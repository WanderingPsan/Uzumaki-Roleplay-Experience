<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I take it we won't be sparring for a while. - Tue Nov 24 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his brow at the question - an inference of someones ability being his assignment of mission? It gave him pause for a moment, but in short time he'd nod his head surely at the question, collecting his thoughts.

"Abraxas' fighting style: It seems quite similar to the one who fought Yumiko in the chunnin exams," Heiwa notes, ignoring the obvious differences involved with their actual techniques. "An in-fighter. His profession is elementalism," he deduces, noticing the obvious flaws in his use of taijutsu. He may be steering towards the path of it in the future, but that's unsure to say. 

"His weaknesses would be his cores primarily. But also some of his general skills towards that. His speed is weaker than Yumikos, and on par with Nori's." his explanations are quick - not needing much further thought for any of them. "His reflexes didn't seem that much more potent either, and his strength left little to stand against those chains. There's also the matter of his forward thinking attitude."

Moving past that, he'd explain the further highlights involved. "It appeared to be a strong jutsu though, showing his ability with the Earth element. If he could make up for his flaws in reach or redirect his focus on Earth away from an attempt at damage dealing and focus it into, instead, protecting he may very well find himself a strong position amongst the vanguard protecting from enemy fire - or water. And where his offense would lack some focus in Raiton or Katon could make up for it."

The final point he would make would be as follows "A lack of jutsu versatility is a major weak point as of now."* - Tue Nov 24 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) heard enough of that mumble to piece together the rest of the details of his statement. <Not just Earth?> It made him consider what he meant, briefly, but he didn't shown much alarm from the knowledge - playing it off as if he'd not even heard it. 

"He also reacted improperly to Yumiko," the child adds on, remembering additions to the statement. "As well as to Nori. An in-fighter does not dash in to combat. They hover around an even position moving in closer until they're near enough for their dash to fully break the distance for an attack. It's a movement similar to the one used by the Taijutsu fighter against Yumiko. Her aim is bad - but closer up she's far more capable. Abraxas ran straight into her comfortable range while limiting his ability to dodge."* - Tue Nov 24 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: More wrong assumptions. - Tue Nov 24 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Sorry to interupt, but I'm not an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not exactly anything. - Tue Nov 24 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I spent too much time in development of. . .well, what you saw. - Tue Nov 24 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I didn't have much time to think past that. - Tue Nov 24 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I don't. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...If you're not an in-fighter why do you fight like one? - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Heiwa. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good job. And he fights that way because he spent more time on his jutsu than his skill.. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He just told you that. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's simply the only technique I've made up to this point in time. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. That's my point. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He spent more time working on an in-fighter jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have no intention of being an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Instead of making a jutsu that is not in-fighter based. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It was simply the easiest to make. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then for now you're an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nah. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then you purposefully lost to Nori and Yumiko by fighting as an in-fighter and holding back. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: On the field you'd be dead. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you'd prefer I treated you as dead, then I'll do so. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: But that would be my issue. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not yours. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. It'd be the village's. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The village that has trained you and prepared you to properly complete missions. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: As far as I am concerned, I am not yet part of this village. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It'd be the issue of the people who hired you. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm on 'probation' - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: The more I hear, the more I want to leave. - Tue Nov 24 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is why I detailed he'd be better off branching out of in-fighting and working on other techniques. - Tue Nov 24 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He is an in-fighter due to his inability to in-fight. He does not want to be an in-fighter, but he is one nonetheless. He can best improve by following his wants and working on ways to be an out-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He's..leaving the village..because he's an in-fighter? - Tue Nov 24 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: More of that personalitty I was mentioning, though. - Tue Nov 24 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: I hope he intends on using a genjutsu to confuse him..Not the chains of absolution.. - Tue Nov 24 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his eyes on the entire transaction between the two, wondering mainly how it was going to end. However, the movement from Liu would gather his attention, even if their closeness wasn't that of the highest caliber. There were only so many explanations for that movement - but all of them meant in some way to subdue the man.

With this mind, he'd take the less lethal choice of it assuming that that would be best in preventing..well being incorrect. Measure twice cut once and all. Very quickly a rotation of seals are made - faster than either Nori's or Yumiko's. He'd bring his hand against the ground following it - and his chakra would enter travelling very quickly towards Kurina. Even with the headstart the man had on him - the chains would reach his position faster than he could run.

<Chains of Absolution.> A technique Kurina was no doubt familiar with by now - the chains were far stronger and more potent than Nori's own. It'd be the easiest way to stop him for now binding him in place. Besides - he didn't like showing people all of his cards. The mystery of combat was more important than anything. Assuming he couldn't dodge or get out of the way - Kurina would likely find himself bound by the same objects as before.* - Tue Nov 24 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope he wasn't intending on me using a genjutsu to confuse him..Not the chains of absolution.. - Tue Nov 24 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) winced on hearing that. It was involuntary - he really wasn't expecting it to go that far. A glance would be taken to the Mizukage as his eyes oepened, seeing the simple and serious look on his face as he gave his verdict. 

"Yes, Mizukage, sir." the child says, his heart not fully in it. He had ended the lives of some few and seen it before, but things were different when you weren't being directly attacked. When you were stopping someone through logic and reasoning - it left you feeling worse coming out. With heavy steps he moved towards Abraxas until he stood just off to the side of him.

A single hand seal was made, his chakra surging out of his body in the motion, and slowly feathers would begin to fall from around the area. The range would be small - covering only a couple of feet. But anyone, aside from Heiwa, would had touched the feathers would fall under its effects. A deep feeling of peace and nirvana falling over them as the dim of sleep fastly set in. 

<This is for the safety of the village..everyone here like family.> The thoughts were truth for how he had begun growing towards this place.* - Tue Nov 24 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . - Tue Nov 24 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) following him passing out, the child steps back and away from Abraxas.* - Tue Nov 24 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) eyed the exchange, ready for what might involve having to deal with her in some aspect. * - Tue Nov 24 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Nov 24 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would only make a movement after a bit of time had passed - long enough for a sudden movement from Kana in response to hearing Liu's orders to be made. Assuming that hadn't happened, however, the child would move forwards towards the man, keeping an eye on Kana.* - Tue Nov 24 10:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Can't keep to his words, eh? - Tue Nov 24 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) presumably made it up to Abraxas, where he'd reach down and lift the man up somewhat. Nigga was still six - even if he was pretty strong for his age. He'd have trouble lifting the entirety of the man's weight - having to drag a good bit of his feet against the ground. Of course - considering Abraxas was able to tank a kunai with minimal damage there was a good shot that this wouldn't really be able to wake him up.

He'd begin moving to the jail, keeping that ever conscious eye on Kana.* - Tue Nov 24 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . . - Tue Nov 24 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: I'll just use him later then. - Tue Nov 24 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gets full clearance to enter in - that nigga didn't even have to display a headband or anything. Being a special jounin at his age..he had respect of the fellows there that was to say the least.

It'd be short order before they helped him and placed him on the bed - being given a brief rundown of what happened. They'd lock him in, and Heiwa would head off leaving giving him however long of a sleep his body would choose to keep him for. The child would be gone by the time he woke up.* - Tue Nov 24 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Note: The man would find a wet spot on the other side of his crotch. You know at what place. ;)* - Tue Nov 24 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) returned covered in blood. 

"Problem solved, sir."* - Tue Nov 24 10:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No need to worry about that now though. - Wed Nov 25 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That's what Nozumi and the rest were warning me about. - Wed Nov 25 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: For the time being, while we train for the next conflict, would you like help with your summoning? - Wed Nov 25 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I suppose..how should I go about working with them? - Wed Nov 25 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I've summoned them multiple times - but mainly for recon. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Well...Summon a small one and give it a message. You also have to talk to it.  - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I, for a long time, gave them scrolls to take back with them. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They'd bring them back written on. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I think it's safe to say there's talking animals somewhere I haven't found one yet. - Wed Nov 25 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aside from Boss Toad... - Wed Nov 25 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: But he's weird in every way.... - Wed Nov 25 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Boss Toad? - Wed Nov 25 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye...Would you like to meet him? - Wed Nov 25 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sure? - Wed Nov 25 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stumbles, his footing weakened as we was lifted several stories up into the air. The entire village could practically be seen from this high up - at least fifteen or so metres being taken by whatever he was standing on.

When he finally caught his footing and the smoke dissipated the child would be able to see just what he was standing on. The flesh of a giant toad! The realization was met quickly with confirmation as Liu calls him by his name 'Boss Toad' explaining why they were summoned. He'd almost lose footing again as the creature began talking.

But that only lasted for a short reprieve. His balance is shot again as the toad rumbles beneath him - and he's quickly pushed downwards pressed against the toad as it leapt into the air. His hands tightly clench around his flesh doing his best to keep himself from falling right off. "WHAT'S IT DOING!?" he yells out, only getting a few brief glimpses of where he was headed towards <The forest..>* - Wed Nov 25 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Given Heiwa's short size and weight he'd likely have ended up flying off of the giant toad when it impacted if Liu hadn't been helping to hold him down. Either way the impact would still hurt - the recoil of the drop near knocking the breath out of him. "Punish..ment?" His question is followed by the sudden disappearance of the boss toad sending them both flying straight to the ground.

<No. No. No no no no.> His eyes widen - the situation growing that much fiercer. He was shocked and stressed well beyond measure, but even still his mind continued to work as fast as it could to find a solution. His hands reach up to his chest and he rotates through a set of strings prepared to try and delay his descent.

But before he finishes he's tossed over like a ragdoll towards Liu with the many clones he made working to retard their fall themselves. * - Wed Nov 25 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) still would feel another jolt from the secondary impact, it causing some short lived pain against his back and lungs. But, indeed, he had been spared most of the damage. "What..was that all about?" he struggles to say, finally having a chance now to catch his breath. 

<That's a relationship with your animal?>* - Wed Nov 25 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nngh. You mean in that they'll try to kill you? - Wed Nov 25 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I..already knew..they could get as big as Ortho's snake. - Wed Nov 25 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No no..Actually...He wouldn't have allowed either of us to die... - Wed Nov 25 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He just likes to....Jolt me when I summon him for no reason. It's apart of our contract... - Wed Nov 25 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I agreed to it. - Wed Nov 25 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ugh.. - Wed Nov 25 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They..never did anything like that to me. - Wed Nov 25 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Well..You don't have a large summon do you? - Wed Nov 25 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not one like that..or Ortho's, no. - Wed Nov 25 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah, well Boss Toad also is  kind of...A dick. - Wed Nov 25 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: There's another giant Frog I summoned but he was really nice and would never do something like that. - Wed Nov 25 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was he like? - Wed Nov 25 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's really nice. He's the one that told me about the ability to summon frogs. He's the first frog I met after signing my contract. - Wed Nov 25 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..My summons have been mainly used for recon. - Wed Nov 25 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Had..a lot of different ones when I started summoning - but then one of them began being the only one that answered the contract. - Wed Nov 25 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah? Hmm...Weird. I have small frogs that are capable of recon. But recently a new type of frog has been appearing...They're..Kinda impulsive. - Wed Nov 25 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Impulsive like what? - Wed Nov 25 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Like..Nori walked up and said hello shortly after I summoned one and it shot her in the chest with a blast of water...Knocked her across the ground and everything..I need to train with them a bit more..Get them listening. - Wed Nov 25 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...It sounds like they're hostile to you or the villagers. - Wed Nov 25 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is she okay? - Wed Nov 25 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah she's fine...It's just a matter of control. It's my fault. The recon frogs don't have that issue. I've mastered my link with them. - Wed Nov 25 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you think I should work on my relationship so they end up like that? - Wed Nov 25 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I'll work on it. Can we go back now? - Wed Nov 25 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 25 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) follows behind that dude. * - Wed Nov 25 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey, Yumiko. - Wed Nov 25 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How is the prisoner? - Wed Nov 25 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Gone. I let him out a while ago. - Wed Nov 25 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Where is he now? - Wed Nov 25 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Konohagakure. - Wed Nov 25 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Wed Nov 25 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hmm... - Wed Nov 25 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: Can they handle him alone? - Wed Nov 25 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Oh. - Wed Nov 25 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Mission time!!! - Wed Nov 25 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What's this one about? - Wed Nov 25 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Rogue hunt of course. - Wed Nov 25 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You guys ready for this one? Your opponent is a swordsman. - Wed Nov 25 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That's about it honestly... - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Swordsman? - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah. Really fast. - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Really strong. - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Honestly I don't know if I should allow you guys to do it. - Wed Nov 25 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It could be worse. - Wed Nov 25 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's by all rights...An S-rank criminal. - Wed Nov 25 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . . . - Wed Nov 25 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..An S rank? - Wed Nov 25 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Betty was a B rank... - Wed Nov 25 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How fast is he? - Wed Nov 25 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Uhm... - Wed Nov 25 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...... - Wed Nov 25 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: .  . . - Wed Nov 25 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Well triple that. - Wed Nov 25 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's about double the speed that's currently in your head. - Wed Nov 25 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt it. My thoughts were on the one who murdered everyone in Kumo. - Wed Nov 25 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He..can't be much faster than that. - Wed Nov 25 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he's that fast wouldn't it be..that sounds like the type of mission that'd need many of the kages to bring him down, sir. - Wed Nov 25 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . .  - Wed Nov 25 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Wed Nov 25 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I'mma feel like an asshole. - Wed Nov 25 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: But don't underestimate him...He's still to be feared... - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's a Taijutsu user... - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Capable of crazy feats in that chair. - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I thought you said he was a swordsman. - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He is. - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's both. - Wed Nov 25 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Just like I'm both a Nintai and a Fuuinjutsu user. - Wed Nov 25 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So avoid close range encounters. - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You'd think it were that simple... - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You won't be able to defeat him from a distance. - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Why not? - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Assassinate him? - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He has a special barrier ninjutsu. - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: It negates pretty much -every- ninjutsu thrown at it. - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: .............. - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tch. Even if we all combined our efforts? - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How can it be that powerful? - Wed Nov 25 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: S. Rank. Criminal. - Wed Nov 25 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Right. - Wed Nov 25 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Now. Y'could just try talking to him. - Wed Nov 25 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He' - Wed Nov 25 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I mean. .He's in a wheelchair. . What's the worse that could happen? - Wed Nov 25 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's the least violent of ou- Of the group. - Wed Nov 25 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Of our? - Wed Nov 25 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brow raised following the mess up, but he wouldn't draw too much attention to it yet. 

"Where is he?"* - Wed Nov 25 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: *shrug* Konoha? Sunagakure? I couldn't honestly tell you...Last I heard he was in the desert near Sunagakure, but with Edge's attack..He may have left. - Wed Nov 25 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Edge attacked Suna? - Wed Nov 25 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye. - Wed Nov 25 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They didn't suffer any losses though. - Wed Nov 25 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: This might take a while. - Wed Nov 25 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Maybe. - Wed Nov 25 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Our only chance is to kill him before he blinks... - Wed Nov 25 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Y'should get going honestly. - Wed Nov 25 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: So hide and strike? - Wed Nov 25 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can you give us a picture of what he looks like? - Wed Nov 25 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: With a name. - Wed Nov 25 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...You want us to kill him, right? - Wed Nov 25 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Kill him. Bring him back to the village. Up to you. - Wed Nov 25 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Doesn't really matter. - Wed Nov 25 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Kill. Latter will be harder. - Wed Nov 25 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he was last seen in Suna that limits the spread at least. - Wed Nov 25 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's not likely he'll be near to Kiri. - Wed Nov 25 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You both ready to head out? - Wed Nov 25 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Indeed. I'd try the desert. - Wed Nov 25 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Head bands off? - Wed Nov 25 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Yes. It's easier to explain things in the case of being found that way. - Wed Nov 25 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I wonder if anyone even noticed the fact that I don't even have a headband. - Wed Nov 25 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Meh. - Wed Nov 25 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hardly wore his headband - if it was ever shown it was most often used as a quick way to prove, within the village, that he was indeed a shinobi. But even that was less required with how much more noticed he'd be now. A six year old made into a special jounin..there'd likely be a good bit of people knowing him by now. Especially any of the soldiers within the Fuuinjutsu or Genjutsu branch.

"We'll head out shortly then," the child says, pulling out a kunai knife from his back pouch. It wouldn't appear to be menacingly held or in any way intending to be threatening. "You have everything you need before we go, Nori?"* - Wed Nov 25 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I have everything as well. - Wed Nov 25 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded in response, the kunai itself moving up to his palm. Carefully he traces against the length of his skin digging into his flesh. An amount of blood exits out, and the child mixes it in and around the entirety of his right hand as if coating his fingers in the stuff. "Suna will be one of the first places we go to," he explains, bringing his hands together fully now to rotate through a set of hand seals.

On the final one he places the coated one against the ground. Seals are crafted - visible for a brief second spreading out from his finger tips before the child himself is shrouded in a plume of smoke. When it scatters there'd be a total of three dragons circling around the length of the child - each of a different color. One white, one black, and one red. They'd each rotate around the entirety of his head - occasionally each one passing by his face.

When they did they'd speak asking their questions to his face before returning back around him. "Why were we called?" the black one speaks, voice far deeper than its size would seem to expect. At most a meter in length it was far smaller in width - appearing far more like some type of flying snake with added tassels and scales at various points of its bodies. The other two would be similar to the first, all asking for their orders in a serious tone - their eyes piercing onto the child with judging eyes.

This wasn't the first time he'd called any of them, so by now he had understood the ritual and patterns they preferred to be spoke in. He even knew one of their names. "Tatsu," he says, when the black one crosses his face. "You're to scout out the deserts of Suna," The red was next, and the child was ready for his orders. "You're to scout out Konoha," and then finally the white one. "You're to scout out  the path to Kumogakure."

They wouldn't stop in the ritual like circling, continuing it throughout the entirety of their stay. "And what are we looking for?" The black one responds with after passing the child's face. Heiwa would turn to look towards Yumiko. "May I have the photo for a moment?"* - Wed Nov 25 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabbed and showed the photo to each of the dragons, waiting until they made a full rotation around to each get a look at his face. "This will be done, summoner," the black responds, and before it leaves Heiwa adds one final detail. "It's in a wheel chair. We'll be in the area south of Konoha for your rendezvous." The red one was about to implicate Liu as the man before that detail was added.

"Very well, summoner." Serious and to the point throughout the entire ordeal - they, or at least the black one, respected the child enough to remain like so. They each broke off - heading out in separate directions of eachother.

"Lets go," Heiwa says, turning towards the exit. "We'll set up a camp south of Konoha if they take too long to return."* - Wed Nov 25 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You there. White hair, go see who's at the gate and return letting me know. - Wed Nov 25 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She has white hair but not a kiri nin. SHE'S A WITCH! - Wed Nov 25 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would quickly get processed and allowed through the gate. However, seeing the bit of commotion over Izanami would cause Heiwa to stop for a bit noticing her. 

<What's she doing here?>* - Wed Nov 25 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I don't recognize him.~ - Wed Nov 25 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Nor the person up top... - Wed Nov 25 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..She's not here because of Edge's attack, is she? - Wed Nov 25 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Why..send someone if he's just going to be coming himself? - Wed Nov 25 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I've never met him here...and he's the Mizukage? Shouldn't you have a bit of influence inside a village before being appointed Kage? - Wed Nov 25 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You related to our little Heiwa here? - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Then again...Kirigakure was under special circumstances I guess.. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Unfortunately. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yes. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) thinks: This is gonna get interesting. - Wed Nov 25 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov 25 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..A clone. Like Mizumi. - Wed Nov 25 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: My family was just attacked, my brother was killed...I want answers or atleast hints as to who did it...I was hoping Heiwa might help me piece together what pieces of the puzzle I have.  - Wed Nov 25 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: So you're just a clone? So my guards failed to check you...Hmm....  - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: May I please just ask him a few questions..? - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You could have sent a letter. I'm sorry but unless you meet them within your village's borders, I cannot allow you to continue to impede them in their mission. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Just leave, wait for us to head out, and follow us. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods* - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: ^ - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I understand. - Wed Nov 25 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: Yumiko snipe that hoe. - Wed Nov 25 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) caught the frog - and then suddenly Liu was gone. <Shunshin? Or..> The child couldn't be sure, but it did leave him wondering to some extent. "Come on, we're heading out," he says, holding the weird frog on his shoulder. It'd feel heavier than on Liu's, but he'd manage his best as the group of three headed out of the village.* - Wed Nov 25 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yaawns* - Wed Nov 25 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || Shortly after the caravan arrives there'd be a return of the one black dragon. It'd follow the ritual flying around Heiwa's head as it spoke. "A man has been found in the desert of Sunagakure. Away from the walls - he is in a wheel chair. He was not moving. May be waiting." It took multiple laps around the child's head to get this information otu, but when it was said Heiwa would nod and thank him before dispersing the jutsu. Not just on Tatsu but on all of the dragons.

"We're going to the deserts of Sunagakure," he says, and quickly he begins walking in that direction.* - Wed Nov 25 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stopped, eyes shifting over to the direction of the sound. The figure of Izanami could be seen, but just barely before she began stepping out of the shadows. His eyes shift over then to Nori and Yumiko, where he'd take the frog off from his shoulders and hand it over to one of the two. 

"I saw a deer out in the woods," he says, blank expression on his face. Nigga had a good poker face with how he normally acted. "Before we go it'd be a good idea to get some food - and the frog is weighing me down. I'll be just a minute."

He really hoped Izanami hadn't been too quick on the draw to allow his lie.* - Wed Nov 25 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had no reason to believe it had failed. The child moves off in the distance - moving at a careful pace as if he was intentionally trying to lower his movement sound. Similar to, if, he was chasing after a deer.

While Heiwa might not have the most survivalist experience, it was one of those things where you knew at least that deers get frightened from loud noise. Eventually, when he felt he was shrouded by the foliage well enough, he'd begin calming down in his movement and look around for Izanami.* - Wed Nov 25 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Hey there. - Wed Nov 25 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his eyes on her the moment she revealed herself once more, the dark onyx stare of the child remaining on her. * - Wed Nov 25 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: So.. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Mm. You're really intent on this meeting. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: What's this about? - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Of course...I need answers to my brothers death. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: What makes you think I'd know anything about that? I don't even know your brother. - Wed Nov 25 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I know, but you do know my father right, if even slightly? - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Fujitora. We met, briefly. - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Briefly, I see.  - Wed Nov 25 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Do you happen to know anyone who wholds resentment toward him? - Wed Nov 25 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: No. I've only visited Sunagakure once. If it was someone there.. - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: (Holds*) - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: It doesn't have to be anyone specifically in sunagakure, anyone at all. - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: No. Your father's name doesn't carry much farther than Sunagakure. If someone holds resentment they haven't mentioned it. - Wed Nov 25 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Unfortunate... - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: It wasn't done in the assault on Suna by Edge, I take it? - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I guess my search continues then.. - Wed Nov 25 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: No, it was done way before... - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: At first I had assumed it was edge...but I'm not so sure anymore.. - Wed Nov 25 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Is that all? - Wed Nov 25 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: More or less..... - Wed Nov 25 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Also....we should keep in contact...we are family afterall.. - Wed Nov 25 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ...I'll send a messenger when I return to Kiri. My team needs to return to the mission. - Wed Nov 25 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: *nods* Don't forget your deer.  - Wed Nov 25 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) let her go.* - Wed Nov 25 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) returned, empty handed. "It..got away. I was..wasting more energy than I would for having gotten it." he lies to the best of his abilities. He had seemed tired at the least. "Lets head out anyways, though! I'm sure we can make it."* - Wed Nov 25 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. We'll travel slow.  - Wed Nov 25 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) drank that milk all along the way to the mission site.* - Wed Nov 25 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) and his gang would traverse along the sandy wasteland just outside of Sunagakure, the one male in the group leading off with the others slightly behind. Of course, they'd all stop on seeing the man they were looking for. Also, on Nori's shoulder would be that froggy.

"Hey, Fengxian, right?" he asks, keeping an eye on him in case he did anything shifty.* - Wed Nov 25 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu Mengde. The name ring any bells? - Wed Nov 25 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brow furrowed somewhat. <This is an S ranked criminal? Or is it a bluff?> He didn't take his eyes off of him, but his guard did lower ever so somewhat. "How do you know him?"* - Wed Nov 25 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Lerixus? - Wed Nov 25 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Betty and Leera are dead. - Wed Nov 25 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: . . .N-no... - Wed Nov 25 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Just be innocent, they said. It would be okay they said. . Hrng. .  - Wed Nov 25 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Dangit mom. - Wed Nov 25 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: . - Wed Nov 25 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back instinctively as his hand raised, preparing again for the worst. The pill would hardly be noticed - and by the time anything would be alerted to Heiwa whatever the pill was would likely have been eaten.* - Wed Nov 25 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Bad move. . . - Wed Nov 25 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced back over towards Nori, before bringing them quickly on the man again. His mouth would open somewhat to speak lowly to her.* - Wed Nov 25 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: You think he's lying? - Wed Nov 25 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov 25 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Well? - Wed Nov 25 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: I think he is. . But I won't do anything if you don't. - Wed Nov 25 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you aren't listening to her. - Wed Nov 25 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Our options are to kill you or bring you back to the village. - Wed Nov 25 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: So time to go with the rest of the plan? - Wed Nov 25 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched carefully as the mist began to encircle around him - a very light amount built for a single purpose: seeing the interaction between chakra and the barrier they were warned about the man having. The presumed possibilities were for it to either be completely unaffected by the technique, or for it to literally bend and warp away from him. 

This time it ended up being the former. It only took him a brief bit of a second to realize this and, then, come to two further conclusions. <Either it's not activated yet or it wouldn't stop the usage..> It at the least gave him this one shot. His hands are brought up to his chest, a rotation of seals beginning before the mist suddenly thickens and his sight is completely robbed. He looks over to where Yumiko and Nori are - only just seeing through primarily from his great sight and also the sheer closeness of each of them.

<We're at a disadvantage here - I can't even see him.> he realizes, disrupting the initial flow of his chakra as the voice booms out from the entire area. Without moving much, he keeps his voice low whispering something off to Yumiko and Nori. As he did so - a slight amount of chakra would begin to exit from his body focusing into the ground itself. But for what purpose?* - Wed Nov 25 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Yumiko, Nori, Shunshin out of the mist. Stick close to eachother - but expansive enough to see out most ends.  - Wed Nov 25 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had just barely made out the blurring figure through the thickness of the mist - the child's own sight remarkable. Yet it'd do nothing to prepare him for the sudden onslaught of attacks. A blade could be seen - but just as it had registered he'd feel his body cut and the man moving to get away - the speed not just of movement but also of fluidity with his weapon.

Try as he might - it'd be exceptionally difficult to keep track of the man through the mist with him disappearing just as he entered. <No way..this speed..> Of course, Heiwa had left a bit of a trap for the man preempting him coming this way - he had just hoped he might be able to dodge the attack or get Yumiko and Nori out when it happened.

Suddenly, appearing as if from the ground three ghastly figures would appear from the mist - each centered around where Liu Fengxian was. Illusory as they were they'd appear remarkably similar to the child especially with the heavy thickness of the mist. The moment they appeared they moved in aiming to overtake the man with their punches.* - Wed Nov 25 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't had much he could do at that point. His genjutsu based phantoms hadn't done much of anything to stop him so pretty much the guy would get away. Presumably his mist would do.* - Wed Nov 25 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Think your animals can track him? - Wed Nov 25 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: They can't move that fast. - Wed Nov 25 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) went and found a caravan to return to Kiri via.* - Wed Nov 25 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) and gang would return back to the village - minor cuts and scratches appearing on their clothing with a small amount of blood also on their skin. Their own blood. 

Heiwa himself would stop infront of the kage, a measure of an annoyed look on his face. "The mission was a failure."* - Wed Nov 25 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you expected our failure why did you send us out? - Wed Nov 25 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I didn't -expect- your failure...But when it took you so long to return, and you had run into that woman agian...I figured you had been killed... - Wed Nov 25 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I'm honestly glad  to see you back in one piece. - Wed Nov 25 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Woman..? - Wed Nov 25 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Well....Small girl is better..But I gave her the benefit of the doubt and figured she was just short. - Wed Nov 25 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: But -- The frog.. - Wed Nov 25 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So then you know how the conversation with him went. - Wed Nov 25 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Since your frog was there too. - Wed Nov 25 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I do. And who do you believe? - Wed Nov 25 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't think he was lying about your past. That much I believe. - Wed Nov 25 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Mhm mhm. What else? - Wed Nov 25 10:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Do you believe me to be the monster he says I am? - Wed Nov 25 10:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is there a reason why you decided to have us hunt them? - Wed Nov 25 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: If you answer my question, then I will be able to answer yours. - Wed Nov 25 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well he seems nice, but you probaby have your reason for wanting him back or dead. - Wed Nov 25 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I saw Leera's actions firsthand. - Wed Nov 25 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then Betty's. - Wed Nov 25 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They attacked without remorse or concern.  - Wed Nov 25 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Nearly killed Yumiko too. - Wed Nov 25 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's his excuse that they were driven this way through the insanity of being chased. However, you didn't hold the power of a kage for years. Or even a position high enough for this. Likely not even the money for this effect. - Wed Nov 25 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The idea of them being driven mad through your endeavors.. - Wed Nov 25 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I believe he's lying. Your group were terrible people and you were a terrible person. - Wed Nov 25 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Were being the keyword. - Wed Nov 25 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Well there's not much that can be done to stop all of them currently. - Wed Nov 25 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye. You've done well..Don't beat yourself up about it...What happened was my fault..I didn't have enough info. I didn't realize that he no longer utilized that annoying barrier. - Wed Nov 25 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He doesn't? - Wed Nov 25 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure it wasn't just inactive? - Wed Nov 25 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: *nods* It cannot become "inactive" in that sense...It's actually nothing he can control. It's sort of an..Automatic thing. - Wed Nov 25 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi,hi. - Wed Nov 25 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Man.. - Thu Nov 26 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Where is the Mizukage when you need him? - Thu Nov 26 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..He's probably on a mission or something - are you sure you should be here, Sado? - Thu Nov 26 01:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why shouldn't I be here? - Thu Nov 26 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your men were banished for breaking the leg of, stabbing, and also cutting the tongue out of a shinobi here. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They weren't my men. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I only have one person to look after and that is Shiro. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The Mizukage knows this. - Thu Nov 26 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So? - Thu Nov 26 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Traveling with someone automatically means that I am responsible for their actions? - Thu Nov 26 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's for you and the kage to discuss then. You can feel free to shirk the responsibility infront of him. - Thu Nov 26 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's not a stupid man, however. - Thu Nov 26 01:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They broke in to places and slaughtered not just military - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But also civilians. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Innocents. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: All because he was mad at Kirie who was already dead. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I should've had control of most of the bandits. Seems I've been slacking off.. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Now, the question is: Are those bandits not the fault of Ortho? - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They followed him. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As Kida and Ichirou followed you. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kida and the other one weren't following me. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They weren't under my name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ortho had an agreement with those bandits most likely. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I posed no such thing with Kida and that other one. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They were simply here to do what they wanted. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Entered the village together. Joked together. Spent most of your time with them. They were allowed passage no doubt under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You may seek for a scapegoat, but you'll find it hard for me to fit that role. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They weren't Shinobi or villagers of this place. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They were allowed here upon the passage of your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Isn't that simply Kirigakure's fault? - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Their lax security allowed two unidentified shinobi to linger.. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said my pet, Shiro was the only one I was looking after. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro has a bodyguard which was the other male. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That bodyguard is not under my protection. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I know him, and we're on friendly terms.. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then it is under the protection of Shiro. Meaning Shiro is to blame. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm not about to take the blame for his problems. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, if Shiro is to blame, and you're to blame for what Shiro does, then that means, transitively, that you're to blame for him. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So what do you plan on doing about it, Heiwa-kun?~ - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What do you expect me to do about it? - Thu Nov 26 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, I'm not that -man's- caretaker. - Thu Nov 26 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Try as you might to blame me for his troubles, but I do doubt that Shiro ordered that man to commit the acts he did. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. You're Shiro's. And Shiro is the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro is not the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He is a bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She is not responsible for what he does off the clock. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he is allowed passage within the village due to the requirement of being her bodyguard - then yes, she is. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let me put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's say if I went on a rampage right now.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Killing anyone I see.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you failed to stop me, is it right to blame you for my acts? - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is a false analogy. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I am not in any way the person that allowed you within the village through our laws. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you into the village ignoring the guards? - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: But you allowed me to murder. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were stronger..you could've stopped me. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you in to the village ignoring our guards - it would be my fault. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...... - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yet..you allowed me to do what I have done. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And just what have you done? - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just as it is out of your power to stop my hypothetical scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh..murder people in that scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The difference is that Heiwa would stop you there. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There wouldn't be any pinning to blame for me. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is truly out of my power to know that those two would harm a random person. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unless you stop me before I take a life.. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is still a loss for you. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Luckily, I am a priest. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The big difference here that you're forgetting - I don't have ties with you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You do. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can be a psychopath just like Ichirou and Kida. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But that doesn't connect us like those two to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unlike them..I don't act without reason. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't cause those two to turn out the way they did. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And, at least one of them, was allowed in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We've already discussed this.  - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one - Ichirou, was it? Or Kida? - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The bodyguard of Shiro - the one you've already taken claim of for the actions of. You've said yourself you agree you'd be at fault if she took the life of others. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're taking agency for her actions. She is an object - you're an agent. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man as her bodyguard is the object of her - she is taking responsibility for whatever remaining agency he may have. This is because he went in under her name. And she went in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Following the chain - it falls back to you. You're the one with the ultimate agency of the entire web. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If a general were to bring his men - a lieutenant held a recruit under him and the lieutenant under the general. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If the recruit went crazy and murdered civilians would it not be the fault of the general who brought his men? - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Much like a village or a kage is blamed for the actions of its shinobis. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The chain of command goes all the way up to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She made a deal with that man that he would protect her. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The was nothing stated about taking the blame for the people he randomly kills. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And from this deal he was allowed passage. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And from this passage he went crazy and harmed a civilian. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We made that deal inside this village. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He traveled on his own, and somehow gained entry. - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if this was traced back to me... - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What does this do to me? - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We both know in the end that my hands are clean. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Wearing gloves to keep your hands clean of a crime doesn't wipe away any of the guilt. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I have no guilt, for I did nothing wrong. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is for the kage and you to discuss. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no need for me to prove my claims. The truth is just that. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd gain nothing from lying. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even you know that. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'd keep passage within the village. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Judging by the fact that the Mizukage didn't kill those two on the spot.. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you hardly gained anything by lying and saying you were intending to kill me. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He didn't care for the man that was injured. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Actually..it was an attempt to save your life. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you wouldn't be to blame for hurting me. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right? Like you said just earlier. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd also like to see who you'll truly resemble in ideals.. - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe you'll potentially gain the power to order me around?~ - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'd be different. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you're dead before I can see that, then it'd be boring. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is a win-win for me helping you stay alive when I can. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if you think I'm a creep. I do honor friendship. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, most friendships are false. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I'll talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no need. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I said..I've already spoken with them. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And? - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is also why I am here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He'd like to speak with me. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You talked to him and he said he'd like to talk to you? - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, messages are quite slow. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is faster to get anything else across in person. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It isn't as if I am on the run.. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's not really the same as speaking to him. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We spoke as in he told me what happened to some extent. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I told him that they weren't under my care, and that I had no idea as to the antics that they have been up to. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I can't be responsible for every person that is injured in this world. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Those under you you are responsible for. - Thu Nov 26 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only one -under- me is "Shiro". - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anyone that decides to associate themselves with her aren't under my watch, or her 's. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If I have to decide on saving Kida, Ichiro, or Shiro.. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You know who I'm going to pick. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The matter of agreement with her is the difference. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man had an agreement to be her bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's of similar clout to a shinobi swearing under a kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, and the agreement of the bodyguard is to protect the person. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This doesn't fall under that. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I doubt this man was even a threat to Shiro if she was on the scene. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: His entrance would be guaranteed by Shiro's own entrance. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meaning whatever he does that is not intended to protect her..isn't my, or her problem. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which, in itself, is guaranteed by your own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The deal was made here. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He entered on his own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do wonder what I'd be sentenced.. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were the Mizukage, you'd most likely lock me up for several years. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Like I said I'd talk to the kage myself just in case he's..feeling dumb. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd banish Kida and Ichirou. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Prevent their entry even with your passage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They'd be unable to enter. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That doesn't bother me. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which is why I said I'd talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Psh..you're so nice to me. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I feel as if you really do care for me! - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The main reason they're even being punished is because they tortured him. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You still let Ortho go. - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I let Ortho go..because I was more concerned about him not killing you. - Thu Nov 26 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sometimes you have to make choices. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Infact, you should be thanking me. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I know deep down inside, you are. - Thu Nov 26 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadness.. - Thu Nov 26 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you going to be remaining in the village to wait for the Kage? - Thu Nov 26 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yep. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Who knows.. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I may even join the village. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: *sigh* Yumiko, how are your missions going? - Thu Nov 26 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Stressful...still thinking of the last one. - Thu Nov 26 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: None. - Thu Nov 26 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Such sadness. - Thu Nov 26 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's probably busy. - Thu Nov 26 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Here. - Thu Nov 26 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) handed her a stack of yen.

"Get what you want. I'll have some miso soup."* - Thu Nov 26 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I noticed that you did.. - Thu Nov 26 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I was somewhat wondering why, but he was indeed in the wheelchair. - Thu Nov 26 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He got away, however. - Thu Nov 26 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Combination of mist..and fast movement.  - Thu Nov 26 08:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Barely even trackable while attacking. - Thu Nov 26 08:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 26 08:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Apparently he no longer uses it. - Thu Nov 26 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I had known that..things may have been easier.' - Thu Nov 26 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ugh. . . I mean. .In a way. .Wouldn't it have been notable if Yumiko was able to get so close to him? - Thu Nov 26 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It was stated to work only against Ninjutsu.. - Thu Nov 26 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And it was implied only against elemental sorts. - Thu Nov 26 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Damn Heiwa, fucking so hard you knocked the Ramen into the floor? - Thu Nov 26 09:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: The mask guy? - Fri Nov 27 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, the one pestering us. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Nigen. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nigen... - Fri Nov 27 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, thanks. - Fri Nov 27 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey, Nori. You seen the kage around? - Fri Nov 27 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Nope.  - Fri Nov 27 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Would any of you happen to know any basic Katon techniques? - Fri Nov 27 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm a medic. Heiwa? Know any? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I know some..Can't say I'm that skilled with the element though. - Fri Nov 27 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah, it's fone then. - Fri Nov 27 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm gonna train my techniques for a bit. . Wanna come along, Heiwa? - Fri Nov 27 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sure. - Fri Nov 27 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) counted through the handseals that she was making. "It's good. Why?"* - Fri Nov 27 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's head rasied and fell in way of a nod. The child stepped forward, feet just barely inching off the boundary of the water infront of him, dark onyx eyes scanning across the shifting pool around them. 

For a child, Heiwa had a lot of tricks up his sleeves as well as a rather strong and focused core - much of his could be also be expressed in through his sight. Capable of seeing far quicker and more exact than most - he'd be able to see the slight indicators of the fish as he stared into the pond, and in turn his hand would be raised up pointing at it.

Nothing else would be said as he continued doing his best to track it. No words would be stated so as to not fear it away.* - Fri Nov 27 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watches carefully, the faint outline of the chains appearing upwards and moving to wrap around the fish. At least that's what it initially appeared like. In actuality she was a metre off the mark - the fish easily escaping the chains that simply weren't fully targetting it. 

When it got spooked and swam away, Heiwa would turn his head back to Nori and shake it in response.* - Fri Nov 27 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, eyes once more scanning around the area looking for another fish. It'd take a bit of time considering they'd just recently been spooked away, but given enough they'd be right back in for Heiwa to spot. Again, without saying a word, he'd point out in the given direction hoping for her to see it.* - Fri Nov 27 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm thinking about going hunting. - Fri Nov 27 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: What are they staring off into the distance for? - Fri Nov 27 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his eyes on the water, carefully following the shadow of the fish. The chains erupt - and once more just barely nip at the sides missing in the full area of the act.
