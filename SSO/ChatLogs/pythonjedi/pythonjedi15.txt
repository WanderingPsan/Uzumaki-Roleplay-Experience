<br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And wait for it to be over. - Thu Nov  5 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He also sent another note. All it says in big bold letters is: Deez Nuts. - Thu Nov  5 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Thu Nov  5 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I've been practicing a bit while you slept. - Thu Nov  5 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Decided to work on creating weak water jutsu without a source. - Thu Nov  5 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As in your mouth instead of all around you? - Thu Nov  5 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: All around you as in the source. - Thu Nov  5 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Although I don't want to try that with stronger techniques yet until I'm use to it. - Thu Nov  5 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Still working on Kenjutsu? - Thu Nov  5 13:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not as often as my suiton ninjutsu. - Thu Nov  5 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up for a spar then? - Thu Nov  5 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) responded with a nod, the young child reaching down to pick himself up. Before he did any other action his eyes would glance across the small confines of the room and gather close to a decision. "Shall we do this outside?" he asks, taking note of how dark the area was at this time of day. "We might not be seen."* - Thu Nov  5 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed after her. (grab pl0x)* - Thu Nov  5 13:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Here is good don't you think? - Thu Nov  5 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It should be. We're in a mostly abandoned district. - Thu Nov  5 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) made no objection to the idea, fully embracing the difficulty that would be shown to the child. "Good. I want to see how it works," Heiwa was a very astute learner, evidenced from how far he has come in the last few months, and the chance of getting to see this all play together had him more than curious. Part of Heiwa sincerely enjoyed picking together all of the ways to outplay an opponent.

As the mist began to form around her it'd reach out to as well touch where he was, much of the district becoming enveloped in a potent foggy mist. Sight was still possible, but from the farther distances items and objects began to blend - it wasn't the full effect of the technique that he knew and experienced the mayhem through, but it was rather strong nonetheless. If anything he grew some appreciation for how strong Suitengu and Seisuke must have been to fight through such a thing.

When the mist had fully seemed to have settled down in its area, Heiwa would reach back to pull out the wooden boken that he held strapped around his back. It'd be still an awkward part to control, both hands gripped tightly around the hilt with the sword pointing off from his solar plexus. How much of that could be seen by Yumiko he was unsure, but he himself could see quite an amount of her characteristics - bits and pieces of her stance and body that were far more visible putting together the rest of the image that was blurry.

"Alright. Here I come!" The child yells out, making sure she was ready as he made his movements towards her. His speed would be near the average for a genin, and relatively faster than would be expected for a child his own age. Of course, it was quite likely that Yumiko possessed such speed as well making the worth of that fall rather flat. Either way, Heiwa would not make his way to her just yet.* - Thu Nov  5 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps hadn't carried much weight behind them, more difficulty being had due to the relative small stature of a child like him. However, with the mist not fully dense enough to block vision it'd become easily visible to the both of them where each of their opponents were as they entered into close range. Heiwa's eyes kept careful note of her as they both approached, his speed slowing down considerably until they were both close enough for a strike. 

<What is she going to do..> Heiwa watched her carefully, paying note of the relatively sloppy movement of the sword itself. Like him she was inexperienced in fighting this way, and Heiwa would move to abuse it. The speed he had been using previously was not his full one, and standing up on the tips of his toes he'd quickly switch out into using it. As one step is taken the other is quickly behind it, his reactionary speed and general nimble-ness of step aiding him in taking a quick step in and to the side of the slash, briefly brushing against Yumiko as he did.

His own use of kendo and kenjutsu itself was equally weak, but even with sloppy wide attacks if one was behind the opponent it'd hold far harder dodging potential. As he made it to her side he would swing his sword horizontally - drawing a very wide arc. It'd seem to hit nothing, but keeping still on his toes the child makes another step - this time away from Yumiko while at the same time turning his body. It'd bring the weight of the sword crashing down against her back in a very fluid type of counter. 

Of course, if her own reflexes were strong or she was able to keep a valid enough eye on him this wouldn't quite work, but Heiwa was relatively high skilled as a combattant. The strength of the attack would also surprisingly hit hard - despite, again, Heiwa's own weaker strength. * - Thu Nov  5 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) did not follow her up in that attack - the driving force of using it forcing him to take a few steps back himself in order to catch his footing once more. It'd be different if he had experience with Kenjutsu, but here the weight of the sword was still throwing him well off balance. When he recovered she'd get off her thickening of the mist turning the entire area around them from a thin veil to a full blanket. 

Quickly even seeing her was growing impossible - only the very faintest glimpse, even with their close proximity, being seen once she'd made a movement. <How..am I even supposed to fight in this..> The question hit him immediately as a far greater appreciation of Seisuke and Suitengu again brought itself up. "Hey! Can you see anything?" he asks, ready to end this spar at this point. If they both couldn't see that was a standstill.* - Thu Nov  5 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not at all. - Thu Nov  5 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then I can't attack you and you can't attack me. Draw? - Thu Nov  5 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) exhaled loudly, and lowered his bokken, his body reverting back to normal with his feet against the ground. That brought about a whole new list of problems. It was a scary jutsu. * - Thu Nov  5 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced at the door as the familiar sound of something landing within the mailbox rang through the house. Without saying another word he went outside, got the mail, and went back inside. He expected it to be a message from Fujitora..but..his eyes furrowed more and more as he read the message. * - Thu Nov  5 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Who is this person...? - Thu Nov  5 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I think I met her in Konoha once. - Thu Nov  5 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And she was in Kiri a week before the disaster happened. - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Threat? - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I don't think so. - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The blood in the note..concerns me. - Thu Nov  5 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah... - Thu Nov  5 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seems she followed to Konoha though. - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And there is a tournament here.. - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can we trust her? - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If anything I think she'd do more harm to herself than to any of us. - Thu Nov  5 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...She spent a few hours standing in pose pretending to be a statue. - Thu Nov  5 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: So she's one of those types. - Thu Nov  5 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You want to go find her? - Thu Nov  5 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe. - Thu Nov  5 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well, if I can't leave, that'd leave it up to you to find her. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a bit older than us, but not an adult. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Red hair. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...If the personality doesn't tip you off that should. - Thu Nov  5 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Fri Nov  6 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Sleep well? - Fri Nov  6 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You? - Fri Nov  6 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm.. - Fri Nov  6 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It was...fine.  - Fri Nov  6 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You up for another spar soon? Once you wake up. - Fri Nov  6 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Then I'll go find that girl. - Fri Nov  6 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll be outside. When you've woken up come outside. - Fri Nov  6 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) picks himself up and heads out of the house.* - Fri Nov  6 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The needed sleep was great. - Fri Nov  6 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You awake enough? - Fri Nov  6 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, pulling his hand up to rest on the wooden hilt strapped behind him. "You ready then?" he asks, taking a few steps away for the both of them to have proper room.* - Fri Nov  6 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) unveiled his own bokken, pulling it up from over back and holding it diagonally infront of his stomach. His stance hadn't shifted too terribly, both hands still yet remaining on the hilt to keep it steady - an occasional minor shift of his weapon appearing as he tries to accomodate the weight. Heiwa wasn't the strongest child, and the likes of a weapon at his age was still somewhat hard to keep up and steady. At the very least it ended up draining a fair bit from him as far as stamina went to keep up with how others, like Yumiko, fared.

"Alright," Heiwa says, finally keeping the weapon steady enough for one second for his own use - feeling confident in his ability to keep it like that for a while. "Here I come!" Both eyes focus on Yumiko as he says that, his feet picking up speed as he made his way over to her. Again, his speed would be like that of the average genin - the child perhaps holding back in his own movements as it was quite clearly not as fast as the time he brought that counter out on her.

Either way, however, it'd be enough to make it towards Yumiko where his pace slowed down to a stop and his sword began to make a dip. It'd bend alongside his arms as he twists it downwards and cuts forward in a horizontal slash aiming the blunt weapon to connect around Yumiko's side. "Hah!"* - Fri Nov  6 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt once more the impact of his weapon hitting against her body. <She didn't try to nullify it..> It was the first thought in his mind. Not even a movement was made to deal with his attack. Yumiko was intentionally trying for another trade. Heiwa's features harden as he realizes the situation he was in, and quickly attempted to get out of the way. His arm pulls back and one of his feet is raised for a small, fast step backwards. Meanwhile his eyes scanned across at every part of her body.

However, it was simply too late. As his arm pulls back it meets resistance in the way of her own arm preventing his right from leaving the area. After the initial tug she wouldn't feel another bit of resistance - Heiwa himself knowing very clearly that he wouldn't be able to overpower her. There wasn't much he could do but try and nullify her own follow up. The moment it becomes clear what her next move was going to be, it becoming clearer the closer it became, Heiwa's free arm moves out to intercept it along its path.

But it wasn't moving to intercept Yumiko's weapon - instead it was following close to what Yumiko's own action was. The child moves in closer to her, his free arm raising up to connect and grab onto the lone attacking arm from her. While it was a power attack the power of it would be focused in the weapon that was being used with the arm itself holding little damage potential along the way. It'd be a very tight action which would only be possible in the attempt due to his heightened reflexes.

If it had succeeded her attack would likely be stopped in its track before she had been able to unleash it. However, Heiwa would remain only a tight few inches away from the girl with both of his hands remaining tied up in a near grapple.* - Fri Nov  6 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his focus on pushing her arm away, it being a relatively difficult thing for the young child to do. Growing up he simply wasn't the strongest kid, and that was only being emphasized even further in his adolescence. That's why it came as a general shock when the slight pull of her arm was felt and the impact of her right leg came crashing into his side. It forced the breath straight out of him, and following it his arm immediately left from holding her back.

Which would bring the following follow up attack from her - likely not holding the pure striking power that it had before with the twist of her foot, but still carrying enough to send Heiwa to the ground after the combination had landed. * - Fri Nov  6 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't immediately meet Yumiko's hand with his own, the child remaining on the ground for some time to catch his breath. There'd be the faintest bit of tears in his eyes that he dare not shed, the understanding of not doing so as a shinobi well ingrained in his mind already. Ushinawa taught much not just through words but also through example. 

It was only after an extended period of time, if she kept her hand out, that the child would eventually reach up and use her to help pick himself up, his breath still remaining harsh nonetheless. <I can't...allow that anymore.> Again he went in too hard and got punished for it.* - Fri Nov  6 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: Perfect specimen.. I need these lolis for my harem. - Fri Nov  6 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) rests on her until she took a seat in which case he'd do the same leaning up against the fence.* - Fri Nov  6 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Feeling alright? - Fri Nov  6 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's breathing began to slow down, and he'd give a nod in reply. "I'm..okay."* - Fri Nov  6 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Eh..I'm the one who got hit. - Fri Nov  6 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's not your fault. - Fri Nov  6 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tsk. I'm far..from what I need to be. - Fri Nov  6 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reaches down, pulling himself up again and turning to face the house. "Go find Nori." he says, resting against the entrance to the house. It was clear he was still hurting. "I'll wait inside."* - Fri Nov  6 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) made his way into the flower shop, another order of roses needed to be picked up by the young child. From the note and the arrangement he could tell that it was likely from the very same man that he had delivered for a few days prior. And even was for the same woman. It seemed as if the man was harrassing the girl who simply didn't like him. 

However, Heiwa was being paid to deliver the flowers, and he didn't really care too much about their feud. There'd be a slight flash of his headband given to the girl behind the counter, alongside the note of delivery, and without much further complication he was given the roses and a strap to carry them along his back. 

<That makes one down,> Heiwa thought to himself, as he began making his way to his next stop - that of the post office. Two delivery missions in one day would make things relatively easy for the young child, as he wouldn't hardly have to do much work beyond picking them up and making the summon for another creature to deliver in his stead.

Following the same methods as the last time, the child gathers the scroll and a proper tying item, before finally bringing out a small, blackened edge of a kunai and bringing it to bare against his skin. His palm would lightly begin to shine crimson as he rubbed the liquid all around his digits, staining them with his body.

<Dragon's Requiem.> He runs through a series of five hand seals, interlocked rotations spurring his chakra outwards before finally slamming his palm down against the pavement. A plume of white smoke covers over him, before finally a black dragon spins up. No doubt it had seen the roses strapped around Heiwa, but even still it asked "Why have you summoned me?"

Its tone was not angered - just serious and wanting to get it done. "I need you to deliver this letter, and these flowers." The child states, and with the dragon's consent he begins to strap them around in areas where he could easily rip them off when he arrived at the places. Shortly thereafter the dragon left, and the child was free to work on the final mission.

Child steps made their way to the back to the flower shop, where the young Heiwa waited for the next couple of minutes. Eventually he found the familiar outline of the old lady making her way up the hill, which Heiwa moved forwards to help her with. He genuinely ended up enjoying parts of the last time he was with her.

She was a sweet little old lady, and she graciously thanked him for his aid, patting him on the shoulder as she did so. There'd be a small smirk finding its way past his face as he interlocked arms with her and they both entered into the floral shop. Like last time she kept things nice, and called for his help only when it was needed.

Things like grabbing some of the heavier items she was well aware that Heiwa couldn't do, so she asked for one of the assistants at the shop to help with it. Heiwa was if anything just there for company with the old lady, and she used this time to disclose further stories about the times of her youth.

In very short time at all, Heiwa and her and found themselves with all of the items they could carry, again enough for her alone to take if she needed to, and in turn she paid the lady behind the counter. Little to no fuss or problems were made in the entire situation with the mission being completed in near no time at all.

As they exitted he'd give his share back to the lady, and they'd disentangle their arms to allow both to leave. It was a short visit, but generally enjoyable for the both of them, and as Heiwa left he'd match with a calm wave of his own to her as she left.* - Fri Nov  6 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) leaned himself against the wall of the local hardware store, eye remaining on the road. The sun had just earlier made its way above the horizon, when the faint outline of a small, old lady made its shape against the backdrop. Just a few minutes after the doors opened and she was here, near directly on time. It brought a smirk across the young Heiwa's face seeing her again. This would be the fourth time in only a few months that he'd been helping her with shopping, and he was already getting well adjusted to her. Indeed, she even requested him by name to be the one to help her.

Flashing a smile as they met, her arm would reach out into an awaiting hook. "You didn't have to get here before me, dear." With his parents gone, it had been nice to have just some of this woman's attention for the short bit of time it was. Heiwa liked her. "It wasn't a problem," he replies back, bringing his own arm out into a hook and interlocking it against her arm. With a move of his free hand he'd motion over to the door. "Shall we?" She nodded, and together they both stepped closer, Heiwa opened the door, and she stepped through it first with Heiwa trailing second.

Compared to the previous shops they had visited, this one was relatively larger than each, and much of the work would actually require Heiwa's aid in the efforts. Carrying many of the supplies simply was too much for the little old lady, and so it was reflected back onto Heiwa. Of course, his size had hindered his ability to comfortably carry much of this, however, Heiwa's training had managed much for his relative carrying ability. From weeks before, Heiwa was now able to carry quite a bit of weight on his hands, and would follow behind the lady without making much of a bother of himself over all of this.

Sensing Heiwa's discomfort, the woman didn't speak much, allowing him to focus instead on holding the items instead of having to pay attention to her. The work he was doing was enough for her. In due time the work would be finished though, much of the materials being in the area that they started in, and it'd all get purchased rather quickly before being subjected back onto Heiwa's back. 

Due to this change, though, Heiwa hadn't simply left after the shopping had finished. With her inability to fully carry all of the stuff, Heiwa was made to carry his own, larger, share of the hardware items all the way back to her place. A couple miles away from the hardware store, it ended up leaving the child winded from the effort, but even still he kept himself going until they had finally made it the entire way back to her home. Gently, but quickly, Heiwa dropped all of the supplies and took a step back, recovering his breath. "Thank you dearie," the lady responded to him, and gave him a soft hug.

She went back inside afterwards, carrying most of the purchased items with her. Nodding, he'd think to himself <First mission done,> before turning back to the horizon, a smirk on his face from the job well done. Her house wasn't terribly far from the post office, so he made that his second stop along the way. Over the last month he'd been doing missions daily, and so he was quickly recognized amongst the employees there. With a flash of the paper he showed what he was here to pick up, and they handed the item off without any form of complication. Heiwa thanked the people, and left outside.

By the time he had made it out there, his hand was already pulling out the sharpened edge of a kunai, twirling it about in his hand for a moment before finally bringing it against the palm of his right hand. A small leak of blood began to pour out from him, spreading across his digits with an increasing motion of his fingers digging and spreading into the liquid. In a short amount of time his hand was stained in his fluids, and the child would bring his hands together interlocked infront of his chest. 

A series of hand seals were made, his chakra spreading out from his body with every motion made. <Summoning Technique: Dragon's Requiem.> The name of the technique passes by his mind as he finishes, and finally slams his hand against the pavement with a surge of chakra. A plume of smoke escapes him, and a small, black dragon begins circling around his body, its tail lightly gracing across his body as it rotated all the way up to the child's face. "Why have you called of me, summoner?" it asks as it passes by his face, circling across the area of his head. 

"Another letter delivery," he explains, briefly raising his hand up to show him. It would listen as he stated this, agreeing with his proposal quickly. "Very well, summoner." Often Heiwa asked for the help of this dragon, who he still hadn't even asked the name of, when he was doing his missions. While not the most glorious of missions, never once did he hear any form of anger or complication over the work. The dragon slowed down in its rotation, giving Heiwa enough room to strap the letter around him tightly so he could still manage to fly about. Of course, it also was kept in such  way for him to wiggle out once he'd made it to the mission site. Without a single word past that, the dragon glides up into the sky to its destination.

<And that makes two.> Most of his missions were completed, but there was still another one left for him. Detailed as a C rank mission, it was ultimately a bit of nice reminder of the work that he'd done. To be given one like this meant some level of being recognized by the kage. It put a smirk on his face. Without a second thought he turned to his next destination, and began making the final trek of his journey to complete the missions he'd been given.

Heiwa stops infront of the Kirigakure academy, the backdrop of the sun hanging overhead. Normally it'd be time for school, but today was a day off for most at the academy. Including the teachers. Except for one person that is. The student he was made to go and help - Gekkido. The child made his way past the steps, entering the academy doors and glancing around. It was a big place, so it'd take a while to find the area, but at least he knew where it'd be. 

<The Taijutsu gymnasium,> Heiwa read it silently to himself as he found the spot, and opened it up to peer through. He'd find a rather portly young kid, maybe ten or eleven, sitting against the wall writing something on a piece of paper. Initially he'd pay Heiwa no mind, until he saw the child continuing to stare at him. It was at this point that it clicked in for the kid. "They sent a runt like you to teach me taijutsu?" The older kid asked incredulously, more insulted at the gesture than anything.

There'd be a nod given from Heiwa as he stepped closer to the far larger child than him. Teaching wasn't his strongest point, especially not in something like Taijutsu, but he was going to do his best. However, that didn't seem to be the most immediate thing that Gekkido had wanted for Heiwa to do. Giving a quick shake of his head, he brings himself up showing just how much farther he stood over Heiwa. At five feet tall he dwarfed the young child in comparison.

"Nah. I'm done here," he says, picking up the rest of his materials. "This is stupid." He wasn't going with the program. Heiwa's brow narrowed as he saw this, well aware that if he just left the child leave immediately that he wouldn't get any credit for the mission. Stepping into the brute of a kid's way he firmly shakes his head. "You can't go. You need to improve your taijutsu." With a roll of his eyes the kid stepped even closer, staring down at the child. "And just who is going to stop me? I bet you can't even beat me."

Heiwa took a step back, creating space from Gekkido which immediately he abused by stepping even closer and pushing Heiwa away. "Come on then! How about a fight, right now?" The larger child flashed a toothy smile, his intent beginning to shine through. If he beat a genin at Taijutsu it'd be clear that he was, indeed, unneeding of training. Heiwa gave him an easy out. Again the child took a step back, and finally Gekkido took that as proof it wouldn't happen. "I knew you were a coward," he says, and steps past Heiwa to exit the gymnasium.

Before he had made it out though, Heiwa finally responded back his voice echoing in the silence of the interior "I'll fight you," he says, nodding his head. "A spar in taijutsu - I'll do it." The smile returned to the older kid's face. "Good. We'll start in the middle," He made a motion to the center of the room where two circles were made - a couple meters apart giving room for charging or setting up a defense without starting directly next to somebody. These two circles were within one larger circle, which the child explained was an automatic disqualification if you had exitted from it.

All of the Taijutsu spars that Heiwa had done in the past hadn't worked out for him. To say the least his confidence was shaken in his ability to immediately work on that, and to make matters worse the child, even if he was just an academy student, did easily lumber above him. It'd be likely it if he got hit. All of this was quickly pieced together in his mind, with the full and final conclusion being clear and obvious to him - he couldn't allow himself to get hit.

An obvious thing to a fight it meant more to Heiwa than most others. Getting hit was a bad thing for most, but it was all over if Heiwa managed to be knocked down. This was something he knew very well, and part of it really was beginning to remain in his brain for how to bring it all together. With their hands raised, they made the seal of confrontation between eachother, and the fight started just like that. Gekkido takes the initiative and charges towards Heiwa in a poor and obvious stance.

His feet would be held without form or style, heavy flat footed steps being taken as he inched closer to the child. In addition his hands remained raised and outwards half way. His attempt at combat fit his body type rather well - a wide portly figure he was focusing on heavy handed attacks while using his initial broader reach of range against his opponent. However, again, his skill was simply just very poor. When he'd made it to Heiwa his right arm raises and is thrown out in a very wide, broad hook.

In contrast to the far larger child, Heiwa was small and short. His arms didn't carry much muscle at all, and his legs even seemed as if they were weak and undeveloped - untoned. It was obvious why he was taken as not being a threat. But Heiwa had training from his father and measurably a good bit of other people, and with that added with his very quick learning abilities, the short child had considerably more under his belt than the larger boy.

Bringing his hands up he holds them tight infront of his chest, his legs spreading out slightly to give him some more room. But also to allow something he had been working on for some time. Following against the example of how he normally had fought, how the other child had fought, and how most of the people he watched had fought, he kept himself raised up on his toes, gaining slightly more height than he normally had had, but also gaining something else from the maneuver. 

Remaining on his toes his feet had less surface tension, and required far less for him to quickly slide out from the area. Over the last month he'd been piecing together the ideas of this, and it was finally his first show and attempt. It was hardly perfected - but he had to do it if he was even going to try and win against this kid. He simply could not allow himself to be hit.

The wide angled attack comes in - the speed low but the range as high as it could be. His arms were large and his hooks were powerful. Most of the other kids likely could block them with their forearm, even Heiwa having the quick thought to do so, but they simply were far stronger than the kid. He couldn't let himself get hit in any way even in a block. <I have to move!> 

Taking a quick step inwards and to the side, the child moves to sidestep the attack with surprising agility and reflexes, quickly moving out of the way in a far more deft of a way than the child thought was possible, and then suddenly snapping his fist out the the kid before his fist had even made it to where Heiwa had previously been. It'd hit somewhat hard against his chest, unable to reach somewhere soft like his face, before Heiwa continued to move on with his assault.

By the time the kid had finished and failed with his first attack, Heiwa had already tip-toed behind the larger kid and sent off a flurry of weak, but precise blows against various parts of his stomach and side. Turning quickly, Gekkido brought his arm arcing out in a wide whirlwind type of attack, bringing his forearm against anything in the area with the momentum of his spin driving him forward and harder. 

But it didn't catch Heiwa up. The kid's reach was long, but his arms were still higher than it would be if someone Heiwa's height did such an attack. With relative ease, Heiwa bends downwards and reaches for the kid's strong legs, forcibly pushing at them with both arms at different levels. One behind the leg near the heel, and the other above the knee around the calf. With his position already compromised by the wide angle of his attack, this would leave him quickly ending up falling backwards to the ground.

<It's over.> The kid lands hard, not having even realized what had happened before he hit, and following the impact some tears would come to his eyes as he rubbed the spot. Not wanting to seem weak, he wiped away the tears and pulled himself up with Heiwa's help, some newfound respect being gained for the child from that action. There wouldn't be much conversation from the two after that point, both of them making the seal of reconcilation without a word, before Heiwa began to go into his teaching methods.

It'd go on for a long time with various drills of endurance and tightening of punches being shown, the child not making immediate improvement in the afternoon on anything but his character. A kid far smaller and younger than him beat him rather easily in a spar. It was a wake up call for him needing work. They'd leave, still, without much of a word being said and Heiwa would finally mark this off as a completion of all of his missions. * - Fri Nov  6 19:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded briefly, his attention shifting away from her shortly thereafter. It'd fall on the kitchen sink over to the side, where the young child would walk over to stopping just infront of it. Part of him was primarily going to do this just to make sure it remained fresh in his mind - even though Suiton really wasn't something he was that skilled in.

He brings his hand up to his chest, interlocking them in a single seal. <Water Style: Raging Waves.> The thought of the technique passed by his mind as he began to rotate through a set of three hand seals, his speed an acceptable mix for a standard shinobi, nothing amazing just enough to get it done. As he did so his chakra would begin expanding around him at a very quick pace, the change to suiton based chakra happening just at the end when the third and final symbol was crafted. 

Disentangling his right hand from the mass he brings said hand up to his mouth creating a circle out of index and thumb through which to spit from. The water was relatively thick, but didn't carry much force released from it, a surprisingly somewhat weak usage of the technique altogether that simply didn't do his potent chakra justice. It'd be kept up for some time, before he had filled up the sink faster than it could drain and he took a step back letting it all sink back down. 

It left him drained. Part of him liked that. <Lyala..> the thought of this jutsu reminded him of her - much like his summoning jutsu reminded him of his parents, or his fireball jutsu of Hideki. Heiwa had sentimental value to the techniques he was taught. * - Fri Nov  6 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his attention back to Yumiko. His eyes wouldn't shift too far off of her as he went over to a pillow and sat upon it. 

"What're your plans?" He'd not really thought to ask her that in all this time. * - Fri Nov  6 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) surprisingly found just the person he was looking for amongst the first people he ran into. Stopping just infront of her he'd keep his eye on her, making sure she wasn't doing anything..Nori-like before speaking. "Hey - you sent me this message?" 

Of course if she was doing some weird af shit he'd prob not say that at all.* - Fri Nov  6 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Being unable to save someone can happen. That's not immoral. - Sat Nov  7 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Allowing them to die for nothing is. - Sat Nov  7 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: What they died for is the village and their kage. - Sat Nov  7 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Who left them. - Sat Nov  7 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: The kage ran with her tail between her legs. - Sat Nov  7 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Not a single word of retreat or anything. - Sat Nov  7 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: If you intend to kill me that's fine. - Sat Nov  7 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Talking to me? - Sat Nov  7 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But let me show you just how much distance - No. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: The boy. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: With his threats. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not killing you. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: He didn't threaten you....... - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's way too much work. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Then what did you mean? - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'd rather take a nap. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: He answered your question. - Sat Nov  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It was a statement my dad say. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He means that by talking this way to everyone. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Someone is going to bury you. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: One day. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't have to be today or tommorow. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: *Chuckles* I understand if your father told you that saying.. But which is one is going to bury me..? It certainly wont be any of you. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: . . . .  - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Your stupid. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hm, and you're a coward. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Violence from an argument. I'd expect that from Kojiro..guess he really is from Kumo. - Sat Nov  7 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Let's not fight. - Sat Nov  7 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) ain't doing anything to contribute to this shit. Don't close your bubbles.* - Sat Nov  7 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) tentatively stepped back, keeping a careful eye and check of the situation. Heiwa wasn't outright intending to get involved with anything just yet - mainly out of the intention to not get involved in the splash of their attacks. Instead he'd glance around, piecing together bits of an idea as he glanced around at the rest of the situation before him. 

<Just like Kojiro and Ambro.>* - Sat Nov  7 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hand- - Sat Nov  7 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Would be more - - Sat Nov  7 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Do you want to continue? - Sat Nov  7 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Because he isn't going to be there to save you next time. - Sat Nov  7 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What was that..? Genjutsu? - Sat Nov  7 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I don't think they saw a trigger. - Sat Nov  7 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Okay. - Sat Nov  7 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Welp, I'm going for a walk. - Sat Nov  7 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: Fucking useless.... - Sat Nov  7 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Child.. - Sat Nov  7 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shifted his eyes over to the man, head tilted up to look at his face. 

"Yeah?"* - Sat Nov  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stared at him, eyes of onyx peering up to him from behind an equally cold visage. Much of what Heiwa had seen could be expressed through the look of his eyes, much of it appearing as if he were judging the person in sight. Not even for a moment would his body falter against the weight of the opposing man's stare, only a simple quick glance at the rest of his body guaranteeing that he wasn't under attack or soon to be.

"And what's that?" * - Sat Nov  7 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Man this guy talks alot... - Sat Nov  7 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Nori.. - Sat Nov  7 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can you teach me about picking plants? - Sat Nov  7 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Sat Nov  7 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov  7 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Don - Sat Nov  7 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Don't you deal with herbs? - Sat Nov  7 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I am still studying them. - Sat Nov  7 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You don't know how to pick them? - Sat Nov  7 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) for a time kept his eyes on the man, every word being articulated within his mind into a full statement before speaking. 

"My father wouldn't want me disrespecting his life by being afraid," he states, bringing his eyes off of him for a brief moment. "I'm not going to do that to him or anyone else that passed."* - Sat Nov  7 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I just slowly cut them from under the roots. - Sat Nov  7 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Could you show me? - Sat Nov  7 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Sat Nov  7 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Someone new? - Sat Nov  7 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: How? - Sat Nov  7 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Come on Nori, just show me. - Sat Nov  7 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Just lightly pull the plant with one hand, have a kunai out and lightly cut through the stem of the plant with the other. - Sat Nov  7 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, the child's eyes returning back onto the man following that. "Is that all?"* - Sat Nov  7 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Greetings again. - Sat Nov  7 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Aden, Are you able to spar today? - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nah, I broke my chest bone. - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Chest bone? - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Im tryna take a leak too. - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll probably screw it up, nevermind anyway. - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Sounds like too much. - Sat Nov  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Heh.. - Sat Nov  7 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's funny. - Sat Nov  7 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Oh look, a helpless naked lady in distress.. If only some Kenjutsu wielding god could save them!? - Sat Nov  7 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You wanna comemy way now? - Sat Nov  7 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Aden, Are you afraid? - Sat Nov  7 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nah, gotta use the bathroom. - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: For how long? - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Aden is his name? - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Mhm. - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Before you came he wanted to act holier than thou. - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He insulted everyone here. - Sat Nov  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I don't remember that. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Tried to make us sympathize with the Kumo massacre. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nah. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Wasn't me. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But uh. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Aden. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And then when he met a survivor. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Be honest. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: See you later. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He tried to fight him. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Are you afraid of me? - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Well, there's afraid, and then there's. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: St-.. No. - Sat Nov  7 22:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: You've been trying to avoid me though. - Sat Nov  7 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nah. - Sat Nov  7 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'm sure if you sparred me once, You would get over your fear. - Sat Nov  7 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'm pretty sure I don't want to. - Sat Nov  7 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Spar. - Sat Nov  7 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Right this instance. - Sat Nov  7 22:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I hope for your sake, I don't obtain the second gate by tomorrow. - Sat Nov  7 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Spaced out for a second. . - Sat Nov  7 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can tell. - Sat Nov  7 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: Glad I'll be out of Konohagakure by then... Think I'll leave now. - Sat Nov  7 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Gonna get something to eat. - Sat Nov  7 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Mhm. - Sat Nov  7 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: And I'm the coward? - Sat Nov  7 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Anyway, That was strange. - Sat Nov  7 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Sat Nov  7 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hello, - Sun Nov  8 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: i swear these kids are ust geting younger. - Sun Nov  8 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Ah. She's here. - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori? Could we speak for a bit? - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh man, you came from no where Akira. - Sun Nov  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Sun Nov  8 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, right. Sure. - Sun Nov  8 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What? - Sun Nov  8 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. This way. - Sun Nov  8 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) made a motion with his hand for her to follow before turning off and heading down away from the manor. If she hadn't come he would have stopped, of course.* - Sun Nov  8 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would lead her into a far more abandoned district of Konoha - few homes belonged to anybody and it was in many cases being rebuilt, slowly, from the previous calamity that had hit. Many other places were, simply, higher priority. If she'd continue to follow him still, he'd stop infront of one of the houses. There wouldn't be much of anybody here. * - Sun Nov  8 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded. He was away from most people, so even if they weren't right in the house it was still enough for him. His voice starts out low nonetheless for mainly her and those within earshot of her to hear.

"I was wondering a few things," he says, his overall stance and expression showing little hostility. Neither did it show any major sense of warmness either. "You're from Kumo, right?"* - Sun Nov  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhhh. Born there, yeah. - Sun Nov  8 00:57:10 2015
