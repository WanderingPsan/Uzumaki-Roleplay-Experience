<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Step-aunt . . . I guess? - Sat Oct 10 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No blood connection though. - Sat Oct 10 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) followed the example given to him, the young child's arm being held out with his palm held forward, even his stance seeming to attempt in mimicking what he'd seen the far older man use. The target that the child was facing would be the fence held directly infront of him where a bystander was very much not likely to be ran into. He'd hardly intend to use such a technique against Kilm or Nozumi.

The fact that there was no hand seals was initially surprising - very few being shown that didn't hold that requirement. But it still held something in common. <Focus your chakra into your stomach..> It was a similar principle to many of the other fire techniques he'd been shown, and above all it was a relatively easy thing to immediately grasp. 

Like a boiling furnace the chakra would begin to interact within him, shifting and moulding together into a potent elemental combination. As more of a feeling he did definitely know how it felt - the heat of his own chakra just waiting, bursting even to be let out. This was the fire element he knew, and with it finally seeming ready he focuses it up to his palm.

Directly deadset on the center would be where he channeled the chakra in, a light, sudden spark appearing from out of nowhere directly infront of this grasped out hand. It'd be very similar to how Kilm had started his with the next step being a sudden fireball appearing within his grasp. However, this simply didn't happen.


His chakra leaks freely from his hand for a brief moment, no shape or elemental manipulation being acted out on it as the technique utterly fizzled in his first attempt. <Not..Like that?> The young lad pulls his arm back and brings it up to see where the spark had gone off. It was definitely a failure, and feeling the chakra exit from his body left him feeling measurably drained from the ordeal. 

It wasn't enough to be compared to the full technique, but it would leave a dent. If mistakes like that had kept happening there would be no way that he could actually learn this technique right now. There were only a few more shots left for him.

Again the kid's hand is held out infront of him, his spacing held out enough for his feet to be held comfortably as he stood in this position, gathering chakra directly into his stomach. It'd be much similar to the way he had done it before, but this time he was focused on something else - not on just releasing the chakra like the other techniques.

This time he was going to directly focus on that spark from before. Once a sufficient amount of energy had been gathered he'd flow it on up to his hand, a bright flash of light appearing in the center of his palm creating a burst of heat. That was what he was focusing on. The very moment that burst exits from his hand the chakra he had been gathering follows suit, combining with the heat generated.

Within his grasping palm a sudden, small ball of flame appears clenched tightly between all digits. It'd shine brightly, seemingly not flickering or dimming for even a moment as he kept pouring a steam of power into it. And despite being a ball of flames, his hand would remain unscathed by his own chakra. <After it's there..just pull back and throw..> 

Finally the lad pulls his arm back, throwing the technique that he'd just created quickly headed towards the fence he was facing. Unlike Kilm, he wasn't holding back his power, but the child simply didn't need to do that. When it impacted it'd cause similar scorch marks to the man who'd just taught him, as well as heating the links up to a much brighter, hot color.* - Sat Oct 10 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . Strange. - Sat Oct 10 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) exhaled deeply, calming himself after using that much chakra. The child didn't have amazing control, nor did he have reserves leading to it taking a measurable drain on his body. As he calmed down, catching his breath, he'd turn to Kilm briefly nod his head. "I'd like to -" 

His sentence cuts off as Angetsu suddenly appears in flames, forcing the child's attention to him.* - Sat Oct 10 12:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) takes the books handed to him, the child inspecting their binding for a title with each one he got. 
"I could eat. Is there a place still standing?" * - Sun Oct 11 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) mimicked Nozumi's actions in taking a seat beside him, his short arm reaching out to take the box of food and rest it on his lap. Depending on whether it was an adults meal or a kids meal would make it clear to the young Heiwa on whether they were supposed to be sharing or not.

Regardless of that fact, he'd just shortly after bow his head, saying his thanks for the food. Ushinawa's parenting had kept the boy polite within his upbringing, and it wasn't a habit he'd feel he'd need to break. Once he was finished he grabbed the pair of chopsticks, broke them apart, and brought a spring-roll to his mouth taking it in one bite. 

As he ate he brought out the frist book he was given, the coloring book, and read through it himself. It'd be finished in very little time, the amount of information within it limited as it only held five words to color in, but nothing would be filled in directly while he was eating. 

Considering this, he'd afterwards open the next book, and take another bite of the food. * - Sun Oct 11 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) pulled his eyes away from the scroll Hideki had given him - feeling a bit more confident in the nature of the technique presented earlier. It wasn't, necessarily, Ninjutsu despite the way he was initially shown it like. Instead the activities fell into the same category as the manipulative shuriken maneuver, the very same one that his uncle first taught him. 

Ever since the incident with his father, he'd barely had time to practice either beyond the most simple of usages. Today he was going to work on both. Taking a step forward in the empty field, the young child reaches into his back pouch to pull out two shuriken, the black, sharpened edges of each star shining brilliantly in the morning light.

<Start slow for now..> He brought them both together, holding each within his hand in the way the scroll had detailed for him to do. The thickness of it felt almost unnatural, and yet still seamless in his hand. <Alright. After this pull your hand back and..> Every step of the action he took would be directed consciously by his mind, a concerted effort to match what the pages had said.

And then he let it fly. Both shuriken were let off, one remaining slightly above and ahead casting a shadow over the one below. Even Heiwa, knowing what he was looking for, had some difficulty telling where it started and ended, forcing him to look under as well to see the full details of it all. <Crazy..> 

The target of each shuriken was directly ahead of the boy, seemingly each ready to crash into the target he'd set up - some basic wood and paper. And yet just before they did, the child's hands each pulled back hard, showcasing each finger to hold a thin, elastic line connected to an individual shuriken.

With a tug of his fingers they changed direction, his overwhelming pull being enough to reverse their direction and send them flying right back to him. In this state they'd easily come close to knotting or entangling within eachother, and knowing this the child spread his arms apart as well, dragging each of the weapons further out to the sides preventing this outcome.

Following his directions they branch out to the sides, almost if they were orbitting him. And, indeed, like a comet they'd eventually crash if he didn't make a move. With his mother no longer around to help in such a situation it forced him to avoid such things instead of fixing them afterwards. However, he did have a plan to deal with this too.

His hands slam downwards as they get ready to spin around and stab him in the back. As he does so he drives his hands forwards, forcing them to change direction and lower their momentum even further. When they hit the ground that'd be it - they didn't even drag further for a bit. They stopped within their tracks lightly cutting into the soil.

<Okay. That works for now.> The child brings his hands up to his face, carefully unstringing the material from around his finger and regathering his supplies. He'd make some plans for his next attempt and try once more, later, to see if his body could keep up with that too. It was time to make some strategies.* - Sun Oct 11 12:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands up to his chest, interlocking them both infront of himself. All in all the bunshin technique was rather simple, and one he was taught far earlier by his own father before the academy. Through a set of three fluid handseals the child surges his chakra out into a sudden plume of smoke passing over revealing an illusory copy of Heiwa. * - Mon Oct 12 05:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) once more rotates through a series of hand seals, each numbering at the end a total of five completed. When he finished he purposefully activated the jutsu, causing another puff of smoke to cover his tracks. When it passed standing in Heiwa's place would be a piece of rubble left laying over from the latest catostrophe to hit Konoha, its relative weight being similar enough for Heiwa to replace with.* - Mon Oct 12 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) responded with a nod of his head, both of his hands moving in tandemn as chakra circulated throughout his body. There'd be a sudden surge of chakra escaping over him once the third seal was made, and once the dust had settled there'd be a close to mirror copy of Hideki standing where Heiwa once was, the child's chakra covering over his entire body like a shroud.* - Mon Oct 12 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good. Good. - Mon Oct 12 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You pass, Heiwa. - Mon Oct 12 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) dispersed the technique, breaking out of being Hideki. 

"Thank you." At this point it hadn't seemed as much of an honor as a few months ago when his father mentioned becoming one. Perhaps because he already knew he was at least at this strength. "When can I start?"* - Mon Oct 12 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm... - Mon Oct 12 05:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You are to find a lost dog. - Mon Oct 12 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's red. - Mon Oct 12 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh...The dog also likes to piss on people. Good Luck. - Mon Oct 12 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, catching the scroll and turning off away from the manor. The child already had somewhat of an idea on how to properly do this anyways. "Okay. Thank you, Uncle Hideki."* - Mon Oct 12 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good Luck. - Mon Oct 12 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't been given much information to go on for his first mission, but it was enough for him to formulate a solid enough plan. A red dog was rare enough of a thing that if it truly existed there'd probably only be one of them in the village, especially in a village this broken down. That, of all things, narrowed down the search without even seeing a picture of the dog. All Heiwa needed to do was find it.

And he had just the plan to do so. Reaching into his back pocket Heiwa pulls out the small, sharpened edge of a kunai and gently presses it against his palm dragging it across and drawing blood. It'd be relatively painless all things considered, with the kunai not dragging in too deep despite the blood that was spurting out.  Once that was finished, he dropped his kunai into his back pouch and brought both hands to his chest.

Held interlocking infront of him, he rotated through a set of five seals, the blood on his one hand transferring over and dirtying the other. <Dragon's Requiem..> His chakra surges out, and he bends over slamming his bleeding palm against the pavement. Suddenly a plume of smoke surrounds him revealing two small dragons circling above him. In colors of red they hovered just above seemingly waiting for something.

"Look around in the sky! Return when you've found a red dog and describe its location!" This was the first time summoning these creatures, but he remembered what his mother had done, and also what the scroll had mentioned. These were recon. Without saying a word the dragons each fly off, extending out into the horizon scanning for whatever they could find.

Heiwa, without much else he could do, posted himself up against a wall, waiting for their return. Several moments passed, Heiwa being able to catch his breath from the summoning of the dragons by the time one of them returned. It didn't waste much time in describing the area and how it stood. With only so many places still standing it meant the dog was in an easy place to find. And, further, its projected path could be predicted. 

"Good job," Heiwa says, a smirk on his face as he brings together the final stretch of the plan. The dragon disperses in a puff of smoke as he's unsummoned, his duty finished. Heiwa himself wastes no time in running off speeding towards the location of the dog. But instead of running directly at it, the child stops just a block away choosing a different plan of action. 

The dog was expected to make his way here. There were, of course, multiple different options, but with this place having trash to dig through and the like it was a good wager he'd end up here. This meant Heiwa could prepare himself. 

In the center of the alley he presses his palm against the dirt, infusing his chakra into the surrounding area. It'd be draining, but with the rest he got after summoning the dragons he'd still be able to stand. Which was important as the young child still had another duty. Hiding off at the other end, behind a trash can, he waits until he hears the tale tell signs of the dog approaching.

Several minutes later it finally happens. The dog steps into the area, triggering the genjutsu that Heiwa had left behind, causing two shadowy images of the boy to appear just behind her running directly towards her. It spooked the dog immediately, the entire sight seeming as real and quickly making her run at full blast to exit the alley. The speed itself was faster than Heiwa could even run - but he still had the element of surprise.

On the dog's way out of the alley, the real Heiwa suddenly jumps in the way, catching it off guard and gnabbing it in his arms. It squirms, but the dog was just a little pup - he could carry it and prevent it from leaving. <Alright - time to return to Uncle Hideki.> the child thinks to himself, walking back towards the mansion with a firm grip around the dog.* - Mon Oct 12 23:55:44 2015

As he was doing that he would raise his hands up and go through three handseals as fast as he could. Once the handseals were done he would breath in and pucker his lips, pushing forth the water he had kneading from his body and spiting it out into a stream of water, splashing water all over the ground. - Tue Oct 13 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ambrocio. - Tue Oct 13 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You can show me your Genjutsu later. Heiwa's turn. - Tue Oct 13 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hai Sensei. - Tue Oct 13 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) walked over standing a couple feet away from Ambrocio. His cold, indifferent stare would fall upon the man, who presumably may have still been in his transformation. If so, the child's eyes would focus on both that, and on the man's face checking to see just how sane he remained. Staying near to him when he wasn't..was near instant death.

"What do you want me to do?"* - Tue Oct 13 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) saw the changes finally begin to end, the child's arms being raised infront of his chest crossing infront of him. "Are you sure?" he asks, remembering directly what he was told by his uncle. "I was told not to use that against anyone but an enemy." * - Tue Oct 13 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Uncle Hideki isn't here anymore.  - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Just go through with it. - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Where is he? - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He left the village. - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He left the village and took most of the funds for the village with him. - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Tue Oct 13 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his attention away from Ambrocio, his expression growing bitter. Him turning in that mission to Taka had made more sense now, as did the changes in squads. the village was now in new management, and just like that his ties to the village began to slip away. Now all he wanted to know was where his uncle was.

"Fine," The child returns his attention back to Ambrocio who, hopefully, hadn't taken advantage of his guard being down. Both of his hands were promptly brought up to his chest, interlocking them both within eachother and rotating through a set of hand seals. Throughout this action his chakra surged throughout his body and finally left aiming to infiltrate Ambrocio's nervous system.

Assuming the man had watched his hand seals - he'd suddenly see a rising trail of leaves lift up into the air and then the genjutsu would start shortly thereafter. Of course, if anyone else was paying close enough attention on the hand seals they also could find themselves trapped within it. If so - any who were caught would see nearly fully realistic versions of their greatest, deepest fears coming out against them. 

Meanwhile, Heiwa himself would move to walk away leaving the area.* - Tue Oct 13 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: A part from Ambrocio smacking us about, fine I guess. - Tue Oct 13 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't seem to be concerned over what Ketsuki said, continuing to walk off from the area. "I'm done." * - Tue Oct 13 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright, when you guys are done, to the academy! - Tue Oct 13 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.. - Tue Oct 13 02:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Heiwa, Takeda. - Tue Oct 13 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: How about you two? - Tue Oct 13 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll deliver materials. - Tue Oct 13 02:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: I expect you all to finish promptly. - Tue Oct 13 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright, I'll be checking on em. - Tue Oct 13 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced towards the woman he'd mentioned, before nodding. It'd be clear that he was upset over something from before he got here, but he didn't let it influence any of his actions. With the mission in hand the child turns and heads out of the area to the drop site for the materials.* - Tue Oct 13 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) found the drop site easily enough, the scroll provided leading enough of a trail for the boy to follow. When he got there he flashed his forehead protector, as well as the scroll written by the hokage. There was some confusion by the people working there, as after all a child was the one delivering the supplies, but after reading through it they realized it was sufficiently legitimate. He was brought out into the back where the materials would be.

This is where Heiwa's patience would be tested, and where a good bit of the work would actually begin. There was a lot of things that he'd have to transfer over, and frankly the child was only a child. His frame was small, and naturally he held far less strength than an adult. But he was sufficiently patient enough to do things the far, far slower way.

Besides, in some sense he preferred this as this gave him some more time to think about the Hideki situation. As well as Nozumi - both of him seem to have left him over the past few days. He could only hope they would come back or it was not of their own free will. 

The smaller boxes would be picked up and transferred over themselves, Heiwa struggling a bit to carry each, but managing to do so well enough in bringing himself to the post office - assuming it was still standing and wasn't torn down from earlier attacks. There he'd drop it off, show them what it was, and go back to the drop site to do it all over again. The bigger boxes he'd carry parts of in smaller boxes, breaking up those that he could just enough to bring them all back to the post office in multiple trips.

This would go on for several hours, the only benefit being that Heiwa was committed to finishing this mission and therefore lowering the time by a severe amount. When finally it was all finished, he got the scroll that the Hokage had given him and had it signed both by the dropsite workers, who were all about to head home themselves, and the post office itself detailing that Heiwa had done the job and that he was finished with it. With all that done he rolls the scroll back up and walks to the academy to turn it in.* - Tue Oct 13 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) walked up to the kage and handed him a mission scroll. "I've finished."* - Tue Oct 13 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Take a cookie and rest. - Tue Oct 13 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) grabbed the cookie and walked over to the fence, resting against it.* - Tue Oct 13 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Tue Oct 13 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hrm? - Tue Oct 13 03:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah.  - Tue Oct 13 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't really cared too much about the cookie, his indifferent stare focusing on the fence infront of him. It was almost as if he was thinking about something. "You want it?" he says, offering the hand with the cookie out to her.* - Tue Oct 13 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) didn't say anything in reply, instead his arm just wriggling in the air still offering it out.* - Tue Oct 13 03:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh. I see. . That's good! I guess. I saw a few people in Kumo, but they were just spacing out near a crater. . A lot. - Tue Oct 13 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Names Ketsuki, Heya. - Tue Oct 13 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's optics flicker towards Ketsuki briefly, before returning back to the fence infront of him. The child would say nothing in response. * - Tue Oct 13 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..You okay, Heiwa? - Tue Oct 13 03:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And that's good.  - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) held himself in contrast to Ketsuki's own visage, a bitter, indifferent look on his face. 

"Why do you care?" Telling her his true thoughts wasn't a good idea in his mind, especially with his uncle still being gone.* - Tue Oct 13 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I don't think it will. - Tue Oct 13 03:59:47 2015
