<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you won't let me help you, I'll make it easier for you. - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: *dramatic arm extend* - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'll kill the kid, so you don't need to protect him. - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: With that..he'll be able to hug the corpse. - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're not helping me at all.  You're making this more problematic. - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) glanced at the two as Kuro started directing him to move. He got that vibe that if he didn't make a move right about now it'd possibly be Kuro's death. This wasn't something he was going to simply let happen again. Not like Seisuke. Not like Lyala. Not like any of them.

Stopping in his tracks he, the child holds up his hand blocking Kuro's movement. "I'll go with you. I'll leave with you, Mizumi." the child says, well aware it was pretty much his death. Just, maybe not his death with Kuro dying as well.* - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're not a priest. A priest wouldn't aim to kill another for such a reason. - Tue Oct 20 06:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're still not..leaving with the child.. - Tue Oct 20 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You really want this child to be killed? - Tue Oct 20 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You really think..I'm bluffing. - Tue Oct 20 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I told you that I wouldn't sexual contact with a child. - Tue Oct 20 06:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: By killing the child, I will save both of you the time and trouble. - Tue Oct 20 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shook his head. It hadn't mattered. After all - if his intentions were to be leaving with Heiwa it was pretty damn weird to not have the real him out there to make use of this all. And that whole 'I can see outside' when the door was visibly closed..Heiwa didn't like it.

Ignoring Kuro's explanation the child steps forward walking over towards the Anbu Agent. * - Tue Oct 20 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) whispers: We are going to have fun okay? We can play catch....go to the lake...Fish... - Tue Oct 20 06:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) really had no ability to deal with this while within Mizumi's grasp. If allowed to connect the child would promptly pass out leaving him with little to no ability to react further to the situation. * - Tue Oct 20 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You not only endangered that child's life.. - Tue Oct 20 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: But now you have the audacity to question my life as a priest? - Tue Oct 20 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I gave you ample time to flee. - Tue Oct 20 06:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's eyes flutter open staring up at the night sky, trying to make out what he could. It hadn't seemed like he was in Konoha directly anymore, at least from the ground underneath him. And the man carrying him hadn't really seemed the same as Mizumi.

Blinking a few times as he woke up, he finally discerned the individual. "Kuro..?" the child asks, not really feeling the strength to move much. "Where are we? Where's Mizumi?"* - Tue Oct 20 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: COME GET IT! - Tue Oct 20 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded, returning his attention back to the woman and beginning his part of the plan. Rushing forward at his top speed, relatively average especially for a child his age, the young boy passes by Takeda charging directly at Hana. As his first foot stepped forward his right hand dug deep into his back pouch lifting out a single set of sharpened shurikens.

There'd be two of them in total, rather plainly seen as he pulls them out and brings his arm back, throwing the both of them just after he'd revealed them. During their flight the bottom one would hide itself under the shadow of the top-most one, making it appear to only be one flying towards her. 

However, someone who spent even a remote amount of time focused on Heiwa's hands would notice the truth of how many there were by the time the shurikens broke off from eachother and spread out on slightly different sides aiming to hit around her right and left sides of her chest.* - Tue Oct 20 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The missiles well miss their mark, cutting straight through the plume of air made behind in the woman's wake. The child well knew of the technique. It was the same one Nina had shown to him before, taught by his Uncle. She was around here somewhere. 

Immediately upon seeing the smoke the child twists his feet, skidding to a stop and turning his head looking around for her. And just as he saw her the hilt of sword made it to his gut. Heiwa looked down, seeing the position of the weapon with a momentary look of surprise on his face. <She's really fast..> He'd barely even been given time to register her flicker before she already pulled it out.

It'd be a short reprieve as he locked eyes back on Hana and jumped back, quickly rethinking his strategy. There'd be a short surge of chakra through his body as he made distance from her without moving his eyes off for even a moment. When he landed he pulled out from his back pouch another shuriken, lightly twirling his hand around the hole.

If allowed this reprieve without immediate follow up, Heiwa would himself egg her on, challenging her with a phrase "Come on!" * - Tue Oct 20 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had been interrupted before he could continue any further - Takeda's blast of water sweeping through the area at Hana. It forced the child to back up somewhat off of instincts alone, having only a few seconds to gauge whether he'd be involved as collateral.

Luckily he wasn't, and the child was allowed a full view of the woman's true speed even without the use of the body flicker technique. Truly his eyes were having trouble keeping up with the blurring effect of it all forcing him to do his best in planning ahead.

Pulling his arm back he throws the weapon on the left hand side of Takeda, arcing out and around in a wide pattern. It'd seemingly appear to be far off from the woman, assuming she chose to take this path, but in actuality there'd be a string remaining attaching both him and the weapon to eachother. If she ran towards that path and in the way of the string, the child's finger would jerk it back, possibly throwing her off balance or even having the weapon itself begin looping around her depending on her reaction. * - Wed Oct 21 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...Go us I guess. - Wed Oct 21 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) saw the familiar flash of white smoke appear infront of his weapon's path, the woman disappearing without a trace a mere moment later. <Again with that..> With a flick of his wrist he brings the shuriken crashing back to the ground and unravels his finger from the string freeing him. 

As he looks around, trying to find her she herself speaks bringing his attention immediately back and around facing her. Indeed she held speed and far more with the use of that technique. If this were a real fight they'd both already be defeated before they realized it. Some respect grew for the chunnin from the genin. She certainly held a lot of skill.

But in that brief moment he also figured out a plan of his to use against her. Bringing up his hands to his chest the child rotates through a set of two seals, quickly passing by them before bringing two digits up to his mouth creating a circle. He spit out through this hole a thick viscous liquid as he jumped back, spreading it along the path directly infront of the woman hoping to limit her mobility by forcing her to no longer be able to run directly forwards - but instead being forced to take a detour around it.

Of course, he had to hope after doing this that Takeda could follow up without any verbal guidance.* - Wed Oct 21 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took some breaths in, seeing as how the training was over. It left him marginally tired using all of those techniques. Getting her out of the sticky mess they'd made, however, was something he wasn't too sure on how to do. The child would instead turn to Takeda seeing how he'd handle it.* - Wed Oct 21 02:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) scrawled back up to his feet and began making his way out of the mansion. "Thanks for the spar," the child says if allowed to get to the door, stopping there for a moment before leaving.* - Wed Oct 21 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Think abou tit? - Wed Oct 21 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. - Wed Oct 21 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) faced his target, a hand tracing around to his back pouch carefully gripping upon two dark weapons. In a quick drawing motion he reveals them to be matching shurikens both thrown at the same time directly towards the tree standing infront of him. 

From a normal standing point of view they'd initially appear as only one total unit - the bottom-most one hiding beneath the shadow of the higher up. The illusion wasn't a perfect one, but it held some skill and clear showmanship. Heiwa had spent a good bit of time working on being able to use such a technique as this. However, it wouldn't stay like that indefinitely. 

With a twitch of his middle finger the top begins to break away from its path, and an equal motion from his index sends the bottom to do the same. In a mere moment their trajectories changed moving to hit from the sides and wrap suddenly around the tree infront of him using the continuing force of their momentum to carry them around.

A transluscent and elastic string kept the motion tight and the action secure, every twist and turn tightly wrapping the string further and further around the bark digging itself in deep. The final bit to add on for the surprise was when both of the weapons finally dug themselves into the wood itself, embedding deeply and keeping the strings tight. 

Getting out for a normal person would be far from easy - more of a test of absolute strength than most others due to the limited mobility it would cause. Heiwa took a stop as he successfully completed the technique to its full ability, just as his Uncle Hideki had shown him with the first lesson of the jutsu. 

It was a feeling of pride that he'd done such and gone at least that far. It was improvement. But at the same time he still had so much more to go. If he was to ever kill Tetsujin. If he was to ever kill Mizumi. If he was to do what he needed to do - there was still so much more to go. Bringing the strings around his digits up to his mouth the child bites into it roughly tearing it and freeing up his hands.

He'd need them for the next part.* - Thu Oct 22 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) returned his attention back to the water infront of him, the child's hands both being brought up during the action. Interlocked infront of his chest, his digits would shift from their previous positions in a total of two seals, rotating fluidly through them while building his chakra up in his person. <Water Style: Syrup Trap.>

The chakra floods into his mouth, quickly turning into a thick, viscous liquid. As the last hand seal is made his right hand is brought up to his mouth forming a circle with index and thumb lined up perfectly with his mouth. With the liquid only continuing to build, Heiwa takes in a deep breath through his nose and exhales it out spitting the sticky thickness in an arc. 

It was the last technique that Lyala had taught him before her passing. Most of his techniques had a certain bit of memory attached to them that he couldn't let go. The thick, syrup-like substance would quickly fall after the arc, landing atop the water and descending back into it as if it wasn't even there.

But Heiwa didn't just stop with that single attempt. The total amount he had made was small and held very little consistent with the diagrams that he was shown. It was far from a completed technique for him - at most a couple of meters when it was detailed to almost be capable of filling up the entire area around him. 

Bringing his hands back into the same rotation of seals he pours even more of his chakra out from his system as he rotates again through the familiar set of seals laid out before him. Heiwa wasn't someone to forget something he was shown, and like the first time they came back in clockwork, fluidly matching through them as if he'd been doing it for a while.

Following the same time as the last, his hand is brought up to his mouth creating a circle to spit through just as the syrup builds up to its full amount. A deep breath is taken in, and suddenly a large amount of liquid is expelled from his mouth. 

It held far more substance this time, so much of his chakra being poured directly into the technique to make it work. But this would come back to be a problem. When the syrup hits the water it does much the same as what it did last time, sinking deeper in the less dense liquid with the rest of the water remaining on top. 

But the drain of the techniques got to him. His eyes felt heavy and vertigo passed over him. A faint outline of black appeared, before he fell backwards landing hard against the pier and passing out. Alive - but unable to remain awake. * - Thu Oct 22 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought both hands inront of his chest, interlocking digits around eachother in the formation of the snake seal. Through the rotation back up into the rat Heiwa's chakra would slowly begin to leak out from him, affecting any who had seen the hand seals with a nasty form of a genjutsu. <Demonic Illusion: Death Mirage Jutsu>

Suddenly a twirl of leaves would appear before the target before dying back down, the signal for the technique being shown plain and clearly as having succeeded. Anyone who knew that this technique worked in such a way wouldn't be as easily fooled, but one who was ignorant would find themselves walking into a dangerous trap.

Several moments after the initial apperance of the technique, after the sudden gust of leaves, the real effects of the genjutsu would begin to manifest and take form. From out of the depths of the persons deepest subconscious they'd begin to witness their worst fears take place directly infront of them.

For Heiwa, when shown this technique, it was of something that inevitably became true. His father, his mother, the Raikage, and most of the village being destroyed right infront of him with nothing he could do to stop it. The harsh truth of how vivid and real his sights were and the future that came from it expressed much of Heiwa's problems with people.

Of course, there wasn't anyone right infront of Heiwa so the technique would be ultimately a failure, but in the end it helped him to better bring about the technique and handle the drain involved with such a powerful one like it. As he adjusted to the drain the child turned back to the village entrance choosing to go back and see if there was a mission for him.* - Thu Oct 22 22:54:17 2015
