<br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) || The attack came around, striking at only the air infront of him as Mana backed away. Throughout the whole motion made by the girl Heiwa would be tracking it with his eyes and reacting accordingly with his body. First the sword was stopped before it reached the full length of the swipe, being pulled inwards for a fast recoil.

Every movement that was made would be carefully tracked by Heiwa, the young child's senses on point where much of his body simply wasn't. Her attack comes in, and suddenly with surprising speed he ducks in downwards, carrying his body under the initial arc of the high sweeping leg while also stepping inwards. It was fast - far faster than someone likely could predict from first impressions viewing the boy.

As he moved in he'd get in close to the girl, throwing his weight around another diagonal slash aiming to chop at the side of her stomach while she was still recovering. It'd be aimed relatively high for the child and would attempt to make advantage of her currently poor positioning.* - Tue Oct 27 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) quickly reoriented his eyes back onto the girl he was sparring, his body shifting and turning so as to once more face her. <I almost didn't see that other kick coming..> he thought to himself, briefly playing through the scene once more. The first kick was initially dodged, but he was a prime target as he saw her prepping for the second. With little where else to go he was forced into the way of the first attack in his successful attempt to dodge the second.

His attack went through shortly thereafter, but the shooting pain in his arm reminded him of that impact. The girl was capable of some good combinations - he'd have to keep his eye out for if she did that again. The child probably couldn't handle many more like it. His stance shifts somewhat, losing some of the form he'd been working on as he moved the weight measurably more onto his unimpacted right side having less of an ability to hold his weapon on his damaged arm. Without a doubt it'd be bruised from the kick. 

His deep, onyx eyes took one last glance at her face making sure she was ready, before moving back in holding tightly onto his weapon. There'd be far less distance to make up this time, allowing for a quick transition to move in and bring his sword sweeping horizontally across aiming for her gut, while he kept his eyes on her movement and a peripheral vision checked up on her legs.* - Tue Oct 27 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) hadn't had as clear of an understanding for their differences of strength, but it was growing more apparent as he made his dash. The throbbing pain in his arm reminded him of how much only a glancing impact had hurt him - and made it clear in his mind that a full on one would be far more devastating. Either she just had more pain tolerance than him and simply she wasn't showing the damage, or she hadn't taken as much as him.

His mind was far quicker than his body, and he came to that deduction rather quickly. Which is why he kept somewhat of an eye on her lower body waiting for her legs to make a movement as the attack came in. He could keep track of the basics on whether she stepped out and would have a good view of her next act to do those tricky kicks - but she didn't do that. Against what he was expecting she stepped in forwards just as his attack was about to land.

Many thoughts circulated, but he knew that it could mean only one thing <She's trying to trade..> His deep black eyes shot upwards in an instant, just as his attack had landed, the feel of the impact rustling through his body. The brief spot of a fist would be all that he had seen, and immediately he went on the defense doing his best to get out of there. Reflexively his foot takes a quick step backwards, his entire body leaning to get out of the way of the prospective attack.

But..it was just too fast. He was just too spread out. The attack connects cleanly with the lower part of his face, and with his attempts to dodge leaving him on unsteady ground he is launched back swiftly, briefly soaring through the air. The weapon lands in the water, floating along it like a piece of bark. Meanwhile, Heiwa continues, hitting the ground underneath him hard and dragging back even further a bit more of a distance. That one, right there, hit far harder than her previous hit - and the little guy hadn't had much in terms of pain tolerance. 

<She hits like..a truck..> * - Tue Oct 27 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) layed there for a time, feeling the sting of the impact hit him. It left his entire body throbbing even if it hadn't been directly hit. This made listening to her full speech rather difficult, but the bits and pieces he pulled out from it allowed him to fit together the full story. It was one he was already coming to a fast realization of. <If I don't improve my strength I won't be able to manage using a a weapon like that. A real sword can cut in deeper, but that won't matter if they absorb it..>

His hand reached up and grabbed onto hers as she offered it, pulling himself to his shaky feet. It still hurt him all over, but he was able to stand appropriately enough. Altogether he was taking a mighty lot from his first spar, and as he began to fully come to he didn't show anger or a measure of being upset at her - his face still showed a level of indifference, but he was ernestly taking an awful lot from the entire ordeal. 

Before she left to work on her technique Heiwa would manage to respond with a nod of his head, replying back to her with a simple "Thank you for the spar." before letting her go. If she continued with the demonstration he'd make a quick mental note of the technique in his mind now seeing it from two avenues. Not just from directly being within it - but also as an observer from outside. It'd be good for him so as to not get as easily tricked by it.* - Tue Oct 27 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) briefly raised his brow, not having expected from her to ask such questions. "Uhh.." He stops for a moment, having to focus off of the pain that was still throbbing at him to get to his thoughts. "Overwhelming force might be an issue - and surprise attacks could certainly end up damaging you," Heiwa explains, moreso getting back to himself as he did so. "While you were in the air you were defenseless, and trading blows when you're aware of the full situation could be damaging."

It was after he stated it that he realized they were quite heavy in the opposites. He had low damage but high ability to react. She had high damage and a general inability to do so. It was interesting.* - Tue Oct 27 04:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned his attention away from her after saying that, taking in a deep breath to prepare himself. He still had a few missions left to do today, and he'd be doing them all while in pain it seemed. "I'll see you later, though. I have to work on some missions." A slight smirk crossed his face anyways, managing to get past the expression he'd normally kept up to most people. With thoughts of how to go about each one and manage them all in his head, he walks off leaving the girl where she was. * - Tue Oct 27 04:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) raised his brow initially not remembering the girl infront of him. They'd met only one time really - and that was during the point Niza was dying in Kumogakure. Aside from that she'd very briefly remembered her being in Konohagakure in the opposing squad to their own. The name wasn't an immediate thing to remember, but he was able to bring it out. 

"Err..Marrisa?" His facial features alone would show that he wasn't too acquainted with her, and of course he'd take a glance over at the battle between Saeza and Violet while figuring this out.* - Tue Oct 27 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) wouldn't have much else he could say in response before the man was gone, leaving directly after the hug.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) found himself staring off into the horizon, watching as the sun set before him. It wasn't something he normally would stop for, but the events of earlier had him wanting to dissect what was told to him, and he had some time left until he had to be at the mission site. 

However, before he could get fully absorbed in his thoughts a voice would snap him back. Bringing his head to face the person he'd give her a quick look up and down while responding "Evening." His face held a slight level of indifference plastered across, a weird sight to see from a child as young as he was.* - Tue Oct 27 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) settled onyx eyes resting on her for a brief time. <Don't forget those who helped you along the way..You can't do this on your own.> The lectures of Daisuke repeated within his mind, and he returned his eyes back onto the horizon.

"Work has to be done," he explains, remaining standing up beside her. "Why're you up?"* - Tue Oct 27 11:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right right. - Tue Oct 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) turned away from the girl. It was about time for Heiwa to get to the mission site. He estimated he'd have enough time to get there assuming no other problems came up. "I'll see you later," Heiwa says to the still unknown female, before simply walking away from the area, a hand raised up into a wave as he left. <Don't forget how to love.> Again the thoughts of Daisuke's lectures hit him in his mind. He'd have more time to think of it later when he's working. He agreed with this to himself, and continued off in his trek.

The first mission he was working on was that of filling in a hole that, honestly, shouldn't have even been made. It was completely in the wrong area and already the construction crew were getting chewed out. Heiwa's mission was to fix this little blunder - without having to use too many men in the repair of it. Hence, he was made to come out at near midnight, when no one was working or active, and fill in the hole for the construction company.

<Lets get this over with..> Spotting a shovel, Heiwa carefully holds it up in his hand. It'd be held favoring the right side of his body where his right arm could maintain the bulk of the exercise. From the spar earlier his left was still feeling some pain, and this positioning would better allow him to continue working for longer. It was comfortable enough, even if it did somewhat limit his mobility through the use of it.

The hole itself was several feet deep, and quite wide at that, but it wasn't fully finished by the construction crew for how big the house was to be. And the dirt was still laying around in plain sight right next to the giant hole. Just so long as Heiwa watched his steps and didn't fall in it'd be just simple grunt work. Albeit, rather time consuming. Starting with the largest mound of dirt, Heiwa digs his shovel in and shimmies a large amount of the dirt back in. Not all of it could be knocked in that way, but the top layer had managed to be knocked back into its former resting place lowering the effort needed.

And then the child would simply begin the long and arduous task of grabbing up shovel-fulls and pouring each into the hole. When he finished with a certain mound he'd then move off to another one, continuing with the work until he was finally finished with it all. The dirt wouldn't look perfect - it'd be uneven on certain parts and obviously look dug up at some point, but it was enough to finish the mission and Heiwa simply didn't have enough ability to prevent it from looking that way. 

As he finished with that job the sun would begin just peeking up over the horizon, notifying Heiwa of what his next mission would be. Luckily, they both played into eachother, but regardless of this fact it'd still be a long day. And both after such a very long night. Placing the shovel back where it was previously, he turns his sights onto the way to the actual construction site, ready to get there in time for the next mission.

This time when he'd arrived there'd be a large bustling amount of people. And, of course, they'd stop Heiwa just as he entered. Restricted area. Civilians not allowed. However, with a flash of his forehead protector their mood changed completely, and they let him in explaining to him the job. There were major looks being given his way - a six year old helping with digging such a large hole, but they didn't make any sort of major stop against him. 

They'd already made some progress before he got there, and as he entered the hole he'd be given a shovel and a basic rundown on the dimensions - before being told to just follow what everyone else was doing when they realized he might not know what they were talking about. Of course, Heiwa had known, and wouldn't have too much difficulty following to the instructions given previously to him. The hardness would come in making that reality. He wasn't as physically strong as the men around him, but he could handle some of the smaller jobs and keep some of the men on track in where to dig.

Hours passed following this way, but eventually time was called and everyone was allowed out of the pit having finished in their work for that bit. The next part was working on the foundations for the house they were making - which was after all why they started with making the hole to begin with. During this time various bits of prep work had already been completed, some of the workers that couldn't fit in the hole completing that. Things such as getting the bricks in the proper area, making the adhesion for said bricks to stick together, and the like.

It was a group effort for everyone involved to work in making it - and there were a lot of people working in the rebuilding process. Again, this continued with Heiwa handling the work that he could actually manage to handle without causing damage to others or to the structural integrity itself. They didn't ask that much out of the child, realizing that he was putting his all in it and was still helping in the end. Occasionally when the really tough work was being done they'd give him a simple job like delivering supplies or even something to cool off the workers.

After the foundation they worked on building the rest of it from the ground up, continuing to do so at a rapid and fast pace. It still took a few days of Heiwa coming back and the workers doing the same, but their sheer numbers had allowed it to quickly begin to be realized in very short time. It wasn't like they were building a mansion or anything - a nuclear family's home of all things allowing the space invovled to be relatively small and compact for what they needed.

At the end of the days it was all finished though, and Heiwa was finally given a stamp to mark that he'd completed his work. Luckily for him, his arm had also stopped being so sore from the impact. Unluckily for him, it was now sore on both arms from all the work. However, he didn't show much of this fatigue, holding it in as much as he could to continue in the work. When he finished though that all changed, and he finally let a large sigh of relief exit him as he trudged back to get his rewards. * - Wed Oct 28 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) sat back, onyx eyes following the movement of her hands into the single seal. And then the water around the both of them began to lift up slowly into the air covering much of the area in its influence. Yumiko would only still remain in his sights primarily due to the closeness of them. It was a jutsu he had seen before - in the bar just when..

A flash of his father's eyes hit him, and he felt ever more sure of what his goals were. There was no turning back option in his mind. 

"You use this to surprise the enemy, right?" Heiwa guesses, coming to a quick deduction of the abilities strengths. "Hit them while they're unaware or unable to react?"* - Wed Oct 28 13:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But.. I don't want to put you in danger- - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stood up straight, thinking about what Mana had said after their spar. His attacks didn't do much damage. The child couldn't take very much either - but his reflexes were on point. If he could continue in reacting and quickly adjust to their fighting styles..even moreso when other jutsus are added he could end up far stronger than she realized. It'd go against what she was trying to teach him, but Heiwa was planning to go fully in to the idea of reflexes.

And to do that required some work. Bringing his hands up to his chest, he rotates through a set of three hand seals, his chakra expanding outwards from him at the very last one. A simple technique - it crafted an illusionary copy of Heiwa directly beside him. Having no mass or form it could not interact with the environment, but it could still seem as if it were. This was still useful for him. The order was already sent - and the clone followed it by pulling out his wooden tanto and holding it firmly in its grasp.

There'd be a slight exchange between the two, before the clone suddenly began, moving in the short distance between them and bringing the tanto to bare aiming against his right side of his gut. <Have to move.> The shot was wide, but it contained a measure of speed that made dealing with it rather difficult - the wide arc making directly avoiding it hard with his lack of footwork. A step is taken from the side, but he in the end had been caught flatfooted.

The illusion's blade hits at his side - doing no damage or even impact. It passes through his body leaving only the realization of defeat as he recoils back into a standing position. <I'm too slow to dodge? Even if I can see it coming..> The clone's arm pulls back, giving Heiwa an ample amount of time to get back into a stance before continuing again. 

This time it cuts in a diagonal. <Move. Move!> Heiwa takes a step backwards, and leans out in the opposing direction of the blade trying to swoop out to the side of the attack - but it continues anyways and still too fast for Heiwa to move. The blade would have cut in deep to his shoulderblade - narrowly making it that far before Heiwa got out. It hadn't done any damage, obviously, but it did show a lot in Heiwa's weakness and poor form. There had to be a change or some focus on improvement..* - Wed Oct 28 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) test* - Thu Oct 29 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) test* - Thu Oct 29 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a glance at the sun. It was beginning to set. It was getting late. He'd need to work on those missions now. With a nod, affirming the plan to himself, he recalls the information that he'd need - having already read the scrolls fully through. And quickly he generated a plan. The first stop would be at the flower store to pick up said flower. <Alright. Lets get this started.> the thought ran through his brain, and he picked himself up and began making it to his first destination.

A bit of time would pass, but Heiwa would make it to the flower shop without much trouble. There he would find a beautiful bouquet of roses waiting for delivery, which Heiwa himself had to sign for in release. It was rather obvious that it had cost quite a lot for the man who had requested the flowers. After all the forms were complete, however, Heiwa was allowed to pick them up and take it out from the store. In addition, however, he'd also been able to purchase a box of trash bags for a later mission. 

Things were all piecing themselves together rather quickly - he just had to add the final part of the plan. Carefully propping the roses up against something that wouldn't ruffle or mess up the bouquet, Heiwa frees up his hands enough to pull out a small, darkened edge of a knife. It'd shine dimmly against the setting sun as he cut it across his palm, digging in lightly to release his blood. It'd hurt, but it was quickly becoming an accustomed thing for the young child. 

His digits would mix and swirl around in the red liquid, spreading it across his fingers until his entire hand was stained with his blood. <Alright. Summoning Technique..> His hands were brought together as he mentally incanted the jutsu, a series of rotations crafting and moulding his chakra into a different form. <Dragon's Requiem!> A sudden surge of energy left him as he finished the final hand seal and slammed his bloodied hand against the pavement.

A plume of smoke spreads out from him, and a small, black dragon is revealed swirling around him. It'd briefly pass by his face before continuing in a rotation around his body. At every point it did this it'd speak "Why have you called me?" it says, voice not sounding angered or even annoyed at being summoned, but instead serious. It recognized that this was a job for it to do, and it'd get paid and rewarded in turn for his work. Not a hard worker, but a dilligent enough one to progress.

Heiwa waited until it was infront of his face to speak his mind, following its own ritual. "I need you to deliver those roses," he says, in a somewhat fragmented sentence due to the dragon's rotations. "After you do that I need some eyes in the sky," He explained both of the mission details to the dragon circling around him, telling him of where to deliver, and the features of the dog that they'd be looking for. 

It'd continue circling across Heiwa in silence, taking in and planning out the journey first, before finally speaking out on one of the rotations. "Very well, summoner. Strap the roses on me." It broke off from the child, and swam through the air towards the roses. There'd already be a strap around it - something Heiwa had asked of when he'd been in the flowers shop. All he needed to do was carefully bring it around the dragon.

And he was done. It'd be tightly folded around him, not interrupting his flying ability, but also being relatively quick and easy for him to take it off when needed. "I will return with information about the canine," It flew off after that statement, not waiting for Heiwa's input any further. It left the scene like that, soaring through the air to its destination and beyond. <That takes care of one mission..> he thinks to himself, and grabs the box of trash bags. <And frees up time for the other one.>

The next mission was a relatively simple one - albeit time consuming and a bit laborous. He was to pick up trash and fill ten full bags of the stuff. Simple and concise, there wasn't much to the job other than to just do it. Since he was already there, the first stop would be the flower shop to pick up any loose litter that had managed to be there. And there was a surprising amount that had accumulated around that area.

But not just that area. There was litter and trash at many points that didn't seem reasonable or real. Especially whenever he'd be there there wouldn't be near to this level of trash - which made it all sink in on how often these missions must be given out. The people here really were dependent on their shinobi so much so that they wouldn't even clean up most of the time after themselves. It was disheartening to say the least.

Wadded up paper towels and napkins. Old broken pieces of technology and empty bags of potato flakes. Heiwa was made to pick up plenty of stuff in the missions entirety and fill up many of his trash bags relatively quickly. There would be some free points - which were reasonably free of trash. However, they'd always be right next to a trash bin which made the fact people were still littering directly infront of a place to dispose of their trash that much more maddening. 

But in time, the mission did come to its conclusion with ten trash bags being filled up in its entirety. These would be put in a large bin for the trash to go and his mission would be completed just like that. Lugging around the large bags were a tad strenuous, but Heiwa was remarkably stronger than the average six year old, and handled it relatively well. The sun would have set during the work, however, the dragon summon had yet to return to Heiwa. 

The child wore white, so it's not like he'd blend in at all. Also, at this time of night it'd be far less likely for others to be out and about - making it that much more likely he'd be tracked. And yet the summon hadn't returned. <It is a dog..if the summon is that far away I couldn't reliably track where it'd go by the time I get there,> he deduced to himself, and picked out his final action. <I'll go look for it myself. It might have overlooked or passed it by.>

With this plan in mind, Heiwa dusted himself off and began walking off in the direction of the alleyways. It was unlikely for a run-away to be in broad daylight - especially after the reasonably lengthy time it was missing. It'd instead have hidden in the alleyways looking for safety and survivability. They'd get both in such an area, added even further with the easy availability of trash. If anything - he was in the right area for finding it with how his former mission had been.

<Just have to keep an eye out for anything..> Thoughts like this ran through his mind, reminding him consciously of everything he'd need to do - when he sees something. It was faint and off in the distance of the darkened alley, but it's silhouette matched with what he was looking for. A large, black german shepherd - the size matched up with the description of it all. Heiwa would have to assume it was.

"Bruce?" The child called out curiously, the name of the animal he'd been given with the mission hopefully catching its attention. And catch its attention it did! The dog's ears propped up fully, and it turned in his direction. <Found him.> A smirk crossed the child's face, the final mission being cleared just like that. "Come on, Bruce. Lets go find your home." It left him feeling good having seen him and not having to brutally bring it back to its caretakers.

Or at least, that's what he initially thought. The dog hadn't moved an inch past catching attention of Heiwa, and instead had lowered itself down lower into a pouncing formation. <What is he..> The growling aggressive stance of the dog made no lies about the hostility it was feeling. Heiwa's smirk quickly lowered, and he took a step back holding his hands up to show he wasn't a threat. It was too far away to rely on Genjutsu - the dog probably could only see base outlines of him.

<I need to regroup - I know where it's living..if I just -> Suddenly, the canine broke off into a pounce, quickly breaking past the distance and making it towards Heiwa at a fast and rapid pace. Heiwa's hands lowered and his stance widened, just as the dog neared close enough to fully gather its features. Frothy saliva spilling from the mouth alongside the complete and feral attitude it was showing - it was a very clear sign of what the state of the dog was at. 

<Rabies.> Heiwa wasn't a medic, but he was a gatherer of information. He knew the signs of an animal in that state. It seemed too far gone even for him to do much else. <I can't reason with it..> The big, black dog lunged in for a bite, lifting off the ground with its fangs barred and ready to clench down. The weight alone would be enough to overpower the small child like Heiwa, and the additional damage would be enough for him to be made a meal.

But beyond that - if he even got bit once that was it. He'd have to avoid it at all costs. In a sudden moment, Heiwa's reflexes kicked in with his right leg swiftly moving behind the left and his body turning in tandemn with it all. <I can't let it hit me..> The dog passes by Heiwa, missing the child completely and instead landing hard against the pavement. It'd straggled back up to its feet, and turn quickly in the direction of the child prepping for another lunge.

<I have to do it..> As the dog came in for another powerful lunge, Heiwa's right hand dipped down into his back pouch grabbing the darkened edge of a strong knife by the hoop. In a quick motion the dog leaps once more for another kill shot - aiming for the neck or face of the child when Heiwa makes his move. Swiftly jumping off to the side, he holds the kunai out strong along the path that the animal was taking and forces his hand downwards along the trajectory.

The momentum of the dog would be used in dragging his blade forward while his hands and his body remained clean and away from any part of the animal biting him or even getting a scratch for the infectious fluids to get into his body. But the same couldn't be said for the dog. Slashed through deep it let out a howling whimper from the pain of it all, and smashed into the pavement it had so quickly lunged forwards to previously.

But this time it wouldn't get up. Its leg was hurt too badly and the pain was cutting into it rough. The place it was hit at was debilitating, and in its state of mind it couldn't get itself back up to continue. It may very well bleed to death if left alone like this. His eyes turn to the exit, before he heard another whimper as it tried to move, but very well couldn't. It touched on his heart strings. <I can't just leave it in this state..>

So much death had been seen - this would be his first kill, but the full act of it all wouldn't be terribly traumatic or life changing for Heiwa. <Everyone must die..> Kirie's lecture hit his mind, as he carefully moved to the dog and slashed it hard along the throat. Where the arteries were exactly he wasn't sure, so he slashed in farther than he knew would be necessary, making sure he hit one of the powerful ones and allow it to bleed out quickly and peacefully.

It made another howling whimper, and then stopped. It began to lay down more and even stopped thrashing about to move Heiwa away. It'd be dead in a matter of moments. The young child turned and wiped off his blade, beginning to return back to the mansion. Before doing so - he undid the seal allowing the dragon summoning from earlier to return back to where it came from. Part of him didn't want to deal with someone else seeing him like this. He made an effort to get to his place first and clean off the blood.* - Thu Oct 29 03:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *stares* - Thu Oct 29 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) shifted his attention over to the girl. A brief flash of memory hit him as he remembered her being with the group of Ortho, Marrisa, and that other girl fighting Violet. <They were looking for jutsu scrolls..>

His onyx eyes came to rest upon her, shooting an indifferent stare at the girl for a brief moment before replying. "Hey."* - Thu Oct 29 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You looking for Ortho too? - Thu Oct 29 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Not really. - Thu Oct 29 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: He'll probably come back around.  - Thu Oct 29 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You seem familiar. - Thu Oct 29 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What is your name? - Thu Oct 29 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's Heiwa. - Thu Oct 29 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Heiwa.. - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Heiwa...your name seems familiar too. - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I am Izanami.  - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I rarely find others my age to talk to. - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..It does -  - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) furrowed his brow. That name now seemed familiar. He knew he heard it before. Mentally he sifted through his memories, near photographic and auditory in it all before he find that keyword. <Heiwa, you have other family. Your father had a cousin named Fujitora.> He was sure of that memory being correct, and the last part sealed it. <Fujitora has a daughter named Izanami.>

"Izanami.." He repeated it aloud, before asking the question. "Is your father 'Fujitora'?"* - Thu Oct 29 06:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Someone told me about him. He ever mention an 'Ushinawa'? - Thu Oct 29 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Ushinawa? I know him. - Thu Oct 29 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: He gave me a weapon a long time ago. - Thu Oct 29 06:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..He was my dad.  - Thu Oct 29 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Ushinawa was family...so that must mean. - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) gave a nod. It'd been a while since the death. There weren't any tears he was shedding directly over it anymore. "I heard Fujitora was Ushinawa's cousin," he stops after saying that allowing what was likely well and obvious now to sit in. * - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you a shinobi? - Thu Oct 29 06:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I thought so. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What village are you with? - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Sunagakure. - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) nodded. At least he knew where they were. "Alright. If I'm ever there I'll keep an eye out," he says, finally breaking the silence between the both of them. Conversations weren't his strongest point, and his general attitude, even if he was trying to fix it, was still non-conducive for a talkative person. "I'm going to go work on my missions," he says, and turns facing away from her.* - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Greetings... - Thu Oct 29 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -just came via fire- - Thu Oct 29 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hello. - Thu Oct 29 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a bit of a step back as the flames first started. He'd seen that technique before on Mizumi - but the man who emerged didn't appear to be the same as him. Heiwa's jet black eyes rested upon him, before his guard lowered somewhat enough and the indifference of his stare returned to his face. <It's not him.>

In echo of Yumiko he repeated the greeting. "Hello."* - Thu Oct 29 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You've grown Heiwatta.. - Thu Oct 29 07:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Your father was like a brother to me.. - Thu Oct 29 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) had his suspicions, but that pieced it together perfectly. His eyes narrowed as he came to the truth. "Fujitora," the name was one he was growing well acquainted with in hearing as of late. * - Thu Oct 29 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm noted. - Thu Oct 29 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kilm told me about you. And Izanami. - Thu Oct 29 08:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm here to take her home. - Thu Oct 29 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I haven't seen her for a while. She was around here. - Thu Oct 29 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..Who's your guardian currently? - Thu Oct 29 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A man named Arata. I sleep at his place sometimes. - Thu Oct 29 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ah...Are you safe here with him? - Thu Oct 29 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I wouldn't classify it as guardian. It's more that I just sleep at his place sometimes. - Thu Oct 29 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Are you safe here? - Thu Oct 29 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I am.  - Thu Oct 29 08:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Great...Within time then shall I help him unlock the flames within. - Thu Oct 29 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That's most good then. - Thu Oct 29 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm sure your father would of wanted for me to help you out alittle. - Thu Oct 29 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Help me out? - Thu Oct 29 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Training. - Thu Oct 29 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... What'd you have in mind? If you're just here for Izanami that doesn't give much time. - Thu Oct 29 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: For now..Just tell me all that you know. - Thu Oct 29 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In Fire and Water? - Thu Oct 29 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes.. - Thu Oct 29 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fireball. Exploding Flame Shot. Raging Waves. Syrup Trap. - Thu Oct 29 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I see.. - Thu Oct 29 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So you know of the sharingan ,yes?.. - Thu Oct 29 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..The Sharingan? - Thu Oct 29 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) saw the glimpse of change within the man's eyes as he switched from his normal iris towards one that was..more than familiar. The eyes that his father almost always wore out and natural. The eyes that his father had attempted to give to him..and later was given to the original inheritor of his will - Seisuke. It was one that was near forever imprinted in his mind. The child just didn't know the name.

He'd hold the scroll firmly in his hand, but wouldn't shift away from looking at it until it was finally reverted back to normal. "Our clan.." he begins, remembering the little bit of information he was told by his aunt. "The Uchiha."* - Thu Oct 29 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) felt the chakra enter his system, revitalizing his body with the energy. It'd be a sudden jolt of awakeness and energy slipping into his body. His chakra levels were rather high, considering his low age, but it wasn't comparable as of yet to Fujitora's. In time the feeling passed, but the sensation of being 'full' hadn't. It still remained with him.

"It's fine," Heiwa says, shaking his head to focus off of the difference. "Thank you, Uncle Fujitora." * - Thu Oct 29 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No problem. - Thu Oct 29 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched as Fujitora left. Beyond just the scroll that he was given, his uncle gave him plenty of information beyond that. Information on his clan and on that of the Sharingan. Which now he also knew the name of for once. <The Sharingan..The manifestation of my father's will.> And supposedly somehow it was dormant within Heiwa himself. The thought hit him at that point to ask how one would go about activating it then - but Fujitora was already gone.

<Later..> His jet black eyes returned onto the scroll that he was given, and carefully he read through the first few sentences in a remarkably very short amount of time, gathering the name as well as various bits of information on it. In a sense he'd somewhat forgotten Yumiko was even here.* - Thu Oct 29 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Uchiha huh? - Thu Oct 29 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) brought his eyes up from the page briefly, before nodding. "Yeah..Uchiha," he says, scrolling back up the scroll and placing it back. He'd have time later if the conversation continued. * - Thu Oct 29 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It seems like there's a lot I don't know about you. - Thu Oct 29 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's information I didn't know myself. - Thu Oct 29 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Life must be rough. - Thu Oct 29 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. It is. But that doesn't matter. - Thu Oct 29 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm? - Thu Oct 29 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's not going to stop me.  - Thu Oct 29 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Stop you from what? - Thu Oct 29 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: From finishing my father's will.  - Thu Oct 29 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm and what was that? - Thu Oct 29 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..To stop the unneeded violence. - Thu Oct 29 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to go into detail? - Thu Oct 29 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...All these wars. The death caused by it all. - Thu Oct 29 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My father's will is against that. - Thu Oct 29 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Thu Oct 29 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: And there's a chance you'll die. - Thu Oct 29 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I won't. - Thu Oct 29 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm promise? - Thu Oct 29 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I swear on it. - Thu Oct 29 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Come here. - Thu Oct 29 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) steps up closer. * - Thu Oct 29 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) got brain damage from the flick. Why you gonna hit a frail kid like that? * - Thu Oct 29 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) --omit--* - Thu Oct 29 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) flinched involuntarily, taking a step back from her in the process. When his eyes opened  he'd stare at her with his eyes narrowed adding an edge of slight anger to his previously indifferent look. * - Thu Oct 29 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Don't get into a situation where you die. Who else will I speak to when I can't sleep. - Thu Oct 29 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) softened his stare, his appearance calming down quickly. "I wasn't planning to do it now.." he said, turning his eyes over to the water. "I'm going to get stronger before I do anything."* - Thu Oct 29 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It doesn't have to be that way. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're shinobis. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We change reality all the time. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can change this. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe. - Thu Oct 29 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well I don't mind helping if you need it. - Thu Oct 29 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) 's mouth raised slightly, a smirk passing by his face in contrast to his normal appearance. <You can't do this alone..> It was progress, in his mind. If someone was willing to help..others just might too. "Good.." he says, his voice trailing off at the end. "Are you tired?"* - Thu Oct 29 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Just a little. - Thu Oct 29 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Would you be up for a spar? - Thu Oct 29 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: However, before we do so, mind if I stock up on weapons? - Thu Oct 29 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Sure. I'll be here. - Thu Oct 29 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) would allow the older girl to pass by and stock up on weaponry. It made sense with her style of combat that she'd use weaponry extensively. Without saying a word to her after his statement, he pulls out the scroll that he'd been given and unravels it enough to get a quick look at everything infront of him. He was a fast learner, and a quick reader so he'd quickly begin to scan across everything that was infront of him. 

It seemed like a relatively similar jutsu to the one that his other uncle, Hideki, had taught him on how to do. Albeit, with less possible damage or variation, but as well equally far fewer hand seals required to craft such a jutsu. 

It wouldn't be long at all until he had finally finished with the bulk of it and could close the scroll - having it fresh in his mind and memory on how to perform it. <It's worth a shot to attempt..> He'd give a nod to himself, agreeing with the thought, and finally bring himself up to his feet. 

Both hands were made to be against his chest, rotating into a simple interlocked seal like that of the tiger. As he did this, his chakra expanded out from him and focused directly into the mouth of the young child, turning into a thick and powerful sheen of fire based energy. It wasn't the full strength it could be - raw and unkempt - but it held some power in and of itself.

<Fire style: Fire Dragon Bullet!> The thought of the technique ran through his mind, and quickly he took a deep exhale spitting out the flames within his mouth in a quick and long burst from his throat. Strangely it wouldn't seem to burn him in the slightest - as if his mouth were capable of handling the flames he was spitting. 

But the drain would still impact him. Even with the chakra given to him by his uncle, he still felt it hit him hard. Far harder than the Fireball jutsu would be. <Weird..>* - Thu Oct 29 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry about that, got pulled into an argument. - Thu Oct 29 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: An argument of what? - Thu Oct 29 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: They found out I wasn't in then started yelling so then they focused on each other and I snuck away while they were doing so. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Do you still have time for that spar? - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm not going back anytime soon. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I also decided to try my luck with a sword as well. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You buy a Bokuto then? - Thu Oct 29 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. Just Kenjutsu then. - Thu Oct 29 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a bit of a step back, his hand moving backwards to rest upon the hilt of the sword he kept strapped around his back. Rested in a sheathe, one could misinterpret it at a first glance to be real, but once out of its sheathe it'd be clear and plain to see in what it was. A brown, wooden sword with no sort of sharp edge to it. Fit for beginners in the art of Kenjutsu and for general spars in which a single bad mistake could normally end in the loss of a life.

He'd hold the weapon firmly with both hands, holding it diagonally outright with the hilt positioned just infront of his solar plexus. None of his lessons were formal - all of them focused on the quick learning aspect that was central to Heiwa and the swiftness his mind had of piecing together this information. Much of this lack of experience, however, could be shown in his stance. Lacking full posture and uniformity it was clear to someone who was experienced that he was uneducated in this part.

His stance would widen out somewhat to give some more breathing room for himself, as he rested his onyx eyes on Yumiko. "You can have the first move."* - Thu Oct 29 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) met her strike with his own, his elbow being raised and his arm twisted so the flat end of the weapon met with striking edge. The general slowness of the attack would give him an ample amount of time to do so - and much of the force would be lost. Which was good for him as potentially without that she could overpower him quite easily. 

When she backed up ever so much, it became apparent alongside the others that she really wasn't too used to this. It was quite reminiscent of his first time being shown one. While he hadn't had formal training - he was at least reasonably familiar with the usage of the blade. He would keep his attacks slow enough for her to react - but he wasn't going to just make this a simple thing. She'd need to learn still.

Taking a step forward while she went on the defensive, the child brings his wooden blade coming down to bare in a diagonal fashion - moving in such a way to be brought downwards across her chest. It would be reasonably slow enough that she could react to it - but if she were to do so it'd likely require her to quickly do so - unable to have a secondary thought about it or a moment to question the impulse of doing it.* - Thu Oct 29 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) kept his eyes on her, watching the movement of her arms as the attack came out - and moved far faster that he was expecting for it to go. With no room to dodge he impulsively raises his arm up again to block the incoming strike, blade twisted so that the side would meet against it. But the force of the impact would begin to weigh on the child immediately. Like a springboard his arm pulls back, the tension easily being enough to cause strain on his arms and prove the girl could overpower him.

But the recoil of such a strike would be enough to also damper his reflexes. Before he had recovered the following strike to his side manages to connect, hitting relatively well to his gut which took the full brunt of the attack. It'd seem on the verge of winding him - almost managing to do so as he staggered back and quickly caught his breath. <She hits hard as well..> he thought to himself. <And her attacks are fast too.> 

Heiwa hadn't had many battles, and as such he hadn't been able to correctly deduce his power in most cases. But quickly he was seeing that he was right with his realization earlier. He couldn't fight like how Mana could - he had to avoid strikes instead of meeting them head on.

"Come on - your move again," he says, ready to have this actually be something.* - Thu Oct 29 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watches her, seeing that she wasn't making a direct action. It was similar in fact to how the other one had tried to fight - Mana would always give him the first move. It'd cut down on his reaction time somewhat due to the recoil of it all meaning if they managed to dodge he would be in for some trouble if they were fast. <Doesn't look like there is much else I could do though..> he thought, coming to the conclusion.

Suddenly he takes a step forward, breaking the remainder of the distance between their swords and swiftly bringing his horizontally against her body. It'd carry his speed within this strike, driving forward at a natural pace for him towards her gut. Despite the relative low-impact strength of his attack, the child not having much striking force or impact, his attacks would manage to be relatively quick. On par with that of a regular genin or actually quite likely above that of one.

Dealing with it would make the situation far more tense.* - Thu Oct 29 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) ended up losing in the exact same way as before. His skill with a katana still left his strikes wide and too far out to stop - unable to properly bring his blade to a halt quick enough when he saw her arm go in for the movement. In short he was trapped and despite his attempt to back away he still ended up getting hit rather hard.

He'd fall to the ground from the impact - his durability and general strength of standing was far off from that of most people. And from another subsequent hit so too would his breath be knocked out from his lungs. It'd take him a bit of rest before he grabbed onto said hand and was pulled up. * - Thu Oct 29 15:14:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) set out on the trail, the next three missions already well enough in his mind on what he'd need to do. Similar ones to that he has already done, it was well expected given the somewhat level of infancy that the village of Kirigakure was going through. Plenty of holes needed to be dug, and often sometimes mistakes happened that required fixing. All in all - it was expected given the current state of affairs, and Heiwa wasn't terribly upset about the missions.

With a bag in his hand, he started with the very first of the missions which was to again clean up some more trash. A target total of ten bags of litter cleaned up, he'd endeavor to start this early and while on his way to the other mission sites. Due to the general distance, there was a lot of ground to cover and he felt quite confident that in all that time he'd be able to gather enough trash to cover up the current requirements of the mission.

And much of that ended up being true. The first bag was filled relatively quickly, and the second was even faster as he found a new gold mine of just consistent litter. The third wasn't filled too fast, but that allowed him to find a bin to dump the first two without becoming overencumbered. This pace of trash cleaning was followed until he was left with two heavy bags remaining in his hands, stacked up just enough so he could carry them both. 

They'd be dumped the moment he made it to the construction site which had a conviently placed bin for reasons quite like this. <That's one mission down,> he thought to himself, turning his attention after back over to the next two jobs he would have. 

Those two jobs would be relatively similar to eachother - being the same job just reversed on eachother. Digging a hole and filling another. It was explained to him that they were planning to work on the foundation tomorrow, and that they messed up and dug the hole in the wrong area. They wanted Heiwa to make up for their mistake and keep them on going just as fast. It is a job they'd normally have multiple people helping with, but Heiwa has proven himself dilligent enough to complete them.

Starting with the filling first, so as to not cause problems by digging too close accidentally, he first grabs a shovel and makes his way to the closest mounds of dirt. As they have just been dug out they'd still be around in the area, and stacked relatively high on some of them. This lead to some easy actions on his part to topple much of the stack over, at least the top-most which would budge, and then begin digging out the remaining layer of soil with his shovel.

It'd take a lengthy amount of time, but all things considered it would be a lot faster that digging the hole would end up being, and in due time he'd be through with one stack and onto another. This continued at the same pace with Heiwa not stopping for too long inbetween sets. And indeed by the time he was finished the moon would be only directly overhead detailing to him that he had plenty of time for the next one.

Covered tightly with the remaining soil, it'd look obvious that at one point or another it was dug up into, but at the same time it'd appear capable enough at this point to withstand somebodies weight, and in due time it would grow to match the remaining soil around it. A job well done and quickly completed for Heiwa.

<All that leaves is..> His eyes returned to the spot that was marked by the construction crew. The dimensions were neatly scribbled about as well on a piece of paper they had in the main area detailing just how they wanted it dug. It was ultimately, like the hole from before, relatively small showing that it wasn't going to be too much work for the young Heiwa and he wasn't going to be unable to do it.

If anything it may be for a latrine or perhaps to set up some piping. Either way though, Heiwa would nod as he mentally made a diagram of the area to be digging, and then went to work with the shovel he still had in his hand. It'd be far slower than the filling process would have been, as Heiwa had to make sure it wasn't too large and that if he dug in it didn't end up spreading out and taking far more than he was anticipated.

When he was finally finished though, the sun would be shining, and the fresh new flock of construction workers would find themselves coming back in seeing the progress that the child had done. They'd reach down and help him back up to land, give him a pat on the back, and sign the mission scroll directly for him detailing that he'd done the jobs to their satisfaction. * - Fri Oct 30 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) stays behind then, waiting for her to craft the jutsu. When she did he'd pay careful attention of her actions, watching as the mist slowly began to rise from the nearest water source and spread out around them. It'd be relatively dense, but she could still be seen from where he was - it wasn't near complete for sure. Having been caught in the middle of one used by the Mizukage - he was well aware of just how potent it could be.

"It needs work," the child says, focusing in on the silhouette of the girl. "It's not dense enough."* - Fri Oct 30 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) watched as very slowly the girl infront of her would begin to grow more obscured for a couple brief moments. It'd increase the density of the jutsu while not lowering on the range, which was ultimately better than it having that drawback. However, quickly it began to fade, which detailed to him a few things about how taxing that really must be for her. 

"It's harder to see," he states, but quickly adds back up "I can still see you though."* - Fri Oct 30 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Over all that's better then. Which is good. - Fri Oct 30 12:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'll rest up and practice again. Mean while what are you practicing? - Fri Oct 30 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached down, pushing himself off of the sand to pick himself up. His head would be made facing towards the river infront of them, as his hands slowly raised up to be brought interlocked around his chest in the symbol of the tiger. "This," is all he said in response, slowly beginning to build up chakra as he rotated his hands through a set of six total seals.

His speed with hand seals definitely weren't the greatest, but they were passable by genin levels with the final six seal being made after a few seconds. Meanwhile, chakra would begin to mix and swirl around in a violent combination within his stomach before being transferred up his trachea on the creation of the final animal symbol. Heiwa's right hand raised up to meet with this motion, index and thumb being made to make a hole which he pressed against his mouth.

<Fire Style: Fireball jutsu!> The thought passed by his mind as the chakra finished its ascent and quickly streamed out of his mouth in a small ball of flames. It'd seem hardly finished or mastered of a technique, and even further would lack the full focused force that, for instance, Yumiko would likely carry in one of her own attacks. His chakra was strong, but his control with this element was near non-existant.

However, he'd nonetheless keep this stream up for some time, the drain not impacting him as much as many other jutsus might, before he finally stopped it and took a deep exhale out. It had seemingly grown somewhat larger since the last time he'd practiced it, but it was still far from being combat efficient or ready.* - Fri Oct 30 12:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) made his way into the flower shop, another order of roses needed to be picked up by the young child. From the note and the arrangement he could tell that it was likely from the very same man that he had delivered for a few days prior. And even was for the same woman. It seemed as if the man was harrassing the girl who simply didn't like him. 

However, Heiwa was being paid to deliver the flowers, and he didn't really care too much about their feud. There'd be a slight flash of his headband given to the girl behind the counter, alongside the note of delivery, and without much further complication he was given the roses and a strap to carry them along his back. 

<That makes one down,> Heiwa thought to himself, as he began making his way to his next stop - that of the post office. Two delivery missions in one day would make things relatively easy for the young child, as he wouldn't hardly have to do much work beyond picking them up and making the summon for another creature to deliver in his stead.

Following the same methods as the last time, the child gathers the scroll and a proper tying item, before finally bringing out a small, blackened edge of a kunai and bringing it to bare against his skin. His palm would lightly begin to shine crimson as he rubbed the liquid all around his digits, staining them with his body.

<Dragon's Requiem.> He runs through a series of five hand seals, interlocked rotations spurring his chakra outwards before finally slamming his palm down against the pavement. A plume of white smoke covers over him, before finally a black dragon spins up. No doubt it had seen the roses strapped around Heiwa, but even still it asked "Why have you summoned me?"

Its tone was not angered - just serious and wanting to get it done. "I need you to deliver this letter, and these flowers." The child states, and with the dragon's consent he begins to strap them around in areas where he could easily rip them off when he arrived at the places. Shortly thereafter the dragon left, and the child was free to work on the final mission.

Child steps made their way to the back to the flower shop, where the young Heiwa waited for the next couple of minutes. Eventually he found the familiar outline of the old lady making her way up the hill, which Heiwa moved forwards to help her with. He genuinely ended up enjoying parts of the last time he was with her.

She was a sweet little old lady, and she graciously thanked him for his aid, patting him on the shoulder as she did so. There'd be a small smirk finding its way past his face as he interlocked arms with her and they both entered into the floral shop. Like last time she kept things nice, and called for his help only when it was needed.

Things like grabbing some of the heavier items she was well aware that Heiwa couldn't do, so she asked for one of the assistants at the shop to help with it. Heiwa was if anything just there for company with the old lady, and she used this time to disclose further stories about the times of her youth.

In very short time at all, Heiwa and her and found themselves with all of the items they could carry, again enough for her alone to take if she needed to, and in turn she paid the lady behind the counter. Little to no fuss or problems were made in the entire situation with the mission being completed in near no time at all.

As they exitted he'd give his share back to the lady, and they'd disentangle their arms to allow both to leave. It was a short visit, but generally enjoyable for the both of them, and as Heiwa left he'd match with a calm wave of his own to her as she left.* - Sat Oct 31 15:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I am fine Kyubishu. - Sat Oct 31 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Anyone feel like training with me? - Sat Oct 31 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Training what? - Sat Oct 31 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Yeah, training. - Sat Oct 31 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: That didn't answer the question at all... - Sat Oct 31 16:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right..Kirie, can I get my missions? - Sat Oct 31 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) reached his hand up catching them missions. Nigga was persistent in that shit - his work even gave him enough of a callous to withstand said throw without breaking something.* - Sat Oct 31 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: May I get a mission, myself? - Sat Oct 31 17:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Right. - Sat Oct 31 17:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Stand back Kyubi. - Sun Nov  1 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Heiwa you too. - Sun Nov  1 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) bunched up alongside the rest of the people checking out the situation, the little nigga ending up only just behind the Mizukage and Elon. He couldn't see very much from his height, but the faint traces of blood could be definitely seen. * - Sun Nov  1 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Elon make sure the soldiers ser up a perimeter around the house. - Sun Nov  1 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) took a step back as ordered, still unsure of what had happened in this area - let alone the death that had occurred. Perhaps if he had seen it he might be more concerned, but at the moment all he had was some curiousity over what caused such damage. With both Elon and the Mizukage blocking his sight he'd follow to leave out of the farm house.* - Sun Nov  1 03:03:02 2015
