<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) || Though Hikaru was a little disappointed with the whole situation, he was still excited to see a match between two, what should be, seasoned Shinobi instead of a rookie Genin like himself. He followed the trio from the Hokage's mansion and went towards the Eastern side of the Village, heading North at the last turn to enter the training grounds which he visited so often.

The two older men bantered with one another, discussing fighting styles and whether or not they were going to go all out or just a simple spar. The pre-teen stood even footed, his arms folded as he watched the fight closely. Suddenly, the Lord Hokage appeared beside him, telling him to watch the match and to learn from it, probably hoping that he would get some sort of experience from it all.

While staring out into the field waiting for the match to start, heh would begin to weave handseals one at a time in a particular order. Snake, Sheep, Monkey, Pig, Horse, and Tiger. One would recognize these to be the handseals for the Fireball jutsu, something that the boy's parents worked hard on teaching him. Just then, the man whom he was supposed to fight suddenly vanished. Hikaru ceased his idle movements and stared in shock, wondering what happened to him.

He could have easily used the Shunshin technique and hid ni the nearby brush, that or he was truely invisible, amazing. It was now clear why the Hokage did not want the boy to fight him. Clearly, they were on two different levels.* - Wed Dec  2 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) wondered how the man would step up to the challenge of an invisible foe. There were not many options left when you look at it actually. He could always just throw items around blindly and hope that one of them hits him, or perhaps use a flash bang to pinpoint where the opponent is by using his own shadows? Maybe even throw out a sticky substance to snare the man if he ever got close.

And of course, all of the above options were discarded. Instead, as soon as the man was about to go invisible, the man, known as Z for now, weaved his own handseals and got to his knees. Hikaru watched him carefully, wondering what exactly was he going to do there. Just then, his own shadow extended forward and headed towards Osuda!* - Wed Dec  2 05:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) had just woken up recently, though it was a little late into the afternoon. He spent the entire night before flipping through scrolls on various jutsu, excited to embark on his journey through the ninja world. Having reently graduated from the Academy at the age of twelve, he was excited to get things rolling.

Now strolling through the northern part of the village he would stumble across a crowd of people. He noticed two of them having what looked like a private conversation, so he figured that he would move past them. He looked up to see a beautiful young lady, well, older looking than he was, but still young walking his way. For some reason she had a frown on his face. Sad to see that on such a pretty person right?

He strolled towards her with a smile. "Hey there! Why do you look like you're down? Are you alright?"* - Sat Dec  5 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I understand Paine - Sat Dec  5 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) cocked his head to the right a little, taking a step back as he did so. "Err..are you okay? You sound a little..annoyed.."* - Sat Dec  5 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Ouch . . . - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) scratched the back of his head at her reply. That was a little harsh for a kid just trying to help her out with some issues. Well, perhaps it was best that she was left alone? After all, company doesn't always help, especially that of a stranger. If Hikaru continued pushing from here it would probably just make him look like a creep anyway..

He looked back up to her, a slightly sad look on his face. "I'm sorry for bothering you..and also for whatever made you this upset.." He said as he turned around and got out of her way.* - Sat Dec  5 19:32:54 2015
