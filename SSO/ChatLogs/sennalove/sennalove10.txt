With a snap of the figures, she would have simply call for more sheets of paper to help her stop the two before they actually start something big in the open.

Using some to protect the Bryson and the girl so he could have healed her without worrying about some random crossfire, she quickly moved her papers between them body like a wall as if she was trying to stop them from continuing, "Oi, oi, spar's over, you two are taking it a little too far now."* - Sat Oct 24 06:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods slowly. Her plan today was to train her paper protection technique. Basically, what she wanted to do here was to actually protect herself from incoming problems much easier without much of a struggle. First thing was first, she need to master the technique or get a better understand. The moment the lad was about to attack, her paper quickly leave her school and twists around her-Waiting for him to.

With a leap back, the sheets quickly moves themselves in front of his attack, at least 10 sheets each to create a strong guard to simply block off his attacks or try to. If the papers were able to then for him, it would have felt like he was hitting something that was as hard as metal itself. Waiting on him to strike again, she calls for more sheets of paper around her back like a defensive formation.* - Sat Oct 24 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles at him, "Indeed however you're forgetting one important fact here, that's only 10, I can control over 10'000 sheets easily. Let's see how much stamina ya have.~". Of course she was not planning on attacking him or using any of her little binding techniques, she was only trying her new skill. Leaping back one more, she summons more paper as they keep on stacking on the guard he was trying to break over and over again by adding another hundred sheets to the mix.

"Makoto, I'll remember that, nice to meet you!", stating during the middle of her battle/training session.* - Sat Oct 24 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) eyes widen from pure surprise, she wasn't expecting that at all however, out of untainted reflex, she moves her hand to block thus causing more papers to protect her from his incoming gale palm as it hits her wall with a force, breaking more than half the wall's defensive. She already figures that she'll need to add another hundred sheets to the guard.

"Dammit..That had me trembling for a second."

Slapping her hands quickly, she simply summons another three hundred more papers to add to her wall at the same times, having the around she use as protection around her just in case she had to make a quick guard. During his assault, Ai simply keeps on adding more and more paper to the wall as if she was reinforcing it more and more.

"I heard! That's a good start! She'll be speaking english in no time!"* - Sat Oct 24 07:52:19 2015
