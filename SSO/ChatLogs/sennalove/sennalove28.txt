<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs loudly, her lover had left to train for the past three days and haven't return as yet. She wasn't going to worry her little head on it yet since she had a few scouts watching over her in the shadows while she was out. Since there wasn't much to do other than actually train her fire element so.

Since she was rather close in progress, might as well she finishes her training for today. She wanted her flames to be hotter than how they are now, string whenever they hit and so on. This was the way she planned on training herself. 
Crossing her hands, her eyes narrows done on the block she used to train.

Her clones where able to burn the card, burn the left, what was left was the paper and block so unquestionably she would have tackled such. Pressing her fingers on both ends, she shuts her eyes and channels as much chakra as she could into that one location as if she wanted to burn an hole in the middle.

She wasn't able to set ablaze but the center was slowly burning leaving an burnt black spot at that location. This was basically the same as the training session before. She assumes this means she wasn't strong enough to do this with materials like that so she had to think of another way to do such.

The item was thick so of course she couldn't have done such easily, she wasn't high tier to begin with-If this was the chase, she should have been able to break down houses if she had that kind of skill level. Sighing softly, she calls it a day and places the item on the table. She had enough control to burn a leaf and card that was as much training she needed from such.* - Sun Nov 29 18:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs softly at the girl's attempt. She didn't have to do much, only for her papers to quickly rise up and out of her scroll-Even if she was in her paper state, might as well she saves when it comes to sheets even if she can summon more. She doesn't know what she has to fight overtime. As the weapon soars towards the two, the paper would have quickly created a dense wall thus blocking the attack if it could!* - Mon Nov 30 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) appears however she wasn't walking, she was actually using her papers to make wings for her and fly across the land. With her, she had up to four butterfly scouts with her as they watched around her-It was like she was an overall battle jet at this point. Since she could have seen her targets, she quickly flaps her wings through launching around ten Kunai towards the ground in a homing matter! She attempts to injury them!

3 to the red hair and the blue hair but 4 to Paine. (All moving at 33.1 Jutsu Attack speed and 11 tiles)* - Mon Nov 30 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: D-Did ai shake the g-ground? - Mon Nov 30 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs again-Two places at once isn't as fun as it looks. Since the child was going for the flag, Ai would have quickly moved her papers towards the flag's recuse meaning the moment the child was able to take it, she would have realized that her hand hits a paper wall with a force. Base on her reaction, Act three might take place right away.* - Mon Nov 30 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "My only problem..Shit..", the moment her fire technique was drilling slowly through the paper, the child would have realized more gave to back up the wall-Keeping it strong and of course, double lay of defensives. Doing this moment, because Iza choose to keep on attack, she would have took note that some of the sheets would have quickly attempt to bind her joints, slowing her movements down and binding her afterwards. If that was successful then of course step two was next.* - Mon Nov 30 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head at Paine literally let her paper techniques close to her, the moment the Kunai was about to scratch her, the would have split apart and explode-Same for the Kunai she tried to kick. Even if she was holding back, all she wanted to do was weaken Paine enough so she could have snatched the flag quickly so of course she would have attempt to blow her up-Momu should have told her Ai's tricks.

(50 tags, 33 damage in total.)

While that was going on, she looks down, she realized the Worm was attacking the clone, "Nope, I need you..", swinging her wing towards the worm, she launched an long shuriken-At least five made from sheets as she attempts to cut the worm in half while at the same time, use the other shurikens to protect her comrade through paper guard if he didn't already protect himself.* - Mon Nov 30 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had her scouts around so she could have seen the girl's attack-just couldn't see her underground. The moment she flicks the weapons toward the two clone, Ai's wing would have flapped back creating two simply shurikens to intercept them-of course she wasn't planning on the girl dispelling them during something this big.

"Koji, handle Momu and the worm, I know you can do that without my assistance."

Having faith in the clone, Ai's body quickly breaks apart as they all took the plane sharp, Ai and her sheets that that-Paine was looking to twenty thousand sheet coming towards her like a sand storm filled with sharp planes and with an force so of course as she attempts to brush, cut and stick onto Paine's skin if they were successful. * - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) allows a few of the sheets to take the hit however Paine would have realized that she had kicked someone like a wall, and dense wall however since it was an paper storm, she attempts to blow through the girl, blowing her while attempting something undercover in the meanwhile-If Paine failed to realize then that's that.

In that meantime, the paper that blocked Paine's leg would have quickly spread along her leg, attempting to bind her as fast as possible. (Bind speed: 33 but blank points, Strength of the bind and guard, 60). During this little even, the ten throwing stars weren't able to do as much damage was she believe however it was progress for her-She did take out a few sheets but not much.* - Mon Nov 30 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was about time for her to fall back-She had also capture the flag-Since Paine was out of the picture, it was about time for her to get the hell out of here, "All I need..", her voice echoes through the land. The moment the wires attempt to hold down on the papers, Momura would have realized that the wires where slowly being cut by Ai creating spinning paper shurikens around the area

Once she was freed, all the sheets would have quickly head off except for the sheet she binded Paine with at full speed out of there before her body reform and the scouts continues to watch around her while following her.

Was this Ai's win?* - Mon Nov 30 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ears twitched however the kick the girl attempt didn't seem to affect her at all since she was using paper guard with her chest-She sheets used to build up her chest before using cloth bind to finish the job with this one, "I like your will, it's cute however know when ya defeated hun.", she mutters.

Now she had to protect herself and whoever she could save. Like the blink of an eye, the papers quickly moved creating a large wall protecting herself, Momu and Koji behind of her-For her teammate, she was too close for her to save her from the hell, "Tsk..You should have fall back the moment you couldn't handle anymore...You're too close for me to save you.."* - Mon Nov 30 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmm.... - Tue Dec  1 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hmmm?~ - Tue Dec  1 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  1 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sweeps her up! Ai wasn't the strongest of them all but at least, she could have lift her lover..Right? "As you wish Ma'am.". Turning towards the door, she made her way to the bedroom with the Hyuuga only to place her down on the bed and join her shortly after removing all her gears! * - Tue Dec  1 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) raises an eye brow at that. She wanted to test something; turning her body towards the female, Ai coils her hands around her as it seems that she was hugging her from behind--Embracing her tightly. While doing so, she nuzzles her nose into the girl's shoulders.* - Tue Dec  1 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) kisses her neck then adds, "You need to loosen up a little. Whatever ya thinking about that's stressing you undercover, ya should get ya mind off of it and if it's too much for that, you can always tell me, I'll see how I can help,~", she whispers.* - Tue Dec  1 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles, "Oh really now.~", leaning her head a little, she rests her chin gentling on crown of her head, "Well, It seems Momu and Han are getting married but it's a private wedding.". This brings back so many memories on Ai's end though she didn't say. Instead, she pulls the girl in the girl much closer!* - Tue Dec  1 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) raises an eye brow, "Fever or Lewd things?", she asked-She did say she was cold before she Ai was worried about that. Flipping the girl so Mizora would have been lying on top of her now, she then proceeds slides her finger across the girl's cheek.* - Tue Dec  1 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) closes her eyes, she couldn't really understand her too well but already getting her answer, she goes on to ask anyway, "And what's stopping you from performing such lewd things?"* - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I.... um.... - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mm? - Tue Dec  1 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) felt Mizora's lip against her thus popping her eyes open, lowering the lids the moment she heard Mizora's words, she accepts her kiss. Shortly after she breaks and whispers, "Relax, we'll get through this together.~". Certainly, she was trying to comfort her. Leaving the clothes removal to the girl, she rests her palms against the bed so she could have summoned up some pills.

"Take one.~"* - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) joins her lover as she also strips off her clothes. From her pants to her fish net undershirt, she didn't stop until she was completely naked. Displaying her whitish thin curvy-body, something that Mizora have seen before. She giggles lightly during the girl's hug then mutters, "Ready? On your back and spread your legs, don't worry, I'll be gentle with my little flower.". Ai have saw her body before-Many times so she was praying that she wasn't too nervous to show her.* - Tue Dec  1 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few, this wasn't really the position she asked for but it could work-Might be a lot more work but still could work. Ai clutches of the girl's cheeks a'fore moving her head down enough so she could have licked the lips of the girl's beloved treasure. She didn't plot on doing anything without warming her up.

Descending her tongue, she laps around her treasure and clit until her tongue pursuits inside of her lover.

"Need you wet before I can do it, it'll be easier since you'll be really tight."* - Tue Dec  1 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smirks, it seems the white and Black Hyuuga was enjoying the same thing she was afraid of. Now she'll see why Ketsuki was addictive to it, "Wet enough..Time for the showcase.~". Already hard, Ai's thick, long meat stick twitches eagerly; taking position, she rest her hands against the girl's back.

"This is going to hurt a little since I'll have to rip through it..The thing that ya'll consider your virginity...Bear the pain a little, it gets much better after that."

With the warning, her hand glides down to clasp on to the girl's hip then move the meat stick in place. Teasing her a little by rubbing it against her lips, she slips it inside gradually but surely until she officially took the girl's virginity.* - Tue Dec  1 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) black screens the rest for now; finish this another day---Low on time.* - Tue Dec  1 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) lays on her back, Ai didn't have the energy left to even move her fingers from that session.

"I..Love you..Mizora.."* - Tue Dec  1 05:25:32 2015
