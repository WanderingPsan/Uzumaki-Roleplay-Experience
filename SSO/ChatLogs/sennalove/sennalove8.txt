<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) follows them both however she wasn't rushing to meet this fellow. Yawning loudly, the figure eyes slowly shifts towards Koji-She could only assume that he have never seen her fight before or use her techniques out in the open before. Not really way to spoil the fun as yet, she smiles and respond with.

"Manipulation---Long range."

Indeed, she couldn't fight up front nevertheless she wasn't a newbie when it comes to fighting. Once the figure arrives to the gate to meet the person she was supposed to assist with the escort, the first thing she did was move away from him just in case, "Not today motherfucker....", she mutters softly.* - Wed Oct 21 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||During the trip, she was playing with her sheet of paper-Literally making a paper bird then paper weapons then paper figure; it was clear that she was bored judging by her actions. This was supposed to be a simple mission-The fact that she had completed two A rank mission before, this shouldn't be as bad as fighting an oversize worm that is almost as big as Suna.

Coming to a sudden pause, her eyes shifts around while her ears twitch to what her squad leader had to say. This wasn't much of her problem for her yet she didn't want to kill anyone-She was only fine with hurting them-Completely trying her best to ignore the fact they can die from bleeding out or her hurting them too badly.

Pointing her fingers forward as sheets of paper arise from her scroll-literally wrapping themselves out of it and swirls wildly around her. The amount of sheets seem to be something along the lines of two thousand or even three thousand, that won't be close to the amount she would have been able to control at the time.

"I'll just do this..You guys kill them if you want...It's beyond my nature."

Flicking her hands outwards, half of the papers suddenly takes the forms of shuikens-That's right, that was a lot of them, more likely over one hundred created at per say time with a few tags implanted with the paper. The woman didn't have them attack the bandits at one direction, she doesn't see the fun in that, instead, she points her fingers upwards allowing the paper shuirkens to take it to the skys, some from the sides and rain them down on the bandit's location-Attempting to lock them down from all location if possible, if she was lucky enough to hit them THEN she would have turn her head away-Take the bitter pill and trigger the tags causing a chain of explosion---Don't forget that she still had half of that amount around her at the moment so certainly she would have used them as wide defends.* - Wed Oct 21 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs as she was a little irritated that they keep popping up through at least the big dog was with them. Taking her sweet little time, she walks towards the new group with her paper whirls around her but at the same time; she calls up more from the scroll. Yawning loudly, she already knows exactly how she was going to fight this man. The plan was simple for her, all she had to do was be a bait, "Oi guys..Take care of the other bandit..I'll handle the main star....". Now giving the head man all her attention, her eyes narrows down on the figure while she keeps on strolling towards him without a care in the world.

"Oh, ya little shit, I'm the one you'll be fighting, come at me if you want to die or ya telling me ya afraid of getting your ass handed to you by a little girl, no?~"

All the figure truly wanted to do was to annoy the hate out of him until he attacks her. If she was successful then she would have harden the papers around her to match the quality of metals. Having the man charge at her with all his might, she simply flicks her wrist, allowing the papers to expand around her. Allowing him to run through her paper cloud of protection, she herself moves back and allow the papers to do their jobs. During the time he was running, he would have realized that he sudden slowing down as if something was binding them.

To his surprise, he was slowly being held by the girl and her paper binding technique. It was rather clear he screwed up one he charged in at her without actually knowing her full on techniques. Using most the papers around, she quickly binds from him head to toe tightly, trying to hold from down from struggling free from her hold. It was clearly she was putting a lot of pressure on the head.

Once he had stopped struggling, the assassin was just assassinated. She didn't like to kill however she understands this was a dog eat dog world. Once she made sure that he was not breathing-indeed, she suffocated him. The papers around his body suddenly remove themselves off his remains, dropping him on the floor like a wild animal. 

Glazing back at the others, she believes they had the six bandits under control since they were still low level bandits after all. Flicking her fingers back as if she was calling her papers, she sighs softly at what she has done today. Allowing most of the sheets to return back into there container, she waits on the others to finish their part.

Breathing a little easy, this mission was not as hard as she believe it would have been. Better yet, this mission was easier than the A ranks she was given back in the day. Tilting her head at the others, the figure would have simply had her sheets of paper protect her from any incoming surprise attacks. Waiting on them, she made a small comment to lighten the mood-That or to free herself from the heavy weights on her shoulders.
