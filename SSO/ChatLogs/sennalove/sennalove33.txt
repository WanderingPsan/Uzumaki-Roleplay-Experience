<br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Fri Dec 11 21:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: That explains why people are complaining about the things in this village. - Fri Dec 11 21:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Such as Necros. - Fri Dec 11 21:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) understands her situation now however she has no reason to kill herself over such. Sure, she understands but she has also been around Hassan long enough to know how to be carefree from time to time. Hipping off the desk, the paper work started flows up into the air before bending and creating flowers of all kind.

One lands into the girl's hair while the others rest against the table, "I never say give up but don't say you won't die soon, anything can happen.", she knows that well since she almost died already. Walking behind of the girl, she decided she was going to be that big sister figure-Hassan figure and hug the girl from behind.

"I can under though what I'm telling you is simple, be more dependent and stop letting people bend you over. Simple as that. Do what Hassan did and accept as much people into your village to assist with the power growth however make sure you are always on top of the food chain. You should then focus on the rumors, kill them off before it gets worse on the village."* - Fri Dec 11 22:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Paper?... - Fri Dec 11 22:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Fri Dec 11 22:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs softly-Safe to say she already knows of this problem and the fact that she also knows of the additional person in the room though the only reason she would be worried would be because Rias was also among them. Apart from that, Ai had no reason to even think about that person at all.

Tightening the hug her sake in case she needs to do use any kind of protection while at the sametime, using that to assist with comforting, she goes on to whisper, "Rias, I understand kid. I've been through more than you think. The reason why is simple, they don't want you to overreact to it as believing they can handle it their self while at the same time, end up creating rumors. As far as it goes, they're doing it for your own safety. I'm not a member of this village though I am an ally and a friend, I can't tell you how to run your village yet I can give you tips, what tip I can give is limited however one is simple, don't stress yourself over it too much as how you're doing now, you have rankings, let them handle such before you do."

Ai's leading skills were up there after all. Using whatever free hand she had, she proceed to stroke her finger through the girl's head for comfort, "You shouldn't keep your emotions locked away as well. Cry if you want to, scream, hit the wall, let it all out kid.", certainly Ai didn't mean if she wanted to release it on her since she could have 'edit' her body to endure it.* - Fri Dec 11 22:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If I couldn't finish a bit of paperwork, what kind of jounin would I be? - Fri Dec 11 22:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Snooping into the activities of a necromancer could be detrimental..to my goals. - Fri Dec 11 22:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) snaps her fingers as the flowers disassemble themselves back into the paper work before stacking up on each other-Indeed, they were moving on their own.

"You don't have to worry as well. I'm her old friend and also was an member of the land of fire.". Her eyes were enough to tell them that.

Sweeping up the Hokage, she place her on her shoulders before she gets ready to head out, "We'll be back soon. Everyone earns a little rest now and then.". As an scout of her level, she knows what happens when you don't rest.* - Fri Dec 11 22:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Land of fire =/= Konoha -Omit- - Fri Dec 11 22:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sits her down as the real Ai sets up the protection tags outside before entering--Dispeling the clone so she could have obtain what had happen.* - Fri Dec 11 22:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) appears to the scene--In the shadows like an scout-Two Ai? The hell? However she didn't do anything as yet, more or less, watch him and waits on him to enter the build. Once he was inside, he would have realized that the Ai that was with the Hokage suddenly dispel then incomes the Ai that had arrive after she sets her tags around the building.* - Fri Dec 11 23:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pokes her side to get her attention. She was currently in big sister mode again. Guiding her woman's head into her lap, she removed the hat and whispers to her softly, "You need to relax. You're not at work at the moment are you? On come, order anything, I'll be on me.". Certainly, she had a lot of work ahead of her before she resumes her mission.* - Fri Dec 11 23:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) heard the announcement ringing in her ear-now she knows what she will be doing after she returns home. For the time being, she prepares the order-Eh..Not sure but Rias won't be feeling anything that much?-Back on topic. Ordering the tea and the bottle of water, she looks down on the kage then whispers.

She already know of the man in the room-He wasn't doing a good job at his work if she knows of her presents. Gliding her finger through the woman's hair, she looks down on her then whispers again! Certainly she remains her of her daughter whenever she's sleepy and doesn't want to admit it.* - Fri Dec 11 23:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: You need to relax kid, I know work is on your mind. Ya gonna look years older than you should if you let this get to you. - Fri Dec 11 23:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Besides, I'm not the type of person you would want to be around stressing about something you're currently not at. - Fri Dec 11 23:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: What am I going to dooooo I need Hassan to guide me... - Fri Dec 11 23:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blushes lightly at her action--Like..That was unexpected to Ai--She knows her body was almost exact to an female's but this was just an sudden to her since noone had did that before. Whispering back something, she gave off a gentle smile.* - Fri Dec 11 23:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: You don't need him to guide you sweetie. - Fri Dec 11 23:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: His style of leading won't work for any or everyone you know. - Fri Dec 11 23:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: I know... ill never lie up to his expectaions - Fri Dec 11 23:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: Im just a failure... - Fri Dec 11 23:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though, if she just stays here, crying. Not really doing much, the villagers will continue to speak. - Sat Dec 12 00:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I always hated this, *sigh* OH!!!!!!! THEY HAVE APPLE ROOT TEA TODAY?! - Sat Dec 12 00:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm still a guy you know so nuzzling like that won't be helping me as much as you think and you don't have to live up to his expectation - Sat Dec 12 00:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: As long as your able to run the village correctly, he would be proud. - Sat Dec 12 00:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pokes her noses playfully--She didn't want to leave her comrade in such an depressing state.* - Sat Dec 12 00:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: I hope you are right - Sat Dec 12 00:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles lightly, at least she was making a little progress, from what she understands, the girl was just trying to live up to someone by using their method however such a thing doesn't work on people at all. For the order, the tea, water included with a few dumplings, spicy raman and the ice cream as an special. There was no billing as the owner himself delivered it.

To Ai's understanding, this was the meal she had with Ketsuki back in the day-Well some of the dish. Now that she understands, this was his way of telling her welcome back without charging her for anything since she did spend big the last time she was here. Whispering to the kage, she attempts to feed the woman some ice cream since she wanted to remain in her lap.

"Open up."* - Sat Dec 12 00:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I know I'm right, I'm Ai after all, I'm rarely wrong. For now, try to take your mind off work and enjoy yourself. - Sat Dec 12 00:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: After this, I'll carry you to do something you'll like to do other than work. - Sat Dec 12 00:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: Well I will try my best to do what I can to better this village. And the only way I can do that  is to do everything in my power - Sat Dec 12 00:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles at her reaction, at least she was smiling again, right? This was what they call..Progress? Feeding her more ice cream unless she didn't want anymore, she tilts her head to the side then whispers something else to her. Really, this was quite a good chill day for both of them since they were enjoying themselves.

She didn't have to worry about the others so everything was well for her.* - Sat Dec 12 00:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Indeed, like I said, I'm your friend, don't be afraid to call upon me. - Sat Dec 12 00:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) removes her shoe and white suit leaving her in a tight sleeveless turtle neck undershirt and her mid-night black jeans. Catching her hair up in a ponytail, her feminine body reveals were at its peck at this moment as she lays down. Using her hands as pillows, she looks up into the sky while still scouting the area with her sense.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) notes for all who just arrives, Ai was wearing a tight turtle neck sleeveless shirt that shows off her curves, a long black pants and her hair in a ponytail. Her extra clothes and her scroll were resting beside of her. She was thinking about it then it came to her. Paper and water ain't the best of friend even if it won't affect her as much.

Shaking her head, she remains dry and on land then whispers a few more things.* - Sat Dec 12 03:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs-Seems like Rias was some kind of rape victim, everyone seems to be stalking her-It's almost like she's on the hitlist. Sighing softly once again, girl was currently sleeping while Ai was able to head off until Kana entered. Already knowing she was following, she goes on to say, "Hello, it's been a while. I'm assuming ya stalking Rias too uh?"* - Sat Dec 12 04:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't know how to answer that one since she haven't visited the cat as much due to Zeno being sic-I mean things around her keeping her too active. Shrugging her shoulders, she sits beside of the sleeping girl then answered with, "I haven't talked with it in a while really, I plan to really soon however."

Striking her finger through the girl's hair, she goes on to say, "What about you? How are things with you and yours?"* - Sat Dec 12 04:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few at what Kana had to show. Believe it or not, she didn't really trust what she was seeing. Even if them and their beast were at good conditions, she didn't really like the idea of her using this-THAN stand in front of her. This is a just in case situation as she used her technique to trigger her dance however she didn't make it too obvious that her body was now paper.

Since nothing has changed in her appearance; only her chakra, she looks on the girl then tilts her head, "Eh, ya can put that away now, it's a little intimidating since I can sense and all..", certainly that chakra level was alot more than she expected it to be leaving Ai worried-If it was Ai alone, she would have been chilled however it was Ai and the sleeping baggage.

"Beside, why are you here anyway?"  * - Sat Dec 12 05:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs softly, what a situation she have gotten herself into-This will be the last time she listens to someone that wants to do something outside...In the damn open. However since they were inside, Ai dropped the barrier and used the sheets that made the tags as paper scouts to alert the Konoha forces of this quickly in the meantime Kana tries to win Rias over.

She could hold her own against Kana if it was a one on one however in this case; she had the secondary female character problems in her hand at the moment. She didn't believe she has the power to protect the girl in a situation like this since Kana was also using the tail's chakra around her.

"Tell me..Why do you want the girl so badly? What did she do?"* - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) already picked up on the chakra the moment she was about to release the technique, "Fuck..". Quickly using her guard the same time she executed the technique, she already knows that it won't be enough to stop it but will be enough to break the force of the attack, weakening heavily and at least give her enough time to react via her body.

Since she was protecting the Hokage who was sleeping, she didn't know if she could have handle the pressure as well but just in case, Ai quickly covered her and used her paper body to protect her from as much force as possible. It would be nice if at least one of the shinobis that was stalking Rias from before to show up.

She wasn't sure if it would be enough to keep Rias safe or if the force will still be enough to break the walls however she knows for sure that the village would have already figure out that shit was going south REAL quick, "Jesus...I'm too old for this shit..Hurry up and handle your problem Konoha....", she thought to herself.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was successfully able to protect Rias. She was rather tired as well as it seems the damage did its toll on Ai's paper body. She could have fought Kana but the question is, how long could she hold out against Kana since she was able to control her beast better than Ai. Making sure that her paper body was still together, she quickly uses her sheets to create wings of paper and of course, carry Rias on a platform with her.

Taking it to the sky, she was literally ready to dip-She had too many baggage to on her, too much-More or less, an important baggage, "Jesus Rias...You're lucky I didn't leave ya so soon..", looking back to see that form..Her eyes widen as the memories of Jiki races through her head-she still didn't know if it was him or the second person Sanoke claim to seal it into.

She already figures out his plan to stall long enough for her to escape with the kage-She did just that. Quickly flying off, she keeps a paper scout around her just in case while at the same time, leaving the lad with a clone to assist him and also assist with her escape. Keeping her eyes on the battle field while she leaves, she heads off to go knows where.

The clones weren't as strong as the main though they handle themselves well enough until Ai was out of range. Quickly using Ai's dance technique, they stand as a wall while Ai heads off.* - Sat Dec 12 07:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Mmhm. She's only there until she's awake again but if my wife doesn't like the idea of her staying there, I'll move her to another house. - Sat Dec 12 19:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: She's just.. promiscuous... that's the least negative term I could use to describe her. - Sat Dec 12 19:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I see. - Sat Dec 12 19:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: She did change a little over the years though but it's up to you sweetie, should I move her or left her stay until she's awake? - Sat Dec 12 19:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: I'd prefer if you moved her to somewhere other than our home... I don't want someone like that around our kid.. - Sat Dec 12 19:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 19:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Thank you. - Sat Dec 12 19:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Let's go. - Sat Dec 12 19:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Yeah. - Sat Dec 12 19:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmmm... - Sat Dec 12 20:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? - Sat Dec 12 20:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few as this was also unexpected, lightening up, she release all tension in her body so she could have enjoyed the moment with her wife. Certainly she flinches from the tight hug since it was also hurting her though she endures it nor did she let her wife know that it actually hurts. 

Embracing her, she nuzzles into her chest and enjoys the peaceful moment. She could have understand it of course, Ai was gone for two years in total-The fact stands that her mission wasn't even over as yet, she had to leave it due to the situation with Kana and Rias. Surely she is glad to be alive to see her wife and daughter again.* - Sat Dec 12 20:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) breaths out! She didn't know how long she could have endured it for. Ai's hands slides down and about the girl's frames the second she settled down. Sighing softly, she smiles at her remarks though reddens slightly at the greetings before the kiss. She didn't resist her at all, better yet; contribute with her part of the kiss.

She wasn't going to lie; she missed her family a lot over the years. This was just a breath of fresh air. Returning as much compassion in the kiss before they break, she grins brightly and finally answered with, "Thank you..~". Leaning forward, she buried her head into Mizora's body-Any part torso wise and mutters, "I'm finally home.."* - Sat Dec 12 20:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) notice she hasn't seen the little one as yet-assuming she was around when Ai was in bed recovering from the damage. From what she remembers Mizora did say she was doing fine so all that's left was for her to return home or wake up to see her father up on her feet again. Nestling a little, she goes on to ask, "Ketsuki is still sleeping? Or did she started school?"* - Sat Dec 12 21:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: She's started school. - Sat Dec 12 21:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? How old is she now? - Sat Dec 12 21:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll have to give her a gift for the birthdays I miss'd. - Sat Dec 12 21:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Four. Almost five. - Sat Dec 12 21:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Sat Dec 12 21:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She's a big girl now. - Sat Dec 12 21:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm... she asked if she could go out more on her own. She's still too young. - Sat Dec 12 21:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Go out more on her own? - Sat Dec 12 21:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm... around the village. - Sat Dec 12 21:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh... - Sat Dec 12 21:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I really.. - Sat Dec 12 21:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Don't like the fact that she'll be around Suna by herself. - Sat Dec 12 21:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Me neither, that's why I told her to wait until she's older. - Sat Dec 12 21:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not when she's older, when she can defend herself. - Sat Dec 12 21:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mmm.... - Sat Dec 12 21:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: That's even more important. - Sat Dec 12 21:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I'll try to teach her the Kage Bunshin... so in the very least she can learn things from people and have clones relay the knowledge of the jutsu to her. - Sat Dec 12 21:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeah, whenever she can handle it though. - Sat Dec 12 21:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Sat Dec 12 21:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I need to learn more Ninjutsu now that I'm better at it. - Sat Dec 12 21:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Sat Dec 12 21:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) bites her chest playfully.* - Sat Dec 12 21:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Sorry.~ - Sat Dec 12 22:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: It's okay... - Sat Dec 12 22:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Oh come on.~ - Sat Dec 12 22:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: Hm..? - Sat Dec 12 22:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: You're not mad are you? - Sat Dec 12 22:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: I'm not.. why would I? - Sat Dec 12 22:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: The bite? - Sat Dec 12 22:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) whispers: It didn't hurt.. that much. - Sat Dec 12 22:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmm..~ - Sat Dec 12 22:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nyaaa...~ - Sat Dec 12 22:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had no reason to resist her. Ai moved into position however she made sure that she didn't hurt herself or her lover. Now that she was ontop of her, she proceeds to kiss her neck gently, "Mmm..~"* - Sat Dec 12 22:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) figures that much, it has been years haven't it? Ai wouldn't mind Netflix and chill at the moment, the only problem was that Ai won't be able to do much with her body condition in way it is now. Already know as much about her lover's body, as much as she wanted to grind her chest against her, that problem would be hell for Ai so instead, she used her free hand to play the part. Taking her time, she calmly massages her chest while still kissing her neck-sucking on one spot.* - Sat Dec 12 22:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves her knee in place nevertheless she squeaks a few from desire. The girl mining nails into her back wasn't truly hurting Ai, as long as she didn't pressure her, she'll be fine. Once everything was in place, Ai arches her back so her knee would be able to grind against the girl's special spot between her legs. Keeping the chest massage and neck sucking going, she made sure that her free hand and leg was used as a support in case.* - Sat Dec 12 23:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles lightly at her remarks; Good to know she was enjoying herself. Ai didn't know how long she could have kept it up without lust taking the wheel so instead of 'diving in', she breaks from her neck-If the area was Red or not, move her knee aside and removes her hands, thus laying down on Mizora once more. She whispers softly, "If you want more, you'll have to be the one to take the lead since little old Ai here isn't in the best condition.~"* - Sat Dec 12 23:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles at her first statement-she was right on that one, if Ai didn't fear Mizora's lusting out on her, she was have resumes. Resting up a little, she never knew taking damage could have destroyed someone's everyday life this badly. Closing her eyes, she whispers in return, "I love you too sweetie.~", before adding in a mumble, "Sorry I was careless...I guess I got rusty since this isn't war days anymore....Leading to this..And sorry for taking so long..I know you must have been worrying a lot about my safety..". Things she wanted to get off her chest, she didn't know how she was going to do it from before but she believes now would be the best time.

"I'm really sorry.."* - Sun Dec 13 00:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) eyes widen from her wife's reaction then comes the light nod-She won't say one piece but she was alive at the end of the day. Indeed, she was doing her job to keep the peace for her daughter even if it was killing her slowly but as long as her child can live in peace, it doesn't matter. She did say she would want a child whenever she believes she can protect them, now that she has that kind of power, might as well enjoy life and her family.

She had nothing to say, only the redness of her face and timid yet honest smile were all the words she needed to explain her feeling. Burying her head into the girl's pillows softly, she proceeds to whispers, "I..-REALLY- love you....You're one of a kind..~".* - Sun Dec 13 00:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmm..~ - Sun Dec 13 00:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I've been meaning to ask, do you know if the internal damage'll be permanent..? - Sun Dec 13 00:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shooks her head no.* - Sun Dec 13 00:54:33 2015
