<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had already finish her meal since this was the first of the day however the Chef point his nose towards the girl leaving-He already knew the kind of person Ai was before though it has been a while since she was in this village, enough time for her to completely change. Sighing loudly, she goes on to ask the leaving girl.

"I know ya uptight and all but walking around with such an expression isn't good for ya health you know.."

She said as if she was speaking from complete experience.* - Fri Dec  4 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks at that-Why did the girl remind her of herself so much-Was this a female version of Ai? Ai only recently started to put aside her hatred for people due to Mizora. Nodding at the fella, Ai sighs loudly, she turns in her seat and cross her legs. Her happy-ish emotion suddenly drop into an blank expression right after she heard that.

"I can relate however is there an reason why you dislike people?"* - Fri Dec  4 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "You sound like Mizora during her depressing times, you even have the same eyes as her.", she said-She didn't want to say she sounds like her back in the day however she knows how to handle people like this. Leaning back, she goes on to ask her, "So tell me, you want to avoid them and all, I'm assuming you don't care about family nor do you want friends...As much as it sounds cheap, Friends and Family are something that's important you know. I can understand ya you hate people..I was actually like that once..Will, still like that to an extent. I hate humans, I hate myself..Well, except one person who changed my mind towards them but at this rate, you might be assuming why I'm even doing this if I hate human....Well, as someone that have fallen to the murderer point, I rather not see someone else join me down here."

Indeed, if someone was about to die and Ai could have stopped it, unless she feels like it, they person is dead.* - Fri Dec  4 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shrugs her shoulder-She tried. She did try to care a little but it seems it wasn't her strongest suit anymore. Sighing softly, her black eyes shifts towards the fella behind of her as she turns in her seat, "Good luck and all, can't say I didn't try.". Returning to the chef, she waits on the next order and her 'next order'.* - Fri Dec  4 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: More people. . . - Fri Dec  4 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hi. - Sat Dec  5 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wanted to train a little more when it comes to mediation since she wanted an better understanding with it. She wasn't going to visit the breast today, just control her breathing while she waits on Mizora. Sighing softly, she took a seat on the ground then crossed her legs. She sets her hands in position and started to mediate.

All the hatred and emotion that was on her mind faded away as she was in her own world. This was merely training for her; she wanted to be able to talk with that beast easier through meditation that used so many pressures on focusing and channeling her energy towards the beast's chakra.

Channeling her chakra throughout her entire body, she relaxed herself and block out all noise around her. This was what Ai considered a relaxing day before the storm. She still had the Chuunin exam to do and she still wants to talk with Nibi on her way to Suna. What better way than to train her block out skills.

Finally coming to a stop, Ai picks herself up after breaking her own concentration. It was time for her to head out since this was literally the last hour she heard left in this village. Her days where up meaning it was time for her to head back to her village for that exam, "I kinda want one more before I go..Oh well.."* - Sat Dec  5 00:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs. This was something she couldn't have avoided-That and this Arena 'Seems' to be working against her while at the same time, was in her favor, "Great..Oil..Bryson..You might need to heal one of us..", she mutters. Only a few knows Ai's full power when she starts to rely on everything she has.

She actually wants to give the girl the win but she also wants to test the girl's strength to see if she's worth doing it for. This was an simple task, all she wanted to do was to see how exactly she would have handle an situation that includes an Target that's almost impossible to hit.

"Alright, I want to see something, I'll test you, if you pass my test, you'll move on. Show your moves."

The moment they started them off, Ai's body broke apart as she spreads into god knows how many sheets of paper alongside the amount of sheets in her scroll-A lot of damn sheets. Her torso, arm and head reappear in the sky with a good amount of sheets around her while the others spreads-She wasn't too high or not too low.

A snapping sound was heard as she created up to fight paper shurikens. Her eyes locked onto the girl as she fires them towards her at full speed with an homing motion, this was to see how she would have handle a situation like her-Momu already know, can she figure it out? She attempts to strike the girl with the fast spinning shurikens!* - Sat Dec  5 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "Don't get too cocky..", before the girl knows it, the shurikens scatters into sheets of paper (50 sheets)-Well back to normal that the moment they were at their closest point to the girl-This was an attempt on surprise attack. This was a  simply attempt to bind the girl before this match could have dragged on too much. (Same attack speed)(65 bind strength against Tai+str)

For the shurikens she throw towards Ai, her paper moved in the way-Not even using paper guard, this was an simple display of her speeds as it seems they weren't able to pass through two sheets each.(35 dur sheets) If the bind was successful then Ai would have simply stare down on the girl and wait to see how exactly she was going to escape it without hurting herself.* - Sat Dec  5 02:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few, she couldn't understand if the girl was insane or really wanted to lose the match. She assumes she wanted to win the match in style-All the bullshit lies she could have convinces herself to. The moment the girl was about to hit the paper, she would have realized that it was much more dense than it looks-It was like hitting a wall. 

The moment she did so, she withdraw her sheets from the area during the girl's charge and reveal something important-Ai also uses tags mainly as an tool for damage apart from her normal paper weaponary. Triggering them right away, she attempts to blow the girl back-At least do some damage against her without actually killing her. (5 tags, 35 damage each)* - Sat Dec  5 03:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) raises an eye brow. She wanted to try something but it seems the girl was playing a game of tag. Even if Ai was holding back a lot, she wanted to see how well she could have hold her own without Ai feeling as if she needs to end this. Literally haven't had much problems the entire time, she quickly removes all her sheets from in front of her and away from the show case.

With this, she quickly races off a few hand seals, "I wanted to try this in combat so might as well.". With this, she fires an round of fire balls towards the girl (17.5 AS and same 65 damage-Around three of them), as she attempts to hit and burn her if she could but this was also an endurance time to see how long she could fight without breaking.* - Sat Dec  5 03:26:04 2015

Quickly reforming her body after completely blocking off the girl's attack once again, Ai literally used Shunshin to get her girl then dipped from the area. 

Before doing so, she created a three clones to assist whoever needs assistance during the big event-For who can't run fast enough that is.* - Sat Dec  5 03:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few though she didn't complain, she enjoyed Mizora's breast after all through the moment she placed her hands on her rear, she would have realized that Ai's rear was almost as large as hers-This arises so much more questions, "Yeah, I always believe I was supposed to be a boy but god decided to change my main gender organs at the last minute."* - Sat Dec  5 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) closes her eyes-She was obviously appreciating the girl's natural pillows-She didn't consider it was the best of both worlds since she still thinks she's a subject to rape if she lacks her chakra to secure herself with; her face and voice could essentially get her killed. Remembering something she swore, she whispers, "Didn't I owe you some sex while we were in Konoha?"* - Sat Dec  5 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles at her comment-Kinda funny how she took the words right out of Ai's mouth, "Cute.~". She was also comfy, the only way she would have moved if she realized that her lover was uncomfortable with such. Closing her eyes, she literally fades off to the dream world within a few moments.* - Sat Dec  5 06:18:27 2015
