<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) heads off--Mission time.* - Sat Oct 31 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) decides she was going to stop home and learn this jutsu before anything. Before, she was able to learn the shadow clone jutsu before without much problem, now it was time for her to learn this jutsu before she goes into that mission. Quickly arriving home, she removes her back scroll and of course her coat. 

This was a fire jutsu so she didn't need anything that could have set ablaze easily. First thing was first, she head into her room so she could have read per say jutsu scroll. Removing the locks on the scroll, she rests it on the table before rolling it out. She slowly flicks on the reading light so she could have seen the writing.

Since this was a fire jutsu, she had to read it with an open mind as if she plans on to use something like fireball as a mental example. Resting though it, she realized that this technique wasn't as hard as she believe it would have been though yet she didn't want to jump the guns, not yet at the very least.

Arriving to the middle area of the scroll, she took a short break to drink down some water. As far as she knows, this jutsu was rather similar to the fire ball technique in the end, only a variable version of it but using what she had learn from the shadow clone scroll, she understands that this could be a little harder.

Taking her little time, she walks back over to the desk. She had to hurry and finish this so she could have finished her mission and collect another scroll from her sensei before leaves again. As much mission and scrolls was possible would be great for her to gain more power to assist the village.

She already knew the power Edge holds from the fight she watched him with him the Kage before Hassan yet she seems calm apart from the mental pressure she was battling. She only hopes she will survive this incoming war, at least to an extend so she could see her kids grow up one day or enjoy the moments with her soon to be wife.

Returning to the scroll, she reads through everything slowly then read it back over just in case she missed something but in her case, she would have more likely overlook it. This technique seems like something she wouldn't find herself using often though it wasn't something she couldn't set up during a battle.

It was a good thing she trains her hand seal even if she barely used them just in case she needed to use fireball jutsu during a struggle to remove something or anything along that line to be more exact. She did need her fire training yet she was learning techniques like fireball without per say training.

This was a good way to train her shadow clone since it would have been training and learning at the same time; nothing that would have actually kill her. Second thing was second; she moves this little training outside since she didn't want to burn down her house while training this technique at all.

Creating up to two clones to accompany her, she strolls outside of the build and over the walls with her clone. It was quite clear that she plans on using a rock outside the village to try out this technique. Once clone has the scroll and her sheets while the other had water just in case they needed to put something out.

Only allowing one clone to actually train with her, she let the other keep the equipment while they practice everything. The moment they both prepare what was needed, they both would have simply copy each other's hand seal rate-exactly, and they were performing the seals at the same rate before attempting the jutsu.

It was rather clear that nothing happened for her since she was only able to blow out smoke while the clone was able to blow out a little about of fire to trail. Trying it again after they took a small break to read through the errors that were made, she and her clone reads through the scroll together.

Like what they say, three heads are better than one. One they all point out an error that was made, they two quickly heads back towards the rock with everything ready at this time. The problem they had before was rather simple. She failed to use her fire release logic; she didn't heat her chakra enough.

Before doing so, they both thing it was best to use fireball before using the jutsu to know how hot they needed to make that jutsu. Taking a stance, they both turn to each other and leap away, to create some ground between them. If the clone was on equal ground as the user or a little weaker than this won't hurt.

Both quickly races through a chain of hand seals then finally locked and execute at the last seal. Taking in a deep breathe, she and her clone blows out a massive ball of fire towards each other but as she said, both should be almost equal meaning the ball would have burn themselves out without hurting them

Giving them the idea, they both quickly turn towards the rock. This time, it wasn't much for her and her clone to not do since they got what they wanted. Swiftly flashing through the hand seals, they did the same as they both did with the fireball jutsu, making sure they also did everything the scroll told them to only to finally breathe out the trailing fire towards the rock with a speed.

Mission complete, they had finally learned this technique-now it was time to finish the real mission.* - Sun Nov  1 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) made her way towards the academy; today, she plans on teaching the kids something they don't know-something any simply chuunin should know at the very least; this was going to be a little order and wise word to the kids. As the scroll said, she needs to teach them something before this mission was complete. 
<p>
She knows they would have took a while before they actually starting the mission, she decided she was going to buy a bottle of milk in the meet time while preparing herself for class itself. Creating another clone of herself, she believes two Ai would have been enough hence why she wanted to do this mission alone.
<p>
First she had to have the kids tricked into something-something that will give them a reason to want to actually learn something. A prize would have been the best bet here. Her only problem was to figure out what prize she wanted to give the kids. "What do kinds like nowadays...Weapons? No..I could give them a one use jutsu scroll as a prize....That'll help."
<p>
As she planned, she created a scroll the kids could have read from. It was a simple D Rank jutsu-Shunshin no jutsu, something she believes all shinobi should have at the very least. It was a jutsu that helps them escape hell if needed to. This would have been a good prize for the class to work among themselves for.
<p>
Once she was finish with the scroll, the teacher had called her in to hurry up and teach them class room though the teacher quickly told them that the class was a headache meaning they give a lot of trouble. Just by hearing that, she could have already figured her job today was to figure their problems.
<p>
Once she enters the class, her eyes quickly narrow down on the students. It seems she was teaching a class filled-Around 30 students in total. This won't be as hard as she expect, as long as she acts like a tough female, she and her clone could have finish this mission in no time without much problem.
<p>
"Good day class, today I'll be teaching you all a little thing about Suna then we'll have a quiz to see who will win this little scroll here that has a super kool jutsu. So today, you will be learning a small thing about Chuunins, I may not be a chuunin though I've been around long enough to know how things work. Team work in all levels such as assisting, sacrificing, respecting no matter the ranking and more along the way."
<p>
Just giving them a small summary of the class; It was rather clear to the other teachers she was using a little trick to teach the kids. She knows if there is a prize to earn that is worth something, they would have listen carefully and remember everything just to obtain such prize. This was a little style she picked up doing her youth days.
<p>
Using her clone as a assistance to chip in whenever she forget to mention something, the teachers would have realized the classroom was quiet and of course paying as much attention as they can-Something the teachers have never seen before since they started with this class. They were even thinking about using this little trick with the students afterwards.
<p>
Starting the little test, she had her clones pass around the papers, "Alright, I only want you to write your answer on the paper. The question is, in your own words, explain to me everything you have learn'd today, the three with the highest grades will get the scroll, the others with passing grades will get some ice cream along with the three, hopefully no one fails this or else I'll have to spank you until you can't sit."
<p>
Just to add a little motivation to the class room. Sitting in place, she gave them only 10 minutes to give her the summary of what they had learned. She expected no bad answer since they were all allowed to look back in their notes, re-read and write out a summary of what they have learned in their own words.
<p>
Luckily for her, the little trick actually worked out well. It seems no one from the class had failed the test at all though she did give out the scroll to the three to learn while they were student-Additional skill, putting them one step above the class which would have given the other students more drive to catch the three students up.
<p>
Allowing the teachers to handle the ice cream problem, she heads out with her clone-allowing it to dispel itself. Waiting on her report scroll she could have shown the kage, she nods at them as if she was saying use that to teach the class before heading out to receive her reward from the big man.* - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015

With those words, she allows her paper to arise and swirls around her like a barrier of protection.* - Sun Nov  1 03:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) figure the current team was enough to take this guy on. Though, as she told herself; she was on planning on killing anyone without a really good reason or forced to. In this case, she was not planning on assisting them to murder the fellow no matter how large his body was, "Rogue that.". She was still the slowest of the set so don't expect her to quickly get into position like the others. Walking forward, she snaps her finger as the sheets of paper slowly rise from out of her scroll-Adding on what was already around her body swirling. As planned, she points towards the fellow thus commanding the sheets to move on around.

She wasn't stupid as well; she kept half around her body as defend if she needed to block some random ass attack. So certainly, she was using 500 sheets at the moment, 250 to attack and the other half to remain as a guardr. With a speed, the sheets quickly swarm down on the prisoner as while the other two had him distracted. Her aim was to bind his joints while they papers had him and the others in a large typhoon-This tactics was to simply lock away or restrain his movements enough for her comrade's attack to land correctly. If this was successful then you can bet that she would have allowed the sheets to slowly wrap around his body was if she wanted to mummify him.* - Sun Nov  1 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: This...Shouldn't be a problem for us..I'm sure only one of us can handle this. - Sun Nov  1 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was questioning how slow her sheets were if they were moving rather fast yet he was able to do so much action before they arrive to him. She wasn't worried at all. The moment her comrade Koji was sent launching towards her, unless he stopped himself, she would have moved to the side yet leaving a few sheets in her place like a wall. The moment he was supposed to fly through it, the sheets would have bind around his skin and slow him down until he was stopped. 

She wasn't a push over yet she didn't want to go to the extreme, not yet. Strange enough the sheets were still traveling towards him but the moment he decided he was going to use his wide range attack. She quickly summons up a little more sheet of paper as defends. Creating a wall around her, she attempts to block or weaken herself, Shin if he wants it, whoever is behind of her and Koji is he was there from the attack. For the youth one Mizora, the paper she used to attack him would of quickly redirected and create a wall around her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs loudly-Why didn't she fall back and stay behind of her wall. She felt as if she was more defensive while the other two were throwing their life in this man's hands without trying to figure out what he is capable of. She only had one option at this moment though with the assistance of the others and the genjutsu, she believes her papers would have arrived on time to save the girl from an ass beating.

"I'm too old for this..Why are they just 'throwing' themselves at me without using any tactics.."

Reaching back to her scroll, she realized she'll need more sheets of paper to fight this guy-Hell, it would have been better if she was the only one fighting him since he would have to come close to her if he wants to attack her. Snapping her fingers after releasing the sides of the side, she called upon hundreds, thousands of sheets (5'000 in total), while saving the others-No need to waste them all.

Withdrawing the sheets she used as a wall back around her as her normal defensive protection technique, she allowed one thousand sheets to assault the fellow-if two hundred and fifty wasn't enough, one thousand should be able to cut it. If accepted or successfully hold, she would have simply attempt to bind his joints then his body slowly while at the same time, trying use the sheets as a armor like wall around the girl-Attempted to save from per say damage as well if she didn't have a plan on escaping.* - Sun Nov  1 05:16:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: That's probably the fun of it. - Sun Nov  1 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had finally hold him down with her sheets--Indeed he was binded---At this point, it was up to the others to finish the job. Feeling as if she was the play maker or and safeguard for the group, she kept her bind nice and tight around his body so the others by finish this off. With a draw of the cigar, she returns the three thousand sheets she didn't need and certainly kept the one thousand and five hundred papers around her just in case he wanted to try something like before-Or she needs to protect herself and more people.

"Finish the job before he somehow breaks free.."

She didn't know of the buildup since she lacks cool eyes or sensing power so in her state, all she could have done was wait and see how it will go-She wasn't fighting alone so she wasn't going to do everything herself, she rather remain as the safeguard/play maker for the others to do the job-The life of a pacifist is a struggle.* - Sun Nov  1 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sheets couldn't hold him much longer as it seems to be a fight between Tai-specialist, "Well shit, they're too close..", indeed, she can't do anything at all if they were all this close apart from trying to keep him in the bind yet it was almost impossible at this point. "Alright..If I can't stop his movements..Slowing him down will work...I'll just protect them whenever they need it."

Crossing her hands, she narrows her eyes down on the fellow as a few on her sheets (500), made their way towards the girls. This was something rather simple-Just as how she would have used it herself, the papers would have used themselves as a hard shield if an attack were to hit them without the girls being able to defend themselves; mainly to attempt and block off the damage, slow down and weaken the attack if needed.

"All I can do for you two without hurting ya, good luck."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) quickly move to the others the moment she realized the man was about to release a massive wave of power. Of course she used the paper guard to protect the two girls, the rest was up to them at this point if they wanted to take the damage or not. Quickly moving herself in the way  of the others, she flicks her hands as the papers quickly created a wall around whoever she was able to save-Blocking off whatever knockback force they had to face.

She felt the force yet it wasn't enough to actually push her away, "Well shit, you guys are dragging this out too much..", she said softly. She was serious, she started to believe she might need to have them all fall back and finish this herself.* - Sun Nov  1 07:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "I can do both actually.". Thru a single seal, she creates two clone of herself-Two of them were made to support the offensive group while the main body was handling the protection of the close range defense problem. With her finger pointing down, she speedily order one thousands sheets of paper to her command. The idea was to cover herself and the only taijutsu user here who was the Hyuuga. 

Snapping her fingers, the papers quickly moved towards him and evidently whirls around him-Trailing him wherever he ran off to and protecting him from direct damage---The paper guard technique, "Alright, he's protected.", at the same time, she was doing so, her clones swiftly move to assist the Kage's with the fire squad. Racing through hand seals, they both hastily breathe out a bulky sphere of fire into the wind-increasing the size, power and certainly flow with the current of the wind.* - Sun Nov  1 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at the kage's order, this was going to be a little hard for her since the Hyuuga was too close for her to actually do anything so she figure she needs to find a way around it so she had two clones, might as well allow them to fight the fellow while she protects the man from harm. The moment she believes Jiki was about move, something else happened.

"For the love of....-Hassan, I can't attack at all, they're too close."

She actually planned on raining hell upon on the fellow but if she did then her comrade would have been caught in the crossfire and shockwave. She could have saved one but Jiki as well? That was just too much for the amount of sheets she had on her. Just to prepare, the clones both called for eight thousand sheets of paper around them and have five thousand sheets to create shurikens, within around two hundred of the shuriken had a 'special' sheet of paper with them.-waiting for the main body's command.

"I'll wait a little and see how this goes, we're ready."* - Sun Nov  1 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs loudly, "Orders are orders.", she knew how this was going to go so might as well do as he told her. With a snap of the figure, the clones quickly points down as the paper windmill rains down on the target-one thousand shurikens in total (Nin + Control = 30 so..Do the maths for how much damage ya take from each shuriken).

To add salt to the wound, if they made contact with him, the set that was special sheets would have triggered off into an explosion. The end result was as simply as it looks, he would be facing her shurikens and the endless chain of explosions (four hundred)-This was what Ai would have considered the rain of hell. During this little rain, she herself quickly moves around to the middle field area.

Once she was in that position, she raced off her hand seals leading into a fire ball-Flamethrower mode only to keep the damage going. Her aim was to simply attempt to finish this man as fast as she can and end this long battle by using her actual lethal abilities.* - Sun Nov  1 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: From the main Ai - Sun Nov  1 09:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: I need a stronger jutsu. Hmm. - Sun Nov  1 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) notice that this was the moment she needed to fall back and wait on orders. She wanted to create two more clones but she was unsure if she could have done so without completely burning herself out. Having her clones prepare for the fire ball jutsu, she herself prepares to use her paper guard on whoever she needed to use it on.

Waiting on further orders, she crossed her hands and see how exactly the Kage will handle this.* - Sun Nov  1 09:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) removes the cigar from her mouth then flicks it away--She didn't want her to inhale her second hand smoke so. Ai seems a bit weighted mentally though she was a happy to see her Ket again-That and she can't really leave the village under heavy watch. Sliding her coat to the side, she wraps her arms around the girl tightly, "Likewise, I miss'd ya' soooo much.~"* - Mon Nov  2 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "Not yet, kinda why I haven't visit ya' in a while, we're still lock'd in. I've did a lot over the time I was on guard here though.". Ai's tone seems a calm as if she wasn't afraid at all.* - Mon Nov  2 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Had to 'fight' for her survival... - Mon Nov  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right, so..? So do we all, in the end. - Mon Nov  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not what I meant... - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Then explain properly. - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't read minds, y'know! - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She was in no condition to be fighting...You know..I kinda had a choice if I should have killed her or not...Accept the mission..Or not..In the end, her final expression after..I remove'd her heac..She was staring directly at me, with a shock'd expression. - Mon Nov  2 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So she really didn't expect you to kill her..? - Mon Nov  2 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) clearly believes in do what you want others do to you.* - Mon Nov  2 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No..She didn't want to fight me and I could have reject the mission.. - Mon Nov  2 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because if she was slated to die anyway, all that you changed was who swung the blade. - Mon Nov  2 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "It was a B rank...Strangely, I'm one of the few Hassan hands them out to."* - Mon Nov  2 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She would have died..Yeah or live to see her 30s. - Mon Nov  2 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still a pacifist at the end of the day so what she was doing as a shinobi was only pushing her to retirement-Hell, the only real reason why she was a shinobi mainly because she had the power to 'protect', not 'murder', believe she would have been able to save lives, not take them hence why this was heavy on her since she was doing the complete opposite.

Nodding lightly, she accepts that fact that she was a murderer at this point and see no reason why she shouldn't keep on doing what she have been since she took the job, "Right..."* - Mon Nov  2 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Sake..I forget that helps to drown away sorrows.. - Mon Nov  2 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, so far, her killing record was currently 6 and her assistance record was 3 so she had all rights to feel really heavy about it mentally. Ai already knew that it was only the way of life but as much as she wants to avoid it, it keeps on stopping her in her tracks, "Yeah..I know..I'm going to retire when I can..For now..I have to struggle until." * - Mon Nov  2 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head at this one, "No...As long as Hassan is commanding us..We'll be fine from Edge, I can't retire because I'm not at the retiring level as yet."* - Tue Nov  3 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You would need to at least be a Jounin to retire, right? - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmhm. - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't worry about it- what are freinds and lovers for, huh? - Tue Nov  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeaah, - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: What about you? - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anything you want to talk about? - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I've been training alot.. I've met a few people and met a few freinds around Konoha- but really.. - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Nothing that I can discuss in public. - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: At home then? - Tue Nov  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure. - Tue Nov  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Lets go. - Tue Nov  3 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Lead the way. - Tue Nov  3 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Here we are. - Tue Nov  3 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's nice... - Tue Nov  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Tue Nov  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few, "Private..Exam?"* - Tue Nov  3 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....With the Gezo. - Tue Nov  3 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He wants to take the exam to become a Gezo Private - Tue Nov  3 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So that he can later become a legal Hokage for Zeus. - Tue Nov  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But the test is to fight ten men at once, to the death. - Tue Nov  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... You can understand why I'm worried, yeah? - Tue Nov  3 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....... - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....Gezo.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh fuck.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He's dead.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...As good as, once he takes that test. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Gezo are normally consider'd...A Rank..S Rank..They'll break him.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh, no. The test isn't fighting ten Gezo. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But it is fighting ten other Shinobi at once. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Him on ten or free for all? - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....Still... even if he is a Ninjutsu Genius, with affinity for every element... - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Him on Ten. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He has skill in every element, and jutsu of all sorts- but I'm terrified it still won't be enough. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sweetie. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You know.. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Because he's skill'd in every element doesn't mean he'll last a moment.. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's an impressive trait; having that many strong Ninjutsu, and enough flexibility for all kinds of situation- but yes. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am /well fucking aware/ it probably won't mean a damn thing. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: My sensei is able to use a seal that reflects elemental ninjutsu. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I half think Zeus is forcing him to take it just to make sure he dies, because I think Zeus blames him for Hana-Sensei's suicide. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: On the other hand- people have passed the test before.. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: --.... - Tue Nov  3 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So him passing it is possible. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: What are the ranks of who pass'd? - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no idea.. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But a Sargaent, which is the rank above private, is Kage level. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So I'd presume Chuunin and Jounin.. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And Takeda is a Genin. As I said- I'm sure he'll die. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
