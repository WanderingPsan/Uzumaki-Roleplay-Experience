This feeling was something that she had since the day she return from her training a few years back, after she woke up from the Coma, it got worse and now, she doesn't know if it's good or bad.

Sitting down around her table, she outs her Cigar then looks at the books she had to study. She was going to do this on her own this time-indeed, she didn't want to use her clones today since she didn't felt like adding more depressed atmosphere around the house while she was studying besides, she can do much better than the clones.

Opening the first book, she took her sweet little time to read through the page though within each five minutes, she finished a page then skip. Her rate was rather good since the book was large yet at the same time, had over 2000 pages to worry about. For Ai's standard, she was going to spend her day on this good.

Finally arriving to the middle of the book after a few hours, her eyes slowly started to clone-Just reading was wearing her out quickly yet at the same time, she felt like she could have at least finish the book before going to bed. She wanted to see how far she could have gone. With a paint brush and paper, she manic examples from the book to test her skills.

She had to drawing down, only needed the skills to get the technique rolling. Closing the book once she was done-After a good six hours, she believe it would have been a great idea if she rest for now. She had already visit her lover's grave and place her daily rose on top of the headstone, only was left was for her to sleep.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) feels drain from that little show she gave the girl-She didn't want to subtract it from her deed until everything was prepared. This was a system Ai uses to perform favorites, some people have more deeds than some through it's only best on what they did for Ai. Once someone is out of deed then they'll be left to dead. Everyone has one deed; to gain more is to perform a good deed for Ai.

Ai could be considered a bitch at this point but it doesn't bother her as much as it would. Summoning three clones after she enters her room, she looks at the books as if she was telling them to use them. While doing so, she made her way towards her reading desk to get some formula done.

The clones sits on Ai's bed as they read through the oversize, man killing books-Lucky for them, Paper specialize comes with a lot of perks such as controlling the sheets of the book itself. With a snap of the finger, they controlled the books this making them light and easier to read. While that was going on, Ai was drawing Japanese letters.

Forming them in a method around into a circle, she sighs softly before tapping the dry end of the brush against her head as if she was thinking. The clones where literally almost done with the studying-Believe it might be wise to ask her Sensei for some Fuuninjutsu scrolls to assist her with this training.

Finally reaching her limits, the clones had finished their books and now were ready to read the other sets. She could have allowed them but the strain it puts on her chakra said otherwise. Giving them a small nod as if she wanted them to dispel-They did just that, returning whatever they had learn to the real Ai.

After such an event, she believes it was time to visit her lover's grave and cry about it later-All this bottled up hatred and depression, she had no one to release it on..Not yet at least.* - Fri Nov 13 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) enters her room yawning. She was a little tired though she wanted to get this done so she could have been trained by her sensei-Actually. Taking her sweet time to remove her extra gears, she looks towards the books with her blank eyes. She didn't want to but she has to, "Ket..See what you have me doing.."

Same as before, she created two more emo clones to assist her with this studying. Today, she wanted to finish her books so she could have moved on to the advance books thus, at that point she would be able to ask her sensei for jutsu scrolls and Formula. The jutsu she had in mind was the jutsu that can absorb chakra and fire it back at them.

With her clones, she moves to pick up the remaining books-Only four books in total though they were all large in size. Smoking on that blunt, she sits with her clones on the bed and started to read the remaining book though this was how it was going to go, she had to finish reading that and the final book while the clones at a single book to read for themselves.

Pursuing the books, she reads through them as fast as she could but at the same time, she reads with an understanding since she was studying after all. Wetting her index finger, she presses her finger against the paper for it to stick and of course, skip the page. Strangely, she was finish with her set before the clones were.

 "Let's see.."

Taking a seat around her reading desk, she wants on the clones to finish and dispel themselves so the information that have given returned to the main body. With this info, she was planning on attempting to create a few more seals-Practice on what she had learn today but instead, she felt like sleeping.

Picking herself up, she made her way to the bed, fall on top and certainly, fell asleep within moments.* - Fri Nov 13 21:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I see.. Well.. Make the first move. - Sat Nov 14 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) already knew how he fought and he knows exactly how she fights so this was going to be a game of tactics-Who is ahead of who. Shrugging her shoulders at his statement, her body started to slowly break apart into sheets of paper along with the amount she always carries with her whenever she doesn't feel like using her body. 

Scattering the sheets across the land, spreading across the land only leaving her torso, head and arms hovering above surface-Up in the air. She knows she has to be careful against Jiki since he was also fairly skilled when it comes to preparation but with a high spirit, she knows she could do well against him.

Pointing her finger upwards, she creates a few hidden paper butterfly scouts just keep on eye around her just in case before planning her first assault. "Same as before..", she mutters quietly-With that sentence, the a few sheets of paper quickly came together to form a ten long swords. Pointing her finger towards the lad, they would have quickly launched themselves towards him in a random pattern-Of course she was aiming for his arm and leg since this was a spar after all.* - Sat Nov 14 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: Sand vs Paper... - Sat Nov 14 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) remembers what someone had told her about wind jutsu so she already knew exactly how she was going to handle this situation. Moving herself to the side, she cancels the force her long blades were traveling with and allow his wind currently to take control of them. Making sure that her other sheets were also away from the current or even use such to spread them more she smiles lightly at his attempt.

"Lovely.."

Now it was time to do was Marrisa once told her-Use the wind to assist her jutsu. With the force of the attack and her own control over the blades, she allows them to make an arc outside of his attack-Using his own jutsu as an amplifier; this was something she wanted to do against that girl during their first spar but shit happened.

Finally using the boost from the wind and her own speed, she arcs the blades and simply attempt to redirect them towards him with the new focus but just in case the attack would have been too lethal, she reduce the sharpness of the weapons so they won't be enough to cause any large sum of damage. 

While this was taking place, the rest of her body scatters to just the sheets around as if she was hiding yet this was only a part of her plan. "I wish to test out something on you but..I would need Fuji's assistance with it so I'll only do what I can for now..", as her voice echoes through the land.* - Sat Nov 14 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) believes that would be a rather smart attempt however she wasn't stupid to let him take that much control over the battle. The moment he was supposed to break into her Longs blade, she wanted to create a shatter them and create a wall since she didn't know the power of his attacks overall.

Within a few seconds-clearly she was aware of his attack with the many eyes around on the battle field, a few of the long blades quickly scatter into a wall of paper-Two lays thick. It was obvious that his shrunken would have broken through the first wall but not the second wall (87 def in total).

"You're underestimating me.."

Allowing the other wind enhance long blade that was left to arc around the wall, she still continues her pursuit with the few she had left. In the meantime he had to handle them, she was setting herself up for the ten-ten barrage-I mean what?* - Sat Nov 14 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||The sand storm was real, she didn't know exactly how she would have handle such an attack since this is new to her, "Shit..". What she had to do was quickly reform her body yet allow the papers she would have normally carried in her scroll remain as a two lay dome shield around her-Same thing he did during their first match.

Using this, she defend herself against his little sand storm while at the same time, block off his attacks. The idea she had was a little verge at the moment but she had to follow through no matter what. With her paper scouts till mixed with whatever sheets that was in the twister, she moves her hands so those sheets and the scouts could have ride the wind until the toss themselves out.

Certainly he was able to rip through a few of her sheets she couldn't save on time but this was not much of a problem for her since she could have always summon more sheets to her recuse. Since she was in his little hell's hole, she would have simply ride the wind until she was out of it-same thing she did with the other sheets.

In the meanwhile, the swords quickly shatter away before he could have restrain the entire set but they didn't attack him, the survivors more or less made their way upwards into the air, "Weapon storm..", she matters in her cocoon. She had the idea on paper but she also needed more paper to assist meaning she did nothing much prepared for this round.* - Sun Nov 15 00:38:49 2015
