<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I haven't talk with ya in a while. - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Bit ticked that... taking time of from my normal routine to study other things.. Seems to have resulted in the others leavin me behind, but.. good on the whole.. happy. - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) taps her scroll as she summons up around one thousand colorful sheets of paper. Shaking her head to the girl, she goes on to say, "No, I just wanted to hang out with a friend you know, been a while since we did something like that.". While she said such, the sheets quickly took the form as roses-Colorful roses as she places one for each graves, two for the graves she knows and three for the graves holding the people she once loved or considered family.

"I wanted to visits them while talk with you hence why we're here now and don't worry about that rank thing, talk to me as if I was still a Genin."* - Sun Dec  6 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) hands her one of the rose-She would have realized that it had the colors of purple, blue and red with an sweet scent, "For a year? If it was Hassan, he would have told you no off the bat, Sanoke maybe allow you do if you have company ya know but I would say get stronger first before you do, bandits out there are quite powerful you know and I rather not lose another one of my friends..Been losing them too often."* - Sun Dec  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pets her head and takes a seat on Ketsuki's grave-She wanted her to know that Ai was here to visit her even if it has been a while due to the craziness around. Looking up at the girl, she shook her head no then said, "You don't need that to become stronger. I understand what you're saying however you're limiting your mind. If you want, I can assist you with training if that helps, teach you that strength doesn't come from such. If you want to kill, do the B rank execution mission."

Ai has done that mission a few times so she knows exactly how it works. She wanted to drink something since the ground site itself was playing with her emotions but might as well hold them in since an comrade was around her.

Closing her eyes, she goes on to say, "Trust me, you'll be fine."* - Sun Dec  6 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head, "Mizora is at the bar with Momu so I won't be able to drink if I go there.". Patting the grave twice, she looks up then say, "You remind me a lot of something but he died around seven years ago during Zet's era. Indeed, she did remain her too much of him but then again, it has been a while.

"I can summon the drinks, only need a place to drink them."* - Sun Dec  6 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shrugs her shoulder, "The Inn? Or an empty house?", the only places Ai could have think of without Mizora looking. For her, she wanted to finish at least one battle of Sake to keep her resistance high enough. Blinking a few at her response, Ai giggles lightly, "Chi, yes, his name is similar to Chi and they both had white hair. He was Edge's Rival and the Kage of the village during that time."

She still didn't know what happened to him since she was in a coma when he vanished. Assuming that Edge killed him finally, she picks herself up and said, "He summoned dogs and found with chains and sword, his power was great even if he loved to battle. Fuji and him always kicked it off in a friendly match."* - Sun Dec  6 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Let's go then. - Sun Dec  6 22:14:36 2015

Playing with her child, she proceeds to kiss the baby's forehead, "Hehe, don't worry little Ketsuki, daddy is here.~", and certainly Ai will be watching over the baby like an Hawk.* - Tue Dec  8 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) snuggles into both of them. She already planned on what she was going to do for the child so first thing was first was the rank up!* - Tue Dec  8 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) cuddles more into the child, "Don't worry about it sweetie.~". With such, she started to play with the baby's sides.* - Tue Dec  8 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) actually made sure that Mizora didn't squish her--That Gentle fist grip during birth always ripped her arm off, never again.

Smiling brightly, her life seems set already.* - Tue Dec  8 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: LOL -omit- - Tue Dec  8 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sets herself like a bed so the child could have slept comfy!

Thank god she had a female body.* - Tue Dec  8 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hi, Ai. - Tue Dec  8 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nodding at the set that returns an greeting and planting a kiss upon Mizora's cheek, Ai suddenly breaks that blank-ish expression into a large smile; giggling softly, she reaches and moves her finger so the baby could have grab hold of it. Bending lightly, she used her other hand to tickle the baby's side.

"Hello Ket.~"* - Tue Dec  8 22:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I'll do meh best. - Tue Dec  8 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) plants one of the baby's forehead, with an smile, she told the child, "Daddy has to work now, daddy will be soon.~". Tickling her stomach, she gets ready to leave! Tapping her radio and kissing her wife, she followed Koji's or you can say, track him down to whatever location she he wanted her to go.

Waving at the two while she was leaving, the fella suddenly vanished, leaving nothing but small amount of smoke in her place.* - Tue Dec  8 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no. This wasn't much of a problem for her since she didn't care about what other thing of her. All she wanted to do was to assist her comrade who was in need! Nodding slowly at the guards, she answers to Koji, "It's nothing at all, we'll get this over quickly so I can go chill with my family. You know, work comes first since it puts food on the table and whatnot."

Certainly Mizora was a house wife for the time being until the baby was able to hold out on her own. Until then, Ai has to be really careful with her mission. Using her paper scouts and sense skills, she scans the area for anything that could be lethal or could be used to kill someone outside of medic and guard's tool.

"Let's get this over with."* - Tue Dec  8 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was about to hover off before--

"Eh..Need something?", she asked the new shinobi.* - Wed Dec  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) just didn't care at all-Ai had one job today and it was not to handle this. If she wanted to check around, she could however she knows the Hyuuga guards would have more likely kept a watchful eye on her while the two worked. Hovering off, she made her way towards the location the others were to start what she was pay'd to do.* - Wed Dec  9 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She's coming? - Wed Dec  9 00:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: What is she doing here? - Wed Dec  9 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yep, lets get going. Oh Kiyoko this is Ai. I'm no good at asking the right question so Ai agreed to help me. - Wed Dec  9 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh, and yeah... I know Ai-chan. - Wed Dec  9 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Goin well. Keepin Kiyoko company for now.. - Wed Dec  9 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't as brave as Koji since she still had alot to live for so certainly Ai had her paper scouts waiting on her outside while she hovers behind--Indeed, she was currently in her paper form as well just in case shit goes down during this little event.

Following behind, she waits to see how this will go.* - Wed Dec  9 00:25:10 2015
