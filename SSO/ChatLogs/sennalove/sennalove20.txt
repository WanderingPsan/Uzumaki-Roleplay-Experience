<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) believes this was the best time to have break-fast/Lunch. Staring down at the dish, a small smile spreads across her face before returning to an blank expression. With a sigh, she prepares herself to chomp down this meal. The reason why she was smiling before but she remembers an good memory she had back in Konoha when everyone there was still alive.

As much as she wanted to cry-she wishes to bottle it up until she was alone. Finally, it was time for the food. Seeing that Mizora was enjoying her meal, she could tell that it might be worth it. Sliding her hair behind her ears, she proceeds to eat---She was from the old Suna set when the village was poor and Kumo had control over it-During the time Edge was still a Suna shinobi. She had eaten along of things such as Snakes, oversize worms meat once prepare'd purposely and whatnot.

No food is considered shitty to her yet this meal was something else, something she didn't expect at all. It reminds her of someone's cooking skills only to put a slight smirk on her face, "This reminds me of your cooking Mizora..", she mutters softly. Finishing her dish before tackling the beverages, she realized this might be the best lemonade she had in her life.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) couldn't help it but to smile. With a snap of the finger, a single butterfly made from a piece of paper quickly folds itself and place itself over the slit in her cheek. After such, her skin color returns as long with her flowing blood and frail bones. Giving them a final wave, she adds.

"Like I said, It's not an hundred percent thing if I'll go or not, it's up to the others if they're ready...Buut..I'll try my best to stay safe if we do, alright?"

She reassures before leaving. During her leave, she taps her ear as if she had a radio located there before she mutters softly.* - Mon Nov 16 01:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was a little surprise about this turn of event though she also understands Mizora's concern---Kind of remind her a little about her past but nothing for her to be emotional about. Accepting her kiss willingly, she wraps her arms around the girl right after she was through; embracing her tightly while whispering, "Now I'm a little worried about my well-being..But I'll try to stay as safe as I can, thank you Mizora..".

Ai's face was a little red since it has been a while she have gotten something like this-She couldn't complain, she felt loved again. Releasing her, she attempts to head through the door however Mizora would have realized Ai left her a piece of paper in her hair that slowly forms itself into a well made rose.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) leans back a bit, she taps her finger against the edge of her scroll only to summon a bottle of water. Wasting no more time, she digs into the stew yet kept an lady like manner while eating. She really loved Mizora's cooking since it probably the best thing she had eaten apart from that restaurant.

During the cycle, something a little strange revealed itself-Ai's eyes weren't as dull anymore, they had a small sparkle to them along with her body aura. It wasn't as depressing anymore as if Ai had finally lighten up a bit over the course. Finishing the bowl, she relaxed a few-She was working rather hard on the mission and her restriction on smoking or drinking.

"By the way..Mizora, I want to tell you something but I'll tell you later today, alright.."

Within a few moments, the depressing mood vanished, all eyes on her and her new kimono. Ai wasn't definitely not expecting that one at all; regaining a little sense of mind, she goes on to say,

"Oh my, she's right, that looks great on you!"

Relaxed herself as she seat beside of her-Strange enough Ai's eyes didn't left her at all meaning that she actually loved the new look. Tilting her head cutely, she said, "Even much better up close.~"* - Mon Nov 16 03:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) couldn't understand why he wanted her to do such a mission when she was a scout that could allow clone to do the work for her-Guessing he didn't want her to use too much energy or chakra or something however instead of using a clone which would be smart, she did it herself. Strolling up to the guard, she waves at the guard before creating up to five butterfly scouts to watch from a higher ground.

Creating a shadow clone, she set it to hide in the shadows of the cliff while at the same time, set up a replacement jutsu between her and that clone just in case shit got real at the gate. She had a long day though she was going to take as much missions as she could to assist with her with funds and maintenance.

Waiting on the other guards to call upon on whenever they need any real assistance, she was felt like she needed a cigar yet she rather not smoke; Mizora didn't like her doing so-That and drinking.  Because of her element, she could have done so without risking the cigar actually murdering her like any normal person.

Yawning loudly at the boring day, she relaxed herself and certainly read through an book she could find herself loving-50 shades of gray, "This isn't as bad as I thought..", she mutters. Sliding her hair behind her ears, she keep her connection open if Hassan needed to call her-That and her scouts could have contact her.

Bing

That was the sound of her mission ending; she didn't have to stay here any longer even if the guards around felt safe with her around. Instead, she left the clone to keep their company though she did withdraw her paper scouts since that was a part of her body, allowing the clone to manic her actions and create a pair for itself just in case.

Once everything was over, she made her way towards the village square for another village-Hopefully, this mission would have been a little more interesting than the guard one he felt like giving a paper scout and shadow clone specialize-She could have certainly finish this without actually coming to the guard afterall.* - Tue Nov 17 02:10:08 2015
