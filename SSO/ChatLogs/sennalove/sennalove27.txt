<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) starts of writing something on a large piece of paper that could more likely help Sanoke and his situation. "Wanted to sing this to Mizora but I don't have to voice for it...Oh well, he'll handle it well hopeful.", she thought to herself-Was Ai actually helping someone again? What year was this? Sliding him the note, "Sing this will ya..", she whispers to him.

Now that was that, it was about time for her to quickly learn this technique and leave the two at it. To speed up her progress, she creates up to four clones to assist with her current situation. Because four heads were better than one, the trap quickly pursuit the technique by summoning a few sheets, brushes and bottles of ink.

"This should be enough.."

Each plans on working on it differently comparing to the others-just like the finger technique Sanoke shown her before, she plans on doing the same performs here. Taking their time, all five Ai slowly write on each seals, preparing the seals by using her own sheets as tags-since that was the plan anyway.

Once all the clones were finish, they hands them over to Ai for testing. Creating a small formation with them, she made the first attempt with one of her own sheet as the test doll. Once Ai executed the jutsu, she moves back and allows the sheet of paper to bounce against each sides of the barrier until she realized something.

During this attempt, one of the barrier tags was written incorrectly hence why it was garbage-It didn't work at all. Since she already knows which clone gave her, she gaze at that clone as they quickly correct the mistake. It wasn't anything serious at the end of the day so once they did such, she tries again.

Test number two was ready to go. During this second time, it seems the problem from before was corrected this time. Lucky for her, this didn't take as long as before meaning she could have study the other two jutsu her Sensei gave her from before. Now to transfer the info the clones gain from this experience, Ai quickly dispels them.

"Alright..That's complete..I'll be heading out now..Mizora is probably waiting on me so, good luck Sanoke."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sits back and opens her two scrolls, first she was going to tackle the cloth binding however the second technique would have been the explosion fire shot. She was still shitty when it comes to fire techniques so she would more likely work her way up to such. Once that was checked out, she realized herself and prepares to read.

Reading through the scroll, she realized something. This clothes binding technique was literally a push over-Rather similar to her paper binding hence why she wasn't going to have a problem learning such an technique. Surprise she didn't need the clone's assistance for this, she sighs and moves on to the next jutsu.

Putting away that scroll, she looks onto the other jutsu. This was something she didn't know how to perform but at the same time, she could have done so like any other jutsu she knows of. Reading through the hand seals, requirements and so on, she narrows her eyes down on the texts-Her Sensei wasn't the best when it comes to writing.

Reading through the scroll, she came to a sudden stop then moves towards her the window. She wanted to learn this was fast as she could so she could have finish her basic five seal training and master the techniques as fast as possible. Once she was at the window, she quickly race through the seals then made her first attempt.

Seeing as that was a failure, she goes on try it once again. The second time was the charm already as she was able to fire up to three of them-strange enough, they did explode on contact with the rock meaning this was only one step closer to completely her wish list. Once that was over, she made her way outside to find the kage.* - Sat Nov 28 06:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: J-Just come at me. - Sat Nov 28 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves back and allow the clone to take over. During this little spar, the clone already know what Ai wanted. Breaking itself apart into sheets of paper, the Genin would literally have to find a way to defeat something she can't touch or know where they are. Doing this progress, the sheets from the scroll itself join the fight-Fifty thousand sheets in total.

"Like I said, I'll be holding back. If you know how Jiki fights, you'll have an idea how I fight."

Spreading the sheets around the battle field, except for the two that were currently having their spar, the real Ai stands back and watches the show. Once the show was set, Paper Kunai from all angles around the girl launches at her with an speed (31 attack speed, 20 in total) attempting to stab into her body one behind the other.* - Sat Nov 28 19:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: So, who are you? - Sat Nov 28 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) clone was everywhere-To find her body part was the hardest part, the same problem Jiki had when he fought against her-The match they had a draw in. Ai could have already figure that this girl gives up too easily. The main body sighs and told her, "I'll give you a tip, listen well. To fight someone you can't see or hit, you must first pin point an weakness, everything has a weakness. As you can see, this clone's isn't as strong as I am and it is also holding back greatly."

She said. Of course Ai remembers what she did during the rage she entered before-She stayed out of it, "I'll show you a trick later on..You might need it.". Hopefully she took her advice. The sheets started to distance themselves from the girl only to realize, the Kunai she removed from her body where actually bombs-Training bombs without the heavy impact and fire-Indeed, they string like a motherfucker though. The Kunais quickly turn to their sheet state then exploded. (200 in total, 31 damage each (Or half if it's too much), nothing lethal), attempt to damage the girl some more.

What AI wanted her to do was simple, she wanted her to use whatever she has and tries to fight no matter how bad the situation looks than standing around and tank everything they throw at her.* - Sat Nov 28 20:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yi(Rikuto Katsu) thinks: Sensei? Hm. - Sat Nov 28 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles at the fact the girl finally took actions, "That's what I like to see.". She told the clone to not use paper guard meaning, the girl had a lot of chances to win against Ai. The ten shuriken she toss hits a few sheets however they weren't apart of the clone's body but she was getting the idea of what Ai wanted her to do.

"Now you're getting into it, you'll be able to defeat the clone in no time.~"

Ai's clone wasn't going to let her get away so easily so it created around ten Katana made from papers to assist. Like an swordsman, they all rush the girl however, unlike stabbing, they all attempt to slash her like an Kenjutsu specialist. Of course they weren't sharp as an actually Katana so they weren't as lethal (Half 31 per a slash, same attack speed tho).

"Come on, now learn how to control your weight in the air, block and avoid, if you fail to, you'll take damage."* - Sat Nov 28 20:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hmm, hey Trill. - Sat Nov 28 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) note she was able to capture two of them however she wasn't able to use them how she wanted to since they still overpower her. Since Ai realized that her plan failed, the clone already knew exactly what it needs to do-Weaken the attack enough so it doesn't cut too deep into her body-Certainly they slashed her violently then return to their 'raw' state-Splitting to their sheet state.

Crossing her hand, Ai sighs, "Momu, That would be smart if you had more strength to overpower them, in this case, you should have use the wires to assist with blocking the attack.", the wire would have more than assist her and minimize the damage. While she was falling, the sheets from the ten Katanas took the form of a great hammer and fell with her, this was an attempt, she was tries to increase her falling speed and smash her into the ground without using much of an lethal force.

"Let's see how you handle something like this."* - Sat Nov 28 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Oh hey Kina. - Sat Nov 28 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles-She was still trying. Since she was, Ai personality weaken the papers enough so her technique would have overpower hers yet at the same time, doing such, Momura's falling speed and pressure would have increased as well. Once she hits the hammer, it forced her down a little more before breaking apart completely from such an punch.

"Good job kid, now try to land it."

Ai starts to wonder if she was actually sparring her or training her since she was assisting her so much doing the spar, "Let's see what you'll do next.". The papers from the hammer would have quickly took the form of an Kunai, around ten of them before launching down onto the ground in the meantime-She simply attempts stab into her again yet wanting to see how she would have handle the situation this time.* - Sat Nov 28 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: hmm. - Sat Nov 28 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||She didn't have to ask, they would have trailed her rather she likes it however she was able to deflect some but not all. Taking more damage. Ai sighs softly-Momura was taking too much damage to keep this up for too long, at this rate, Ai was worried that she'll bled out before she finds the clone.

Putting her hands up, "That's enough."

As the papers suddenly dispel themselves, covering the battle field in smoke. Once the smoke clears, The real Ai was standing behind of the young girl, "You still have a long way to go if you want to do battle with my sheets however you're getting there sooner or later, it isn't something that happens overnight. Just need a little more training is all. If you want me to assist you in such, just ask me to help you train, not for a spar kid."

She told her. With an pat on the head, she hands her a simple healing pill, "Take that and get some bandage on."* - Sat Nov 28 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pecks her lips!* - Sun Nov 29 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) leans into her a little more while pulling her closer at the same time-Might as well not mess up her back. Pressing their lips together, Ai proceeds to take it to another level-Lip lock only if Mizora wanted to do such an act as well.* - Sun Nov 29 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) tilts her head left, surely she started to redden faintly the more the girl's breast rubs against her. Come to think about it, it has been a while since both of come kicked it like this. Ai decided she was going to grab her rear with one of her hand-using such to pull her in while the other runs through her hair during the kissing period.* - Sun Nov 29 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) already figures that she would have end up loving it so Ai sits up a bit. Now that she knows that Mizora wanted more, it was time to take it to another level. Before doing so, she made sure that she warn her lover and see if she would have approved such. Breaking from the kiss just for a moment-At least long enough for her to say.

"Wanna step it up?"

With a pants and a breath of air, she proceeds to tackle the session again head on, resuming the kissing. Base on her answer would have decided if Ai stepped it up or not. If she wanted it then of course Ai would have provided it by sliding her tongue through their lips and wait on her part way-hopefully she wasn't new to this.* - Sun Nov 29 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) searches her mouth as well as coils around the girl's tongue. She was getting too much into the mood including Mizora but she also believes she'll know exactly where to stop it. Her breathing rate increases along with her heartsbeat that Mizora could have more likely felt via her breast. Her body automatically begun to slightly grind against hers from the lustful act as her mind decided to blank out on her as well.

Sloping her head to the other side, she groans and moans in her lover's mouth while at the same time, trying to take her mind off of it. Ai was certainly blushing heavily while trading and accepting her lover's saliva. If it was too much then of course she would have left some slides down her throat without an care in the world, she was her lover after all. 

"L-Let's stop before we take it too far..~"

She said from a short break away.* - Sun Nov 29 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was able to focus with her actual head and not the second, now she could have to figured out what's up and down, she calms down as much as she could doing the break and said, "Yeah, unless you're not afraid anymore and want to go that far, if not then lets continue.", giving her the options to choose from.
Like Ai said earlier, she also has say in it so if she wasn't ready then she can't force her to be and push it on her through lust-Not to mention that innocent voice strike Ai rather hard through the heart. Catching as much air, she waits on the girl to make her decision and act to that decision-Ai was happy with whatever she choosed both ways!* - Sun Nov 29 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods- this time, she was going to copy what Mizora would have normally do, "We'll enjoy it, I'll cut the moment short whenever we're a little too heated, already?~". Certainly, Ai respects her decision and indeed, they know exactly where the bed was if they needed it.

Pushing Mizora over, she crawls up on top of her then press her chest against the girl's breast, she sticks her rear in the air then stares in her eyes from a nose to nose distance.Like a cat that was about to pounce, her knees buried at both sides of the female, she goes on to say, "You're going to copy me and I'll copy you, let's see how well we do.~", surely this was an game Ai came up with over the short breath. Peaking the girl's lips over and over, she wants on her to make the move!* - Sun Nov 29 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) got up off of her once she realized her situation, if she wanted to move this into the bed then she can't complain-She wants to get comfy after all. Sitting up once she was off of the girl, she tilts her head towards the door as if she was telling her to go on ahead, "Pretty up for me, I'll be right there to pounce on you in five.~". Certainly Ai was planning to give her five minutes to do so. During this five minute, bottle of water would have become Ai's best friend.* - Sun Nov 29 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) puts Mizora to bed as she proceeds to finish up her training for today. This wasn't much for her not to be able to handle at the end of the day. Walking outside of the room, Ai knew she had to get this done now. With the flick of the wrist, the trap summons up the tools needed to train with.

She summons up an paper, brick and a card from an pack. This training was going to be simple, tries to burn an hole in the center of the items without applying too much stress to ones body. Since the field was already set, all that left was for her to summon up the clones she needed for the act itself.

Performing the seals needed, the figure summons up around two clones in total to assist with the training. She was going to handle the brick, one takes the paper and the other takes the card. Out of the three items, the paper was the harder since that was like metal strong. Setting themselves off, they begun the training.

Ai attempted to burn a hole in the center though it wasnt as simple as two plus two. She had to focus her chakra enough and channel it towards the center of the brick while trying to use the heat to rip an hold in it while the clone that was handling the card was already able to burn that hole without much time wasting. It did the job and kept the fire under its control

The clone that was handling the paper had a rather rough time melting the hole while the main body was just not able to do something like that in its current situation. Taking a break after the main was able to create a burn spot, she looks towards the other two clones then dispel them. That was enough training for today inside, she did enough.* - Sun Nov 29 07:42:56 2015
