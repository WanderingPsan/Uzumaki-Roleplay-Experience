<br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "What a drag...I knew this was going to happen but..", the moment she said so, her hand rest against her scroll as she literally summon herself some more sheets of paper to her assistance; certainly, she was going to strength and refine her shield while at the same time trying to push against the sand as if she was trying to create an opening and even expand the amount of room she had inside. 

If this was possible, she would have simply create herself two shadow clones-Of course but her and the clones were aware of his little trap so might as well she moves as fast as she could. "Let's start..". The opening that was there, she would have allow the clones to borrow her techniques and tactics to break them into sheets while at the same time, use the sheets they had in they scroll for protection.

Pouring out of his little trap leaving the main body inside, she didn't know what he had planned for if they were able to escape but she quickly closed that opening to prevent him from entering. During this escape, she puts up a seal thus allowing the papers that rise above him to trigger-A few moments ago, she was preparing something, now it was time to revealing what she has been doing.

Unsealing a load of papers as some falls with a speed while the others take their time. All the papers she had summons on top of him seems to have a seal or writing on them that was rather common, only with a few small adjustments to it, "Catch..", she mutters in her self-repairing shield as they all exploded on contact.

Strange enough, the tags weren't lethal, more or less lack the flames but still carry the shockwave/Impact-Spar friendly set. This was a simple play to keep him distracted while the clones escape his sand hold. Just in case if he see pass her distraction, the clones had already prepare their deal wall protection if all odds failed.* - Sun Nov 15 01:33:26 2015
