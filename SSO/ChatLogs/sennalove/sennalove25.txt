<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Not well. I don't take hits. - Sun Nov 22 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I just avoid it all togethjer. - Sun Nov 22 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 22 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Consider this has ya reflex training. - Sun Nov 22 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wanted to see if she could have fought all out with Sanoke like she used to do with Jiki-definitely she was looking for an replacement since he's dead and gone. Gliding her fingers against the scroll, she summons up to four packs of sheets with a few strange markings-For Sansoke, he would have realized that they were homemade tags.

"Okay..Let's see....Showcase zero.."

Tapping her fingers against the sheets, they suddenly rise above her only to take a formation similar to a defensive whirlwind. She wanted to test her strength against him-She haven't gotten a real fight since Jiki had died so she was hopefully this'll cut it. With the snap of the fingers, a few of her sheets quickly merge into a few Shuriken.

Flicking her finger towards him, they launched themselves at the current target yet they travelled in wide and in a circular arc. Her goal here was to try and land the few projectiles, fifteen in total or even have them rotate around him like bees in a beehive. If was successful then certainly Showcase one would have shown its day view.* - Sun Nov 22 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "Why are you powering them up..?", she asked, the same thing Jiki did, he repeats the cycle; cutting the force of her attacks, she lets the wind carries them off only to use that as an boost. She didn't even seems to be bothered by the fact that he was currently behind of her, trying to land an hit. 

The moment his hit was about to land, the papers around her moved to protect her-blocking his attack, she was aware of course, that wasn't even a question however for the paper shurikens, Sanoke would have realized that they used his gust as a boost and was now heading back towards him with the additional speed and power.

She wanted him to dance towards-strange enough he was avoiding Showcase one which is quite interesting to her. Continuing her previous attempt, she tries to hits him with the per say boosted papers so the combo could have begun unless said otherwise.* - Sun Nov 22 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles lightly at his attempts, he was rather quick, she'll give him that however he's underestimating her ability as a shinobi-she did learn a few things from Jiki after all. Returns the shurikens from behind as they all swirls around her, she moves her hands upwards as if she was planning on tries to get hold of him.

The moment he fires the wind bullets, the walls quickly moves to protect her however the bullets were a little too strong for a one lay wall to handle thus leading to her taking damage. It wasn't as bad as expected since she was able to weaken them enough for her frail body to take the blow well enough which send'd her on her back. (Block'd off 49 damage, the rest is direct hit)

"Well shit..That hurts.."

Picking herself up, she haven't used her trumpet cards as yet but at this rate, it might actually be hell but at least she knows she'll need a two lay wall to block off his attacks. Taking aim, she launches another round of shurikens towards the fella but just like before, wide so he had to target them one at a time to tries to hit all with an shockwave like attack.

"Let's see.."* - Sun Nov 22 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head, "Don't underestimate my tricks..", as the papers quickly moved to protect her however this wasn't any normal protection, it made a thick two lay curved wall in front of her-People used that jutsu on her too many times for her to not know about or remember about it--It's like everyone's Ace card or something like that. The wind would have hit the walls yet didn't bypass them at all. He was able to knock off the shuirkens that were heading from that direction but he had others to deal with at the same time.

Ai had plans alright however the moment he remaining shurikens where in range since he was trying to blow her away, they'll quickly scatter back into their pure form-Mizora would have remember this tactics from before however unlike before, she didn't try to bind him, instead, the triggers the tags-He had eight shurikens coming at him, they all reveal back to their paper form meaning he had eighty training tags to handle. Unlike actual tags, they were not design to kill or cause burns (24 damage each). 

Waiting for the storm to end, she allows the paper to encase her in the meantime for additional protection-The question is, will he finally take Ai a little more serious no matter her village rank or will he still hold back against her.* - Sun Nov 22 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: Wow... - Sun Nov 22 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still under protection, she didn't know the storm as ended until the kick against the paper, "Oh?", opening the back, she quickly leaps out while at the same time, the paper that made the wall-The rest that didn't follow her would have took this chance and tries to bind the clone's leg, reducing it's speed.

In the meantime, Ai was trying to figure out what was going on around her after that wind sand storm. Meaning this was a turn to recover from the current situation. With her hands open as if she was ready for anything, she scans the area, wondering if he was taking her serious at all or was he still playing around.

"Come on, use your full power and I'll use mines.."* - Sun Nov 22 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) seems she might not be able to escape this at all since she was still on the earth! And lacks sense-That and her paper scouts weren't around for her to know it was coming. Trapping in his dome, it was game at that point, she couldn't do anything to escape without hurting herself in the process to it was his victory!* - Sun Nov 22 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Side note. You need to get more jutsu and different strategy. What you did is like an imitation of Tetsumi's battle style. - Sun Nov 22 21:31:05 2015

Reaching up, the trap frees the small ponytail merely to catch her entire hair into such, "Hm? Strip off the rest of ya clothes hun, I'll need ya completely naked~", she told her with a grin.

"While I was in Kiri back in the day when my Mizukage friend was still alive, He show'd me the spa, they took good care of my skin, they work'd out my body until I felt like a feather.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at her approval; since she was still damaged from fight she had with Pa, Ai believes it was wise to not add too much force to her body. She intended on to modestly rub away her tensions and of course, makes her skin glow even more than before. Once the particular areas were covered precisely, Ai started from the shoulders. 

Tenderly pressing her thumbs into them, she moves them in a twirling movement as if she plans on rubbing down the muscle strain since she didn't want to try any other thing that could affect her wounds. Once lessening them a tiny then she applies her knuckles against them, "One day, I'll tell ya to strip for something else though maybe ya'll expect that.~"* - Mon Nov 23 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) raise and eye-brow at that latest remark, "Deeper..? Sounds a little lewd don't ya think?~". Moving down to the center of her body as soon as the shoulders region was complete. Performing the same deed to her back, she smirks brightly at the noises that were heard, this was rather inspiring for her-If her lover was appreciating this then might as well give her the full body massage.* - Mon Nov 23 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) seems a little confuses at the last word but she let that slide for now. Moving down a little more after she was finish with her back, Ai tackles the her legs starting from belong the rear, "Let's see.~", drilling his fist into that area, she could have already tell that the tension in this area was a lot since the leg muscle are used often. Coming to a sudden pause, Ai moves up and planets on at the back of her lover's neck, "You seem to be enjoying it more than I am.~"* - Mon Nov 23 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) groans softly after she was finish. Taking a seat behind of her lover, the trap goes on to ask, "Rate me, out of five.", clearly she was playing with her but Ai believes it was time to give back to Mizora for all the things she has done for her outside of material objects. Swing her hair to the ponytail was over her shoulders, she gazes down on her lover with a smile.* - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) lays down beside of her-Ai might actually need to change the covers after this but its whatever at this point. Relaxing a little, her hands were still covered with the 'lotion' she used on Mizora's skin so surely she avoid it to make contact with her hair, "I'm glad ya enjoy'd it, I'll give you another whenever you free stress'd and I can still move.~"* - Mon Nov 23 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was currently sleeping---No doubt about it, Ai was fatigue from the battle she had before and of course, the massage itself since her body wasn't the best after taking a few wind bullets to the stomach.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had finally arrived to the scene however she was walking towards the battle with her body slowly breaking apart as some exits her scroll and black cloak-During this time, there were two more Ai running around, one was inside of the village and the other was out not to mention this Ai that was currently entering the battle. This Ai was here to assist the battle and of course follows Hassan's orders.

"Edge..Been a while..Doubt you'll remember me through since I was only a child back then.."

She mutters in the meantime, the papers that scatter from her body and scroll suddenly moves forward only to create a wall in front of Edge's paper bomb that was aiming for the army mainly to block them off-Saving a few of Suna's shinobi while they attacked back, "It's a little sad though...You were a great shinobi to Suna back then...What changed you.."* - Tue Nov 24 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So... I wonder if Im still needed... in a whole not many people died... compared to the total of the army  - Tue Nov 24 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) taps her ears before saying, "I'll protect and attack..", she whispers a few more things before sliding her hand against the scroll on her back thus summoning more sheets of paper however it was strange since all the sheets that were summoned had black writing on it only those who had practice in the art of sealing would have figure what it was. Like a sand storm but instead paper-Paper storm, they blow toward Edge's remaining army.

She was rather late for the battle but might as well clear up quickly while she was at it. With an murderous aura, she picks her fingers up into a seal-Giving the Suna army enough time to withdraw only to trigger her sheets once they were around the remains of his army.

'Sezzzzzessssss'

A sound of something burning could be heard before, 'Boom!', explosion all around the battle field-This was an condition an hell storm as they exploded (31 damage each..Over 500 sheets)-Her plan here was the murder the remains of his army while she could and certainly wait on Hassan to give her another order other while quickly after triggering them, she creating a wall so Suna's force doesn't die to the shockwaves.* - Tue Nov 24 03:12:51 2015

If it was clear then Ai would have simply dispel and allow the real AI to know that the battle is over thus allowing the Citizens to return home.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "The same guy Hassan put Suna under heavy watch for back in the day...And the same guy that wipe'd out Kumo."* - Tue Nov 24 04:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) rests her head in Mizora's lap.

"Was a little worried about you.."* - Tue Nov 24 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) chuckles quietly as she tries to lighten up the gloomy atmosphere, "Well, I didn't know as well until Hassan and Koji radio'd me, I had to create a few clones to assist with the citizens and the short battle...I'm still alive so that counts.~", her attempt on trying to lightening up the mood but it didn't seem to be the best off paper.

"Time to enjoy each other like it's the last.~"* - Tue Nov 24 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pokes her cheek like she was trying to catch her attention, "Why so depressed? I'm still here.", she remarked. Ai was wondering if she was going to be sad while her love ones are still alive or sad once they had died-No one lives forever afterall.* - Tue Nov 24 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "You sure about that?"* - Tue Nov 24 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: If you want to talk about something, don't be afraid to talk with me. - Tue Nov 24 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) relaxes herself as she prepares to study once again; today, she plans on working on her fire element training. Certainly Ai knew fire techniques however she wanted a better at them so she could have used them against her current target-Edge. He was also an fire element user so what AI had in mind was to be able to create a few fire techniques.

She had a plan for such-Just like Jiki, she planned on improving her paper techniques overall. Surely what she had in mind-She wanted to infuse her fire chakra into the sheets so wind techniques would have improve them and other fire techniques wasn't have affect them. She had a long way to go by might as well.

Creating up to three clones to assist her, she gave all of them a dense chakra covered sheet of paper, today her plan was for them to burn an hole in the middle without burning the ends but this was the trick. Both hands should be located at the tip of the sheet so they would have to control the chakra well.

All clones except herself started to work on such, she was busy reading up on fire elements overall. Surely, she had to study as well since the more she knows, the better it is for so. Scratching the side of her head, she reads through the books while the clones practice. No progress was made overall.

Within a few hours, she cuts it short-She didn't have to time for it anymore. That and the village was on standby meaning she had to prepare for armor and mask for further orders. As much as she wanted to clones to keep training, she doesn't know how long and where Hassan was planning on sending her.* - Tue Nov 24 22:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Tell me the story. - Wed Nov 25 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: It's a long one, it's about a boy.~ - Wed Nov 25 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sits upright, she slowly removes her rather lengthy sleeve jacket before starting this story.

"Alrighty so I'll break it into two parts since it'll be rather long.~ First, I'll start with this beginning. There was a boy that was from a bloodthirsty clan. That boy had seen too much violence, death and so on until that boy had a thing against all of them. Luckily for him; his mother was for another clan, thus she took him with her to avoid him becoming such of a murderer but her clan was located in another region. That boy's mother died shortly after due at a sickness leaving him all alone in this strange land. Because that boy was too young, he had to endure on own until he was old enough and had the money to join the academy back then. Once that boy gradated, he became a shinobi of that region with his own unique-ish style. Lacking a teacher, he had to self-train himself, be a lone wolf until he slowly started to make friends. During that time, the world was rather corrupted with slavery of people like they were objects, same for villages and daily execution to set examples. That boy had to assist with battles against things that were bigger than him yet he survived each one. He was considered a fodder back then, he was still too weak to even complete a C rank by himself but the friends he had made over the months that turns into years pushed him to become a better shinobi gradually. Comparing to their progression, that boy was taking much too long until someone decided they were going to train him out of the goodness of their heart. He was still growing slowly but the rate was not as bad as before, he was now able to defend himself a bit. Surely the boy was still a slave to Kumo but it felt more like he was a part of their village outside of Suna's low income. Suna was not even considered a village anymore because of that and Kumo was considered the big shot village. That boy had grown attract to his friends, his Sensei and his life, everything was going his way until one day, he decided to do a mission by himself and got himself seriously injured to the point he entered an coma state.."

Breaths a little-that was along to side.

"Time for part two, any questions so far?"* - Wed Nov 25 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) cuddles up with her, "Alright.~"

Dragging her memories, she goes on to say, "After a year, the lad woke up but found himself in another small town. The villagers were the ones that took care of him and nurse him back to health. He had to wait at least one month before he was able to travel again. After he had recovered enough, that lad finally returned to his village he calls home and to his friends but to his surprise, the village was not the same anymore, everything had changed, what was considered a no name village was restored, the buildings were much different and larger and certainly, it had more shinobis and villagers."

Sighing softly, Ai continues.

"He wanted to know what had exactly happened while he was gone by..Asking around, his luck was not the best since no one notice him or responses. It was like he was an ghost or something. He started to believe it as well until one beautiful woman appears at the hotspot. He believed that he was a ghost so of course he figured it wasn't best to try and talk with that woman until she moved to him for a little protection for an perv, she didn't want to hurt him-That was all that boy needed to know that he was still alive. Because of the type of skill set he had train'd himself in, that boy was able to protect both the girl and the perv for an ass kicking."

Ai precedes to kisses the back of Mizora's neck as he was able to say this part!

"Everything changed from there, that girl offered to become his friend, the lonely; ghost outsider feeling the boy had has finally vanished, his luck improved even more the moment his Sensei finally shown himself. The lad was rather an happy man that day till he was told the deaths of almost all of his pervious friend. Who wasn't dead, didn't remember him or was now evil meaning he was back to ground zero--Not to mention he also lost his house. Accepted back as an Suna shinobi, he started to work his way back to his standard, he still didn't have much friends nor money but he was making them overtime. The first friend he made, the lad wanted to do as much as he can to assist her due to an fear he develop'd over losing anyone else. He had made a comrade that became his best friend even if that friend was a mere teen. That teen invited him to stay at his place, fed him and assist him as much as he could until he was able to stand again. He didn't expect such kindness for a village that treated him like shit before. He started to make more and more friends' overtime....His luck suddenly changed right after the death of his best friend. Everyone slowly started to die off after that. He left to Konoha because he needed a few health pills and guidelines towards making them since he wanted to keep his pals alive as much as possible, he found love in the strangest way. Now with a relationship, he realized that they were moving a little too quickly yet they weren't bother'd by it at all. The boy had to leave because his time was up so he returned to the village and of course, hands out the supplies and give the hospital what was needed to create their own. The boy's lover decided to visit him since he was restricted due to an incoming war but leaving her to do as she likes in an strange land led up to her death thus putting the boy in an deep depression, even causing the boy to hate humans. He lost his gentle ways and become more of a cold hearted killer like his father's clan. Nothing got better from that, everyone started to die off that boy; his friends, comrades and even family, he made them die shortly after. It was like an curse until his first friend finally decided she was going to try and comfort him. She was more concern about him than she was about herself putting the lad in a state of confusion. He grown to love that girl yet he didn't want to say anything. He had accepted his faith that he was going to die lonely 'till the girl's friend motivate him to confess. Surprisingly, the girl liked him as well, he was worried about history repeating itself with his new lover though he had faith that it won't have. Through thick and thin, he wanted to stay by her up until this very day. The lad has grown madly in love with this girl to the point he doesn't fight as dangerous nor does he tries to self-destruct his body, he had finally found himself a shoulder he could cry on and a lap he could lay on for comfort through his difficult life."

Whispers one more thing;

"And of course, that boy won't even know what he would do if the cycle repeats....Maybe lose whatever sanity he has left."* - Wed Nov 25 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Indeed."* - Wed Nov 25 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) never expected that kind of reaction for her lover then again, she's always surprising her. Exhaling softly, it may be the story of Ai's life however his life has been improving somewhat apart for the deaths of her friends. She still had her lover by herself after all. Tilting her head into the girl's hand, she goes on to say.

"Thank you...~"

Ai wanted to believe it but at the back of her head, she knows history was going to repeat itself sooner or later, this curse haven't ended so behind the mask, Ai was crying deep inside, fearing of losing everything again and again yet knowing it'll happen.* - Wed Nov 25 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ---.. - Wed Nov 25 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: As do I...I'm here for you...To protect you...I want to assist you..Through thick and thin you know...I love you so much..I'll do as much as I can for you. - Wed Nov 25 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pulls her in closely as she accepts her kiss! Certainly she returns the same affection through that kiss!* - Wed Nov 25 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods slowly, she was still blushing lightly as her eyes locks with her lovers, "Yes but we still need to take a bath, no?~"-Ai still needed assistance with her hair after all* - Wed Nov 25 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) picks herself up. She was already half way naked so might as well she strips on her way there!* - Wed Nov 25 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was currently sitting in a decent size tub. The water was steaming, filled with an natural perfume soap and of course, she was completely naked. Relaxing with both eyes close, she waits on her lover to show up-Right on que. Opening the eye towards the door, she gazes at her lover's body with an smile, "Well then, looking good.~"* - Wed Nov 25 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whips her hair around; because it was wet, she believes that it would be easier to straighten but god knows she was wrong-No progress has been made since.

"How is the-Ow...Water sweetie?~"* - Wed Nov 25 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) turns herself around-Allowing her lover to do whatever she wanted with her hair!* - Wed Nov 25 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shuts her eyes as Mizora works around her hair. What Mizora would have realized was that Ai's hair was longer than it seems and was extremely soft yet seems rather hard to strengthen since it was also strong.
 
"Alrighty.~"* - Wed Nov 25 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) flinches a bit the moment she felt the girl's chest against her back. Definitely, she blushes a tad but she already assuming it was because her hair was also giving her some problem hence why she didn't say anything as yet. Allowing her to handle her such, within moments, she hair was smoothen down. After that, she said softly as if she didn't want her to over-react, "Mizora, braving up now uh?~"* - Wed Nov 25 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't have to see her reaction to know what she did. Giggling loudly, she leans back and said, "You know, I didn't mind, right? You are my lover and I'm yours after all.~", she clarify. Keeping her head still---Come to think about it, when was the last time did someone assist Ai with wasting her hair? Years now.

Ai's hair wasn't dirty at all-only the massage lotion she used from before got into her hair and messed it up after she fell asleep recently. Ai adds just so her lover could have felt a little more comfy around her body, "My body belongs to you so, paper or solid.~"* - Wed Nov 25 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Mhm, turn around, so I can.~"* - Wed Nov 25 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) seems rather calm but as for Mizora, she would have felt Ai's member embracing her if that was the case. Pouring some shampoo into her palm, she proceed to throw a little water upon her lover's head to get her hair wet before she started to scrub through.* - Wed Nov 25 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was just about finish with Mizora's hair. Flicking on the showers, she shuts her eyes thus allowing the water to fall on top of them--Washing away the soap!* - Wed Nov 25 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) figures she would have felt asleep. They were finish so might as well Ai took care of her. Picking her girl up bridal style, she proceeds to dry her off from head to toe-She didn't miss any part of her body-No joke then slides on the girl's underwear on and hooks her bra, slows on whatever she normally sleeps in then finally sets her down on the bed. She dried off herself and put on some clothes then dry up the water from her moving around wet before joining her lover in bed!* - Wed Nov 25 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That's new... - Wed Nov 25 21:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: This will not be able to be dodged though. - Wed Nov 25 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) crossed her arm-Was this the clone Ai or the real Ai?- it was rather clear that she recently woke up as well. She had no real idea what was going on, she knew that she was called upon to the south or the east. Certainly she had no idea what was going on around this area so her eyes falls upon the child then back at Koji.

"Details on this situation? I want to know exactly what happened before taking action, the punishment will be determine base on the details you pass onto me."

Once she said that, he skin suddenly became pale yet she looks perfectly fine; only the veterans around her knows exactly what Ai was preparing for.* - Wed Nov 25 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) narrows her eyes down on his seals while she calls upon more sheets from her scroll-she still didn't know what was going on however she quickly created an clone of herself. Surely it was weaker when it comes to physical work but still, it matters. She was about to tap her scroll until she heard Iza shouted out-only to suddenly gaze towards the fellow with eyes of wonder.

Within a few moments, their sheets quickly moves in place thus creating a thick two lay wall with the sheets from both Ai like a shelter-Paper on all sides. She simply attempts to block off his attack yet cost her of her sight on what's going on around her-Meaning the child was fuck'd because she was too far and now out of Ai's sight.

If this was successful then Ai would have simply removed whatever is left of the wall and see the aftermath of this event, if not then both would have disappear in the flames but of course, rely the info to the main body which was still around the village-Still trying to figure out what was going on.* - Wed Nov 25 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I can't die here...not yet...not yet... - Wed Nov 25 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: (The clones are dead then---Wait_ - Wed Nov 25 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Admin(ZenoKuthric) whispers: [You aren't dead but.] - Wed Nov 25 22:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't strong enough to defend against the jutsu as the walls were engulfed by the flames slowly but surely. She didn't have much left in her-She still tries to quickly replace the papers to the wall as much as she could, stacking and stacking, even summon up more sheets to her assistance though the clone she created was not using her dance of the Shikigami thus putting her in a bad situation. The moment the heat was too much for the clone, it dispel from the pressure.

"Crap..Crap..CRAP!"

This was why she wanted to create that little fire infuse sheets but it seems she might not get the change to. Surely her paper body was more endurable than his flesh and  blood state. Once the fire had fully over powered her guard, she bite down on her dry lip as the fire rushed against her-burning her like a text book.

She couldn't even see make out what was going on around her anymore, she was in a state of shock; flashing back to the first spar she had against Marrisa when she used her fire infuse winded technique, she remembers the reason why she made the paper guard, for something like this exactly but it seems she wasn't able to stop such this time.

The only thing she would be regretting is to leave Mizora alone after all they have been through-The only human Ai actually grown onto after the hell, heartless murderer she had become from the death of her previous lover, "She'll do fine without me..", she thought to herself. This was her last moments.

"I guess..But..I'm also sorry.."

Her sheet body started to strip away slowly as the burn itself was a little too much for Ai to even survive against. After the flames had ended, Ai lays there in the burnt crater the jutsu more likely left behind, her body had restore itself back to the flesh and blood state however she was burnt out of this world. Lying there like cold, lifeless, it had seemed she had decreased from this world.* - Wed Nov 25 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still alive strangely but to her, she didn't know anymore-It was like she had actually died in her mind. She was good as dead before hearing a few voices chatting to her even if she couldn't have answer so naturally she would have released control and complete will of her body, believing that god was talking to her in her final moments. Finally losing it; a unexpected chakra started to pour out of her body and twirl around-She wasn't conscious so only god knows what was happening to her at this point. 

The chakra seem to have a mind of its own meaning she had no control over what it wanted to do but all assure, it swirls around her before engulfing her completely.

What's next to come.* - Wed Nov 25 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) rise up like a zombie. The burns around her body quickly healed up-Almost instantly as her eyes takes the form of a cat-this wasn't Ai anymore, this was certainly something else other. The blue chakra around her body slowly forms into an cloak and of course, formed a single tail from it. Her eyes set sights on everyone that was around the area.

Just as she was commanded, Ai kicked the ground into a quick dash towards the crowd of shinobi-She wanted to rip apart everything, anything that was still alive, she wanted it dead. She was now on neutral grounds but seeing the lad was traveling faster than she could have kept up with, she gets on all four then proceed to open her mouth thus allowing an orb for form slowly at the tip.

She didn't care who was in the way or what, all she wanted to do was try to snip the fellow and whoever was in that direction. Unless stopped, the orb would have control to form and charge with red and blue balls infusing into it until it was completely black, once so, she would have fired it towards the end the lad flee from-Attempting to hit or kill anything that was in its way.* - Wed Nov 25 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't expecting that at all-Was god trying to show her a few signs? Charging the attack, her fangs grown out along with her nails. The moment she was about to launch the attack, Ai found herself picking up an kick that launched her straight into the Suna wall with a force behind of it to create an massive crater.

On Paine's end, she would have realized that the cloak she had just kicked inflicted damage to her leg in return---Burning her.

Ai might actually be dead from the shinobi's point of view however the damage she had obtained from Paine suddenly restored within moments. During the regeneration, a loud hiss was heard coming from that wall. The real Ai felt as if she was drowning in a pool of sorrows, slowly sinking to the bottom, "What..What is this....Is this hell? I'll assume it's for my deeds...I guess I'll drown uh..", she thought to herself.

One tail Ai would have quickly emerge from the hole with her left hand expensing widely-She attempts to sweep up the Suna forces and launch them into the wall as pay back, "GRRRRRRROOOOOOORWWWWWRRR!!!"* - Thu Nov 26 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I-I can't fight that..e-either.. - Thu Nov 26 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) emerge from the crater however the moment the fellow's wind jutsu and throwing stars with the tags on them were about to hit, Ai used her tail to launched her back onto the ground thus avoiding it by an hair length. That was a little too close though her movements were as agile as a cat at the moment.

Landing on all four legs, she looks up only to see Paine trying to hit her with an..Shuriken? Out of Ai's reaction speed but not out of the chakras; her tail suddenly shots up towards paine while expansion longer and larger, the plan was to smack her over towards her comrades with a force though at the same time, trying to burn her some more. If that was successful, Ai would have too an stance as if she was about to dash towards them wildly, if not then of course Ai would have prepares to answer their attacks once more.

The real Ai was still sinking deeper and deeper into this pool the more they battle. As much as she wasn't the same Ai, fighting her friends and comrades was killing her slowing inside-This was probably why she was sinking so far under the depressing never ending ocean.* - Thu Nov 26 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: This again.. - Thu Nov 26 01:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: ... What is he doing!? Is he trying to kill him..? - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . . - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shoves her hands forward as the chakra quickly expanded and forms a wall-large chakra hands taking a boar thrust position to block off the attacks. Hassan's will attack didn't pierce through nor did it hurt Ai at all but just added more heat/blaze to her cloak-Same for Koji's air palm. It wasn't able to bypass her defensive-If they would have realized the hands skills rather similar to Ai's large paper wall formation.

Ai heard her name thus causing her to look towards the direction it was coming from. Unlike what Ai would have normally do, once the attacks had stop, that would have used the hands as a boost to launch themselves towards the girl called her name, leaping lightly into a claw attack!

During this event, the real Ai heard the voice inside of her head, "Mizora..? Why are you i-", coming to a stop, she realized that she wasn't dead and she was actually fighting her comrades uncontrollable. She couldn't have taken control of her body at all, as much as she wanted too, she had sink'd too deep in the waters.

Noticing that her next target was Mizora, Ai quickly rejected the power, chakra, and the control she gave to the voice in her head. The moment she was about to strike Mizora, she came to an sudden stop with her body trembling heavily as if something was holding her down. An sudden whisper could be heard, "No..I want my body back..You had your fun..I'm taking control..This cycle will end here..".

It was an inner struggle; Ai against the will of the voice-Outside of this inner battle, Ai was holding her head, crying out in pain as if something was ripping away from her.

With through words, the cloak around her body suddenly started to fade away until Ai was back to normal. Out of exhaustion, she fall on her knees in front of Mizora, she couldn't have resume combat-Good job Suna, they hold off an one tail cloak long enough for them to burn themselves out naturally.* - Thu Nov 26 01:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't have much clothes on her for Mizora to remove. The moment she touched the water, her body started to cool down slowly. She was still wondering what saved her and what took control over it--Was it an foe or friend.

All that matters at the moment was that she was stll alive with Mizora--That was all that matters to her now.

"Love you Mizora..Sorry you have to take care of me like this.."* - Thu Nov 26 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) realized that her body was slowly answering her command--She was still under the effect if ripping control from a Bijuu even if her body was already. Accepting the back scrub since she didn't have much say over her body anymore, she whispers.

"Yeah...I should be able to move again..Whenever my chakra starts to flow around my body..A little stable.."* - Thu Nov 26 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blushes slightly--Come to think about it, it's been years since someone had bath her--Since she was still a child.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) note Mizora would have saw an demon chakra deep in her stomach like Jiki however her current chakra was flowing rather weak.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Now that I think about it.. it won't be painful. - Thu Nov 26 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was thinking about it but before she could have answered, her lover already started on unlocking her points-It was rather painful to full her points back open however during such, Mizora would have realized that cold heartless chakra spread through Ai's body with her normal flow then return to her stomach as if it was assisting with something.

The pain Ai felt suddenly faded as she looks at her lover, "What did you..", she asked-Now realizing that her body was finally answering her orders! "Hey..I can move again!~", she said with joy before tackle hugging her, "Thank you so much!~".* - Thu Nov 26 04:25:23 2015
