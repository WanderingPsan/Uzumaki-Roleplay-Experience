<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) notes that Mizora would have found a gold ring with a large diamond. Around that ring was a gold female necklace with a heart pendent and a note. If she had read the note;

"Marry me.

From Ai"* - Thu Dec  3 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was quite glad she didn't reject her or else that would have hurt'd..Badly. She giggles lightly as her arms coils around her, "I'm really happy..You've been with me from the very beginning, comforting me during my lonest times, my darkness times and my depressing times..You took care of me when I'm sick, you save'd me from death, you gave me hope, Love, Compassion and many more things I haven't gotten before in my life..Even fix the unfixable...Though this might be an self-fish act on my end but I love you too much, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.". Ai murmurs. Honesty was good for the heart of course. Returning the tight embrace, Ai rests her head on top of hers.* - Thu Dec  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods slowly-Ai would have never thought that she was this in love with someone again-Is this magic? At least, she was really happy with her. Pulling her in closely, she simply drags the Hyuuga into her lap so they were able to snuggle! "Let's plan the wedding later, alright? For now, this is our time.~". Removing the mini radio from her ear and other equipment, Ai was quite serious when she said such; she literally planned on ignoring all calls and orders for today.* - Thu Dec  3 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) 's cheek lights up slightly, she couldn't resist from such an feeling. Exhaling softly, she simply calms herself down-Regaining her cool. Sliding her hands down to Mizora's rear, she clutches on to them and pulls her in a little more into her lap. She didn't know what to say at the moment, only that remains was for her to enjoy the moment with her mate.* - Thu Dec  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) glad accepts the lip lock-then comes the break. She was wondering why she wanted to show her eyes now. The reaction Ai gave was one of that 'She didn't care how her eyes were.'. Pulling her in closer until they were nose to nose, "Ai whispers, "You shouldn't hide such gorgeous eyes you know.~". Removing her own contact, she reveals her Onyx shaded eyes (Hopefully I spell'd that correctly), "Your eyes are pure and attractive comparing to mines sweetie.~". * - Thu Dec  3 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head lightly, "They're not blank to me, I like them, I don't know about anyone else though.". Ai has been around Koji long enough to get use to the white eyes so of course Ai didn't seem to care about them at all however on the other hand, Ai dislike her eye shade because they remind her of the things and event she had to endure as a child, "How about this, we'll both stop wearing our lens and see how it'll go.". With that, Ai pecks her lips then smiles. * - Thu Dec  3 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had no reason to deny her offer so Ai held the kiss with her until they both entered another lip lock. Releasing her lens, Ai's hands slides down to both of the girl's legs before spreading them to each side so that she was basically sitting forward while facing Ai though during so, Ai was now locked under Mizora's control, since her legs would have been on each sides but also doing so gave Mizora a little more height over Ai. -This was basically the riding position. 

She did all of this without breaking the lip lock. Now that they could be a little more comfortable kissing wise, Ai tilted her head slightly to the left in the meantime.* - Thu Dec  3 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Alright.~"* - Thu Dec  3 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't looking for such but it seems it couldn't avoid her at all. The attention demon strikes again!

She was actually on the move but decided she was going to wait on the two to finish before asking her question. Crossing her arms, she stares down the lad before asking, "Have any of you seen a girl with..Eh, a half black and white long hair around here? I'm currently looking for her.". This was Ai's way to getting info before she goes hunting.* - Fri Dec  4 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs-Might as well she hunts her down.

"Thanks anyway.".

Bowing slightly, she kicks the ground only to disappear in a few second, leaving nothing but smoke behind of her. What was left for her now was to finish what she started.* - Fri Dec  4 04:05:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, closing her eyes, it seems she had to enter big sis mode-Better yet, Husband mode-She wants to help her make the right choice for the girl's future. It won't be great if the kids didn't even know their family.

"Mizora..You know you shouldn't have. I know you hate her but at the end of the day, she's still your family..No matter how stupid they are. Getting over it and bypassing such is how family works. I remember when you two were bonding so much. Whenever she pops up, you were quickly moved beside of her back in the day..What happened?"* - Fri Dec  4 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "For now, let's go, I still have a house here that's under my control.". She whispers to the girl.* - Fri Dec  4 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mm? Okay. - Fri Dec  4 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm heading to bed. Be safe, alright? - Fri Dec  4 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: When I'm up and full of energy, I'll give you that thing that makes ya twist and turn, - Fri Dec  4 05:02:04 2015
