<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "No one was...We murdered the fellow without breaking much of a sweat..."* - Thu Nov 19 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Oh.. then why? - Thu Nov 19 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I can't..Hold back when it comes to close range warriors...Kinda fear hurting you. - Thu Nov 19 01:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nonsense. - Thu Nov 19 01:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Make the first move. - Thu Nov 19 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Okay. - Thu Nov 19 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What's going on over here? - Thu Nov 19 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, she didn't know how much power she would need to put into her assault however she decided that she wasn't going to use her trumpet card against her lover. The moment she summons up her clones, she lift her finger upwards thus call upon thepapers she carries in her back pouch. Certainly it wasn't much but it was all she needed for the current spar, if she wanted more, she would have simply summoned more.

With five hundred sheets at her control, the trap points her finger towards the incoming projectile therefore creating a wall in front of her to defend against it. She didn't know what it was for but she also didn't want to find out. Moving back slightly, she keep her eye on the girl while the sheets swirls and trails her.

"Alright..Let see."

Fighting like classic Ai, she quickly race through a few hand seals before breathing out towards the girl-An ball of fire however the fire itself wasn't as hot as most, it was still an fire ball at the end of the day. She simply attempts to give the girl a little challenge if she wanted to get in range.* - Thu Nov 19 01:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm going to get to see your skills. - Thu Nov 19 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I don't have any s-skills.. - Thu Nov 19 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It's should be fun "Pebble Thrower". - Thu Nov 19 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I can punch and k-kick.. - Thu Nov 19 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-And throw p-pebbles.. - Thu Nov 19 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) raise an eyebrow at her techniques. Maybe she didn't have to hold back too much after all then again, she wasn't trying to kill or anything like that. Leaping back, further away from the female, she snaps her fingers thus creating about ten shuriken made from papers around; which would have more likely cost her one hundred of the amount of sheets she had limited to her at the moment.

Once they were created, they all launch themselves at the Hyuuga in all types of pattern from Arc or an whirlwind to an rain-Attempting to strike her from all directions-Just like the mission, this was only a smaller version of Act two she used against the leader. She wanted to see if she was still going to pursuit or handle the shuirkens.

"Don't underestimate them now..."

Warning her beforehand, let's see how she handle the situation, based on what she did may or may not lead into Act three.* - Thu Nov 19 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I can't "s-show" them all..b-but a-alright.. - Thu Nov 19 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This is crazy... - Thu Nov 19 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't know there were so many strong people here. - Thu Nov 19 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Keep up the good work, Pebble Thrower! - Thu Nov 19 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: N-Nope.. - Thu Nov 19 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: It's a s-seed.. - Thu Nov 19 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: o-oh...w-why? - Thu Nov 19 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: B-Because I..uhm...c-can. - Thu Nov 19 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves back even more, "Not smart at all.", she mutters. The moment the girl's shurikens were about to make contact, Ai's set would have simply shift pattern thus avoiding impact; She did tell her not to underestimate them, since she still had control over them. Just like the bandit, she made the same mistake.

This was only leading into Act three. 

"Let's see how well you do against one hundred target.."

Already know how it would have ended, the moment the weapons were in range, they would have split apart, returning to their normal sheet however Mizora had one hundred sheets to worry about at this point. The moment they scatter, they would have simply attempt to grip and bind down on the girl (Bind str = Nin + Con, resistance = Str + Tai)

If she had successfully bind her lover, Act four was next to take place.* - Thu Nov 19 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs again, "Training you..That's a must..". Mizora is strong however she needed a little more tactics when it comes to battling someone like Ai. The bind only wrapped around her body and leave the head open. Ai's eye fall upon the lad that was in front of her using an paper technique though that didn't affect her at all.

She knows she wasn't the only one with such an skill since what he did was considered an basic skill. Vanishing and appearing beside of Mizora, she proceed to plant an kiss upon her cheek, "You did well however this is Act four, execution, in the same order, the bandit leader died however I figure why you're struggling against someone who fights with range techniques."* - Thu Nov 19 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) withdraws the sheets, her own arms wrapped around Mizora waist, pulling her in closely. She didn't believe she was as great as she believes Ai was---Ai had to give up on something to gain something else thus putting her at the skill level she currently has. Resting her head upon the girls, she whispers, "I'll give you a small tip and a technique to train with hun, I want you to master it and finish your training with it~"* - Thu Nov 19 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was a little surprise she took that news well. Kissing her forehead in return of her actions, she whispers, "So have any plans tonight?"* - Thu Nov 19 04:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles lightly-Wasn't the first time she heard that but it also has been a while since she heard such. Resting on hand on the ground to support their weight and the other to stroke through her hair, she said;

"Heh, and I'm glad to be your boyfriend."* - Thu Nov 19 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) flinch surprisingly at that question; she didn't know if she was serious or not. Staring down on her lover as if she didn't know what to say-It was best for her to be honest, no?

"Eh...Yeah I do but I always believe I'm not capable of protecting them.".

Some reason, this felt like history repeating itself all over again, how will it turn out this time?* - Thu Nov 19 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was in that teasing mode, "Oh? You had something else on your mind other than that?", she asked, sliding her finger under the girl's chin, she turns Mizora's head so they were staring at each other-Complete eye contact.* - Thu Nov 19 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves in slowly, "Well..?~", Ai's eyes weren't hollow anymore, from Mizora's point of view, they were a pearl like blue with a lot of sparkles as if she was alive again* - Thu Nov 19 23:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I've never been to a festival or cafe-hopped though, to be honest. - Fri Nov 20 00:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Gimme a kiss.~ - Fri Nov 20 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) lightens the hold she had on the girl so she could have moved up. The hand she placed behind as a foundation slightly shifts closer to her body this allowing her to bend a little without losing balance. It was able that time; meeting her part way, Ai would have simply press her kisses against Mizora but instead of an simply peak, she positions her lips for an actual kiss.* - Fri Nov 20 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) slightly tilts her head to the right during the kiss to add a little more 'spice' to it. Her lover would have realized that Ai's frame was too close to a woman from the sides to the hips were extremely curvy. Flicking her hands a bit so her sleeve rolls up a little since that was too long, she pulls her lover much closer than before. 

Without an doubt, Ai was flushed the moment she felt Mizora's chest against hers-Now she understands the girl's pain. Keeping the kiss going, she was merely enjoying every moment of it!* - Fri Nov 20 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't know that since Mizora didn't explain her body to Ai. She could have only assumed that Mizora was enjoying herself to the max thus giving Ai the O.K to remove her foundation. Now with that free that, she could have teased her lover some more all for the price of giving up on her balance in the process if Mizora decided to use her weight.

Sliding her free hand to Mizora's rear, she grips on to it lightly while wrapping her other arm around her so she could have pulled her much closer to her body. During this intense make out session, she softly whispers whenever she gets the break, "I love you..~"* - Fri Nov 20 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) found herself falling but not too fast. Landing on her back, Mizora was now on top of her to do whatever she liked. She was already in the position she liked, she had no intension to change it now. Moving her legs up-For the knee to be pointing upwards and spreading them so her lover was basically between. Slightly biting down on Mizora's top lip, she returns to the session, if she was luckily, they might have stepped it up a bit.* - Fri Nov 20 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) could already tell that her lover was deep in pleasure, she herself had no intension to stop it since she more or less wanted her lover to experiences love a little more. Stroking through the girl's hair, a soft muffed moan could be heard during this intense session. Tilting her head once against, she changed lips positions thus giving her lover all the control she wanted over her.* - Fri Nov 20 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't stop her! Ai herself needed some rest and air too; panting heavily, she didn't know how long she could have kept that up for but in the end, she was glad that Mizora was satisfied with the results. Her eyes remain shut, she was blushing extremely while her chest bounces-Indeed, her chest was still as flat as the wall.* - Fri Nov 20 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Nnnh... - Fri Nov 20 03:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Yeah... - Fri Nov 20 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles, finally opening her eyes then proceed to rests her head against the girls, "Cute.~"* - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm, Execution, alright. - Sat Nov 21 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) job's today was the murder a prisoner. Unlike before, Ai has changed a lot; her don't give a shit attitude strike fear in the guard's heart since they all knew she didn't like Humans as much as she used to. Arriving to the Prison, her eyes shifts towards the Guards around the door area only leading to her pointing her finger towards the building.

"I'm here to murder a prisoner as requested, I'll make this quick so let's move to the cell, oh, and make sure someone that can put out an fire is around, they might need to.", he told the guards. Both guards remember her from the first time she murdered one of the prisons from before however they would have already realized something else.

Ai's confidences level was rather higher than before, she didn't seem timid towards killing like before-believing the death of one person could have caused such a turn of event in Ai's half. She didn't seem to care much about what they had to say; all she wanted to do was make this quick and of course, collect another mission.

After the Guards confirm it was the real Ai, they shown her the way around the building, to the criminal cell. During the walk there, she had four guards escorting her there-This may be a mission but you may never know when their assistance would be needed-That or an shinobi could have assist with one of the prisoner's escape.

Arriving to the cell, she took note it was empty-from her understanding, they moved him to the forward yard to make an example out of him to the other prisoners so they could have install fear into them. In AI's eyes, that was quite pointless since killing a few will only want them to revolt against them.

Stepping on the yard after an long walk, her eyes narrows down on the target; the follow was a lad that seems to be in his mid-teens with long black hair, white eyes as if he was blind, tattoo around his body while he only wearing a sea blue jeans to his liking. Ai didn't have the time for this so she plan on making it quick.

Waiting on the guards to set up the barrier around them, she crossed her hands while summoning a few sheets of paper. The sheets had fading writing on it as if she made them herself-something you won't see at the weapon shop. Looking at the lad, she gave him a small tip, "Fight me with your all..You might die faster than you think."

She wasn't planning on sparing him or turning away. The death she planned out for him fits her current personality well. The moment the barrier was up, the lad quickly charged at her. In return, Ai let him try to land a few punches but to her surprise, he was a Gate user. Locking up to the fourth gate just to murder Ai.

Teleporting beside of Ai, he attempts to land a punch to the cheek but to his surprise, she turned into paper, the force from his attach alone scatters her around the area. The poor soul wasn't sure of what was going on until he realized his movements where suddenly restrained by..Sheets of papers?

He looks around as if he didn't know what was going on anymore, he didn't know if this was a Genjutsu or an actually jutsu until the real Ai appears at the end of the barrier was if she was planning on leaving it, "He's already dead..", she commented. The moment she left the barrier, all the papers inside suddenly exploded creating a chain of explosive, enough to destroy the ground.

Ai didn't look back at all; she knows the power of her attack. What the guards say was the remains of the fellow around, his arm, head and leg where the only thing that survived the explosion. Flicking her hands towards the guard, she walks away like this was just an average day for her-this was what a broken Ai is.* - Sat Nov 21 06:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Pass it here. - Sat Nov 21 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) arrives to the gate while clearing her hands, she had no reason to rush at all; instead, she took a sit, fearlessly like the shinobi she was. She didn't care much about anything; she was basically a backup guard just in case they needed more man power to assist them with a battle along the lines. 

Normally Guard duty is a rather dull yet dangerous job but it is also something one can use to relax a little while being paid for more. This was a win-win. With her paper scout circling the area, she looks over to the two other guards then told them, "You guys should keep an eye out because I'm here doesn't make much a different."

She wasn't going to lie, they were lax after she had arrived, they know she'll have along of support against any trouble maker so she made sure she told them from now that she wasn't going to assist if they don't want to assist themselves in the process, they'll be her problem once they arrive inside of the village.

Waiting until her time was over sooner or later, she made her way back to collect her reward and certainly, take a good nap since that is needed. She felt a little burn out together due to Mizora of course-In a good way that is. The girl works wonders on Ai's personality so she was a little more kind to Humans.* - Sat Nov 21 06:37:13 2015
