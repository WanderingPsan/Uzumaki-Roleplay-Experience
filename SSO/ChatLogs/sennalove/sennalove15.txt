<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles at her respond-Seems Ai had finally found herself a lovely wife indeed. She didn't want to move from her position so instead of actually getting up, she allowed her papers to do the work for her. Retrieving a black small glass box, she slowly opens it to reveal the ring; A golden ring with an decent to large sized diamond.

The ring itself cost her an decent sum though it was only to best for her lover after all. If allowed, she would have removed the ring from it's container and slide it onto her lover's finger, "I love you.~"* - Tue Nov  3 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles at that last comment-Not because it was funny, because she already had one ready to assist her. Snuggling via her noses into the woman's neck, she whispers to her.

"One is in Suna, he's also my good friend as well, Bryson~"* - Tue Nov  3 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Maybe.~ - Tue Nov  3 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: But, I rather wait a little--At least to the point ya can go inactive and rest for the nine months.~ - Tue Nov  3 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: It has a small chance of failing. - Tue Nov  3 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't the strongest though she could have at least manage her soon to be wife's weight. Sweeping her up, she made her way towards the bed room.

"Aye Ma'am.~"* - Tue Nov  3 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles, she could have tell from the message-That and during the first, it seems as if she didn't want to stop at all. Laying her down on her back, she allows her paper to collect the pill bottles and of course carry them to her, "I know.~ Take them, you'll need it, the second time will have much more pleasure so don't lose control, the condom can tell fail us.~"* - Tue Nov  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods slowly. Making sure the doors were locked, she slides off her own coat-Stripping herself slowly only giving herself in a shorts and the fishnet undershirt.

"Mmmhm~"

Placing her hands on the bed, she crawls up and 'kittens' over to her lover.

"Nyaa.~"* - Tue Nov  3 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pounces! But not like a kitten, more just wrap her arms and legs around the woman while nuzzling into her, "Nyaaa.~" * - Tue Nov  3 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) finally stop nuzzling into the girl. Blushing already, she lays herself down on top of her though not applying enough wait for her to struggle. She whispers in her ears, "I should get the condom now but since we're going to use the condom, I'll need to apply some nature lure.~". Ai figured that it has been at least one month since; she would be too tight for her to assault the young lady without it.* - Tue Nov  3 04:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) quickly performs a few hand seal as a clone appears beside of her. This clone was a complete copy of Ai yet the only different was, this clone was also much weaker than her. 

"This is half my power so enjoy."

Half of Ai's power isn't as lethal as her pull ability yet it is a great training partner for the lower genins. Planting a kiss on her lover's cheek, she have her a small wave before vanishing off thus leaving her with the clone to train with. * - Wed Nov  4 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) also likes to add! She's breathing heavily! And she was heavy since she had +15'000 sheets of paper on her and her own weight.* - Fri Nov  6 00:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still breathing a little heavy, she was currently sweating around and this wasn't from the heated land. Yes, Ai was a guy-Bypassing the woman figure, hair, voice, face...All those features, at the end of the day, Ai was a guy-No surgery. Her body temperature was through the room, at least double her normal amount and raising-Certainly, this was a bad fever.

If they were to remove her coat, they would have notice a small cut on arm's hand that isn't bleeding nor did it looks healthy.* - Fri Nov  6 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Uh..oh... I hope she..- he is going to be fine. - Fri Nov  6 01:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still sick! Whatever that has been down haven't seem to help her at all. She was still in the same condition as before-Only different was that her arm was taken care of. Still breathing heavily, her body limbos like a helpless princess in need-She finally got it, Ai was actually poison through it wasn't an high level poison.* - Fri Nov  6 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: The medicine should delayed the inclination of the fever's severity. - Fri Nov  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) lay there on top of the bed---Hopefully it's soft. The medic was correct again, the poison wasn't at the level whereas it would have actually killed her...Unless not treated over time. It was a slow spreading set so Ai had a lot of time before it becomes fatal-Not to mention it was her it started to spread from, not her neck and any place close to the head.

Leaving the rest to the medics, she remains unconscious while panting heavily as if she was fatigue or had a hard time breathing overall.* - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) slowly regains consiousness, "...Graaah...", she moans softly.* - Fri Nov  6 02:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Can you think of how you might have gotten poisoned? It was from a cut on your hand, it looked like. - Fri Nov  6 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Bandits... - Fri Nov  6 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: The surprise attack with...The needle....Launcher...I'm..Assuming..They were...Poison... - Fri Nov  6 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You idiot... why didn't you get medical help /before/ you passed out, huh..? - Fri Nov  6 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Needles....I..Didn't know...It was..Poison..Until you..Told me.. - Fri Nov  6 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Ah... - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well. You'll be fine. - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: They said it won't be fatal, the medics. - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you just need to rest here in the hospital while being treated for a while.. - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Oh...I'm..Sad.. - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I...Won't be..Able to...Spend...The..Rest of...The...Days you...Have remaining...With you... - Fri Nov  6 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles weakly at her comment-Clearly she wasn't even in the condition to be laughing. Finally, it hit her; before she slowly drifts off due to the poison, she told her soon to be wife one last thing, "Find....Bryson....He..Has the..Power to....Fix this............". With that, she finally lost consciousness once more.* - Fri Nov  6 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was WAAAAY ahead of her.* - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) as currently sleeping--She was sweating, breathing heavily and seems a little red.* - Fri Nov  6 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) suddenly, she felt the sickness from her body lifted as the man removes the poison without much of a problem. Doing the process, her body started to cold down as the redness fades away.

She looks as if she was much better now---Even short after, she opens her eyes, "Bry..Son? Oh, Ketsuki got my last message...Thank for removing it."* - Fri Nov  6 03:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: This is always so hard - Fri Nov  6 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) couldn't believe what she was seeing. This was a little too big of a pill to swallow-The one time she needed to be around to save the MOST important person to her, she failed to. Falling on her knees due to the shock, tears started to flow down her face. She couldn't believe it at all, she had to see the body for herself. 

"This....It  is a joke..Stop playing.."

Crawling over to the tombstone, Ai would have simply started to dig with the assistance of her paper hardening around her hands so she could have used it as a shove since she still lacks the physical strength to do something like that. Unless stopped, Ai would have merely digs like a dog that's missing it's bone until she comes across the body if there was one.* - Fri Nov  6 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was stopped! But this was the only a part of her mental break down. She wasn't even in her right mind to ask who did it, only smash her hands against the grave-Certainly she finally break into tears. Was this a curse? Can't she have something good in her life anymore? Why does this always happen to her.

"Why..Why,,,,WHY!"

She creams as her emotions runs wild this causing her papers to do the same. All sixteen thousand sheets burst out through her scroll and swirls around her wildly-All sheets were solid as steel and was also rather sharp as well. Grinding around the house, the walls and whoever was close to her-Stopping her from digging.* - Fri Nov  6 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) finally stopped through her body language wasn't something Ai would have normally had-This was the Uchiha blood feeling alive at this point. Calmly return her sheets back into her scroll, she gave off an intense killing intent-Something the Pacifist Ai would never have even if the condition seems dire.

"Fine...I'll stop..Just...Please...Tell me..Who did it....I'll..Handle it..Calmly.."

She asked in a average tone yet her face was still down, crying away her sorrows. It's a shitty day when someone's love turns into hate and needs to be directed onto someone.* - Fri Nov  6 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: It was a anarchist from the Heuevo the same one I left to see the other day... but they are dead now - Fri Nov  6 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) Didn't seem to care if it was an accident, the moment she learn that Bryson lied to her about it, the killing intent she had increased tenfold. She wasn't playing no games nor was she thinking about life or anything that she normally believes in. Her mind was only on her dead lover-Fact that she was supposed to have the wedding within a month stings her the most.

"She...Wasn't supposed to die..She...I..I should have..Let her....Stay home..I..Was too..carefully..Tell me..Who did it...I..Want their name..."* - Fri Nov  6 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs softly, she wanted to get this done as fast as she could so she could have relax with her lover at the end of the day. Today, she was planning on teaching the kids about Ninjutsu. She still couldn't understand why this mission was labeled as a B rank but nothing that she couldn't do at the end of the day.

Creating a clone of herself, she figure that she might need that during this class to perform some ninjutsu action while she was teaching the class a few things about it-Main pointers that no one could have missed. Yawning loudly, she and her clone enters the school lazily. She looks around as if she was searching for someone.

This was her plan, the clone display when it needs to while at the same time, give the kids a reason to learn about it-teaching them a basic jutsu could do the trick and she knew exactly how she was going to do such. Just like before, she plans on teaching them then quizzing them at the end of the class.

After she was picked to the class, she made her way there without much of a hesitation however to her surprise, she was only teaching a group of five today. From what she understands from the teacher's summary, they were elites from the class before that didn't seem to understand what ninjutsu was unlike the other students that did.

 "Alright you five, today I'll be teaching you all about ninjutsu so let's make this quick, if you all pass the end quiz, I'll give you all a cool jutsu to practice but team work in the key which means, if one of you failed then you all failed. If you are Elite as the teacher told me than this shouldn't be a problem for you."

Snapping her fingers, she moves across with her clone as they but started to teach the students about Chakra, types of chakra-She had to stop from the bottom before moving up the ranks with them since she didn't know if they knew this or not. She was a little funny how sharp they were when it comings to giving her some attention.

Once she had arrived to Ninjutsu, she had to clone express the usage through simple minds such as using Henge. Giggling softly  while the clone was displaying the technique with a little joke only to get the kids laughing two, she prepare them for the quit she had saved up at the end of the class for them

Lucky for her again, they all passed it with flying colors-As promise, she gave them each the Henge no jutsu scroll to read from while heading off herself. Collecting her report, she heads back to the kage for her reward and whatever else she needed to di-Of course she didn't forget about her lover!* - Fri Nov  6 22:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) picks herself up as she finally reveals her face after such. She didn't care about anything anymore; her eyes were hollow as if she was only a shell, under her eyes were black as her expression was dull. Clearly she was breaking to that point she wasn't the same own Ai-She had finally gave up on this world.

"I'm going...."

Lighting a cigar, she started to smoke slowly-Something she told herself that she will never do while she was with Ket. Her mind was completely focused on murdering, did care for nothing at all-She didn't even care about what Ketsuki would have wanted at this point. She had Konoha to tell the news to as well as the Kage. With a high as hell killing intent, she walks off-leaving the two at the grave.

"Everyone is dead to me now.."* - Fri Nov  6 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Ai.... please - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head, "The church doesn't need me...I will do something regretful, I'm done with everything.."* - Fri Nov  6 23:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: He needs to learn... you cant reason with shinobi... heartbreak is too great sometimes - Fri Nov  6 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) glares at him with an eye as if she was saying 'Release me or else you will join her'. The hatred was carried was enough for her to break her mind set and personality-She wasn't a pacifist anymore-She was more a murderer now. While waiting on him, the sheets of paper from the scroll slowly arise around her-At least three hundred sheets.* - Fri Nov  6 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) flinches slightly to his aura yet she didn't seem to let it bother her too much. Just from his eyes, she could have told that he was going to be someone annoying to deal with unless it turns out how she wanted it. She didn't saw a thing, only allow the sheets to swirl around both of them. Her plan as quite clear. 

She didn't care if he wanted to try anything or not, he was putting himself in a bad situation. Even if her glare wasn't working, it was time to take action-If he didn't release her than he would have realized the papers started to stick on his arm-His body joints and harden as soon as they took position.

Actions speak louder than words.* - Sat Nov  7 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was aware of his attack thus the paper did the rest for her. The moment he was about to strike her directly, he would have find himself hitting a wall of sheets like a hitting a solid metal wall-She was no push over hence why she was considered dangerous-Because of her old self, she lacks lethal offensive skills.

The moment his attack was blocked, she moves her body to the side slightly as the block quickly changed into her binding technique-attempting to bind that hand before he could have withdrawn it. During this progress, he still had the other papers around that was trying to bind him to deal with-Clearly coming this close to Ai is close to suicide.

(Jutsu speed = 15 control, bind strength is Con + Nin against your Tai + strength.)* - Sat Nov  7 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) have sparred with a Hyuuga so she knew exactly how to defeat one; the moment was about to try and break through her sheets, it was rather simply, more paper would have taken their place into protecting her. Him withdrawing was the best thing he could have ever dpne in this situation. Returning her sheets, she allows them to swirl around her body closely.

Since he was away from her, she had no reason to keep fighting so instead of attacking, she walked off-She had other people she needed to murder.* - Sat Nov  7 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) heard his voice again. Gazing back, she was about to say something until she heard his feet steps-Now she was aware--His foot step give away his surprise attack. The moment he was about to strike again, he would have end up smashing into her paper wall once again as it seems like it he wasn't making much progress at this point. She was getting a little more annoyed that he constantly tries to stop her.

"Someone murder your dearest wife, the only person that shows you so much love and comfort in this dark cold world and you want to take revenges for it one way or another. Would you really let someone stop you? I don't really care for your answer, you won't understand until you know the pain I'm feeling..If you're looking for a fight, keep testing me."

She said coldly-It was rather clear that she has been holding back-If he kept on pushing her buttons then his safety might not be ensured at the end of the day.* - Sat Nov  7 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You... leave Ai be! Let him do what he needs to do... your not helping - Sat Nov  7 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was getting tired of this shit, she felt his technique though it wasn't affect her at all, only adding more salt to her wound-He keep on attacking her over and over again until she decided she was going to finally attack back, "You done fucked up....", she said softly. With a single seal, she created two clones of herself.

"Bryson, I'll give you the option, will you stop him or will you let him die?"

She asked. During this little pause, she raises more sheets from her scroll---One thousand more while the clones themselves manic her action and called up on five hundred each-This was literally a gang up since he had three Ai to fight-One was bad enough to handle, now he had three.* - Sat Nov  7 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) stares at him with the eyes of someone being controlled, "I won't be a monster....Accident or not..A murderer will always be a murderer, I'm simply going to take action until that murderer is dead...I can also 'accidently' kill that murderer once I find out who did it.". Clearly, she didn't care if she killed someone, she didn't care about life anymore.

Now she knows how Edge felt when he lost that girl-Why he is that person today. She can understand him at this point-Meaning, she was now at the state, she doesn't care about the health of others-One step closer to darkness.* - Sat Nov  7 02:03:18 2015
