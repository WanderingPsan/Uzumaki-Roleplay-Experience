<br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||What Ketsuki would have felt was something hard and lengthy thus giving her an answer-A feminine male indeed, meaning Ketsuki was still straight. Ai did say it herself that she shouldn't let the appearance or voice fool her, it was just the way she was born and the tradition she carries hence why she doesn't actually cut her hair at all even if she would have only appear to be a woman with short hair.

Tightens her grip on her lover's rear, holding herself back as much as she could, allowing her lover to lead them to happiness. She would have simply swallow whatever saliva she had earn from her lover openly. Pressing her tongue against hers, her head shifts lightly in place while turning for an better angle.

If she was worrying about her eyes, Ai had her closed the moment their lips meet. Like a female, her breathing increases while her moaning remains a little low due to the fact, her lover's mouth was blocking off the sound. Slightly sliding her hands down, she rubs down Ketsuki's rear as if she liked what she felt.* - Tue Oct 27 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) purrs softly to the sensitivity of the girl's knee basically rubbing against her part. She wasn't going to lie, this was burning her out, literally-Het body was steaming hot even if she wasn't sweating much. Ai didn't know what she should be doing but more or less decided she was going to spend one more night with her before actually leaving.

Fidgeting deliberately, she felt as if she was going to explode with lust, love and pleasure though she control and resist letting it take control. Ketsuki wasn't the only one that had first entered a real relationship; this was also Ai's first time though she had already knew everything about it because of her Sensei Fuji.

Cleaning out her mouth via her tongue as if she was asking for more mixed saliva, her hands slides a down her legs then back to her rear and the other up her sides up her figure until it arrived to her hair where she strokes and plays with it.* - Tue Oct 27 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pants lightly, to advance further was all on Ketsuki since Ai was not the type to take catch though Ai had finally open her eyes again---With a lustful stare, it was rather clear that she was ready for some more no matter what it was. Hearing those works from Ketsuki, her lips curves into a small smiles.

"Then have me...~"

She responds in a soft undertone. She didn't care what happens at this moment; all she wanted to know was that Ketsuki was right here with her, making the best out of their lives. After the rub downs, her hands rest at her woman's hips while she waits to see what she had planned for them next in such a heated moment.
* - Tue Oct 27 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) breaths out as she attempts to catch some air and relax as much since they might be doing something that will require a lot of movements. Allowing her to remove the pants, it was strange enough that it wasn't that hard to remove-Once the belt was open, everything else should be a breeze to remove.

Returning to the kissing for the moment until she had to move, she was enjoying every moment on it. Once her pants were off, her part stands tall for her through her underwear. She was undoubtedly blushing extremely at her comment yet her lustful thought completely moves everything on her mind to the back, allowing the girl to do as she please.

Waiting to see what she had in mind, she tries her best to calm herself down.* - Tue Oct 27 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no at the first and second statement, "No, I do understand, besides, I'm doing it with the one I love so it doesn't matter to me how fast we're moving.~", she explains to her-Her honest thought since she was indeed the only person she loves this much. The rod was rather hard like a rock while at the same time, rather warm like the rest of her body.

Giving her another nod, she accepts her request due to the fact it was a quite simple demand though it was nothing out of this world to do. She was had her V card nevertheless at the same time, she knew a little bite about it from books and from what she heard.

Using her finger to stroke against her cheek while Ketsuki bit her lip, she told her, "We'll go through this together, let's have a great time.~".* - Tue Oct 27 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) realized that she lacks a condom-Oh well, pull out game better be strong. Hearing that it was also her first time lifted a lot of weight off her shoulders since she was a little worried that she might not be able to perform at the standard she wants but hearing that, she didn't have to worry about it at all.

"Oh...That makes both of us.~"

Since it was her first, this only means she was worth a lot more than expected. Removing her clothes if she didn't already remove them, her head travels down between the woman's legs whereas she begin to lap her tongue around the woman's gold mine. Using the same method as kissing with her tongue, she tried to get the taste of the girl first before moving on. 

Quickly switching after a few.

Placing the hard rod at the entry, she simply looks at her look to see if she was ready, with a soft sigh, "Let's go....~", she slowly but surely slides it inside-Lucky for her, she didn't miss. Due to the fact the girl was also a vagina and Ai wasn't the best when it comes to physical strength, bypassing her tightness would be a real problem though she know she'll overcome it and provide what her lover needs.

Trying to make sure she wasn't feeling too much pain for her first time, they end up fading into a black screen during the proceed.* - Tue Oct 27 05:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) walks off before vanishing--Body flicker game too real.* - Wed Oct 28 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had arrived into the Konoha forest. This wasn't as bad as though but she was worrying her ass off when it comes to her lover. She knew it wasn't wise for her to leave the girl their alone with that stranger but she promises that you'll try to stay alive. As much as she didn't want to be overprotective, she had to let her do her shinobi work.

"Jesus..Now I know how Sensei feels.."

This was a simple effect of her being in love was all but love can also cause pain and the worse hatred in history was well so she had to be careful during this little time. Trying to take her mind off of her lover's safety without her around, she looks around the forest as her eyes locked on the wasteland ahead.

"Here we are.."* - Wed Oct 28 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) walking through the wasteland-This was her home land so it was rather clear she knows her way around this heated death trap though of course she also knows of the animals that roams this place hence why she had her paper around her just in case she needed protection from any random jump scary.

Sighing softly, she didn't know what to expect once she was back into the village, it's been weeks since she had left it, now, it was only right for her to return home after such a long leave. Using her Suna clothing, she overs herself up from the sand as she made her way through the wasteland-Suna was already in her sight.* - Wed Oct 28 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was looking to the side as if she was thinking about searching for her until she heard what he had to say about that situation. See, this is why people should tell others shit that really happened then give them a small part of it or leave out info like this. Quickly turning her head out of surprise, she notice the tears falling from his eyes, "You got to be..Kidding me..".

The moment he was about to walk away, she quickly tackled him though it wasn't something that was rather rough, only enough to stop and hug him tightly at the same time. She understands his pain, she have felt it before, hell, she even tried to ignore her own problem; indeed, she was doing well until recently after she was put under a genjutsu that inflict double the amount of mental stress on her.

"I..I didn't know..I'm sorry....I understand your pain since I've been through it too..."

Ai had actually almost lose all of her friends, lost her house, fall back intensely, been lied to any many more, she knows how cold this world could be (Hence why the profile music makes sense.)* - Thu Oct 29 03:03:28 2015

Indeed, she had to clear that up before he tried to push her off.

She wasn't stronger than him since she only fights with her papers so of course he was able to push her away. Watching him leave, she hopes that what she had told him comes into effect-Hopefully he puts himself into Ai's shoes and learn from the mistake.* - Thu Oct 29 03:24:48 2015
