<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Come on then. - Tue Nov 17 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shrugs her shoulders, "Anything that I'll remember..Kinda want to drink as much before department..I know Mizora doesn't want me to but just in case, I believe it's wise to.."* - Tue Nov 17 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: I'm not with my real squad...Trill is with me..And I have to save someone with two shinobi that might not know how to be a silence killer...I hope this won't be hell for me.. - Tue Nov 17 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, accepting the fist bump, she smiles back lightly-She could thank Mizora on fixing her this much-At least she was smiling again. Ai could have hold down her beverage quite well-Well..Against the strong type, lets see how she does.

"Don't underestimate them, you'll never know their tricks..I can already see how they'll play this one yet I'll gave to move ahead of you three to recuse her."* - Tue Nov 17 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles again at the comment. She was in Suna during it's darkest time so she knew how shit works here hence why she said the current generation isn't as strong as the older set.

Ordering the bottles, she believed it might be wise if she keeps her drinking rate a little low since when people are drunk, they do or say anything.

Ai haven't felt that before and she doesn't plan on feeling such toward---Shortly after the order, the bottles were brought to their table-Two bottles of each and two shot cups for them to drink from. This was going to be an interesting night.* - Tue Nov 17 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) took the first shoot as it seems she was fine-Luckily. She didn't care about what she wanted to do with the bandits, she made it very clear before that she doesn't like humans including herself-Mizora has also been working on fixing that mind set as well hence why she'll care about her comrades without taking a deed from them.

"Objective first then kill second, once she's safe, do anything you like."* - Tue Nov 17 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "I have a plan, don't worry, as long as you guys listen to my orders, we'll be fine. To suna!". She cheers her drinks. She hasn't felt it working on her as yet but she knows it will work sooner or later.

Taking another shoot, she creates a single paper scout and check up on the build from the outside, more or less warn her while she was inside.* - Tue Nov 17 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) took yet another shoot, "Mmhm, I can turn my body into paper and paper butterfly scouts..With the Assistance of Koji, I'll be able to find room or location, all I'll need is a single sheet with a seal on it to save her..I'll unseal the other papers, use the scout as an eye to keep the awareness around her. Once that was clear..We'll murder them all..". The tactician as speak.* - Tue Nov 17 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ...Anyway. We should stop while we're still sober.. - Tue Nov 17 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) took another shoot-Surprisingly she was not drunk as yet-All them drinking from before have finally getting useful-Suddenly, she was called through the radio.

"Yeah, Hassan is calling, we'll finish soon."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Ai, I don't think what's east of Konoha is them either... And besides, it's on the way. We have to go through the area to the east anyway... to get to the other. - Tue Nov 17 07:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Either that individual bandit is a survivor from their group, or they are camped east of Konoha... - Tue Nov 17 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So maybe we should check out what's east of konoha. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Also I see a lot of corpses. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hopefully they haven't murdered Chikyu. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's probably it, then.. maybe someone else got to our targets before we did, and we just need to get out Chikyu. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: *Sigh*, I'm too old for this shit. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What direction, Mirai? - Tue Nov 17 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are east. - Tue Nov 17 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, it was work time it seems. As planned, she created a shadow clone. Using her head to keep her chakra usage on a minimum, she allows the clones to use her dance of Shikigami technique just to keep everything under control while she relaxes and of course, tries to recover the amount of chakra she used to chakra per say clone.

The clone created six butterfly scouts to her assistance; five scout the area around them for anything-assisting the girl while one acts like an small butterfly however that one clone had a small seal on it as if she was preparing something. Searching the land for the small genin, it enters enemy turf just to learn more about what they were up against.

"Mirai..Pinpoint the genin.."

Instead of preparing for battle, it prepared the girls by giving them both-Well, everyone that couldn't do what the other clones could have a guard; papers started to swirl aroud Trilliam's clones and the two girls not to mention itself. Ai quickly explained, "We're safety tower, you'll fall back to us whenever it's called for and leave the clones to hold things off if we can't handle it. The paper around you is call paper guard, as long as the clone is around, you'll protect you."* - Tue Nov 17 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) questions nature and that random ass bolt striking next to her however the figure would have realized at that point that the person they were talking to where made from god knows how many sheets of paper since her body slits lightly and hardens to endure it. Lucky for her, it didn't hit directly. 

Ai still wasn't afraid exactly and there were many reasons behind of that. After such, her body slowly reforms back into its solid state, "Paper also resists current..Just saying 'God'..Kinda funny when you put everything that has been said together,,", she mutters softly. Gazing at the figure, she goes on to say, "You know....If you had left me in and have me check out this place, everything would have been alright.."

While that Ai was playing around, the other Ai whispers to Mirai if she sees anything else like seals, anything behind the walls, the girl and whatnot-More detail on what was going on with that house-Insisting so much for a group to enter the while they where hinted before to see a fuck load of bodies, random storm, random bolts that hits the ground, random ass with rather high chakra from before? Ai has been through a war, putting all of that together while on a mission that's classify death, she has an good enough reason to be this cautious since she was with a team, not by herself.

"Just take me inside, if everything is good, I'll let the others follow, I've told you that before, it's not hard."

The Ai that almost got burned said.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, she saw it coming but through she still had her sheets of paper around the girls that eat the cookies and drink the tea. She shook her head-As much as she wanted to say told you so, she rather waits and sees. With the comments, "Melee squad..You're free, wild out, Trill, cover them.". While the other clones moves forward to assist.

Hopefully, the butterfly she send to scout the area had found them, if so then the other, other Ai would have pursuit that area while the two Ai was here fighting. With a snap of the fingers, he body quickly slides apart into sheets of papers-She didn't want to attack as yet since the Melee squad was close so instead, she allows her sheets to travel towards the targets with an speed, attempting to bind or show them down enough.* - Tue Nov 17 09:45:48 2015
