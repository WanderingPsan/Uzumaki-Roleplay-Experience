<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Y-Yeah... - Sat Nov  7 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) still had that dead eyes and blank expression. She only accepts his spar because she wanted to test out a jutsu she was working towards since the day she heard about it from the Konoha group. She didn't seem to call up on her sheets nor did she looks as if she was planning on moving right away. Since the attack was airborne, she had to simply manic him.

"....."

Iron Sand Manipulator against Paper Manipulator-Let's see how this goes: Flicking her finger upwards-She was aware of the attack thus sheets of paper suddenly rise up from her scroll into a thick guard as if she was planning on slowing it down while she simply..Turns into paper planes, literally-To scatter and soar upwards into the air.

If she was above safely then she would have simply re-form her head, torso and arms but her legs were missing and looks as if they were made from sheets of paper all together. Hovering in the air, her body seems to have lines and open area-Inside of that area looks like a dense book as if she was made from paper herself.

"Lets..See.."

Allowing the sheets from her sheet and the set from her lower half to spread around the area like a paper storm, she would have simply snap her finger, allowing the sheets to take the form of paper Kunai around the lad at random places-This was an simply attempt as she tries to have them rain down on him from all angles BUT the Kunais were not lethal-If they hit, they would have felt like someone hitting him with sharp stones.* - Sat Nov  7 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was already aware of his attack-She was pushing her jutsu to the max since she wanted to see how well she could have used it while fighting. She had set up a paper scout among the other sheets floating around the armor-Hidden them-That and she saw it coming. The question was how exactly will she stop this, will she use her paper wall again or will she use something else to counter it. Bending her finger back, she would have simply manic his assault.

Allowing the sheets to quickly take the forms of shurikens, she launches them towards his set as if she was planning deflecting them with her own if she could-If that fails then it would have been simply easy for her to quickly switch from the paper shuikens to the paper wall so she could have block off and stop his attack with whatever remaining force it had left

She figure this was going to take her a while to break through his own defend so might as well she tries to in another attempt-Creating a set of swords this time-At least 10; she would have simply tries to stab into his sand armor if they was able to get that close to him, her goal here was to bypass per say armor.* - Sat Nov  7 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was actually one step ahead of the lad-She had already set up her paper scout among the other sheets meaning she knows what was going on around her without looking directly at it. Already saw through his attack; the figure would have simply shattered apart into butterflies along with the other papers she had swarming the area-mixing herself with the other sheets around. 

He was about to capture a decent amount sheets of paper but the question was, if he had captured apart of Ai, if so, what part was able to capture? So many questions though for now, she didn't reform herself this time. Allowing the sheets to return into their normal free paper state, she stated as her voice echoes throughout the masses.

"Can you find me? Do you know where I am? I'm here, there, all over."

With that, she created another set of paper swords but this time, she only created five of them, "Am I a part of this assault or is it normal sheets..Who knows?". Indeed, she was literally playing mind games with him at this point. Permitting the swords to attack him from one direction, he would have realized the other set of swords from before would have joined this assault as well shortly after the first-She was putting her manipulator skills to the test-This would have end up in a test of brains and chakra.* - Sat Nov  7 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) actually believe that was the real Jiki so the moment the paper was able to get a hold of him, she would have simply use her binding technique to hold the clone in place. After this change of event, her upper body finally reforms however her hands were a little short comparing as if she lost half of them or didn't want to reform them. 

Staring at the at whatever was leave, she gave him a small nod like she wanted to tell him the battle might be over the moment she binds him though she didn't want to jump the gun as yet, he could have control the iron sand around him so it was best if she kept her guard up-Until he gives up that is.

During this little pause, she allows her paper scout to be her second set of eyes just in case he wanted to use his sand to pull off the same tactics he did before.

"Give up?"* - Sat Nov  7 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) scout quickly alert her of the large amount of sand he had prepared-She didn't know how she was going to avoid this one so she quickly think of something, she was going to play the stalling game. Her hands reforms below her, as if she was trying to be a little secretive. She quickly created a single clone to assist her with this little tactics she had planned.

Swiftly moving her hands up, she and her clone would have put together in creating a thick large roof on top of them to put a stop to his sand rain jutsu. At the same time, she still remembers that kind of person he was so she believes it would be wise to shatter apart while her roof was holding off the sand-this was only to hide herself from his assaults.

Eye for a scout; The clone itself decided that it was going to join her little tactics so it also changes itself into sheets of paper along with its set of Ai would have normally carried with her. Scattering the sheets all around the area as fast as they can to avoid the sand, she was thinking about an little way for her to stop him from fighting any long-Indeed, she still believes the clone was still the real Jiki.* - Sat Nov  7 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) realized her clone didn't make it yet, she was wondering if he could have still move while he was bind'd by paper. This was going to be a small test for her, she wanted to see what he would have done to the clone. Remaining hidden, she watches from her sheets to see how he would have handle the situation while at the same time, waiting on the clone to play it off well.

The clone struggles in the sand coffin like it was trying to break free, even trying to use the sheets of paper it had to try and create some room-Fail or not, she was struggling either way, she was playing it off well. "Alright..We're both trapped..Is this a draw..?", the clone asked. At the same time, Ai was thinking, "I wonder what will he say..I'm going to surprise him when he less expects it.."* - Sat Nov  7 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) didn't want to give up on this surprise attack. Her and her scout watches around the field like a hawk, waiting for the clone to do something; in the meantime her clone would have tried to talk with him-Seems like no progress was being made at this point. It was only right for her to wait on him to say he gives up or he wants a draw before thinking about releasing it. 

During this time, she tightens the papers bind around the sand clone as her own clone asked again, "This is a draw or what...Talk now!".* - Sun Nov  8 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Or.. I could go vi-.. No.. If I visit Madelyn.. Most likely it'll be the same.. - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She won't remember me.. Plus she'd guarded.. - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Tch... I'll just tunnel into her room to visit her. Fuck that hospital. - Sun Nov  8 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) realized the sand freed the clone-believing it was her win or a draw, her upper body reforms above with her hands crossed-This was a rather interesting battle between the two yet at the same time, it was longer than expected. She didn't think she was having last this long against Jiki at all so this was a plus for her.

"Good game.."

Ai's expression was the same-As her eyes, nothing had changed throughout this battle she had with Jiki though at least she knew what she had to do now---Learn about sealing to assist her the best it could.* - Sun Nov  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'm going to see Madelyn* - Sun Nov  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) dispels her clones as she calls in back her body parts so she could have reformed. When she had all her body pieces together, the trap would have simply deactivate the jutsu-Returning to her normal flesh and blood body, 

"Alright..I'm going to study....Later.."* - Sun Nov  8 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) believes it was best if she started her seal basic training. After that long spar she had with Jiki, it was best if she keep the training will rolling. She had the books she needed for the training so what was better than using her clones to assist her with her studies. She was indeed skill enough to do so. 

Creating four clones of herself, she looks towards the stack of books she needed to study from with an eye of stress-Certainly she was still depressed over losing her lover but she had to at least finish her studies and get stronger-For her sake. She was pretty sure that Ketsuki would have wanted her to live.

Resting her head on the table, she lets the clones takes one book each from the set and read them for themselves-She was at the point she could have gathered Intel from her clones whenever they dispel, the information returns to her right away. Resting her head on the table, she thinks about her dead wife.

"How careless of Suna..I'm done with people...If they performed better..She would have still been here..This is also my fault..I should have avoided the poison needle..If I was around her during that time..She would have still been with me but..I was just too careless..I hate everyone..I hate myself.."

She said softly, a tear runs down her cheek as she thinks more about it. Once the clones finished one of the books, they dispel thus passing on the information to her-She wasn't going to lie, this was literally one of the best jutsu she could have learned in her life time-Seriously. The ability of the jutsu itself was on pick.

That was enough for today, now she wanted to visit her lover's grave and give her the daily conversation and apologize.* - Sun Nov  8 00:32:25 2015

Removing the cigar from her mouth, she goes on to ask, "As for you, why do you wear a fake smile..?"--Then goes back so smoking.* - Sun Nov  8 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) closed her eyes as she listens to him---"Sounds about right..", she mutters softly. A few of what he told her was some of the things her wife would have already told Ai in the past so god knows how much memories was flowing through her head at the time. She needed a drink, that or some weed to assist with her unstable emotions.

"Peace is non-existent..There will never be such a thing..As long as man wants power, money..Envy, greedy, pride..Wrath....Stupidity...Peace cannot exist...You're only wasting your time with that. To me, the life span for the shinobi world is simply 30 years old..Live over that and you can consider yourself a legend....I recently learn all of this after I lost my pacifist ways."* - Sun Nov  8 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) accepts his bargain-Before she did, she check the beverage just in case. If it was clear then she would have drink her problems away. Drinking and smoking-Two good tag team indeed. Using her thumb, she polishes off the whenever excess that was running from her mouth then asks, "Really now..?"

His resolution was moderately noble yet if this was old AI, she would have told him rather moral optimistic remarks but this was the fresh pragmatist Ai so don't expect such a reference from her. Instead, she told him the negatives right away, "You believe you're doing a good job with that? Look on the village's condition.."

Groaning quietly, she adds an additional to the list of truthful complications, "You're doing all of this yet do you believe whatever villagers really cares that much about what you're doing? If you're lucky..They'll give you a funeral.."* - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs-He was literally asking her to remember things she doesn't want to remember so-she was going to give him a quick Summary about her own story but the question was where she'll start this story. 

"Alright. I'll only start at a few months ago...I woke up from a coma, realized everyone I once knew is dead, who that was still alive forget about me or was rather distance. Felt like an outsider in my own village. Over time, I started to make friends again, even got myself a wife until everyone started to die off one behind the other....Funny enough, everyone that had died....I could have stop'd them if I was more aware with what was going on around me yet..There is nothing I could have done. Now my wife died, I gave up on this world, people, myself...I'm only 'stable' now because I believe Ketsuki wouldn't want me to join her so soon."* - Sun Nov  8 17:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods casually, enfolding her fingers around her cup that was presently occupied to Sake then brings it up for a cheers. Randomly, lacking an expression change or any sign of emotion from her eyes, a solo tear streams down her cheek, "Hm....? Oh..". This was from the effect of remember everything she didn't want to remember, one could even say, the tears belongs to someone else. Reaching up with her unrestricted hand, she wipes it away then return to downing her Sake and burning her cigar.* - Sun Nov  8 17:28:44 2015
