<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, astonishingly the child took the news better than her. Once Ai heard that news a few hours earlier, she found herself curled into a ball after she left the scene for god knows how long until she had come to the assumption that she was cursed or should stop letting things like this break her down-Certainly her mental state wasn't the best any longer. She understands the child's confusion about the circumstances as well though she believes they'll be well at the end of the day. She was her Sensei's child after all and her Sensei was her blood distant family so.

She herself wasn't in the greatest state nevertheless, the voice at the back of her head kept on provoking her to assist the child. Squatting down to the child's level, she place her hands upon the child's head gently as she merely tries to comfort her along with the assistance of Bryson before she told her, "Let it out..A shinobi can cry too, they're still human at the end of the day so don't bottle it up kid...It'll only hurt more..".

Her eyes shifts towards Chikyu for a brief moment to see her response to this incident; what she could have gathered base on reactions, she was worried about something. To Ai, whatever she was worried about more or less rotates around this topic. Shaking her head gradually, she proceeds to tell the young teen, "Relax..You seem a little tighten for no reason.."* - Wed Nov 18 10:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Aye. - Wed Nov 18 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) created a clone to assist her with this little training session. Tapping her holster, she summoned up an large scroll she uses to save her sheets and other equipments. Rolling out her scroll, once she removes the sheets, she takes a seat with her legs and arms crossed. This was the basic technique one needed to know when it comes to sealing.

Ai didn't care about how much it would have assist her in battle, during big missions, they would be rather useful than her wasting her paper resources so she made her decision on which she wanted to learn, "Finger carving...Though..You can teach me that and my clone the other.."* - Wed Nov 18 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 18 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods slowly at the fellow. It was kind of funny if it was viewed from outside the box; Mirai's lover is assisting Mizora's-Family assistance if one views it like that. She knew exactly how to execute this technique since she does have to lay her fingers on the sheets if she wanted to use her papers. She also knows fire techniques along with a few sealing techniques she listed before.

She had all the requirements to figure out how to perform this technique better than expected. She didn't want to waste any more time on this so she gazes at her clone with an eye as if she wanted assistance; two heads are better than one after all. Moving over a little, she gave enough space for the clone to join her in this struggle.

Since she rather not destroy her scroll with this technique since she was still going to use it at the end of the day, she taps the back of the scroll container only to summon a weapon-an wide Tanto. Unsheathing the blade, she process to rest it on the scroll so both her and the clones could have worked together on this strange technique.

Since they were prepared, she channels her chakra from her stomach towards her fingertip as it started to give off an heat-Plainly she was infusing her fire chakra with the flow of chakra towards her finger as if she was planning on burning the seal into the blade without reconsidering what was shown to her before.

Her clone on the other hand did something else since the main Ai was too busy trying to inscribe a seal into the blade with her heated finger. Examining Ai's failure, she did the opposite of what Ai did, instead of using fire flow, she used her normal chakra but she increased the vibration of the chakra around the tip as if it was a sonic blade.

Definitely she was engraving seals into the blade but that was certainly incorrect. Ai took note of that failure and simply did something else, something close to what the clone did but this time, she didn't vibrate the chakra, she more or less increase the volume of such however that was clearly an failure again since she was missing something important.

Her clones nods at her attempt, she realized what they were missing-It was so simple, the fact that they even use it whenever they're in a battle-Sharpening the chakra around the finger and enhance it so preform the action. The clone nods slowly from recognizing the main problem why they were failing so much.

Stopping Ai, it tried to do the action itself as if it was showing her exactly how she was going to perform the deed. Imitating what Ai did, it sharpens the tip like a pencil yet softly pulses the chakra on the tip until it was stable enough to write with. Lightly pressing against the blade, the clone proceed to right Ai's name on the blade smooth and easy.
