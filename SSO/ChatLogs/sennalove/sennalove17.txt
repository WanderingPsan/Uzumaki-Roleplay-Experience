<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Thought so. - Mon Nov  9 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Sennalove) couldn't use her scroll so she had to depend on her body during this mission; well until she was able to get her hands on a different color scroll, "Alright.". She wasn't planning on talking through this entire event nor was she planning on letting herself been known to others since she was an Anbu after all.

She had to be careful when she plans on using her paper jutsu. In this condition, she was going to slaughter others so this would have been an tolerable situation for her to use her techniques. Once they have arrived to the village, she gazes at the two then gave them a nod, the information she got from Koji was enough for her to make a tactics from it.

"Leave the rest to me..We'll have to make this quick..Really quick..I'll have my scout take out anything that will give us away ...The guy at the door is mines and the boss guy once you two handle the other guards....You two.....Aim for vital spots, cover their mouths so their voices can't be heard..". She replies through the transistor. She didn't want to alert them so she used 'black' sheets of paper.

Once she had gave them the order--Well, the strategy, she believes they would be able to finish the job swiftly through what she had just said. Now that everything was prepared, her body started to break away, leaving only her torso, arms and head as hundred, thousands, of sheets spread throughout the area silently and stealthily.

Using a few sheets to create her small butterfly scouts, she allows them to enter the build slowly in search of anything like a radio, cam and Etc. If they found anything then without a doubt, they would have simply transform into normal sheets, bind them and crush them with a force-certainly this had to be out of the guard's eye sights.

After that was complete, she allows her sheets to leave the shadows with a speed-binding the lad from head then to toe. She made sure that his mouth was cover along with his noses-clearly this was to stop him from many any more noise while at the same time, restraining his movements and choking him until his body shuts down and dies due to the lack of oxygen.

During this process, she didn't want to keep him at the door so instead, she moved him away from his guard post into the darkness to suffer and die-painfully. Once he was dead, she whispers through the radio, "One down..Finish the other two..We'll handle the bodies after worths..". Giving them the element of surprise, she wanted to see how fast the two would have been able to kill the other two without making much noise.* - Mon Nov  9 04:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) inhales softly-She haven't visit her lover's grave as yet since she wanted to pretty herself up enough before so. She didn't want to go to her grave looking like a heartless emo---looking like an emo is enough for her. Creating a few clones to assist with her studies again. She was getting quite close to half point of her studies.

Tackling the books with her clones, she narrows her eyes on the words and instruction while at the same time, playing with the tip of her hair. Her expression seems flat out impassive while her eyes were still muffled. Clearly she was still mentally damage from the event with her wife and as she said-she was unfixable.

Closing the book, she had to prepare herself well for her daily visits while allowing the clones to finish the job for her, "Read up…Hopefully you all..Finish the books and scrolls before I change my close..". She told them. Change her clothes as in, she had plans putting on another suit that was fresh after her shower.

Leaving it to the clones, they quickly scan down the books and scrolls afore starting to work on the different formulas they need to understand this. They had the mind of Ai so they know what a time limit is. Swiftly  finishing off the work that was stacked on them, they relaxed a little as the main body returns.

With a new pair of clothes, her hair in a ponytail, she turns towards the clones therefore giving them the opportunity to do as they like-They were Ai's clones after all so this only means they dispel themselves thus feeding the main body the information from the clones. This price was a small headache but this would something she needed in a long shot.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs again, she didn't want to help this girl yet she might as well assist her a little-Clearly, she wasn't going to reach out and do everything in her power to help her. Snapping her fingers, she allows the sheet of paper to arise from her scroll only to slide under the girl therefore lifting her up. "This is the only good deed you'll get from me.."

Appearing in front of her, she literally grab her cheek-Attempt to force her mouth open so she could have simply toss a pill down throat, "Take that..It'll heal you rather soon..". She comments. If all of this was successful, she would have felt the effects of the heating pills rather soon. To make sure she didn't die before that, she walked her to the hospital on her paper bed so the doctors could have patched her up while the pills work on her wounds.* - Tue Nov 10 01:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shrugs her shoulders, "Yeah..Whatever..". If she believes she could have recovered with the pill's assistance fast enough without doctor's assistance then that's all her. Permitting the paper bed to remain until she had enough strength to get off, she heads back into her counter to watch the other spars.* - Tue Nov 10 01:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) returns to her room for the daily studies. She believes she might make some progress today without much of a distraction. Certainly she plans on visiting her wife's grave rather soon though at the same time, she wanted to leave a clone in charge of the house while she was gone. Creating up to three clones, she prepares herself for the studies.

With the assistance of her clones, she made her way over to the heavy books as they all put some backbone into it-the lift the books they needed-All four books what were made from at least one thousand sheets of paper-It was that thick. Setting them down, the three clones and the real Ai started their research.

They made a plan, thee studies more about seals and two do the formula to perform basic sealing. Certainly Ai would be the one to make the formulas with a clone, leaving the studying to them since whatever they learn transfers back to her at the end of the day. Swiftly performing the basic sealing with her clone while the other reads through the book.

She realized that progress was not being made during the good hour they were studying for, the clones only finish half the books they were reading while Ai herself couldn't even figure out the idea of basic sealing since they all seem the same to her.She wasn't going to through in the towels just yet though she plans on waiting for the other two clones to finish the book.

Another three hours later, they were about to make somewhat of a progress therefore she could have called it a day even if she was not the one to make that per say development. Dispelling the clones, she gains all the knowledge the clones as obtain from the book and assisting-Giving the figure a better understanding on what she was doing wrong.
