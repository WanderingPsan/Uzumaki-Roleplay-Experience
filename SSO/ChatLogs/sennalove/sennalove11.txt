<br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I wonder did I mess up again during interaction? - Sat Oct 24 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at his attempt as the papers falls, at the moment it was his stamina against how much paper she had on her-She had a lot so she was pretty confidence in herself. The moment she realized he wanted to make some more progression, she increased the rate of the papers she adds to the wall from two per a second to five in per a second AFTER she ships another hundred to support it.

Making sure the thickness of the wall holds, she wanted it to be exactly as it looks; an unmovable wall. With her palm pointing towards the guard, she keeps her pressure up as it seems like a war between a defensives player and a offensive player, who can break who first.

"Running out?~"* - Sat Oct 24 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) Shook her head no; She was barely scratching her paper supplies. She already could have guessed how this was going to end however she didn't lit up at all. This wasn't a training session anymore; this was a game to see who will run out first. Flicking her fingers twice, she calls forth another hundred sheets of paper. 

It may not seem like it but she had a backup plan just in case he somehow outlasts her which will be revealed later on. For now, she keep piling them on to strength the wall so he doesn't break through it whatsoever.

"Nope, we'll see how this goes!"* - Sat Oct 24 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) seems as if she was running low on energy as the paper rate slows down gradually; she still have the paper supply however what she didn't accounted for was her own Stamina to keep this up. Breathing a little heavy, she laughs to herself a little as it seems the lad was starting to make more progress through her wall slowly.

"Shit..I forget I'll also run out of stamina soon as well, well damn, didn't saw that one coming."

Putting some more energy into it, she force herself to gather another set of papers to slow down his progress, even stop it if she can for a little longer-Believing that he'll be the one to run out before she does.* - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves back slowly, she figure she needs to put more back bone into it however she had already hit her limits and it was proven due to the amount of papers she could have placed in front of the wall. Stepping back, she struggles to keep herself going before her paper protection slowly fails her-Before she knew it, her body caved in on her.

"D-Dammit..I need to..Work on my stamina...Pff..You won this round.."

Better it happened now than push herself to literal death.* - Sat Oct 24 09:33:00 2015

She was no pimp so she knew how to fight if something where to happen even so, her goal was not to pick a fight, it was supposed to be keeping up with the asshole.

"Fuck!"

Kind of wise she was better when it comes to sensory or even was able to sense chakra would have been great but she has to use what god able her. Finally leaving the waste land, she leaps through the trees in search of that shinobi she needed to tag along with and hopefully, she finds him before some shit happens resorting her to killing again.* - Sat Oct 24 19:57:39 2015

She would need to take a rest stop seen even if she was close to arrive to the village. Taking a stop, she looks ahead to spot Konoha.

"Alright.....West now.."

Indeed, that was all she had left to do, that was to travel to the west after arrive to the village though she wanted to take a small break in Konoha and rest a little due to the fact she has been running and using Shunshin the entire time, skipping through, she makes her way towards the village as a rest stop.* - Sat Oct 24 20:04:28 2015

Oh and I'm not a lady, I'm a guy, don't let my face, body and voice fool ya.". Indeed, she wanted to clear that part up beforehand while waiting on her food to arrive.* - Sat Oct 24 20:22:24 2015

"When will my passport expire? How long do I really have before I need to return? Gonna shop for some more items while I'm out."

In a fairly clear penmanship.* - Sat Oct 24 20:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) snaps her fingers once as a single sheet of paper arise from her scroll than bends and forms itself into a rose. With a flick of her fingers, that rose slowly made its way into Ketsuki's hair--Placing itself correctly, "Your lucky day, uh?"* - Sat Oct 24 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: People love fighting... - Sat Oct 24 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles a little, "You're quite lucky today, aren't you? Meeting someone from another village, someone with a strange profession, someone that has something against fighting and that person's story.", she puts it all together. She didn't really care if she shared this since this was nothing that can be used to hurt her.

"Alright, listen well. When I was a mere child, I was from a clan located in the land of fire, close to this village. My clan was a rather violent clan that believes the weak will die and the strong will rise, violence and bloodshed was a thing for them, that turn'd them on.. As a child, you grown in a clan like that, you believe you'll gain some of their teachings no? Seems I was different due to the fact my mother was not apart of that clan so she teach me otherwise. The scars from watching innocent citizen dying in front of me turned me avoid it. I believed everything desires life, fighting shouldn't revolve anything, it only brings more pain and suffering..Thus continuing the chain of hatred....Don't get me wrong, I'll fight to protect myself and others IF it's needed, someone show'd me that back in the day." * - Sat Oct 24 21:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But yeah...I think a tournament could be good. - Sat Oct 24 21:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We need to also give a prize at the end...I had two ideas. - Sat Oct 24 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: First was a monetary prize...Half a million. - Sat Oct 24 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The second would be a final fight...a shot at the Hokage...aka you. - Sat Oct 24 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The entry fee could either be five thousand or ten thousand...although it might need to be more if we go for the first prize. - Sat Oct 24 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs at that last comment, "It's really hard to...Because of my nature....In my life, a lot of people died before I was too soft to actually help more however I'm not a long term fighter, I'm more of a one shot person....Controlling over ten, a hundred thousand and more sheets at once gives me all the advantage. Though, I promise myself this, as long as I can, I won't let anyone comrade died around me...This world is cold you know."* - Sat Oct 24 21:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Or if they don't want that, I guess we can also give the half a million prize. - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Mmm..Need a cigar. - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can provide that if the village can't... - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I can provide. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ok then. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We could also set up some fun little competitions like strength and speed competitions. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Stuff that people can try and prove themselves against others with, people like that. - Sat Oct 24 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Mhmm. - Sat Oct 24 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Good. - Sat Oct 24 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The sudden silence...Rather strong isn't it? - Sat Oct 24 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh... - Sat Oct 24 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So how is being a paper manipulator? - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Helpful. - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I remember the one from here was...kinda weak. - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Weak how? - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well...She was made of paper so... - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Pretty much everything could hurt her... - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Wait, made of paper? That seems... very odd. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fire...water...wind...earth... - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I've heard. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess with a style like that she'd be very reliant on dodging. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Avoidance. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Long Range assault. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I haven't seen her since Suitengu died...guess she died with him. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She should have invested into defense. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Paper...defense..? - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, I don't really see how that works. - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: If you know what you're doing, paper can he as hard as earth, sharp as wind and whatnot. - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...and as flammable as fuel... - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: All depends if that fire user wants to take the chance. - Sat Oct 24 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I would. - Sat Oct 24 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well, against me, it won't work unless you're better than I am when it comes to chakra control. - Sat Oct 24 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd still take the chance. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm pretty confident in my own abilites. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm only assuming the one here focus on only offensive techniques. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Meh, Any technique can be offensive if you use it correctly. - Sat Oct 24 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hehe, well said. - Sat Oct 24 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I should get going back to the mansion. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: See you all later. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Bye mum. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Later. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hey Zeus. - Sat Oct 24 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Sat Oct 24 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Made of paper uh..Hmmm, sounds stupid from a front view but...From inside of the idea...She could be quite powerful..Just don't know how to use her own power I'm guessing. - Sat Oct 24 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I should probably go get to training. I'm a little off, after all... Mrm. - Sat Oct 24 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hey Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 24 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Come around the Mansion more, Me and Hana are always there. - Sat Oct 24 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Yeah, sure. - Sat Oct 24 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mm..I think I might look around the village a little since I'll be there for a day. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Actually- I don't supose either of you would care for a sparring match, for training purposes? - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh.. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Maybe kiddo. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Kiddo? We look about the same age, y'know - Sat Oct 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: True, just a bad habit. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mind if I watch..? - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Regardless. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll be out in the training field, if anyone cares to join me!~ - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Come. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, you both came? Well, a'right then. - Sat Oct 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well, I wanna see what Miss Ketsuki can do. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Don't expect my all though. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll just be over here...I don't really allow myself to spar... - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. that's good- cus I'm not really that good, y'know? - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Forget to eat...DAMMIT! - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles back at her, "You're quite cheerful.", allowing her sheets of paper to arise and swirl around her slowly, she didn't know what exactly did the girl had planned for her so before time, she enclose the sheets around more making thick lays off defensive-Just like the spar with the Hyuuga, she was simply going to create guards for the girl to try and bypass-Training her own technique while at the same time, training the girl's.

"Go I guess."

With the rise of an eye brow, she realized that the area was now empty, no one was around yet she keep her defends tight just in case she wanted to pull off a surprise attack of any sort. Looking over to the left, her eyes glance something-It was her sensei? "Senpai? How the hell..--!", cutting herself off the moment she saw the man being raided by a sudden barrage of kunai, too fast for her to really reaction to him though end up killing the man.

".....What..The.....I....."

Indeed, she was captured in the genjutsu.* - Sat Oct 24 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was still in the genjutsu loop of watching everyone she knows and love died in front of her eyes? This is sort of adding salt to her recent mental wound. Where is that shringan?! Ai had to sit there and watch everyone die in front of her she couldn't even move to save not even one of them leading her to slowly but surely cry.

The girl's attempt to bypass her paper lay had failed-She would have realize why she told them her paper was as strong as earth, maybe stronger. For her, it felt as if she was trying to bypass an iron wall though because the user was currently unaware of what was going on around her, the girl had as many attempts to try and bypass it without any reaction.* - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was finally released but it was a little too late, she saw too many things, damaging her mentally. Falling to her knees, her breathing was suddenly heavier as the tears falls from her eyes. She already heard the girl and knew her location so instead of even attacking or anything along that line her paper adds on to the defend at that location, tightening it even more.

"Genjutsu..I..I saw too..Much things.....Things..I..Don't want to relive or..See again...."

This was the second time she have been in a genjutsu, the first time was with the oversize worm that was said to be larger than a tail beast and now this girl. She didn't know if she could have finish the spar mentally due to the damage she had obtain but let's see how this goes.* - Sat Oct 24 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no---Indeed, she could continue since it was only a mental damage yet it would have destroyed her focus as it already started to affect her jutsu. The papers suddenly loses their formation, returning to their standby state while the girl was still on her knees; wiping away tears.

"I-It's fine..I'll learn from it.."

Her guard was still up nevertheless she was still not going to attack the girl-Her fighting style which rotates around nothing much defensive measurements. Looking to the girl, she shook her head again and told her, "No..It's fine..Use it, it's a reliable jutsu...Master it."

Something such as that could have been rather lethal on someone who didn't fight exactly like Ai or any sand user.* - Sat Oct 24 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right then! - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let's have fun, then, so you don't have to think about that stuff! - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) papers closed in on the user. It was a little safety measurement but she believes the spar was over at the very least so instead of doing anything out of there, she withdraws her papers then looks up on the girl, "And..What will that be..?"-Definitely, under her eyes were black as well.* - Sat Oct 24 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles faintly, she could have figured out that she was putting her all into this so she couldn't blow her off just yet, "Ice cream...Sounds like something I would have done with the kids...But I'll pass on that..Something? Something like? And what I do for fun..I really don't do anything for fun other than stand around and talk.". Suna wasn't as fuck as it looks if you're not training or on a mission.* - Sun Oct 25 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm... - Sun Oct 25 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Wanna get something to eat? - Sun Oct 25 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure.  - Sun Oct 25 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Order anything. - Sun Oct 25 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, meal's on me- I'll pay. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Whadaya want? - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No, no. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll pay. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I insist. I always pay for food if I'm around for a meal! - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 's What I do! - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Today you won't. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ehhh? Come on! Are you reallyy going to insist that you not accept someone else paying for a meal, huh? - Sun Oct 25 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "More a gentleman's thing. I asked you out, I'll pay for the food so order anything, it won't cost me as much as you think."* - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) tilts her head to the side and smiles-At least she was smiling again, "Could be, maybe it is.~", certainly she was teasing as well. She could get her mind off of what she had seen for now but it doesn't mean she'll forget about it at all; it'll only haunt her in the near future. Calling for a menu board, she waits to see the girl's responses.* - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) leans in closer; she gave her a genuine smile then nods, "I will but I'll also need you to do the same to me as well, be careful, I'm quite fragile.~", she replies kindly while sliding her hair behind her ear.

This was her first time in Konoha so she didn't know what to order really or where to stay--Since all the foods there much different from what they eat in Suna.

No Lizard or anything on this list at all.

Since she had no idea what she needed or order, she would have ordered the same thing the girl was, it was better that way, no? Turning to the waiter, she listed what she would have liked from them, "Alright, I would like to order two Spicy Miso Soup with ramen and meat, one large cup of ice cream, two bottles of water, one bottle of sake and one bottle of juice. All in five star quality please."* - Sun Oct 25 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at her, well, now she knows why she is more defensive than offensive; it's because she can't take a hit at all. 

Waiting for the order to arrive, she removes her scroll filled with paper and a single tanto before placing it aside and away from harm but of course the scroll was a little open so she also didn't could be able to summon her sheets of paper just in case anything were to happen at all and she'll need to protect the two.

Rocking lightly, she goes on to say, "Well, why don't ya tell me about yaself? You already know a lot about me, no?"
* - Sun Oct 25 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) crosses her hands and think about a question to ask her.

"Well, best if I ask, what's ya favorite things? Like color, food and whatnot. I do need to remember them.~"

Of course, this won't be much of a problem for her to remember.* - Sun Oct 25 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks about an response for the first comment but let's be honest here shall we?

"Maybe?~ That answer is up to you.~"

Listening to what she had to say, she kept everything, all the important information saved in her brain so she could have used them on a later day-Like someone wanting to abuse Henge no jutsu and try them to believe they're who they are. After taking down all the info from the girl, she leans back as it loads.

"Who says I'm not having fun, this is actually the most fun I've had in a while, maybe after this, I might not need to think about smoking anymore.~"

Her life could be rather stressful at time so it doesn't hurt to always have a cigar on you.

While they were in the middle of their conversation, the food have arrived-Best quality the village had to offer lied out in front of them.* - Sun Oct 25 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) flinch slightly-That she didn't expect at all. From a surprise to a smiles, she also blushes lightly and nods, "Then It's settle and I'm also glad you're having fun as well.~". Something she never thought out have happen since her appearance only mislead people to believe she was an actual female and not a male. Bryson was right at the end of the day.

Once she food had arrived, she was about to dig in before she saw the girl's expression. Using her finger to over her mouth, she tried her best not to giggle at her.

"Cute.~"* - Sun Oct 25 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs quietly, she seems rather relief but at the same time blissful. The girl did a rather good job cheering her up though her finger slides under her cheek smoothly afore reaching for a napkin. Gently wipe away whatever leftover was currently on her face, she nods at her responds, "Indeed, you are really cute, cutest in Konoha alright.~"

Removing her finger, she finally decided she was going to take a eat hers yet she started with an open mind. Once she realized the food was good, she exhales happily. It was much better than what she could have gotten in Suna, not to mention the price were much cheaper comparing to Sunas.

Rocking from side to side lightly, the aura, her body language was quite leveled as if she was cheerful; it was even lighter than the first time they both meet.* - Sun Oct 25 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) , "I won't, don't worry.~"

Ai had actually finishing with her bowl within a few moments even if it didn't look as if she wolfed it down; resting the chop sticks aside. Now waiting on her, she caught her hair into a ponytail so it didn't bother them as much. She proceeds to run her head upon the girl's shoulder as she does feel rather comfortable around her.

Waiting on her to finish, she closed her eyes and listens to everything she had to say-Believe it or now, they had a lot of food ahead of them, they have the ice cream and whatnot left to eat/drink.* - Sun Oct 25 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at her comment about the ice cream, "Well, yeah, it's the reason why I order'd one large ice cream.~". The only reason why she other one bottle of sake, water and juice was before she didn't know what the girl wanted to drink or likes to drink often so she picked the one of all so she could have pick and choose which she liked.

Ai only ends up blushing as well the moment she realized that the girl wanted to feed her. She had already true the girl enough to completely drop her guard so, might as well-They are supposed to be dating now after all, no? Just like the girl, she proud accepts her feeding offer with her cheeks red as pepper.

Closing her mouth over the spoon, she let the ice cream melt out a little before swallowing. Turning to the girl with the cutest embarrassed expression, making it even harder to believe this was a male. Preparing herself for more, "Y-You enjoying yourself, right?" * - Sun Oct 25 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) breaths easy; she wasn't normally the type of personal to be very exciting for others though she was just a different type of person that puts others over her own safety now and then. Still blushing heavily, she accepts another spoon full from the girl and her saliva that should still be on the spoon as well. This was similar to a heaven for her, it was a little sad that she won't be able to stay here forever with her new lover.

During their little date, the messager bird had finally arrived with her feedback. Landing onto of her scroll that was placed aside, she looks down with a loud sigh and finally checks out the message, "Dammit..Why now...Hopefully this isn't abo-", Cutting herself short, she reads the note then smiles. 

"Good goof."

Laying down, she rest her head in her lover's lap and of course let the note remain on the table if she wanted to read what it had to say.* - Sun Oct 25 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no, "Not exactly, I'm here for only a month it seems..Knowing the kage, that month will end up into two weeks since we're currently performing the Chuunins exam but its Suna only.".

She wanted to suggest a few things like coming with her but she thought about it and believes it might not be smart to take her away from her village.

The hardest part about this was that she needs to find the person she left out with meaning she might have to actually head to Kumo.* - Sun Oct 25 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) purrs softly, "I like it down here.~". 

Her suggestion does make a lot of sense if you look on it from the other-side in though leaving the village often will cost her along-nothing a few A rank mission can't fix. 

"By the way, sweetie, if any happens, I want you to stay safe alright? Avoid as much lethal battles, I know I'll be able to keep myself alive long enough but I'll be worrying about you each day I not around so please, stay safe..If this village falls again, come to Suna and find me."* - Sun Oct 25 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs quietly, she understands though that worries her more. She didn't understand what she meant by the village following though as long as she remember what she had told her today, everything will be alright..At least that's what she wants to believe. Reaching up, she rest her finger against her cheek before slowly yet softly she strokes.

"Good enough but don't be afraid to call on me, I might take a while but I'll get here."* - Sun Oct 25 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Good.~". She was right there, they barely knew each other yet they knew each other..That makes sense right? Finally getting back up, removes a sheet of paper and started to write on it. If the girl wanted to see it was, "Yo, Bryson, sorry but I'm out of the village for a while meaning you'll have to teach Moko English without a translator. I have two week to a month here to buy some healing pills and other pills. Do you need anything? And if shit happens in Suna, bird me quickly."

Letting the note roll itself up, she gives it to the bird and set it free!* - Sun Oct 25 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few time-She didn't know how to react to this at all, this was the first time someone was drunk or getting drunk around her.

"Y..You sure you can handle that sweetie? I mean....It can be too strong for you."

She was the type or person that didn't want to end other's fun unless it was getting out of hand but she didn't know as yet so she wanted to see her answers.* - Sun Oct 25 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't a rocket science but she knows when someone was drink just by the way there behavior switches. Sighing playful, "Good goof..", she held on to her hand and leads the ice cream back into the cup, "Come on, rest a little, I'll have to take you home to sleep off the sake.", wrapping her arms around the girl, she pulls her in for a simple hug which leads into cuddling.

"Thank you for today, it's been years since I've enjoy myself this much so I thank you for that..Just to make things clear, what you did for me today is too much for me to simply repay the favor so I'll do my best to be the greatest boyfriend for you despite my appearance."* - Sun Oct 25 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) tilts her head slightly at the last statement, "Don't have one?", she asked-Come to think about it, Su's house now belongs to her since he died for a stupid reason. 

Waiting on her answer, she strokes her finger through the girl's hair in the meantime-basically trying to get her as comfortable as possible.* - Sun Oct 25 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) started to question how Konoha works. She knows the village was already rebuilding from what had happen but what she didn't know was that they could have sleep in the academy? This was nothing like Suna at all, you sleep outside if you lack a house but at the very least, you won't be alone.

She was her girlfriend after all and she believes she needs a space for herself.

"How much do you need for a house here? I know it's good for you but you also need your own space and whatnot.".* - Sun Oct 25 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, she didn't believe it will actually be holding her down though she'll finally have some use for her money. 

"Seems your day is just keep on getting better and better uh? Let's go house shopping, my girl should be sleeping in the finest style.~"

She wasn't joking, if the houses in Suna where around 40'000 and that was for the best of the best, she was wondering how much a house here should be since this village isn't as developed as Suna. Let's find out soon enough. "The person we need to talk with is the Hokage, he should be the person I'll sell us the house, after that, I'll stack it up for you."* - Sun Oct 25 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) pulls her in a little closer, "Mmhm, I'll carry you if you want to sleep, you're not heavy afterall.~"

First thing was first, she needs to pay for the food so she did just that, passing them her Shinobi credit card, she had them check out the cost for everything before taking back her card.

"Come on, we're get you a play to stay.~"* - Sun Oct 25 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) removes one hand from around her so she could have held on to her legs instead-Hopefully she wasn't heavier than she looks. With the tilt of the head, her scroll lift itself off the ground and follows closely behind of Ai. 

At the same time, a few papers from that scroll found themselves carrying the girl's tanto with them. Speed wasn't a problem for her since she was also a body flicker master, the only main problem she had at the moment was to find the hokage on time.

"Hold on tightly, alright?"* - Sun Oct 25 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yo, kid. - Sun Oct 25 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Haii Takeda. - Sun Oct 25 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Do you know where the Hokage is..? - Sun Oct 25 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Day dreamining uh? - Sun Oct 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Should we wait on him? - Sun Oct 25 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Eh. He's probably pretty firmly passed out, mhrm.. - Sun Oct 25 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alrighty.~ - Sun Oct 25 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: .... - Sun Oct 25 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.... I guess the Kage is probablyyy passed out. - Sun Oct 25 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mhm. This symbol.. - Sun Oct 25 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm...? What about it..? - Sun Oct 25 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: History for me. - Sun Oct 25 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... that so, huh? - Sun Oct 25 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: .... I wonder why.. - Sun Oct 25 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmmhm, the members of this clan are still wanted? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wanted..? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Nani? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The eyes. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... sorry, I thought you meant criminally. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nah. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I wanna tell ya something but I don't want ya to freak out or be afraid of me. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Of course. You can trust me. - Sun Oct 25 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm from this clan but..The outer shell, my clan symbol is on the back of my suit, close to the neck. - Sun Oct 25 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles a little, "I'm assuming that's why we get along so well.". For a Uchiha, she wasn't what you would have expected though during the Suna struggle state, Uchihas and Hyuuga were wanted for their eyes hence why she always wear her lens and have her hair down over her clan symbol.

"Meh, still don't mean much to me really.~"* - Sun Oct 25 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||At this moment, she couldn't help it but to hug the girl while she was looking over at the lake. She honestly believes that the cousin incest was going to bother her lover however she was glad to hear that from her.

"I..Really like that, thanks, I thought it would have bother you.~"* - Sun Oct 25 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no at the first statement, "I didn't at all but it doesn't matter now~", she was one of the first Uchiha she knew that doesn't wear any sort of lens. But all seriousness, Ai care not about that fact they are family at all-As long as they weren't from the same parents or family tree, she had no problem with them at all.

Pulling her in a little more closer as she leans in herself, "..Really...Now?..~".* - Sun Oct 25 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) chuckles a little, she started to believe that this girl might still be a little drunk from the way she was talking but that was her teasing. Closing her eyes, she enjoyed each moment of it. 

Rocking with the girl in her arms-Well, close to her body slowly, she responses softly, "Oh? I see, I'm glad then, now I know I should keep my body health for ya.~"

Clearly she was joking around at this lovely moment. Both were happy with each other, nothing else matters at the moment.
* - Sun Oct 25 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sweeps her up off her feet so she could have carried her brides style; turning around with the young lady in hand, she was planning on carrying her to a house or a inn-A place both could have actually catch some Zs.

"Alright, renting a room for tonight them. One bed or two beds? You decide."

Before leaping off with the assist of body flicker.* - Sun Oct 25 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: As you wish.~ - Sun Oct 25 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||After paying for the room from a long yet short search for a one bed house, it seems they only had two bed houses in this village so might as well they take the one with a little better class.

"We have two beds however I believe we're only use one.~"* - Sun Oct 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) made her way over to the first bed she saw as she slowly sets the girl down on top. Setting aside all her equipment and even her papers-Bagpack and what not, she takes a seat beside of her lover then stated, "Hm, I have two jutsu I wanna teach you and We'll need to get ya some more clothes so shopping and jutsu later~"* - Sun Oct 25 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) found it a bit funny how she hasn't realized it until now. Her lover was wearing a coat then she remembers her black reaper coat was left with Moko before she left. Believing that it should be in good hands; she removes her white jacket, leaving herself in a thick fish net undershirt, she then puts it aside. Replacing her pants with shorts, she crawls into bed like a kitty.

"What other resting do you have in mind?~"

Two can play that game of course. Coming for a sudden halt, she forget to catch hair up into another pony tail to keep it straight and probably easier to fix in the morning, she removes her small necklace and place it on top of her scroll while waiting on her response.* - Sun Oct 25 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) leans in a little closer to it, the young lady did earn herself the kiss during the date and lucky her Ai, she seems like the type of woman she could invest into. Wrapping her arms around her tightly, she gave her a small nods as if she was saying she approves of the idea though during that, she was blushing faintly.

Moving her head closer to her lovers, she wanted to see if should would have meet her part way for the bedtime kiss!* - Sun Oct 25 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) || Just by that, she could have tell that her lover was excited as well as herself however she could have already tell that her lover wasn't the greatest kisser at all. Moving herself a little more closely, she decided that she was going take the lead on this one. With a slight tilt of the head, she would have shown her lover a little more about kissing.

Brushing their lips together while pushing it was only one part of a kiss so she had to show her the other though at the same thing, not take it a little too far. Positioning their lips by slightly moving her top lip between hers, hopefully she'll be able to actually switch positions with her partners, she started to move her lips in a simply method.

This little method would have applied a little more feeling to it that and the small effect if doing it like this though over a time, she would have switched from bottom to tip if allowed though at the same time, wanted her lover to mimic her actions.* - Sun Oct 25 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) lightens herself a little more, all the tension she had finally left her doing the heated moment. Unlike her lover, her chest was quite flat though she lies upon her with one hand balancing her or you can say, reducing some of her weight while the other was slowly rubbing down the side of Ketsuki's body.

At this state, she believes her lover had learned what she needed to thus returning the lead back to her. As much as she didn't want to take it too far, this moment was something Ai haven't had in years so of course her mind would have gone blink to it. With a small twist, she brushes her lip against her lover's bottom before giggling.

With a little moment, she slightly bit her lip though nothing to cause any harm before resuming her kiss with her. Moving her lips moments leisurely-something along the lines of lip massaging, she shares each and every moment with her exciting lover.* - Sun Oct 25 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yo? - Sun Oct 25 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few times, she couldn't understand what the hell is going on so just in case shit happens, she calls up on a few sheets of paper to protect herself with. She didn't know what kind of murder happened here so instead of rushing to the lad's aid, she looks around the room for signs of blood, bodies or anything else-Just to figure out what had happen here.

Slowly walking to the lad, she asked a few questions.

"You alright? What happened here? Why are you covered in blood."* - Sun Oct 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wanted to laugh at the lad's high and mighty tone-For her, this won't be a problem to clean up since she had a lot of tags on her; of course she fights with 'one shot' capability yet, this isn't her village thus was not her problem. The next thing she knows, she tries to assist him, he attacks her and she end up killing with by accident, sparking a war between Suna and Konoha. Let's avoid that; Her expression along says enough.

Sighing softly, she turns around and leave him be, it was rather clear that she didn't clear what happens to the other leaf shinobi that enters this area-EXCEPT ONE! Making her way through the door, her guard was still up due to the fact she didn't know if he wanted to attack her or not but let's find out.* - Sun Oct 25 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) had just return home with a cigar in her mouth. Luckily, she didn't set it ablaze as yet. On the table across them her where food she lied out for her lover to eat when she was away-Certainly, they were covered and wrapped up nicely as well. Cracking a small smile the second she realized  Ketsuki was awake;

"Good morning sweetie, sleep well?~"* - Mon Oct 26 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Mmmhmm, I hope ya enjoy it.~". Tapping the mouth of her boot on the ground, she finally made her way towards the young lady.

"You know, you have a killer grip when you're sleeping, right?"* - Mon Oct 26 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles softly, "Cute.~". Removing her scrolls and set it aside, she comes to a stop at the bed. Planting herself beside of the girl, she simply peck her cheek, 

"After ya finish, I'll show you the two jutsu.~" * - Mon Oct 26 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) rocks lightly as it seem she was in a good mood. Turning her head to the girl, she proceeds to say, "Great fire ball and Shunshin. One the Uchiha clan is known for and the other to assist with movements though you do need to train ya control.~". She explains it to her with wide grin. 

They were something she shouldn't abuse for her current level though it was best if she knows them-You'll never know when something comes up and she wants the fire power or speed.* - Mon Oct 26 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) feels like she was forgetting something while they were talking-Maybe it will pop up in her head sooner or later.

"Well yeah but it works with one's control so the better your control, the faster and further you can move hence why I'm able to cover the village within a few minutes.~"

Different between both of them was that while Ketsuki was good physically, Ai suck when it comes to such but however, spiritual, Ai is greater, Ketsuki seems to have it worse.

"Oh right, that child from yesturday, he was cover'd in blood and told me that I should tell everyone to stay away from the mansion or else he will kill everyone...Though he didn't sound like the child from yesturday."* - Mon Oct 26 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "I left him be since I rather not have them believe I'm here to start a war or anything along the lines.", because if Ai end up accidently killed him, what could she say to Ketsuki or her kage?

Picking her scroll up, nuzzles her nose into the woman's neck, "Hurrrry up and get dress'd.~ Let go check it out before something happens."* - Mon Oct 26 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Mon Oct 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Takeda... - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You alright? - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Sad enough..He's taking another path.. - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) moves closer just in case a nigga needs to command the papers she set around Ketsuki beforehand.* - Mon Oct 26 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ketsuki...You know...I can..You know..Bind him, right? - Mon Oct 26 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am /not/ risking a Fire Jutsu to the face. - Mon Oct 26 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He won't be able to move at all. - Mon Oct 26 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Unless he can use his jutsu without his handseal. - Mon Oct 26 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: That's depressing.... - Mon Oct 26 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) prepares to block some fireballs because that nigga could be telling a lie.* - Mon Oct 26 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: It starts with pain..Follow by hate..Fuel by the endless questions....No one can answer...*Sigh* I already know how this will go.. - Mon Oct 26 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Right then. - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll stick 'round as long as you need, yeah? Is there anything else I can do to help...? - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I...need you cloak... - Mon Oct 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) withdraw her sheets.* - Mon Oct 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry, does what ring any bells? - Mon Oct 26 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Meow, meow? - Mon Oct 26 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, "Mmmhm, just a little tired but hey, I can't complain.~". Walking over to the girl, she hands her a key, "Rent'd it, now, you don't have to worry about payment as well, It'll be coming to me no matter where I am.~". In addition, she hands her 50'000 yens as well-Would be more but she wasn't sure how heavy the payments would have been.

With a kiss on the forehead, she stated;

"Keep that.~ It's a little sad I won't be staying much longer.~"* - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: (Pass is on la skype) - Mon Oct 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) whispers: ((Yeah, let me log back into skype. - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: (Ya need a phone that can carry skype, lol) - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What's up, bitches. - Mon Oct 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Oh /fucking joy/. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles softly, well, she did have a few hours remaining before she has to go so spending a little time with her won't have Hassen down her back. Wrapping her arms around her, she brings her in for a rather tight hug as well, "Well, sure but I can't stay too long.~".

Her ears twitched the moment she heard the man's voice as she turned her head to see who it was. Ai wasn't sure what to expect-Was this a Leaf problem or just a normal traveler like herself.

"Hello there."* - Mon Oct 26 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Have we met before? - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You and me both. - Tue Oct 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Guess i'll have to wing this shit. - Tue Oct 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Wing what shit? - Tue Oct 27 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Nothing~ - Tue Oct 27 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Right right. - Tue Oct 27 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... what do you wanna do? Go Cuddle, have something to eat, train? - Tue Oct 27 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Cuddle and eat sounds fine.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... to that place we're renting, rather than a resturant, or..?~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The rent house.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: North hun.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: On this road.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Here.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You'll have to decide on that, I'm not much of a great cook.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Ah... well, I suppose I'll get to it then. Mrm.. you just get comfortable, I s'pose!~ - Tue Oct 27 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I do want to help ya.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) would note the kitchen was completely stacked with food from cooking to can to pre-ready.* - Tue Oct 27 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) removes her jacket, scroll and other extra she didn't need.

"Cook, I may be crap when it comes to it but I can still move around the kitchen fast enough to get you want ya need."* - Tue Oct 27 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) wasn't sure what she would have like on her meal since she eats anything that can be considered eatable and doesn't get you sick. Vanishing and reappearing front of the cabinet, she removes the requested spice and a few other random spicy set. Within a second, she appears beside of her lover with what she wished for.

"Here ya go."* - Tue Oct 27 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) kisses her neck softly, "I can wait.~", she whispers-Really, she actually can't since her time was still running out.

Turning on her heels, she made her way towards the bedroom so she could have lied down and rest a little merely because she has a long travel ahead of her.* - Tue Oct 27 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was actually thinking about what might have happen to Kumo-As much as she dislike the village, they were also the reason why she was able to become a shinobi overall and be where she is now. Thinking about edge's action, she started to question why he would have down such a thing-THEN she remembers about the girl she failed the save during the worm attack, the girl that was considered Edge's child. All the thinking was putting to sleep until her ears picked up on the girl's voice. Rolling off the bed, she made her way into the kitchen with a smile on her face and rubbing the crap out of her eyes-This will actually be the first time someone this close, well relationship status had cook for her. With happiness, she quickly run over to her like a child when they heard they'll be getting free wifi.

"Really?~ Yay! I can't wait to taste Ketsuki's cooking.~"

Waiting for her to respond, she quickly regains her calm then of course tilted her head at her cutely along with her hair behind her ear and her genuine smile on her face.  * - Tue Oct 27 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) accepts her dish only for her to join her lover on the flood. She couldn't wait to dig into it but first, she needed to praise to the sage of six path-I mean Jesus for the food before she could have actually eat. Once she finished after a few seconds, she digs down into the pasta like a hungry wolf. 

If it was good or not, it didn't matter to her at all, the thought was all that counts really. Making sure she eats until nothing was left on the plate, she leaps back and of course, enjoys the moment.

"That was great hun.~"* - Tue Oct 27 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) tilts her head so she could have given the girl a peck on the lips, "No problem and I'm glad I decided to stop here that day, I would have missed someone as great as you if I didn't.~", truly, she was happy that she made the correct decision because if she head off to Kumo without stopping in Konoha, she would have been killed by now; by the same person that was once her comrade.

Cuddling more into her, she simply pulls the girl into her lap then nuzzle into her some more, "You might be the first person I'll say this to but I guess It's fine, as long as it's from the heart, right?~ Well, here goes, Ketsuki, I love you.~"* - Tue Oct 27 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods lightly-Ai's life is considered to be depressing since everyone she once knew died (Almost everyone), becomes emotional person (Emo), hard to talk to or just plan evil so she was actually a breakthrough in Ai's life hence why she was more ify about her actions and always consider the world to be rather cold and heartless until she met Ketsuki. She was the first person Ai invested into and the first person to show Ai this amount of love and affection. 

Accepting her kiss, she giggles once at her attempt but she knows she'll get better overtime. Position her lips correctly, she tilts her head and returns the favor. Slightly tightening her hold, she blushes intensely as the girl's respond repeats over and over in her head. * - Tue Oct 27 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) groans a little from pleasure as her body heats up even more. Her heart races along with her finger sliding up and down the girl's back gradually. It was rather clear that she was enjoying every moment-Kinda making it rather hard for her to leave this village since she wants to be by the girl's side always.

Flinching playfully as she didn't exact her to gotten this good overtime, she lets her take the lead yet proceeds to suck lightly on the girl's bottom lip. 

Using her own to massage the girl's, she moves her own lips in a motion that causes them to curve a little more than before so she could have getting a better position. This was only the beginning of their happy relationship, they will have more happiness together in the near future.~* - Tue Oct 27 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) Hair scatters around her as she was engaged in this make-out session. Her hands held on to the girl's as her finger entwine with hers. She was too deep into the moment, her mind was going blank and of course, the only person that was left on her mind was no other than Ketsuki. During this, her own body moves along with hers, how close they were, the girl could have felt her heart racing.

The second she felt her tongue, she simply had hers meet her halfway so they could have traded saliva with her aside from wrapping her tongue around hers; she did so until they break such a passionate kiss. Her eyes were glued onto Ketsuki, her face was red from embarrassment and definitely she was panting quietly. 

She didn't know what her lover had left on her mind however she didn't care, her body was now belongs to Ketsuki-It was now her playground.
* - Tue Oct 27 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) smiles brightly as they started up round two, it was crazy obvious that the lustful tension in the air around them was strong. Ai herself was quite hungry for more, more of her lover's lips and compassion. They were moving fast though this felt great-She had no problem with everything that had happen-Clearly this was only faith.

As they started round two, Ai's tongue delightedly met up with Ketsuki's so they could have finished their play date by starting with the twist game. For Katsuki, Ai's hair was silky soft since she can take care of it without worrying too much while her rear was also a little soft, similar to one of a female-Just wasn't out on the edge massive for a guy.

Her hands travel around the girl's body as it slides from the side to her back and finally her rear; you don't even need to ask if she didn't grab on to it. Grasping tightly onto them, her fingers lightly presses around as if she was massaging her in the mean time she herself faintly moans during the kiss.* - Tue Oct 27 03:16:16 2015
