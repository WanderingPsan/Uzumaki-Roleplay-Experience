<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks at her. Now that she knows she'll have to power through both wind and fire, she figures this was going to be an annoying battle. So preparing herself, she allows the paper from her scroll to unwrap and spread into the air around her-Around 500 sheets of paper swirling around her like a storm.  She was going to make the first move so might as well she makes it a little more interesting by flicking her finger forward, allowing the sheets to take the form of paper shurikens only to launch them towards her-At least 5 was heading her way, three out of five had a small surprise to them as well.* - Fri Oct 16 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) quickly moved out of the way, at least away from the attacks with her sheets of paper in the meantime, the moment the heat hits the papers, they suddenly exploded into smoke. With the wind, the smoke was blown back towards her yet marked her away from the woman. She couldn't see but she does remember her location. Believe that she haven't move, she created two more shurikens but this time, she had one land out from the smoke into an arc while the other did the same---Basically left and right, bending and curving towards both sides of the woman-Attempting to distract her a little, if this was successful, another shuriken which was real would have simply rips through the smoke, attempting to catch her off guard. * - Sat Oct 17 00:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) actually couldn't have done anything else after that, she was burnt, her papers were gone not to mention damaged, it was rather clear that she couldn't have continue the fight even if she wanted to. Pointing her finger up after the burn, she goes on to say, "You win..Don't have any more paper left.."* - Sat Oct 17 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few times yet she started to question what he took her for. Shaking her head no, it was simple; she couldn't use something such as this to actually train with. This was a little too small for her to train with overall. Bending down to the level of the animal or close to that level, she asked, "Unless they can take the size of a human, I don't believe I can actually train with them....I'm trying to test my binding speed as well as strength you know....Do you really think I can use them when they're not even up to size?", indeed, her paper was almost bigger than them so this wouldn't have been a real struggle for her.* - Sat Oct 17 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods, what she was going to do was something rather simple-She wasn't lethal because of what she believes in no matter how strange she attire herself. With the flick of her fingers, sheets of paper rolls themselves out from out of her scroll; at least one hundred sheets of paper. Once she had all her sheets prepared, the woman rests her hand against his chest to set him as her current target.

Once that was done, the paper would have simple swirl around the lad like flies on shit. As it goes on, he would have realized that the papers where sticking to him like glue-And at the same time, she was also move back away from the swarm; Clearly wanted to avoid paper cuts. If he didn't struggle, within moments, he would have found himself in a paper cocoon.* - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015

She wasn't joking when she told him it won't be that bad, the fact that she wasn't exactly trying to completely restrain him, only to see how strong her bind was and how much work she had ahead of her.

"Alright, since that bind is quite fine....I think I'll work on another jutsu soon."

Flicking her finger back as her sheets rewraps themselves gradually and careful, her eyes wonders around as if she was looking for someone.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) opens her bag as she removes a small text book worth of paper-At least 100 sheets.

"Lets see how this goes.."* - Sat Oct 17 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Tch, what is this now? Someone hold her still. I can handle this. - Sat Oct 17 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: This one is crazy...I should avoid her harder. - Sat Oct 17 22:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: But..It can't be helped, I know how it was for me. Things made it worse when people attacked, despised my very existence. - Sat Oct 17 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was literally about to imprison her movements nevertheless was stop by her ranking. Releasing the sheets, she allows them to flow around her as if her body was carrying a gentle swirl like breeze. Since orders were orders, she had no plan on breaking them; more or less she wasn't exactly planning on attacking her. 

Strolling up to the girl, her eyes fall onto with a bright emerald shade, staring at the mentally damaged girl. As much as she wanted to avoid her, she actually needs the help more than anyone else she know of-Even if she doesn't understand how she feels, she does know precisely how 'different' feels, the feeling of being out of place.

Crouching down to the girl's level, she tilts her head then asks, "Oi, aren't you supposed to be a part of a big family? Why are you having a melt down here? You don't have to be afraid to talk with us you know, we don't bite nor will we attack you....Unless that person is considered as a jackass then I could understand."

Trying to lightening to mood, she waits on her respond while at the same time, prepares for counter measurements if the girl was too out of it and attacks them.* - Sat Oct 17 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: ...Fucking...this won't make things better. It'll just worsen em'. - Sat Oct 17 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was way ahead of him, the only different was her paper seems less harmless than his sand. She understands where the girl was coming from yet he didn't have a family that long to know of her troubles. Fixing her coat before she gets on her knees-Sitting on her legs like a normal Japanese would have done, she crossed her hands under her coat then nods at Jiki's respond. It was rather clear by now that she had no intention on attacking her even if her papers was still slowly dancing in the wind as if they weren't going to fall at all.

"Well, you don't 'deserve' to be alone; you kinda have everyone here looking after you. You believe you're alone but in reality, you have your sister, me, Jiki, your sister's friend and many more people here to keep your company. None of us wants to hurt you, more or less, you can feel loved you know~"

Indeed, if she was looking at it from outside of her box, if they didn't love her as a person, they wouldn't be talking to her now nor would they be wasting their time with her-More or less they would have shipped her off to the hospital with a restrain jacket on. Revealing her hand, she held out her palm as if she was offering her a hand. Smiling brightly, her pacifist trait was noticeably showing-Not a bad aura or even seeming like she was faking, just like Jiki, she was completely genuine.

"So tell me, will you be our friend? We'll keep ya company and do what your family failed to do, show you a lot of attention. ~"* - Sun Oct 18 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll take the abuse, it'll be worth it in the end. - Sun Oct 18 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) groans quietly at the butchery comment. She was against something like that so obviously she shook her head no.

"Sorry, it isn't in my nature to kill..Same for fighting..As much as it can unavoidable sometimes, I really dislike the violence.".

Withdrawing her hand, she slightly tilts her head than ask, "Do you really think that? We have no reason to kill or harm you.". She couldn't put herself in the girl's shoes, she was comparatively rejecting what they had to say to her yet she couldn't blame her at all since well, this world we live in can be quite annoying sometimes with people who take advantage of others.

Breaking her little sitting style into one that was rather lazy, she places her hand on the ground behind as a support to keep herself up then state, "You never had friends uh? I can relate but now is the best time to start."* - Sun Oct 18 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) removes her coat as she sits recklessly-basically unlades like though she was pretty sure everyone here knows her gender by now. Wearing a white suit, her eyes shifts towards the bartender with a little wrath, "Word of advice, don't disrespect him..Your job is to get us what we requested in a five star manner, not to single out someone, now go. I would like the same thing doc here is having.". She could be gentle and she could be rough though it was rather clear that she doesn't like people who treat others like they're different. Defending the lad, she leans back slightly and asks, "We're giving you two a sip, alright? We're having fun so let's not restrain ourselves too much.~"* - Sun Oct 18 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You know what I just realized?  - Sun Oct 18 05:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles at the girl's respond, "Well, we're not forcing ya kiddo, the milk is on its way.~". This was only the beginning of Ai trying to lighten the three up a bit, as far as she knows, Bryson seems relatively entertaining already. Once the orders have arrived, she smiles brightly merely to accept her glass of sake from the Doctor himself. 

"Cheeeers!!!"

It was a little strange how she was acting for a figure that barely drinks but tonight, she was planning on letting herself up-Do things she would never really do even if it was supposed to save her life. Finally sipping hers, she laughs softly as if she was going crazy or just remember something that had happen to her, "I remember the first time I tried this, right before I was a shinobi, I got myself drunk in a heartbeat.~"

She took another sip as her eyes shifts towards Jiki; sliding him her cup, she gave him a small nod as if she wanted him to take a sip, "Try it now, better now than never.~", referring to that fact a shinobi doesn't always live that long once they go further up in the ranks, "Relax and lighten up kid.~"* - Sun Oct 18 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) places her hand out as she catch her sliding cup, "You'll get used to it kiddo.~". She could have hold down her drinks quite well comparing to others who couldn't; because she started at such a youth age, it only makes sense that she would be able to do so. Drinking her sake as if it was water, she had already reached her second cup.

"I'm guessing god wanted to make me into a woman then changed his mind at the last second.~"

Responding in a funny manner, she slides the bartender the payment for the order in exact cash-Maybe a small tip, you would never know. Once she had finish her last cup of Sake, she leans back and let it soaks in. Her cheeks had a slight red shade even if she wasn't drink and she had a small smile on her face-it was more like the figure was high.

And don't like anyone bad talk you now.~", she told him before sliding off her seat and heard off-She had a lot of fun tonight, maybe it would be wise if she did this a little more earlier during the day.* - Sun Oct 18 07:19:02 2015
