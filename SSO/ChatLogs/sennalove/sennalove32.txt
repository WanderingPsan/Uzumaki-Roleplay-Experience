"Gooood.~"* - Thu Dec 10 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) made her way into the forest, improving herself by buying new training equipment, heavy weights which weighs up to 200 pounds; 100 each leg. Anyone could have tell she was going to having a hard time walking much least running, she was moving around with something that was much heavier than herself after all, but the goal was to be able to walk with it, she wasn't aiming to become a taijutsu specialist but it was better to have her body ready to fight one way or another.

Arriving to the massive trees outside of the desert-After a day of walking, she looks up on them as it seems it was the day she was going to test her limits and start her control training, she did learn the basic Suimen and he did learn that power isn't given like candy. It is something that has to be work for it, that's why she was at the biggest trees in the entire forest, the enormous twin tree. Her goal was the run up the entire tree with weights, seems easy enough to someone with the training that is however she believe she possibly will handle herself better than others.

Observing the tree, she knew that this was going to be a long run and it's going to hurt a lot, but this was the only way to develop her body then so be it. Preparing herself for the first dash, she attempts the run up the tree with the weights on her legs, taking off in a rush, she concentrates her chakra into her legs, to the insole, it was almost time for her to sprint up the tree. She was support over double her weight so unquestionably she would only go 10 feet up the tree before her legs slips causing her to fall. She didn't just fall. She used her head, flipping and flick a kunai at her location as a place holder before falling to the ground landing on her back.

Back on her feet shortly after, she clutches her back with an sour expression as if she was feeling a lot of pain, that did hurt since she fall like an egg but she was not were near finishing her training yet. She quickly regain her concentration before preparing herself  for another race, it was almost time, this phase she plans on using the weights as place holder and she was only going to do three more before calling it a day. Swiftly making her way up the tree like she was used to it, she bypass her pervious check point though the weights started dragging her down the she goes. The question currently was if gravity likes her or not since this was good and bad nevertheless she was only able reach around the 16 feet mark before she started to slip., With quick reactions, she would hurriedly swing her legs to strike the surface of the tree with the assistance and force of the weights however she also Receive recoil damage from performing such an strike. This recoil launches her into an flap yet at the end, she was still heading towards the ground with an see.

Landing on her feet surprisingly, she sighs softly as the real problem was about to reveal itself soon enough.

She plans on completely the length of 90 feet in the air. She knew she wouldn't be capable to do so on her first attempt. Swiftly dashing up the tree once again, this time she didn't reach her current check point, only to fall out of the tree before reaching the 7 feet mark. She then knew that she was running low on chakra then again she could move so it was nothing she can't ignore. Safe first, she decided to take a break as she quickly whirls her body to landing on her feet in one piece.* - Thu Dec 10 05:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Huh..? - Fri Dec 11 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) taps her hand against the scroll as she summoned up a red scarf. If Mizora remembers well, she'll realize that was also the scarf Ai had on years ago-the date they met. Putting it around her daugther's neck, she proceeds to say, "This actually belongs to my mother. I wore it in her honor however overtime, things started to happen so in order to keep it in one piece and safe, I had to stop wearing it. This is what ya can consider a generation treasure."

Gently wrapping the scarf around her daughter's name, she whisper one more thing playfully, "Don't destroy it, it's older than you and me.~" even if she was serious. The Scarf seems to be in a decent condition however the end tail had a few rips revealing that it had indeed been through alot.* - Fri Dec 11 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: That scarf.. - Fri Dec 11 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec 11 00:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Go mess with mommy, tickle her on the left, I'll take the right, alright?~ - Fri Dec 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) prepare for the worth reaction by allowing a few sheets to remain close to her daughter without making it too obvious. Moving closely to her wife, she proceeds to kiss her as a distraction and finally, assault her with an barrage of tickles! "Hehe, ya shouldn't shell yaself like that around ya family!", she thought to herself while them fingers were put in the work!* - Fri Dec 11 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) giggles softly-She didn't plan on lightening up as well because of the fact she had no intention to stop until she believes it was enough. Tickling the night away, she moves her finger up and down the girl's right side, "Keep it up Ketsuki.~"* - Fri Dec 11 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at Ketsuki as a seems they can stop now! Finally coming to a halt, she proceeds to wrap her arm around Mizora, cuddling up with her.

"Come join us, Ketsuki.~"* - Fri Dec 11 01:11:15 2015

"Paper, Elements, Taijutsu? Genjutsu? Can you teach her a little Tai?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Your five senses are your sense of touch, feeling, hearing, seeing and tasting. - Fri Dec 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ketsuki(SephirothRaged) says: Ah! - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: It's not typical for the illusions to toy around with hearing, touching and tasting. Usually sight and feeling are the only ones hindered. I'm sure there are advanced enough specialists out there. - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I don't know any genjutsu, but your father may. - Fri Dec 11 02:37:26 2015

This was a just in case shit goes wrong.* - Fri Dec 11 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yo? - Fri Dec 11 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) walks into the shop in search of anyone that could be considered the 'Raikage' or anyone long such lines.

"Yo? Ya leader awake at the moment? Or any higher ups? I wish to speak with them."* - Fri Dec 11 03:37:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was currently sitting on a chair made from sheets while indeed, playing with paper rose. She didn't seem bothered at all, more or less already know what she was here for. The moment someone had finally adjusted her, she goes on to say, "Ai and I'm here to talk about this problem. Stand at easy, I'm not here to fight the village."

Flicking out an headband for the village with her name engrave in the back through ID and registration, she proceeds to say in a lazy tone.

"Could you please explain to me how this problem stated between Kumo and Suna?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: How did you obtain said head-protector? - Fri Dec 11 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I was from this village. - Fri Dec 11 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: "was" - Fri Dec 11 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: During Niklaus days. - Fri Dec 11 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The Yondaime said the same thing before I exiled her. - Fri Dec 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: However, I seek no trouble. - Fri Dec 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Who's Yondaime? - Fri Dec 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Then you should get going. - Fri Dec 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: If you don't want to seek any trouble. - Fri Dec 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The previous Raikage. - Fri Dec 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why would you ever leave? - Fri Dec 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Whether you allow entry is up to Takuma. - Fri Dec 11 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Was assign'd to Suna back then since Kumo had complete control over it. That was the days when Konoha was under slavery. - Fri Dec 11 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see.. - Fri Dec 11 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs softly, "After Suna regains independent, don't know when since I was out of it but I had to register as a Suna shinobi because Suna was controlling Kumo then. From what I've heard, it was because of an Meteor attack, causing the village to shatter thus ends up under Suna's wings.", she said. 

Snapping her fingers as the rose sudden disassemble, she looks up at the man that was questioning her and ask, "At the moment, the new Kazekage wanted peace and ask'd me for assistance. Hence why I'm here now. What did Suna do to cause such an situation? I'll like to know this at least, I'm pretty sure it's something that can be fix'd or work'd out.". She knows Hassan left one thousand shinobi to assist and guard Kumo as they rebuild, what happened to cause Kumo to reject Suna's assistance and started this mess.* - Fri Dec 11 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: I should visit Konoha, see how Rias is doing. I also want to see what bullshit has been going around in that village as well. - Fri Dec 11 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So you see. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: In this particular case Sunagakure was the evil entity. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: They forgot where they came from. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Now I want nothing to do with anyone. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: For they all turned their back on us when we wanted nothing more than to be left alone. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It is why I do not trust these surrounding nations. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's why I don't trust you. - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I can understand that. - Fri Dec 11 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I also didn't know they attack'd as well. - Fri Dec 11 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll assume the current kage barely knows about this. Who was the name of the kage during that time? - Fri Dec 11 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sanoke. - Fri Dec 11 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sanoke? Hassan? - Fri Dec 11 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: -- - Fri Dec 11 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighs, "I see, he isn't the kazekage anymore..More or less, he was a wonderer who took the role of kage since no one else was skilled enough leadership wise or power wise for it until recent."* - Fri Dec 11 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm sorry for the trouble he had caused. - Fri Dec 11 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: That's why he remain shut with the things he was doing as a kage and why he regret taking such a role...*sigh* - Fri Dec 11 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Who was Konoha's leader during that time? - Fri Dec 11 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods to his statement, "I see, I'll visit her shortly. Thanks for the information, that actually backed up the rumors I've been hearing about Konoha and her recent actions...That's something I'll need to take care of personally.". She learns more and learns every day. Rocking from side to side-She was having a grant time with her paper chair before saying, "Sanoke's apology, that will be an hard thing to get from him due to his current family...They're too prideful to let him do such a thing though he isn't a shinobi anymore, that's for sure.".

Heading the voice of the current Kage ringing in her ear, she proceeds to rely the message, "Seems he also didn't know of Sanoke's actions so basically, he left him in a deep hole after stepping down..", she sighs softly. Using her fingers, she plays with the end of her rather long hair and finally added, "He wants to meet you in formally as well. From what I understand, that will be soon."* - Fri Dec 11 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) ||| Now she understands why everyone wanted her to be the kage but in this case, she'll have to try and fix the KAGE'S problem--This is like the other Hokage trying to fix the second's and first's problems-She better get a rank up for this shit. She understands him since she is also like that yet she is also surprise that he isn't worse than her since they killed off more than one of Kumo's shinobis.


Sitting back, she scratches the side of her head then say, "I can understand ya, and you're more humble than I am. I honor that but this current kage isn't like the others. He's nothing like Sanoke or Hassan and believes in honor. I know how you feel since I've been through someone similar to such but my experience wasn't as bad as this village's. I'm not sure if you'll have it left in you but at least hear the kid out. What he has to say about the situation. You don't have to drink tea; all he wants to do is talk."* - Fri Dec 11 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods and stands, "Alright, I'm assuming through the bird messager though he wants to apologize as well, behalf of Suna hence why he wants to meet you in person.", she clears that one up. Tapping her ears, she repeats to the radio that he should not come to Kumo but they may talk through bird communication.

Once that message was out of the way, she gave him a small bow out of respect, "Alright, thanks for your time. I hope this problem will be resolved soon.", with that, the paper that was used to make the chair disassemble, fold themselves and return into her sleeves. Still active just in case but nothing for them to worry about.

"Well, see ya around, Time to handle Konoha and the problems they've caused upon this village."* - Fri Dec 11 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: ---SOME OF A, DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO COME! - Fri Dec 11 05:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was literally about to stroll off into the Caravan until she sense their chakras behind of her. Turning around slowly to realize who they were, Ai quickly sucker punch Koji! This was for not following her orders even if she wasn't the kage but this was more like a big sister and little brother type of moment, "I told you not to come! Why did you come anyway?!", she questions furiously.* - Fri Dec 11 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) heads off--Konoha is next.* - Fri Dec 11 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) shook her head no. Her job here was already over. What left of it was to handle Konoha since she has been hearing alot of things with it. Assuming they are true from the facts and information she had recently obtain; she had to go see for herself and tries to fix it by force or words.

"I'll catch you guys up, I need to visit Konoha."* - Fri Dec 11 06:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) strolls inside-From a Konoha's stand of point, Ai seems rather outnumbered however from a Suna's standing point, Konoha might actually be fucked more ways than one. The aura Ai had wasn't friendly nor was it lethal-Just annoyed. Her eyes shift around the room before it falls upon the Hokage.

"Rais, wake up. We have to talk about a few things such as what I've been hearing over the years and the recent information I've gotten from Kumo."* - Fri Dec 11 14:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Not Suna here...mm...  - Fri Dec 11 14:43:08 2015
