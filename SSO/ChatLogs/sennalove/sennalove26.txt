<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll make some.. - Fri Nov 27 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) created a clone to ass her with this jutsu training. She had to get this done before anything so. Three clones in total-All they had to do was study and train. Ai had to stay and cuddle with her lady so the lads had to do something else in the meantime. They all used shunshin to quickly exit the room before Mizora could have notice.

The clones quickly appear in the living room, at this point, it was only a matter of taking care of a few things before Mizora and AI leaves. They couldn't leave the house since that will cause some problems and distraction so each one summons up an book on fire training. In the end, it was rather simple.

Two clones handle the three books while one clone handles burning the paper through the middle only without making contact with that area. This was easier on book but harder when they started to pursuit such. Scanning through the book, both clones were able to finish one book each, leaving one to read the last book and the other to assist with the training.

Now having two clones trying to burn the center of the paper, they realized this was truly time consuming but all that matters in the end was survival. Remembering that cloak his out of control body had, she remembered it burn the shit out of Paine's leg giving her an idea to what she had to do later on.

Once the clones have arrived to their max point, they all sigh together. No progress was made against but at least, they got a little info from the books that could be useful when it comes to training. Hearing the door open, the clones quickly dispel and return whatever they had learned back to the main body Ai.* - Fri Nov 27 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) taps the back of her scroll. She didn't have much to do with them so might as well she use them now, "I was saving these for my ops mission however..", she drifted off. That tap from early was an simply seal placement tap since she lost her other scroll thus summoning colorful sheets. With the snap of the finger, they sheets quickly rolled up into an rose of different color petal. Since she had so much, she created one for each grave that was currently here however three for Ket's grave, two for Jiki and two for Su's.

"There.."

Sticking in place, she made them strong enough to withstand sandstorms and so on without breaking apart so easily. She took a seat between Jiki and Ket's grave before she goes on to say, "Hey guys..I'm still kicking..I know you two don't want me to join you so quickly though I don't think I'll be any time soon since you know, I've found someone I need to live for.", she said with an head tilt towards her lover, "I'm sorry I haven't been around..Edge and all but I guess you two were watching over me...And you too Su, I haven't forgotten about ya."* - Fri Nov 27 06:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Talking me to. - Fri Nov 27 22:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. - Fri Nov 27 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) sighing loudly, Ai created three more clones to assist with her training. She had no reason to rush since her main problem was gone but she still had that one shinobi she wanted to kill. That one guy that almost put Ai is an grave and setting Mizora in an Sasuke state so this matters a lot to her now.

She was alone so she could have assisted her clones with it but she also needed to do this before Mizora gets back from training so. Summoning an book, she decided she was going to read it while her clones handle the activities in the meantime. Resuming the book she wasn't able to finish, her clones draw for the materials.

Each clone had something that could have used to train with. One had a leaf, the other had a paper and the final clone has a card. The idea was the same as before, they needed to burn an hole in the center of that object without making any type of physical contact with the area so that means chakra control is Key.

Ai started to scan the book, trying to figure out what was going on in this book, the info she needed to assist with training, the clones put some work into their chakra control, trying to channel their chakra into the center however it was harder than it looks. Ai clone didn't expect that much any time soon.

Closing the book once she was finish, the only clone that was able to perform such an action was the clone that had the leaf, the other clones failed badly. This was only the start, if they were able to do so with a leaf then they can finish the job with the other two. Once they all finish, she puts away all her equipment and prepare for the worse.* - Fri Nov 27 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) blinks a few, she didn't presume that at all-She didn't plot on doing such like tapping into it since she's a prideful trap. All she wanted to do was meet the beast that saved her and get to know them well enough since they're trap inside of them forever or even ask them a few questions about what happen and how they ended up inside of her body.

"Eh..I don't think chakra is the thing....I had my full reserve the first time I heard the voice; I was only put in an bad state. I don't really want to ask for assist during a battle, I like to depend on on my skills..Well, as long as it's my battle. Stress.I never heard of it during my stressful times so that's out of the question.---I should do what not? Sanoke, I can't do that unless I'm using my sheets.."

She admits. She had no physical practice to even contribute with such. If she had to rely on her own strength then that boulder will certainly not break, she can only perform such with her sheets that will take less than one minute to do since she has along of control over time. Sighing softly, she wonders what Jiki did to talk with his.

"Did Jiki had to go through this to talk with his? Weren't you around when he was talking to it?"* - Fri Nov 27 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) was already sitting. She remembers what he told her to do before. This shouldn't be hard at all-well on paper so. The question how she was going to do this through mediation if she doesn't know how to do so; Looking over at the fella with the eyes of a lost woman, she goes on to ask, "Can you..Help me with that? I don't know how exactly I'll be able to do something like this since this is still all new to me."* - Fri Nov 27 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) nods at what he told her. This shouldn't be a hard task at hand but this is her first time doing such. Sitting back, she relaxes as the chakra around her body started to flow, she tries to block out everything that was on her mind-As a Uchiha, that would be an almost impossible task but she attempts to. 

Inhaling, she tries to do as she was told, blocking out what Sanoke told her, blocking off everything around her and tries to find that chakra path she needs to trail to meet up with whatever demon was inside of her. This would be an hard task at hand as stated before. Copying the fella's seal, she attempts to meet the voice that spoken with her the other day during her time of need.

"Come on..Work.."* - Sat Nov 28 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) still wasn't close to reaching this thing inside of her. As much as she tries, she was out of luck. She might actually need to wait on it to contact her against whenever it felt like it but for now, she wasn't able to. Certainly she ignored the conversation the two were having until the end, "Yeah..No luck I still can't-Oh..Hello there.."* - Sat Nov 28 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? - Sat Nov 28 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Sanoke was slightly correct. Block out all distractions around you, it wasn't hard for me because I do it everyday however I don't know about you. In anycase, once you do that, close your eyes and concentrate on the other chakra within you, you should be able to feel it slightly even if you can't sense. - Sat Nov 28 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Concentrate on that until you fade away into the next plane, you'd possibly see you 'beast' inside of you. - Sat Nov 28 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Easier said than done.. - Sat Nov 28 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Whatever you do and say there will not affect what happens in reality, however if you disconnect the slightest you'll be sent away. I don't know how your beast operates so . . . You may have a time limit, you'd want to gain the important information first. - Sat Nov 28 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Actually, I did it on first try. It's not that hard. - Sat Nov 28 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright - Sat Nov 28 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Go on try it, feel the other chakra and grasp a hold of it. Enter it's realm. - Sat Nov 28 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: .* - Sat Nov 28 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hopefully this works... - Sat Nov 28 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) tries to pull this from under her belt again. This was basically what Sanoke told her however she didn't have to trail it, all she had to do was focus on it. From all the tip and facts Kana shared with her, she believes she might need to have all of her questions prepared beforehand. Saving what she had to say in mind, she preceded to her little attempt-her second attempt.

Blocking out everything around her-All distractions, she tries to focus on herself and herself only just as she was told. During this time, she didn't have to follow the chakra, all she had to do was focus on it. It was pretty clear that she had another chakra inside of her even if it was rather faint, "Come on....I just want to talk..Nothing serious..", she mutters to herself softly.

Shutting her eyes, she controls her breathing and certainly, mediates. Since all distractions were blocked out, she was focusing on the other chakra inside of her whenever it reveals herself and attempts to visit the beast's domain-She had a lot of questions for it but for now however she plans on asking the important set.* - Sat Nov 28 01:38:59 2015
