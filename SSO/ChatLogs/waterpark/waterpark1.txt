<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Huh... - Fri Dec 11 20:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You feel like training with me? - Fri Dec 11 20:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright. Go ahead and start off. - Fri Dec 11 20:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) set himself opposite of Kyubishu, allowing himeslf to remain still as he observed his opponent. For the moment, Anguo simply glazed his eyes over him, keeping a basic stance. Then a light nod came from him as he recognized his opponents stature and form. An assumption came from him, and Anguo recalled upon his opponents abilities somewhat, remaining wary.

To begin, Anguo simply revealed a single scroll with quick succession. Rather than making the direct approach, Anguo set off a single trap, launching forward several kunai and shuriken. Three of each to be specific. These all rapidly sped forward unto Kyubishu's position.* - Fri Dec 11 20:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) continued to observe his opponent from afar, remaining completely still while his actions took place. It wasn't until the handseals came into play that Anguo had opted to tense up. With the production of the wires though, this was when Anguo had channeled his chakra immediately into his wristband, causing himself to summon forth a single kunai.

With himself now equipped, he lashed out at a single wire and made a side-step, utilizing the quickness of his technique and his own physical limits to his advantage. His intent was to guide himself forward, breaking past his original point and trying to close the distance prior to making his low strike---a simple sweeping kick.* - Fri Dec 11 20:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) finds himself making his way over to the drop off office of Kirigakure, making quick progress throughout the village. Eventually, Anguo set eyes upon the building that required his attention. Moving in, he found that the delivery he was to make was simply a vase of flowers. Accepting them, he moved on to complete the task now.

Anguo exitted the shop, making his way across the crossroads, already understanding where he was required to go. Eventually he found himself amongst the streets again, making his way towards the drop-off location. Along the way however, Anguo proceeded to stop at different intervals, opting to pick up stray trash and toss it into any disposal units nearby.

His watchful eye continued to keep on lookout for him as he moved around Kirigakure. His movements were somewhat low, for better scoopage with the flowers obviously. Regardless, he still moved onwards to his goal and target.

Soon, Anguo found himself now at the end of the road. He was now at the homstead where he was to drop off the flowers. Anguo then soon opted to switch his attention to the trash amongst the streets. His movements forward eventualyl lead to him cleaning Kirigakure by removing its trash from the vicinity.* - Fri Dec 11 23:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) proceeded to make his way throughout Kirigakure, traveling to the post office seeing as he'd recieved a mission to collect a letter for someone. Upon arrival, he easily found the pick-up zone and recovered the letter necessary for transportation.

A few seconds later and Anguo was now back on the streets of Kirigakure. With ease he made his way throughout the village, traveling onwards from the post office to the target's homestead. Upon arrival, he knocked on thir door and simply handed them the letter as he said, "Delivery."

Following that, Anguo would take his leave from the village.* - Sat Dec 12 08:41:45 2015
