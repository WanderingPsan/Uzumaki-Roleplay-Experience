Everyone in the Area would be coughing and whezzing with their eyes closed it being hard from them to breath and it didn't help for the matter that he was forcibly keeping the dense smoke in  Shoji's lungs trying to make him fall unconousis. 

Of course he would keep the smoke from Harming Naleth and use it to wipe the both of ther scents away. He woulld then go to his now freed friend and begin to take him to Suna.

The Ambassdor knew that Hassan would be sooooo pissed when he told him what had happend he just hoped that this did not effect the treaty they had.* - Sat Oct 24 20:39:28 2015

Okay I had reutrned home after I had just made an Alliance with Kumokagure... I was doing my daily retouine reading to the kids... When i herd Naleth yelling for help he ran to me and begged me to help him. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he had been kidnapped from suna by Baelee and Shojo or Shoji ...sorta bad with the others name anyways  He told me he had escaped them and they where trying to kill them...The one named Baelee frequnts the village so I thought it was absurd at first. Then the two kidnappers showed them selves and begun trying to capture Naleath. I used my special skill to keep them from finding our harming him so fast but at lass in the end it was all for not......Some how some way the two survied my technqiue and method of attack no one has evey done that before ever.......It was like the on Shojo was not human he for sure is supposed to be dead I know for a fact because of  what I did to him.......And then the weirdest thing happend he made his Intestine erupt from his back and used them to attack destroyed most of my plaza area........... Then I was like okay why is he not dying I then throw my shurkien at Baelee but some way the guy was able too reach her in time and block it with his instine before I knew what happend Baelee had got lucky in my smoke screen and killed Nalethe... They then tried to capture and dispose of me but...due to my skill they could not they then ran away fleeing the village as I called upoon the guards to apreehend them......I just did not understand at the time how i could not kill them untiill. Miss Kastune told me something.. She infromed me that Aseroth is a necromancer which explains why those to people would not die no matter how hard I suffacted them......I also took note that Index Asteroth roayl butt scrattcer i mean that figurtavily and littrealy frequents this village.. I am worried Mr.Hassan I think Aserotth and her peons are plaining something.....Every time i enter the village the others get very quite mid discussion...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) he really did not like how close index was to him so he would gather his hacra towrds his feet turning them into smoke forming a cloud he would then take off into the sky  hovering looking down at Index "I told you personal space and what do you want there is no game to play..." his stormy grey eyes would lock on Index.* - Tue Oct 27 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) he hovers in the air drifiting away from Index "It appears he has some sort of issue with he clamis to want to talk but keeps approching me and voilting my personal space....... Now I will say this one more time Servant of Asteroth... Say what you wish to me and leave me at peace....."* - Tue Oct 27 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) he floats on his cloud the Ambassdor was no fool Index was up to somethign and he was not buying it at all. "You see my face I see your Face now speak or leave me be That is the last time I will tell you."* - Tue Oct 27 02:21:39 2015

He then drifts off* - Tue Oct 27 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) building up chakra in his chest seeing as Index planned to keep bothering him he would  exhale hard. As he did plume upon plume of smoke would emit from the holes in his mask. It would completely encompass the area. Due to the thickness of the smoke Index would no longer be able to see what was around him.. He would aslo begin to cough and choke due to his natural inhaletion..

Xon had had enough of Asteroth and her goons trying to harm him..He knew deep down Index had Ill Intentions for him so for him it was kill or be killed. 

Due to the nature of the technque Xon could see perfectly well in his smoke. He would reach out a hand and begin to force even more smoke into Index's lungs to Sufficate him...If his theory was correct he would be prepared for the next step he had to take.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) due to the amouut of force packed into the technqiue his smoke would be blown away and he would fall to le ground he at this point he didnt even care no more because this was llike his 14th char this wipe he would wait for the final blow to end his life he knew that Aseroth and her goons would get bodied eventaully due to the fact he had already notfied the othrer kage thhat had aliied themselves with him that if he were to dissaper or die to kill Aseroth and her gang of misfits... This was a game a chess and Index and the rest of Asteroth cronnies were playing Checkers. "He would Lay on the ground Cackling like a mad man.* - Tue Oct 27 03:04:19 2015
