He would reach the outskirts of the village being some what content. He would look around and see a slue of paw prints. sighting deeply he would follow them a little ways away... Tramerus would then spy a tree and low behold the cat would be upon a branch lazing around.he would SHout "Hey get over here you stupid Cat the servent of the great Ares Commands it." the cat of course would pay him no attention and continue doing what it wanted.

Seeing that the cat was a docuhe he would pick up a rock and throw it at the cat knocking it out of the tree he would then go to catch it. as it did the cat would trey to scratch at his arms so he could clamly hit in the top of its head knocking it out.
