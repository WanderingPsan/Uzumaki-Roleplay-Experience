<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garukichi(Doyouevenlift) took action the moment Marissa took the time out to look at him and get an assessment. The male immediately, began to change in shape, as quills began to form upon his body...Looking like a giant pin cushion. He wasted absolutely no time. Running to the side, as she made her handseals. Before dropping down into a ball, before charging at her as she fired the wind bullets, hoping his extra 'spurt of speed', would work to his advantage. He was also wasting no time  attempting to be done with this girl..

He had to pass this exam...For his family.* - Mon Nov  2 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garukichi(Doyouevenlift) wasn't aiming to be up and out that fast, he wasn't the best, but he stayed on the move, aiming to  shift his trajectory, due to the quils sticking into the ground he'd launch himself back towards her. Aiming to take the Wind blasts at an angle, so that the concussive force would knock him forward, though he did experience a bunch of residual damage, he seemed like he'd survive. But there was no way in hell he'd be able to dodge forever, One did manage to hit a few of his quils, and with a single blast they were blown off.* - Mon Nov  2 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garukichi(Doyouevenlift) at the speed he was moving, he'd probably have reached her when she moved to grasp her fan since that did take time.  So continuing on with his path, he'd aim to tackle her in his ball form with his porcupine body. Hoping to impale the woman, as images of his children flashed through his mind...He was doing this for them, and he wouldn't allow himself to fail, worst case scenario, the fan would probably his the top of the ball  he was currently making. Probably inflicting more blunt damage than anything.* - Mon Nov  2 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garukichi(Doyouevenlift) was content having probably managed to take out Marrisa's only weapon...But that left him open to her swing which crashed down atop of him, the final blast of wind, cutting through his armor leaving a deep gash upon his shoulder. As he  stopped briefly, but he didn't fall over...Not now...He'd probably die if he stopped...But something...Kept him going. His foot kicked off the ground, stopping his techinque for only a moment, as he aimed to throw Marissa off balance, while continuing his rolling forward.* - Mon Nov  2 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garukichi(Doyouevenlift) continued rolling until he stopped a few feet away, springing back tolife.  But Ultimately the poison bomb would've gotten to him, and since she was underground, the poison would probably overtake him leading to his death.* - Mon Nov  2 02:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Oedipus, Electra(Doyouevenlift) took the initiative the moment they arrived in the field, their hands were raised to chest level, and immediately they made a single seal, their hands were almost like a blur. As their chakra moved into the surrounding area, Marissa would begin to see the grass suddenly spiral upwards in front of her eyes, as the figure took off running towards the north.* - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Oedipus, Electra(Doyouevenlift) didn't quite stand in one spot, they kept on the move, looking at the deceased body of the person who had fought before, they made their way there, before aiming to leap atop of the corpse, They were familiar with this hiding like a mole technique, since it was very common amongst earth users, if they weren't standing on the ground, they couldn't be sensed, therefore, they hoped to draw their opponent out while they prepared to launch another attack the moment they appeared.* - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Oedipus, Electra(Doyouevenlift) wasn't as foolish as she might've thought, since they were focusing they heard the movement, as well as felt it beneath the body. And immediately they jumped forward, aiming to get themselves clear of whatever tampering the woman had done beneath the corpse, they were on the smarter side afterall and they didn't need to be a scientist to understand something fishy had just occured.* - Mon Nov  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Oedipus, Electra(Doyouevenlift) even in the case of the explosion, without a doubt the corpse would've  tanked a majority of the force of the blast, but the moment the explosions were first felt. They made it their duty, to leap away from the body, not managing to escape the damage totally, they suffered minor damage  from the residual effects of the explosion. Which were most likely light burns, they'd survive though. But the corpse probably wasn't in great shape.* - Mon Nov  2 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Oedipus, Electra(Doyouevenlift) was simply caught, and the tags blew around their legs, the blunt force trauma causing blood vessels to burst killing them ultimately.* - Mon Nov  2 03:41:00 2015
