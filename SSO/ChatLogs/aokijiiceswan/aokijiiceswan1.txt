<br><font color=yellow>*Hiran, Nitch(Aokiji_IceSwan) would be studyng the books of the hospital. These books titles would read, Science for Dummies, Evolution for Dummies, Biology, for dummies, Anatomy for dummies, and Chemistry for dummies. Nitch would seek out the knowledge of what exactly science was before stepping into the other readings that seemed like another language to him. Nitch had a drive to understand life, because he had an obsession with seeing the limits of humanity pushed. Being sent off to the hospital gave hims that chance to exlpore those desires he had. 

Nitch opening the first book Science for Dummies began to examine the pictures first. As a kid these tended to grab his attention more so than the big words he didn't understand. Nitch would find himself in the dictionary more so than the actual chapters at this point in time, but he would patiently study until he gathered the required knowledge needed.* - Fri Nov  6 19:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Booty Hulk(Aokiji_IceSwan) in the midst of shouting belligerent He'd be heat blindly making the brute bite his tongue! But, Geo would have notice something the man indeed was kicked, and he would appear to fall but he would use his momentum to drop the people's elbow on the young wipper snapper.

"OI, OI you remind me of my girlfriend Trilliam. All rowdy and enegetic! Let me show you my Longstyle technique!" 

The man would grab Geo by his legs and say, "Nice Booty" As he tosses him toward Hiroshi! In attempt to knock him off his feet!* - Sat Dec 12 00:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Booty Hulk(Aokiji_IceSwan) is impressed that the guy is able to defend himself against the people's elbow! The boy would then follow up with a powerful blnt attack to attmept major head trauma, but versus the man's durability it would be minimum as best! The man had little time to react toward the blitzing Mizora! As he's struck in the head by Geo he'd grab the boy firmly, but would be struck in his abdomen as he turned, thus closing the points successfuly! But as this occured the Hulk would muster strength to pull Geo (if possible through the barrage.) throwing off her punches with the shield Geo Dude. Thus forcing him to receive the rest of the blows if not stopped!.

After which the hulking man would seek to deliver a round house kick to Mizora while still holding onto Geo dude. As he was going to attempt to shove his hand up the boy's rectum and work his mouth like a puppet. 

But if his action was not allowed during the process the man would feel the full blunt force of Mizora's attack without fail. * - Sat Dec 12 00:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Booty Hulk(Aokiji_IceSwan) would be devasated and staggered. Sixty-four strikes that closed 64 points! The man was in over his head now. 

"I WILL HAVE BOOTY ARGH!" Having a lot of tenketsu point closed he could barely stand now, but he'd muster the stregnth! I'm weak in the knees..

"This must be how ol'girl felt when I beat that booty. hehehe." 

Hulk charges Hiroshi, but his speed would be cut and fatigue heavy! 

"I MUST HAVE IT!" 

He falls to a knee.

"Your Booty!!"

He unzips his garments and charges in full body!
