<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't bother participating in the battle, nor did he feel any sort of emotion towards the newly deceased. He did feel a sense of sorrow for the large man known as Maloth. Watching him grasp for the woman's life for it all to be in vain tugged at his soul. It was hard to watch, but he watched none the less.  Perhaps it was all due to the recent images of war that burned into his head.

Either way, he remained quiet and simply prayed for the departed soul in silence.* - Tue Sep 22 01:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was alone in the lands of Kumogakure. For days, he'd secluded himself up in the mountains to better hone his skills. The shinobi clasped his hands together, forming the single tiger seal required for the jutsu he was currently training. A surge of chakra overcame his body, charging up his inner pathways. 

The chakra circulated through his body as he took a step forward, releasing the built up chakra through his legs.  In an instant, he'd disappear in a plum of smoke as he kicked off from the ground and hurled forwards. 

He'd stop his stride just a few feet away, only to suffer the consequences of virtigo. The genin  leaned his head over, trying to maintain his composure and stomach.  "Guh, this is going to be difficult to get used to," he commented to himself.* - Sun Sep 27 22:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued with his mountain training. The kumogakure genin raised his fists and began to strike out at the air, bobbing and weaving his torso in the process. He'd jump left to right, keeping on his toes to remain agile. As he went on with his basic training, he jumped up into the air, performing a forwards somersault, all while launching his left leg outwards. He'd slam the heel of his left foot out, striking out at the imaginary opponent who stood before him just as he landed onto the ground.   

He'd then strafe to the left, performing another somersault in which he snapped his leg out to perform an overhead axe kick. As his legs made contact with the ground, he quickly hopped back up, rotating his body in the process. His left leg extended out, kicking out, then the right followed shortly behind.   Once again, he landed upon the balls of his toes in which he'd lunge forwards and perform a jumping knee.

"Ha!", he shouted, as he moved his body fluidly. He'd once again jump up from the ground upon landing, twisting and contorting his body as he performed a backwards somersault.  As his body rotated in the air, he'd extend his left leg out, kicking out in an upwards motion. The momentum brought forth from the reverse somersault combined with his extended leg resulted in an upwards axe-kick, one in which the chin would be strike if used in proper combat.* - Sun Oct  4 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) decided to rest up and head towards the base of the mountain, to see if anything was going on.* - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015

"If you fuckers want a fight, then bring it," he spoke out, tilting his head to the side. Outside of combat, he was rather average, but for some odd reason, he just loved the blood rush that followed with a fight.

All he knew was that the man was rather physical, and had the defense to back it up. The last he saw, he witnessed the man get pierced by spikes. Since then, he surely bulked up quite a bit.

Kida grinned at the opportunity to combat such a man. He wanted to test his own limits, and see just how far he was able to go. As he watched Maloth step forwards, Kida lunged to the side, ducking the initial swing.  His eyes narrowed upon Maloth's frame as he launched a bone shattering kick towards his ribs.   "You've got to be faster than that!", he replied, testing the waters of the sparring session.* - Mon Oct  5 00:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was taken back by his ineffective kick. This was by far the first individual he'd been up against where his strength did nothing.  "Tch, what a monster. This is going to be fun," he thought to himself, smiling at his situation.   Just as he was about to retract his foot, he found himself stuck. His eyes darted to the source, being his ankle which was now had a massive hand wrapped around it.

"Shit," he muttered, quickly thinking of a counter. He was indeed in a rather disadvantagous position. A leg was held in his enemy's grip, and another leg was grounded.  In such a position, his options were limited, especially since his legs were locked.

Fearing for the worst, he chuckled and spoke a few mocking words. "Give me your best shot big guy." Just as the words flowed from his tongue, Maloth's fist came flying into his direction. The genin quickly crossed his arms into an 'X' formation, hoping that he'd be able to cushion the blow. Either way, he knew that the man's fists weren't for show. 

As the fist made contact with his body, he felt the strength pulsate through his entire being. Maloth definately wasn't weak, in fact, he was probably one of the most physical individuals he's been up against. Kida was of course enjoying their skinship bonding, but the punch still had damage behind it.   The wind was indeed knocked out of him, but he felt as though his body could still keep on going. After all, none of his bones were shattered, or felt as though they were breaking.  However, multiple hits surely could do the job.  

Kida was at Maloth's mercy for the time being, as he was turned into a human sized punching bag, while his leg was still in the male's grip. All he could do for the time being was keep on the defensive and wait for an opening.* - Mon Oct  5 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was still at the mercy of Maloth's giant frame.  His actions were still limited due to the grip the shinobi had. "Damn it..That hurt," he muttered to himself, still feeling the impact of the punch. 

"Think, think, think," he thought to himself as he began to wiggle around, trying to break free from the man's grip.  Before he knew it, he was now in a bear hug, legs dangling just inches above the ground.   Kida clenched his fists and began to buldge his muscles, resisting Maloth's grip. He was employing everything he could to get out of the man's grip, as every second he felt Maloth's muscles squeeze deeper into his body.   

With his legs dangling about, Kida decided to go for a dirty blow. Using the strength he held in his legs, he raised his knee up with as much force as he could, hoping to strike either the male's stomach or genitals. Even if that didn't work, he'd raise his other knee, bringing it before Kida's own stomach to act as a wedge between the two. Maybe it'd work, maybe it wouldn't, he wasn't entirely sure but he was hoping it would.

Had he freed himself, he'd quickly build distance between the two by stepping a  few feet back to readjust himself.  It was however obvious what would happen to him should he not be able to escape. * - Mon Oct  5 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was left defenseless against the combined might of Maloth's weight, and the force of the drop. As the dust settled, he remained on the ground, struggling to stand back up.  He was able to stand up onto his two feet, but only for a moment. His entire body ached from the combined might of the attack, plus the damage he'd obtained prior also had an effect on him. 

"Damn..That's another loss," he muttered to himself, falling to his knees. He retained his consciousness, but as far as things went, it was obvious he wasn't able to continue the fight. Had he kept on going, he'd probably suffer some serious injuries.

"Your win big guy," he called out, giving Maloth a thumbs up.  As the words flowed from his mouth, he laid himself onto the ground, closing his eyes. * - Mon Oct  5 03:17:07 2015
