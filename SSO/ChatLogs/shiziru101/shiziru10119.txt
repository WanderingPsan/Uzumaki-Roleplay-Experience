<br><br><font color=teal>*Yakato, Midori(MadameShredder) says: Did you miss us? - Sat Dec 12 22:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) rubbed his cheek. His eyes followed Shiro as she walked up the stairs. "I have no idea what's going on anymore," he thought to himself, chuckling under a smirk.  He then stretched his arms out and walked out of the house, opting to go for a walk.  Just as she made her way up the stairs,  Kida called out to Shiro. "I'm going for a walk. I'll be back."* - Sat Dec 12 22:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Yeah, sure. - Sat Dec 12 22:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) walked up the stairs and into the kitchen with leisure expression. He'd let out a sigh of relief, rotating his shoulders. "It feels good to not have to wear that disguise. It felt weird acting like that for what, five years? Oh well. We're home now. No point in playing pretend," he spoke. He'd then approach the group, sitting himself in an empty seat.* - Sat Dec 12 22:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Crap... five years? - Sat Dec 12 22:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: ..Not good. - Sat Dec 12 22:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: I was always better with sweets. - Sat Dec 12 22:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: And sour foods. - Sat Dec 12 22:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Not my kind of food but it's been done well. - Sat Dec 12 22:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked down at the food that was laid out for the group to enjoy.  He was quite surprised that Kariudo offered to cook, let alone actually did it. His eyes traveled  towards the others as they consumed their food.  Such a setting gave off a nostalgic feeling, but it also didn't seem right.  Something was off. Perhaps it was all due to their prolonged absence from such a lifestyle that made this very scene feel so foreign.

After all, they all were traveling abroad to various villages and settlements for the past 5 years. "So, what have you been up to for these last 5 years exactly? You're more social," he spoke, breaking his own silence.  He'd then glance down at the curry, then back over at Kariudo, still feeling off about the situation. "I guess it has been a while," he thought to himself as he picked up a spoon and began to dig into his meal.* - Sat Dec 12 22:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Honestly... - Sat Dec 12 22:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It was quite an adventure..Sadly, we still never got the chance to kill Kyubishu. - Sat Dec 12 22:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Which sucks. - Sat Dec 12 22:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh.... that's too bad. - Sat Dec 12 22:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You just like... adventured? It wasn't business? - Sat Dec 12 22:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: That just makes it worse that they left me behind. - Sat Dec 12 22:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Adventured..... - Sat Dec 12 22:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It was. I mean, we left acting like we were merchants. - Sat Dec 12 23:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I got close to killing him, but things happened. - Sat Dec 12 23:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...So it was all just to kill one boy? - Sat Dec 12 23:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh right, that Ryo kid, seems like he died from the injuries you gave him Shiro. - Sat Dec 12 23:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: If I knew that I would have just gone and killed him myself. - Sat Dec 12 23:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Mostly. Also, we owed Shiro an adventure. - Sat Dec 12 23:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Which, we never finished. Oh well.  - Sat Dec 12 23:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Didn't know I hit that hard. - Sat Dec 12 23:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yep. Well a mix of both, but mostly from yours. - Sat Dec 12 23:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So. - Sat Dec 12 23:03:37 2015
