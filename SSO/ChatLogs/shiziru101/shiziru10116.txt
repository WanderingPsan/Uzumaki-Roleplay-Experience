<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked quite a distance away from Ichiro. He wanted to seclude himself into training. "This should be good," he muttered to himself. He stretched his limbs before beginning his training. 

To begin, he kicked off the ground, entering a mad dash forwards. It was all for a running start. As he picked up speed, he started to look around to determine a target. Seeing how there weren't any viable targets nearby, he resorted to the good ol' imaginative figure.  

In a single leap, he jumped off the ground and pulled his left leg back.  Using the initial momentum from his running start, Kida lashed out his leg to generate a rotating force. The two momentums mixed together caused the shinobi to spiral around like a tornado.  

His body continued to rotate lie a propeller as he continued with his assault. The more kicks he unleashed, the higher he climbed in the air. It was remarkable, however he felt unsatisfied with his attack.

When the climb ended and he unleasehd his last kick, he found himself landing onto the ground with a thud. "Tch, not enough," he muttered, starting back from square one. * - Mon Dec  7 02:04:09 2015

"Where have you been anyway? I've been looking for you," he added.* - Mon Dec  7 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was just about to gather some supplies for their journey when he noticed Yuriko standing like a statue.  He approached her and extended his finger to poke her in the forehead. "Yo," he called out.* - Mon Dec  7 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You're pretty fast. And yeah, we'll need help getting into Kirigakure. - Mon Dec  7 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Of course, if I help you with this does this mean you accept my offer? - Mon Dec  7 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I accept it, but the person who's out tie breaker is skeptical. So, I'm assuming if this goes well, we'll be good. - Mon Dec  7 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright, then I want to hear the deal on getting in. Are you just needing entrance into Kirigakure? - Mon Dec  7 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, getting into the village is a thing. Besides that, I'm not sure what else we'll need. I'm sure the others will think of some things.  Just follow me. - Mon Dec  7 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) began to walk off towards where he left Shiro and Ichiro. He expected the female to follow.* - Mon Dec  7 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I brought a copy of the papers if you wanted to look over them to show proof I am legitimate.--Mn, honestly I want to support your group to do as you wish here. In the future maybe I will need something that both your group and I will need. Such as this situation with going to Kirigakure, I'm willing to help to benefit me in the future. - Mon Dec  7 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: For this you will be from Takumi no Sato, a small village that is non shinobi oriented. They will think you are there to sell goods, I have a caravan waiting outside Amegakure for you to complete the look. Getting into Kirigakure isn't all that hard. - Mon Dec  7 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No henging obviously since there is a henge check. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: As long as my head ends up there. - Mon Dec  7 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) nodded his head as he crossed his arms. He thought long and hard for a fake name. At first he thought it to be a simple effort, but the more thought he gave it, the harder it was to produce a name. After what felt like hours, his eyes widened. "Ah! I got one. What about-" he then paused at Shiro's bad naming sense. "Isn't that what you made up before?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Anything else we should get before we go? - Mon Dec  7 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn... you need to tell me if you need anything else. - Mon Dec  7 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There's other ways of disguising yourself than using henge. - Mon Dec  7 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Make up huh? - Mon Dec  7 03:47:24 2015

It looked confused and rather aggitated, but Tetsu didn't pay it any mind. He glanced at the others as village guards approached their caravan to do their regular inspection.  "We're here for trade.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) said not a word and approached Ryo. He towered over the child, glaring down at him with anger in his eyes. He took a deep breath as he balled his fist and raised his left high into the air.  In a single motion, he hurled his fist forwards at the child's face. But alas, he stopped his punch just inches away from his target. "I should punch you, but I rather not cause any problems," he spoke, stuffing his hands into his pockets and walking back over towards his companions.

"Be lucky that we are merchants, had we been anyone else I'm sure you'd be in some serious trouble," he added.* - Mon Dec  7 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: unles you forgot to post it - Mon Dec  7 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) stood there,scratching his head for a moment. Before he knew it, his companions had darted off into the offense.  "Damn it. And I wanted to drink and dine tonight," he called out.  He had two options, join in the conflict, or stay out of it.  Seeing how either option would hold negative results for the male, he flipped a mental coin. 

His decision was made and he quickly lunged into a dash, aiming his sights at the one who started it all, Ryo.  He quickly jumped off the ground, reeling his leg back just before unleashing it forwards to drive his body forwards like a propeller.  His leg would spin around, slamming into Ryo's form, all while bringing him higher and higher in the air with each consecutive kick.   At first he was going to play nice, but after watching his companions go into battle mode, he couldn't hold back.* - Mon Dec  7 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) felt his feet touch the surface after kicking into Ryo. It was a plesant feeling, kicking into someone, but it wasn't enough. He wanted more. A sinister grin started to form across his face as he back peddled a bit, glancing around the area. He was like a wild wolf searching for its prey. 

Without thikning of the others, he quickly jumped up to the wall of the inn, applying hsi chaakra to his feet to stick. He then began to run up the wall, only to jump off above from where Ryo was currently positioned. 

Down he decended, folding his legs as he prepared his attack. Using gravity to his advantage, he quickly threw his legs out, just moments before reaching Ryo.  His own weight along with the help of gravity further pushed Ryo into the ground. His target being the center of the youth.  He was a few levels away from getting the Kyubishu treatment.* - Mon Dec  7 08:47:47 2015
