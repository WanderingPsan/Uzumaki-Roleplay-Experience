<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) walked into the courtyard all alone.  The two companions he had previous were not with him, and he was without his cart. His eye glanced around the area, taking notice to the various shinobi in the area. "Ah, more customers!", he spoke out with a smile.

He then scrunched his brows as he recalled the events from prior. "I have a complaint," he added, placing his hands onto his sides.* - Tue Dec  8 03:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) noticed Kyubishu too wore an eyepatch, albet different than his own. He could see from his single good eye that the male covered his eye with his forehead protector.  "Ah, a man of style I see. Would you be interested in some of our fine clothes?", he spoke.* - Tue Dec  8 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Sadly, we don't have a large amount of clothing at hand, as most of our cargo is in our caravan back in the village's storage. We were just about to leave, but I suppose I can show you some before we do. - Tue Dec  8 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) took Kyubishu to the storage house in which their ox and caravan was located. The room wasn't large, rather it was of average size for a merchant.  He motioned over towards his stock that he brought into the village. "This is our store house, at least for now.   We've weapons, clothes, spices, and the lots," he added.

Tetsu then walked over towards a closed container, opening it and sticking his arm into it.  In a fluid motion, he pulled out a piece of clothing, robes to be exact.

"I've more than this," he added, handing the male the robes.* - Tue Dec  8 04:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) pulled up to the village gates with nothing but a lage bag of supplies.  He had his travel papers and everything. He had just came from Kirigakure selling some of his wares, but alas trouble happened which caused him to find himself in the area of Suna. He let out a sigh as he approached a guard, talking to him and explaining his situation.

"I'm a traveling merchant. I've come to sell my wares, well whatever I have left. I lost a large shipment due to some complications in Kirigakure and their friendliness. Either way, I aim to make my profits here."* - Tue Dec  8 05:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) was still at the entrance, conversing with the guard. He then noticed a female behind said guard. "Oh hi! I'm a traveling merchant. I've come here to sell my goods.  Sadly, I lost majority of it in Kirigakure after being attacked by some of their Shinobi," he began.* - Tue Dec  8 05:40:28 2015

"Oh how I miss the companionship of a lovely women," he thought to himself, letting out a sigh.* - Tue Dec  8 05:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) walked over towards Izanami. He extended his hand out just like the others. He had no idea what she was going to do, but he was used to the various checkpoints from different villages. In this day and age, it became common.* - Tue Dec  8 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) reeled his hand back as the kunai pricked his skin.  He gripped his hand, looking at the blood dripping down. "Ow," he winced, swatting his hand about.  "Ah, I get it now.  This is quite an odd means, at least compared to Kirigakure. Then again, I wouldn't want to go there anyway. So, am I cleared?", he asked, keeping his thumb pressed onto the small puncture wound in his palm.* - Tue Dec  8 05:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) was directed into the center of the village.  He had his merchandise in his bag, which was over his shoulders.  He glanced around, trying to find a good source of information.  His eye locked onto the pink haired female clad in armor.

He approached her and extended a hand, followed by a warm smile. "Hello there. May I ask, is there an inn around here?", he began.* - Tue Dec  8 05:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) let out a sigh, stuffing his hand back into his pockets. "I guess it's going to be Kirigakure all over," he muttered. His energetic tone had dropped. Seeing how he was being ignored, he looked around for another person who might be a guide to him.* - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: There is an Inn. - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015

I doubt they'd make it here, but just in case they do, I'd like for you to let them know that I'm safe. That is if they come here and I've gone.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: About the Hokage holding people hostage for her own desires in the mansion. - Tue Dec  8 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) whispers: I haven't seen that. I do know that she has close ties with Suna. I remember seeing here there a couple times when I visited before. - Tue Dec  8 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Hm... - Tue Dec  8 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) whispers: Why wouldn't you? And it seems a bunch of people from Suna and Konoha. I saw one guy from Kiri though. - Tue Dec  8 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Hm... whatever. - Tue Dec  8 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) let her walk off. He waved at the female and then walked his own way. "I'll be staying at a near by inn," he spoke.* - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) approached the academy all casual. He had a large backpack on his pack. One could see various items sticking out from its opening. He had a smile on his face, even though he only had a single eye.

"Howdy," he called out, waving at the Kirigakure genin. "Ah, you were at the scene," he spoke, pointing over at Yumiko. "I'd like to apologize for what happened. It wasn't my intention for things to go south. I'll give you four a discount of my wares," he spoke.  He then paused for a moment, glancing at the area.

His single eye laid visage upon Kyubishu. Suddenly, his calm face turned into a frown. "Hey you! What happened?"* - Wed Dec  9 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Oh. - Wed Dec  9 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm, Kirigakure was once my village aswell so of course im inclined to care about its well being just as mnuch as Sunagakures. - Wed Dec  9 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I hear some fishy stuff has been going on. - Wed Dec  9 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *glances at Anguo*  - Wed Dec  9 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Maybe Rias wasn't totally wrong... - Wed Dec  9 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) was just there with his merch, still trying to sell his wares. So far, he was having a difficult time selling them. He let out a sigh as he scratched his head, realizing that his customer had just dipped. He crossed his arms and began to think of his next agenda. 

"Hm..I'm going to need the caravan again," he mumbled.* - Wed Dec  9 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Ryo is dead? - Wed Dec  9 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Wed Dec  9 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) stood there with a confused expression on his face. "Shinobi killers? Since when was selling product a means of threatening a village?", he spoke, glancing over at Heiwa. He was utterly confused, as he didn't know the fate that had fallen upon Ryo. In fact, he thought everything was going well due to his interactions with the various shinobi in the village afterwards, plus he made a point to voice his complaint. 

However, it seemed as though things went further south than he had perceived.  "What are you talking about?", he asked, wanting to know what was going on.* - Wed Dec  9 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: We aren't murderers, just merchants. - Wed Dec  9 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Eye witness testiomies. Lead by Nori, Sekitsui, Yumiko, Ryo himself on death bed, and, yes, me. - Wed Dec  9 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What exactly did you two do to Ryo..? - Wed Dec  9 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: If you're referring to the incident from prior, no one was killed. Seriously injured, yes, but killed no. - Wed Dec  9 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: He died of his wounds shortly after in the hospital. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was an act of self defense might I add. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Shortly after?  - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Tragic. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: But not my fault. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You tried to punch him and he reacted against you. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ....Hm.. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is legal as a shinobi. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Tried to? No, I simply played a joke like he did to us. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Throwing a punch is a joke. Very clearly it is not a threat that we, as shinobi, face every day. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Whatever the case may be, you still killed somone, a child at that... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Jail would be appropriate... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was a scare tactic for his actions against us. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The problem is they are excellent taijutsu users. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Our jails are not strong enough. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I'd like to let it be known that I've killed no one. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Hasn't been seen. - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Woah, isn't that a bit extreme seeing how this is a case of self defense? - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: It was not a case of self defense. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It was. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Do you not recall me asking for your help to lead him away before the situation got worse? - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ren himself charged towards either Nori or I. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Both of which were not harming anyone in the struggle. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: If they accept to jail time, then it is to be put in their trust to remain there, if they escape or try to escape it's clear they do not care and are open to being exiled or hunted down as fujitives. - Wed Dec  9 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *glances at Ren* - Wed Dec  9 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And then the next member attacked a shinobi of the village. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And then another member, you, tried to do the same. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Intentional or not, punishment is needed. - Wed Dec  9 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I asked him to leave us alone, and I even asked for Heiwa and Nori to help calm him down, as his threats were having a reaction on one of our own, one who is not present- - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: But they should at least know the truth. - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Just what they want. - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Take the punishment. - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is self defense, right? - Wed Dec  9 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Saying you will rip someone's spine in half? - Wed Dec  9 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Before any fights start? - Wed Dec  9 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's a bit of jail time....there's no need to go through any other hoops or fights for this....you can atleast  honor a boys death by owning up to it.  - Wed Dec  9 03:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Our village at the time was disallowing any shinobis. - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: They were here illegally. - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ryo was doing a check to see if they were trained as shinobis - if they were more than simple merchants. - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This was his job. - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is not the example to set for -any- shinobi in the village. I am offering them a simple chance at exile. - Wed Dec  9 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: You mean to say that...Your shinobi at the gates are failures in their checks? - Wed Dec  9 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: They can accept or decline. - Wed Dec  9 03:26:04 2015

However, I believe the situation is being steered in the wrong direction."* - Wed Dec  9 03:26:56 2015

"If you see our third companion, please don't instigate anything, as she's more than likely will bite back. Just let her know that we've left and returned back to Takumi." He paused for a moment and looked over at Izanami.

"The offer for those discounts still stand Little Missy. Perhaps elsewhere I can explain to you what has happened, but seeing how Heiwa doesn't want to acknowledge his own wrong doings in the situation, and his lack of action, it'll have to wait another time." 

He then looked back towards Ren and began to leave. "I do hope you burn this incident into your mind, the aspect of treating merchants with some sense of hospitality.  Oh and Nori, once again, thank you for your help," he added.* - Wed Dec  9 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: What we'll do is simply plant some along the Mizukage's mansion. - Wed Dec  9 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Others along the bridge leading to the exit. - Wed Dec  9 03:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Of course they'll be on high alert, so be as covert as possible. - Wed Dec  9 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Of course. - Wed Dec  9 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: The bridge will be easy, but the Mizukage's mansion will be a task. - Wed Dec  9 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That it will. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Our best bet there is planting them within, rather than outside. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Hm..But how would we get inside? I doubt they'd let us in. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Simple. - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Let me guess, we're going to kill some guards? - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Make it as clean as possible. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That's going to be difficult. I'm not the clean and silent type. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: At the least, get them away from the mansion. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: ? - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: What we can do... - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Destroy the bridge. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Attract attention there. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Ah. That makes sense. There's other exits from the village. - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: If need be, we can make haste over the walls. - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I guess we send the caravan towards the bridge? - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Make it look like we were attacked. - Wed Dec  9 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: We just need two bodies then. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Well. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: For realism. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: We can simply sell on the market. - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Prepare the caravan, sell it to a willing buyer. - Wed Dec  9 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Surely someone, would enjoy travelling. - Wed Dec  9 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: That is true.  - Wed Dec  9 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: So we're going to sell everything first, then have someone buy the caravan and cause it to explode huh? - Wed Dec  9 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Indeed. - Wed Dec  9 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Let's get this plan to motion then. - Wed Dec  9 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Of course. - Wed Dec  9 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) clapped his hands together just moments before rubbing them together. He broke out into a wicked grin as he rushed over to grab the caravan and just about everything that was attatched to their name. After a certain amount of time had elapsed,  Tetsu could be seen leading the ox back towards where he last seen Ren.

"The ox and the merchandise. You want to sell it, or do you want me to do it?", he asked, holding its reigns in his grip.* - Wed Dec  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: You can handle such. Mercantile isn't something I can do. - Wed Dec  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) led the ox down the road leading to the general marketplace.  Just before he took it to be sold, he grabbed a large bag of merchandise and chucked it over at Ren. "That's what we're keeping," he spoke out. 

Eventually, Tetsu made it down to the market place. It was a busy section of Kirigakure, just not that busy.  Kirigakure had a rather negative connotation when it came to merchants, thus their trade was effected as such. The market was still viable and thriving, just not at what it could and should be.  The one-eyed merchant let out a sigh as he glanced at those in the area. They were pretty pathetic in terms of human beings, at least that's what he thought. He never was into such stuff, but lately it started to see just how fun it was.

A man approached Tetsu, observing the ox and caravan. He wore thick robes, and looked just like a foreigner. "Ah, I see a pleasant ox you've got there. And a caravan. Are you perhaps a trader as well?" the male asked. Tetsu glanced in his direction and smiled back. "Yeah. I'm in a rush and I need money. I'll sell this all for a few thousands. How about it? Ox and merchandise included," he replied.

The man looked at Tetsu with widened eyes. He wasn't sure if this was a con, or a deal. The items he had in the cart were well over half a million, so to get them for such a price was difficult to believe. "What's the catch?" the merchant asked. Tetsu shook his head, "Nothing. I just want to settle down. I'm not into this anymore," he answered.  The merchant nodded as if he understood Tetsu's emotions.  He then reached into his robes and pulled out a large coin purse, placing it into Tetsu's hands. "Deal." Tetsu smiled and then filled out the proper paperwork before granting ownership of the merchandise to the unknown male. Now with one task finished, he had to prepare for the other departing goals. After making sure his end of the deal was completed, he made his way back to where he last left Ren. "It's done. No more caravan and ox."* - Wed Dec  9 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Good. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Has he set out? - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: From last I saw, he was getting ready. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: But he's still in the village. - Wed Dec  9 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Damn. I should have given him an incentive to leave soon. Think I should go look for him? - Wed Dec  9 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fujimoro, Ren(Master Roku) says: Probably, we need this to go quickly and swiftly. - Wed Dec  9 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  9 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) was just about to go leave to search for the man he had just made a business transaction with.  As he took a few steps away from Ren, he noticed off in the distance a familiar silhouette. It was the caravan he had just sold.  "Wow, just my luck." he muttered, chuckling to himself.  

As he watched the man trot along the pathway, Tetsu jumped out to say his farewell. "Hey, I see you're leaving already.  I'd like to thank you for buying the stuff. I'm sure it'll all go well for you," he spoke, extending his hand out to the man. The man smiled as well and gripped Tetsu's hand, shaking it as a friendly sign. "No problem.  I should be thanking you. You're making me rich." The man then burst into laughter, prompting Tetsu to mimic.  The two had a brief conversation, and before they knew it, the man had departed on his journey. It was a bit heartwarming, yet sad as the man's journey most likely won't last long given the affairs of the world.  Tetsu then looked over at Ren and shrugged his shoulders. "Well, that answers our question." * - Wed Dec  9 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) followed after Ren who had stalked behind the caravan. After he saw it explode, he began to make his way towards the mansion with haste.
