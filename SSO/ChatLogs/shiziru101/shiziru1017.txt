<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Where is Misa... - Tue Oct 13 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a loud yawn as he stretched his arms up above his head. As of lately, he's been rather bored. With the current status of the village, there wasn't much he could do but train and try to help with reconstruction. However,  with the new Raikage, he has become quite skeptical of her ability. From his own perspective, she seemed like the paranoid type who would hide at the first sign of danger, a fatal flaw for a leader. Whether he had such views about her or not mattered not in the grand scheme of things.

Kida let out another  yawn as he sat himself onto the ground. "I should go back to training," he thought to himself, eyes glancing around the remains of Kumogakure.* - Tue Oct 13 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) as always, was alone in Kumogakure. He'd spent all of his days doing nothing but training to perfect his body and craft.  The genin would always begin a work out with a series of sit-ups and push-ups, before stepping into anything serious. Once he was done with his warm ups, he'd place himself into a rather secluded area so that he wouldn't be disturbed. 

"Alright," he'd say to himself as he finished warming up his limbs. The shinobi then clasped his hands together, forming a series of hand seals all in rapid succession. After finishing the hand seals, he'd convert the chakra that rested in his abdomen into a malleable force. He'd take in a large amount of air through his nostrils as he spat out a thick mist from his mouth. The mist spewed from his lips at a constant rate, soon covering his body and eventually obscuring his own vision, leaving nothing but a thick veil of smog.

At first, the plume of mist was faint, but after applying more chakra into it, the cloud became denser. The mist continued to spread around his body, thinly coating his form. It wasn't difficult to see his visage, but as he applied more chakra into the technique, his form would soon become difficult to make out. Eventually, the entire area became filled with chakra infused mist.  
Kida squinted his eyes as he stopped releasing the plume from his mouth, looking over at the obscured area. Even though it was his own technique, he had difficulty seeing far off. At just a few feet, he had a hard time viewing his surroundings. The shinobi let out a sigh as he formed another hand seal, causing the mist to fade slowly.
* - Wed Oct 14 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waited for the mist to clear up before starting off with his physical training. He'd bounce up and down on the balls of his feet, bobbing left and right as he began to build up from the bouncing motion. Once he felt as though he'd obtained enough bounce, he'd launched himself into the air with a series of aerial kicks, finishing the combo with a fierce axe.

As he jumped into the air, his body rotated in a clock wise motion, swinging out his left leg for a low sweep.  He'd use the rotation generated from the initial kick to provide additional support and power to the second kick, aimed towards the center mass. After kicking towards the center, he'd use the remaining momentum for a high kick, followed by a downwards axe. As his legs lashed out, his body continued to propel in the air, gaining air with each kick.

Upon landing on the ground, he dashed forwards, entering another kicking combination. He'd start off with a low sweep, snapping his leg out to break the legs of any who stepped in his way, rotating his body using the combined effort of his footing and his hip.  Next he'd rotate his body, lifting the same leg up to a chest level, delivering a fierce roundhouse to the torso area.  Building up on momentum, he'd raise his leg higher, now aiming it towards the skull. His leg smashed along the imaginary foe's head, as he quickly switched legs, raising his right into the air before descending it down upon the foe's body.

He smiled upon completing the combo, as a sense of achievement washed over him. He was happy with the way his legs connected to deliver such blows. With the euphoric sense washing over him, he decided to retry the combo again, this time adding more to it. He'd begin with a swift strafe forwards, using his lower body make the most out of the short sprint. Quickly, he'd raise his left leg, snapping it low as to aim for the legs. He'd then switch legs, using the right to aim for the opposite side. Kida's legs would soon travel along the imaginary body, striking out from left to right as his legs climbed the body. All while dealing maximum damage. He'd then finish it off with another axe leg, aimed towards the skull.  Had this been a live human opponent, the individual in question would most likely have suffered some serious life threatening injuries, but it didn't matter to him. He enjoyed combat and exerting himself physically.

Once his feet found themselves back onto the ground, he quickly jump forwards, twirling his body as he extended his left leg out. The back of his foot would descend downwards, slamming into the imaginary body. Before the phantom figure had the chance to recover, he quickly follow up with another series of kicks. His legs would raise from the ground, striking the foe's chest first, then working their way down to the legs. Afterwards, he'd finish off with another jaguar kick, one aimed directly at the skull.* - Wed Oct 14 07:48:03 2015
