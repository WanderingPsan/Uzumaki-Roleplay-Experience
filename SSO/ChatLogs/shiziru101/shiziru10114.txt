<br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what do you rate her? 1-10. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: She's not Shiro though. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Trash. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That's what I rate her. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ouch. Hard crowd. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I thought Shiro would come out at any moment to be honest. I feared for my penis. - Sun Nov 29 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: If she saw us, we both would probably be dead. - Sun Nov 29 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Not that I was serious with the flirting or anything. - Sun Nov 29 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I don't get it... - Sun Nov 29 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: How'd she even know we were here? - Sun Nov 29 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Who? Yuriko, or Shiro? - Sun Nov 29 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Sun Nov 29 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The one you called trash? Seems like she was exploring around. - Sun Nov 29 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Oi, Kida. - Sun Nov 29 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'll be outside. - Sun Nov 29 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked out of the 'base', and saw Shiro and Ichiro just a few yards away from the entrance. He walked off to the side and seats himself, choosing to be a spectator of whatever was going on.* - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: He seems faster than before. - Sun Nov 29 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I knew it.. - Sun Nov 29 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Fuck... - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Join in and help Ichiro. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Two against one. - Sun Nov 29 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stood up from his seat, dusting himself off from the dirt that clung to his body. "I'll join I guess. Just don't beat us up too bad," he'd say in a cheeky tone.   He'd quickly join in to the bout.  

In an single leap, he found himself in the air, rotating and twirling his body to position himself directly above Shiro. "Here we go!", he shouted, throwing down a single axe kick into his partner's frame.* - Sun Nov 29 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't expect for Shiro's response. His eyes widened out of a bit of shock, seeing his attack halted in mid motion. "Damn," he thought to himself. Suddenly, he felt his body pull towards the ground, a combined effort of gravity and Shiro's movements.  He had to think on his toes, thus he lashed out a single kick with his free leg, aiming to strike her arm just moments before she made her move.* - Sun Nov 29 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) quickly found himself released from Shiro's grasp, readjusting himself to a standing position. He then took a step back, recalling the movements from prior. "Ah, that's what that was," he muttered.* - Sun Nov 29 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: No, you think I'd give up that easily? - Sun Nov 29 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) groaned at Shiro.  He looked like a child who was being neglected of ice cream or something. "Fine," he spoke, turning his gaze over towards Ichiro. 

"Let's go at it." Uttering that single phrase, Kida dashed forwards, launching himself into a barrage of kicks.  He'd switch between feet as he inched closer and closer to Ichiro, striking hot and fast.  One towards his knees, thigh, chest, and head. * - Sun Nov 29 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was rather bumbed out about the turn of events. His anger swelled from inside, feeling a sense of shame and inferiority. "Tch, I can't stay the weakest link," he thought, focusing more on his assault.  

He was on the verge of dodging, but opted not to, in turn for going all offensive.  His head would rear back after he halted his assault, watching Ichiro go for a counter. In a thrusting motion, he hurled his head forwards butting the fist.  He wasn't as sturdy as Ichiro or Maloth, but he was sturdy in his own right.  

"Let's turn this up!", he shouted.* - Sun Nov 29 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took a step back as his skull bounced along Ichiro's fist.  It stung a bit, but it was nothing that he couldn't handle. His lips curled into a smile as he embraced the challenge.

Kida quickly pivoted to the side with a single step, just narrowly keeping from receiving the punch. He felt it's force brush agaiinst his clothing. Without missing a beat, he took to the offensive, stepping into Ichiro's zone and throwing a hard knee to his gut.  Following behind the knee, Kida send an elbow towards the back of his foes head, should the first strike connect.* - Sun Nov 29 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) kept an eye out for Ichiro, as he was his sole target.  When he rolled along, his head turned, following his movements.  However, that's where Kida made the mistake. He had left his right side open, not intentialy, but by accident.  Using a quick burst of adrenaline, he lowered his right arm, collapsing it to shield a large part of his side.  Of couse, he couldn't defend himself from every attack, but a decent portion. Kida quickly pushed himself forwards, sending a shoulder charge into Ichiro's direction, all while enduring the ensuring attacks.* - Sun Nov 29 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued with his charge, feeling his weight connect with Ichiro's frame. However, something felt off. There was no recoil per say, the sensation of knocking someone over.  He took another glance and found Ichiro performing a clinch. 

The two were in a rather disavantagous situation. Kida had nothing in his arsenal to combat a grapple, but that didn't stop him from trying.  For a moment, he thought of bringing the fight to the ground, but that would tilt the scale over towards Ichiro's perspective.   It was then that he decided to aim for his legs, choosing to weaken the base to lower mobility and overall power.

Before noticing the incoming palm strike, Kida raised his right foot and sent it crashing into Ichiro's foot. As he did so, he'd push forwards just slightly to tilt the balance. * - Sun Nov 29 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) saw the fruits of his attack bare. The instant Ichiro released his clinch, Kida charged forwards like a mad dog. He instantly halted his assault, after hearing Ichiro's words. "Alright. I guess we can stop," he answered, plopping himself onto the ground.* - Sun Nov 29 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I think that's the first I've seen Shiro use that stance. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's a second for me. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah.. - Sun Nov 29 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess I just have to get stronger. Can't slack off anymore. - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's strange... - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: How much stronger she's become since she met Nigen... - Sun Nov 29 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Don't mention this to anyone but, Shiro was nothing like that prior to meeting Nigen. - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That wasn't even her name before then. - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Really? - Sun Nov 29 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What was it? And just how much of a jump in strength did she gain? - Sun Nov 29 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Her name was Makoto. - Sun Nov 29 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Makoto huh?  I'm assuming you knew her before she met Sado? - Sun Nov 29 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I met her the same day she met Sado. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just an hour beforehand. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So whatever he did to her, got her stronger huh? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just a bit. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's that purification thing. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Which... - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I asked Sado about... - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: He says you and I were options for it but. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We're already on the right path, so we don't need it. - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well whatever it is that I need to do to get stronger, I'll do it. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Even if it means selling my soul. - Sun Nov 29 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I feel like...Asteroth and Sado are hiding something. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A power. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A 'dark art.' - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I can't let her stay stronger than me. How would it seem being the weaker one in the relationship? Pathetic. - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You mentioned it before. What is this 'dark art' thing? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'm unsure. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But I don't think it's anything like ninjutsu or genjutsu. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's something entirely new. - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Something new? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Is that possible? - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I believe so. - Sun Nov 29 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Think we can use it if we try? - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I doubt it. - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We've no idea what it is, so how could we? - Sun Nov 29 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We'll get them to tell us more. - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've seen some of what Asteroth is capable of with hers. - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But Sado's... - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: His is a mystery... - Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But you know he has it? - Mon Nov 30 00:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I see.. - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, did you tell Shiro yet about that daimyo chick? - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess I'll tell her then. - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yo. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Yoshima Monomyth) says: HEy~ - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You're a new face. - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Yoshima Monomyth) says: I am! - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just eyed Akira. He couldn't tell at all what gender the person was.* - Tue Dec  1 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) crossed his arms and nodded silently. He had an old man air about him, wise and perverse. His eyes trailed along Akira's body, tracing her silhouette. "Hm..I see," he'd speak. He'd return his gaze towards her upper body, specifically the face. "I'd give a B," he thought to himself.

"So, what brings you here, Akira?"* - Tue Dec  1 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) remained in his crossed stance. He'd nod once more, "Didn't think natives stayed," he spoke.  His eyes followed her gaze, smirking as she gave the wink. "See something you like?", he added.* - Tue Dec  1 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) unraveled his arms and placed his left onto the female's shoulder. A sly grin rose from his face. "You're not trying to take my soul, or cut my junk off are you? It wouldn't be fun if you did that," he replied. * - Tue Dec  1 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smiled, "You're quite freaky. And here we are, just meeting for the first time. You're pretty bold."  He then began to chuckle.  His arm wrapped around her frame, keeping her close to his body.  "So, anything you want to do?", he asked, eyeing her up and down.  

"I wonder if I should include Shiro into this," he thought, deciding onto his next course of action.* - Tue Dec  1 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) paused for a moment, keeping Akira to his side.  He raised his free hand to his chin, thinking long and hard. "Hm...I've a fantasy I want to try out. You might, or might not be into it. Who knows," he spoke, breaking the silence.  He'd lower his left hand, reaching for the female's rear. 

"Let's keep an open mind," he added, grinning.* - Tue Dec  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You're the fast one here. - Tue Dec  1 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Yoshima Monomyth) says: So many lies~ - Tue Dec  1 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Lies? I only speak the truth. - Tue Dec  1 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Yoshima Monomyth) says: Maybe~ - Tue Dec  1 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, want to take this elsewhere? - Tue Dec  1 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I've got a room. - Tue Dec  1 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't know? - Tue Dec  1 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I went to Kumo recently, so not there. - Tue Dec  1 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) magically spawns out front like a bawss. * - Tue Dec  1 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Need to let that cool off. - Tue Dec  1 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Oh. - Tue Dec  1 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waved over at the Engi siblings.* - Tue Dec  1 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You guys seen some chick named Akira? - Tue Dec  1 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Earlier, we had. - Tue Dec  1 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. - Tue Dec  1 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What you think of her? - Tue Dec  1 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: An annoyance. - Tue Dec  1 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I think she should learn what a razor is. - Tue Dec  1 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) leaned forwards as he turned his head over towards Kariudo. He understood what she meant, or at least he thought he did.  A large mischevious grin formed upon his face. "Aw, you're fitting in.  Ichiro, your sister just became adorable," he announced.   

Kida took a step forwards, positioning himself directly infront of Kariudo. " I'l treat you to something for that. You just made my day," he added, grinning harder.* - Tue Dec  1 04:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Because I'm not sharing. - Tue Dec  1 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned his head towards Kariudo and let out a sinister grin. He then opened up his mouth, twirling his tongue around in a seductive way.   After demonstrating his thoughts, he closed his mouth and gave the female a thumbs up. "Mouth-to-mouth. That's what happens."* - Tue Dec  1 05:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) seemed a bit annoyed that he couldn't call Kariudo his "sister" anymore.  He then made a mental note to himself to keep calling her his sister, just not out loud or when she's around. 

He looked over at Ichiro and gave a thumbs up. "What do you take me for? A dog?  Besides, we already made an agreement before." he spoke. He then chuckled at Kariudo's joke. "You can break me anytime," he'd add, giving her a thumbs up as well.  "Just kidding. She's safe, trust me."  Kida then began to walk off, expecting his "sister" to follow.* - Tue Dec  1 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shrugged his shoulders. "We walked from there to here.  We can continue the walk after, but there's some things we need to be on an even field for," he began.  He sat himself into the ground, then patted it shortly, signaling the girl to do the same.* - Tue Dec  1 05:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Shiro follows his every wish, respects him, and is his slave essentially. - Tue Dec  1 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I know that you and Ichiro are Shiro's body guards for hire but hardly ever see the money and if you tried to leave she would hurt you but not kill you because she wants you around. - Tue Dec  1 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I know that Shiro is a taijutsu expert, the best I've ever seen or heard of. - Tue Dec  1 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You travel a lot and are thinking about taking a job when you normally never take jobs. - Tue Dec  1 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You left to go to your room, she left after an 'appropriate amount of time' had passed. Late you came out of the room with her, when we played the dice game she quickly stopped me fom taking you into the room with me and it wasn't because she wanted to sleep with me. - Tue Dec  1 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: She just wants to get a rise out of me.  - Tue Dec  1 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh right, everything we've talked about so far, don't let the others know. Especially Shiro and Sado. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:04 2015
