<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes, And scout the area. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Got it. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) now had a mission to accomplish. "Let's go," he said to himself dashing from the courtyard and towards the west wing of the village. As he ran at top speed, he glanced from side to side, looking for any potential threats that might have sneaked into the village. "Nothing so far," he muttered to himself as he approached the first housing complex.* - Sun Sep 13 21:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) arrived at one of of the houses. As he got there, he saw a family fleeing from their house which was on fire. "Calm down, we have everything under control. There's a safe house just up this road. Follow it and you'll be alright. We are currently being attacked, but our forces are repelling them," he said, directing the family to the safe house. He then went into another house and repeated the process countless times. All in all, he'd saved about 10 families.

Now with that portion of his task completed, it was now time to look for any enemies that may or may not be in the area.  He carefully walked around the now empty streets of Kirigakure, glancing over at everything that he could possibly imagine. Alas, he found nothing of interest in his search, which was a good thing. * - Sun Sep 13 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) came back to the square after he was done with what he was assigned. "I found no one, and I got everyone out. Now what?"* - Sun Sep 13 21:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a loud sigh as he listened to the two bicker. "Shouldn't we focus on more important matters, like the war? I mean we have a combined force of three villages going up against Amegakure's forces just outside of our walls.  To be arguing over fines and what not, it just seems pointless.  This isn't the time for that. Anyway, that Fuji guy and Mitsuru are taking their sweet time getting back. I wonder if they are alright."* - Sun Sep 13 22:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Once Kubo's gets back, I'll send you out on scouting duty. That way it will give something to do, because I know just as much as you. However much it hurts to be standing still in this. - Sun Sep 13 22:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shrugged his shoulders and walked over towards the side. Once he was settled, he began to shadow box with himself. He visioned an opponent who used their entire body to fight. The mental fighter took a fighter's stance, and so did Kida. He stared forwards at the imaginary figure and smiled. 

"Let's start," he whispered to himself as he launched a fierce right jab to the figure's chest. The figure blocked, and retaliated with a left knee to the rib. Kida instinctively lowered his left arm and wrapped it around his rib, shielding it from the blow.  He'd then twist his torso as he executed a low kick to the shin.  He'd continued to perform similar actions as he went on with his training.* - Mon Sep 14 21:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stopped his shadow sparring and headed over towards the waterfall upon hearing the village annoucement. It was a great time to improve his arsenal.* - Mon Sep 14 21:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) arrived at the waterfall upon hearing the annoucement. He glanced over at the other people who were there. "So this is where everyone was," he thought to himself.* - Mon Sep 14 21:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Alright.. - Mon Sep 14 22:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The Suimen ability is as easy as it can get. You all know how to knead your chakra already, so it's a matter of concentrating it to a certain point. - Mon Sep 14 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Obviously that certain point would be the bottom of your feet, so as you center your chakra and allow it to flow, deliver a steady flow to the your soles. - Mon Sep 14 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Then what? - Mon Sep 14 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Err. - Mon Sep 14 22:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) wasn't entirely sure what to do in terms of learning the suimen technique. Tethy's explaination seemed to lack some information, but it was alright. He had to make do with what he was given. The world wasn't a place where everything would be given to you on a silver platter. He took a deep breath and clasped his hands together, forming a single seal.

He closed his eyes and began to concentrate, feeling for the chakra that flowed through his body. Kida himself wasn't the greatest when it came to chakra conversion, but it was something that he could do. "Just focus," he muttered to himself, invisioning his chakra like a river moving in a steady direction. In his mind, he began to direct the chakra through his system, sending it to the bottom of his feet.  

The soles of his feet began to warm up slightly as the chakra was being poured into it. He felt the chakra coat his soles in a thin film. "Is this it?", he thought as he continued to maintain his concentration.  He was honestly unsure if he was doing it right, but he kept a steady flow of chakra in his feet. "Ok, now what?", he asked Tethys as he parted his hands. * - Mon Sep 14 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: ..What do you mean 'then what'..? - Mon Sep 14 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Step on the water... - Mon Sep 14 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) nodded. "Alright." He glanced over at the large mass of water that was stationed before him. There were many thoughts racing through his head, mostly concerns about getting drenched by the water if he failed. "I've got this," he said to himself as he inched closer to the lake. 

He paused right at the edge where there was a clear line between the water and the soil. There was doubt in his mind, but he had to go through with the training. After all, the mother of success is failure.  The genin took a deep breath as he placed his left foot onto the water gently.  It felt as though he was standing on solid matter rather than water. "I-I did it?", he questioned as he took another step into the pond. 

He indeed accomplished his task, or so he thought. Not even a full minute standing on the water, he found his body sinking. Perhaps it was a lapse of concentration, or just poor judgement, the result being that he now found himself about six inches in the water. 

"Damn..I almost had it," he commented to himself as he walked out from the lake.  "I had it for a moment. It must be from not enough chakra. I'll just have to use more," he theorized, taking a look at the current results. 

"Alright, round two," he called out, focusing his mind once again on the distribution of his chakra. Instead of his previous attempt, he decided to apply more chakra to his soles. He was sure that by applying more chakra, he'd be able to remain atop of the water. 

"Let's hope this one works," he thought to himself. Kida then proceded to walk over towards the edge of the water once more. He grinned at Tethys, a testiment to the success he was sure he'd obtain.   Just like prior, he placed a single foot onto the water's surface, then another. However, unlike the previous attempt, he was able to remain on the surface for just a single second.  Once again, he had failed.  He wasn't angry or anything, just puzzled.  For a moment, he believed that he had an understanding to the technique. 

Unsure of the cause of his failures, he walked back onto the land and sat down for a moment. He then began to examine Tethys and the water. He noticed that  he had complete control of his body over the water. Even with the water's constant changing state, he remained on top. "Hm..He said it was simple, so I must be over thinking. Or I'm just missing something. The first attempt, I was on the water for a moment, but the second attempt I wasn't able to maintain balance.  What if I alternate between outputs? I don't know why I didn't think of it, but water isn't like the ground. It's liquid and it's form changes very easily..If I were to regulate the flow, maybe I could achieve it," he theorized.  

With his theory in mind, he stood up from his seat and smiled, ready to go for a third try.* - Mon Sep 14 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hmm...I'd say about a Veteran Genin.. - Mon Sep 14 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Here's a scroll, may help you on your taijutsu, much like the last. - Mon Sep 14 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stretched his limbs before readying himself for a third try. This time he was confident that he'd get it. "I hope this works," he said as he started to coat his soles with another film of chakra.  Initially, he kept a static flow of chakra under his feet. He took a step forwards and placed his foot onto the surface. The moment his foot touched the surface, he began to alternate the flow of chakra, making it dynamic and syncing it up with the movement of the water. 

While he applied his chakra in such a way, he noticed the difference instantanously. Unlike before, he'd just fall into the water in less than a minute, but now he wasn't. He felt the water becoming a solid footing for him. "This is it! I've got it!", he called out, now placing his remaining foot onto the surface.   He then began to jump onto the water, further confirming his theory. With a smile, he then began to walk along the surface as if it were normal. 

"I guess I've got it," he called out to Tethys. * - Mon Sep 14 22:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) wanted to watch the fight, but he was more interested in increasing his combative capabilities. Heeding Jin's warning, he made his way back to the land. He nodded at Jin's explanation of the jutsu. "So basically, you're applying chakra to boost your own speed to reach a destination. Correct?", he asked, trying to gain a better grasp of the jutsu in question.* - Mon Sep 14 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I cant... take this... - Mon Sep 14 23:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...Guess I'll have another training sesson tomorrow. - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) clasped his hands together forming the tiger seal. He paid close attention to Jin's words. "Just apply the chakra to my legs and aim for an obtainable destination," he repeated in his mind as he closed his eyes to focus.  He started to draw his chakra, flowing it throughout his body and directing it down to his legs and ankles.   

A sensation of jolting energy pulsated through his legs as he continued to mold the chakra. "Is this it?", he thought.  The genin was filled with doubt in his mind, as he continued to channel his chakra to energize his legs.  It was only natural when learning something new.

"Alright, let's try this," he commented to himself as he opened his eyes and took a single step. In just an instant, he felt his body jolt forwards at unprecedented speeds.  "Shit!", he called out, quickly realizing that he didn't have control over how fast he was going, nor his exact direction.  As he felt his body hurl forwards, the speed died down and he eventually met himself with the ground.

The genin began to tumble along the ground like a rag doll, rolling around until he smacked into a nearby bush. "Ow!", he shouted, feeling the pain of hitting the ground and slamming into an object. He slowly stood up from the ground, feeling his body ache.  Suddenly, a sensation over took him and he soon found himself forced to puke.

After he was finished, he wiped his mouth and made his way back to Jin. "I'd say that was a failure..Heh," he called out with a smile.* - Tue Sep 15 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) nodded once more. He believed that he got a better grasp at the jutsu. If his mind couldn't understand it fully, his body sure would.  With a determined look on his face, he executed the tiger seal once more. "Alright, hold my body steady, and visualize a destination," he repeated in his mind.  The genin began to charge his chakra down into his legs once more, this time he maintained a steady stance.

Kida took a single step forwards and began to visualize his landing point; a nearby tree. As his vision blurred and the force of the jutsu pushed his body, he momentarily lost his concentration. For an instant he glanced over to the battle between Koeki and Tethys. Even though he was moving in high speed, he could see a blur of colors, blue specifically.  Even the sounds of the exploding waterfall caused him to look, which resulted in him slamming into the tree. 

"Gwuah!", he coughed out, now sprawled on the ground. "Gah! That hurt!", he shouted, wrapping his hands around his forehead.  "I almost had it too!", he spoke as he jumped back onto his feet, feeling somewhat groggy from the head on collision. * - Tue Sep 15 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..>Any Genin here lookin to train? - Tue Sep 15 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glared over at the two combatants with daggers. "Why can't they be a bit mindful of what's going on around them?" he muttered, dusting himself off from all the dirt that accumilated on his body from his multiple failures. 

He took a deep breath to calm himself down and to regain his focus. He was sure he'd obtain his desired results this time. He clasped his hands once more and began to focus his chakra into this legs. As he did so, he marked his destination for an open field per Jin's suggestion. After all, his failures were mostly due to the fact that he crashed into things.  He understood the execution of the technique, just not the exact landing and fine tuning that was needed to have a successful jump. 

After analyzing his mistakes thus far, he felt like he was ready for the third round. "This isn't going to be another failure," he said to himself as he lunged forwards. In the instant that he stepped forwards, he released the built up chakra that was stored, sending him hurling forwards at high speeds. 

As he got closer and closer to his destination, he began to focus his chakra more onto his ankles to lessen the strain and improve his landing. He quickly found himself stopping in the middle of the field with both of his feet safely on the ground, A cloud of dust lingered in the air around him, almost as if it were swirling around his body.  With a smile on his face, he raised his left fist up into the air "I've done i-". Before he even got the chance to finish his sentence, he quickly found the world spinning in his eyes. "The hell?", he called out, now feeling the sensation of his gut being pulled. It was an awful experience which caused him to stumble onto his knees and lean over.

"Ugh. Is this what you were talking about Jin?"* - Tue Sep 15 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smirked as he took Jin's hand, standing up onto his two feet. "I think watching this fight is the best choice right now," he said. He'd then set his eyes onto the two shinobi fighting.  "What is with Koeki?", he asked, staring at the chakra cloak that covered her body. * - Tue Sep 15 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I...don't know.... - Tue Sep 15 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced over towards Yan momentarily before resuming his spectation of the fight.  "I'm Kida. Nice to meet you."* - Tue Sep 15 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hassan.... You're Koeki's teacher right? Do you have any idea whats going on with her chakra right now? - Tue Sep 15 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just continued to watch the fight. He didn't know how to react in all honesty. He was completely mesmorized by the two fighting. He finally understood what Tethys meant by him being the strongest in taijutsu. However, he had no skill and only relied on brute force.  "I never expected the village to have such power houses..I should really step my game up," he thought to himself.* - Tue Sep 15 01:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked over towards Yan and raised his fists. "Alright, let's begin," he said in a calm tone.* - Tue Sep 15 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Sep 15 01:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Who will be her assistant my lord? - Tue Sep 15 01:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smirked as he saw the three clones materialize before him. "This is going to be fun," he said as he lunged forwards at the opposing four.  With his fists clenched, he throw a few stomach jabs at the two who approached for close combat ranged. With the third, he'd snap a swift kick towards it's the knee, aiming to disable it for the time being. * - Tue Sep 15 01:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) saw a mass of mud approaching him as he was combating the two clones. He quickly lifted his leg, stomping his foot upon the leg of one of clones and using it for footing. He then jumped up into the air, kicking said clone in the head in the process, and proceded to mount it so avoid the attack.  He'd stand on the clone's shoulders for a brief moment before using it as a stepping stone to jump over to the clear patch of land. 

"This is more fun than I thought." He quickly clasped his hands together to form the tiger seal in preparation for his next move. Suddenly, he remembered his previous experience with the jutsu and halted with forming the seal. "Shit. I almost did something foolish," he muttered to himself, now trying to figure out his next move.* - Tue Sep 15 02:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) crossed his arms in an "X" fiormation as the stream of water hurled into his body. He kept his feet planted onto the ground, trying to maintain his balance against the attack.  It honestly felt weird being shot by a stream of water that pushed him back. "Damn.. I need to get closer," he thought as he tried his best to endure the attack to refrain from being knocked into the mud. * - Tue Sep 15 02:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was honestly in a pickle. He was currently being pushed back by the currently flowing river of mud. "I guess I have no choice," he thought to himself as he clasped his hands together forming the tiger seal. As the river pushed his body, he began to focus his chakra into his legs, energizing them enough for his purpose. 

Without a stable footing, executing the technique would be risky, but it was worth it. He started to roll his body around, aiming to at least get his feet onto the ground for a moment, even if it was brief. Once he was able to have his feet touch the ground, he executed the technique.  In a flash he vanished from his location and was now in the air just a few feet above the flowing river, Yan and his clones. 

"Shit, I shouldn't have done that," he commented, already feeling the after effects of the jutsu he had just learned just moments prior. His head started to feel dizzy as he started to fall from the sky and into the fresh patch of land which wasn't touched by the river. * - Tue Sep 15 02:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) quickly found himself getting ganged up by multiple clones while in a weakened state from the after effects of the jutsu. He quickly went onto the defense, tucking his arms until he recovered. Once he was was finished recovering from the shunshin, sprang up from the ground with a knee to one of the clone's chin's. 

In that brief moment, he quickly twisted his torso and snapped a powerful kick to another clone's neck aiming to break it. He wasn't holding back, especially since he knew that these were clones.  There was no reason for him to hold back.  Each attack had the force and intent to inflict serious debilitating bodily harm.  In all honesty, he was having some fun when it came to this spar.  He couldn't ask for a better partner seeing how he would be able to fight to his heart's content.* - Tue Sep 15 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) really had to focus if he wanted to win this spar. Even if he didn't win, it would be good training either way.  He took a deep breath and glanced all around at him, sizing up each and every clone that was in his vision. "So this has now become a battle of attrition huh?" he spoke to himself as he stood in the center of the clone mass. 

"This is really fun!", he shouted as he stepped forwards with an elbow to one of the clone's faces. He'd quickly turn around and perform a sweeping kick on another, aiming to trip them up. Afterwards, he'd grab another and perform an overhead throw, tossing it upon a few others.  By then, he started to breath heavily, but he wasn't going to end right there.  The genin began to charge forwards, throwing a knee at a clone who was positioned infront of him. He'd swiftly perform a backflip, snapping his leg out in a reverse axe like motion. His objective was to aim for the clone's chin in an attempt to bring it to it's knees or at least rock them.  In all honesty, it wasn't easy dealing with the amount of clones that surrounded him.* - Tue Sep 15 02:46:11 2015
