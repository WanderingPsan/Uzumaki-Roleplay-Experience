He swished the bottle in his hand for a bit, getting a feel of what remained in it. A grin formed along his face as he motioned his free hand over towards the top of the bottle, pulling the cork out from its opening.  A nice sweet aroma began to seep out from the bottle, filling the merchant's nostrils.

"Ah, I can never get enough of this," he muttered, quickly drawing the bottle to his lips and chugging it down. "Gulp,gulp, gulp" That was the only noise emanating from the male.  The sound went on for about 30 seconds before he stopped, placing the cork back onto the opening. He then wiped his mouth down and stuffed the bottle back into his robes. "I'll save the rest for later," he whispered to himself.* - Thu Dec 10 01:57:45 2015

His eyes would focus on nothing but the wall. "Hm..Until we see doubles? Is that possible?",  he asked with a tilt of his head. He crossed his arms just at the center of his chest. 

"Well, I have an idea as how a rock breaks.  A constant strain on it will cause it to wither away. You can also use brute force to break a rock. Um, you can cut it if you're good enough.  You can do a bunch of things," he spoke out as he continued to observe the rock wall.* - Fri Dec 11 01:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) continued to observe the rock. While Paine was speaking, he glanced over at her direction, observing her every words. "Hm..If not brute force, then what if you apply force at a weak spot? Similar to how workers use dynamite. They make an incision into the rock or structure, then pack it up with the explosives.  Then you've got all the force generating from the inside instead of dealing with the outer layer. So in a rocks case, aim for a crack that's already there. If there isn't one, then I guess you'd just have to make one. Right?", he answered.* - Fri Dec 11 02:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Let's do it in a few days. - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) chuckled. He never said anything about magic or ninjutsu. He was only thinking of force.  He wasn't a shinobi like the others, rather he was just a simple merchant who wished to better themselves to combat bandits.  Having a means of defense was what he wanted.

However, bringing him back to the current situation, Tetsu was rather confused.  If striking at a weak point wasn't the answer, then what was the answer? He only knew of brute force, and if that didn't work, then you'd use more force. If that too didn't work, then you'd have to use whatever was in your arsenal. He lived that type of life. 

He continued to stare at the rock, listening to Paine's words.  The more she spoke, the closer yet farther he felt he got to the answer.  He let out a sigh as he lowered his arms, placing his hands into his pockets.  "Hm..If making bigger cracks won't work, then what about attacking from the inside? Hit the sweet spot, a spot that takes in the most force with the least amount of effort?  For example, if I were to go up against another human, you'd aim for the diaphragm. So, I'd guess in this sense of the rock, you'd probably would have to strike at its equivilent of a diaphragm." 

Tetsu wasn't sure if his answer was right, but he was still thinking of various means to break the rock. He himself was fully capable of destroying a rock, it just required the proper tools and technique.  But to do so with little effort and with the body, that was something he wasn't confident in.* - Fri Dec 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi, Chikyu. - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) nodded at Paine's words. As per her instructions he took a step forwards.  His eyes locked onto the rock like a wolf to a sheep.  He was ready. The merchant took a deep breath as he reeled his left arm back, closing his fingers tightly into a steady fist.  With a single step forwards, he lobbed his fist out at the rock.

As his fist jetted forwards, he made sure to hold back his strength. Had he used his full strength, the rock would surely break, but that wasn't what he was told to do. He was directed to use as little force as possible, so that's what he did.

His target was the center of the rock. As he didn't know much about rocks, and where their sweet spots would be, he just estimated it to be at the center, just like a humans. However, upon feeling his fist collide into the mineral, he noticed that it wasn't the case. The amount of strength he applied behind his punch did nothing to the rock. There were no marks, scratches or even dents to it. It was as good as new from when it was formed by sediments and time.* - Fri Dec 11 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Hmmm, how to help. . .  - Fri Dec 11 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) took a step back as he glanced at the rock once more.  His first strike used too little energy, so he had to gauge just how much force to apply to this attack.  He took another breath,  raising his fists up. "Alright, this one should do," he thought to himself as he lunged forwards, throwing his fist into the rock.   This time he applied more force behind the attack, but attacked in the same location. 

He took a step back after his fist reeled back from the attack. His eyes looked at where he had just striked. At the center of the impact area, a small crack can be seen. The rock wasn't destroyed, but he cuold see he was going in the right direction. "Hm..Not good either," he muttered.* - Fri Dec 11 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That too. - Fri Dec 11 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) glared at the rock once more. It was starting to annoy him. He listened to Hiroshi's words and darted forwards. In a flash, he launched his fist at the rock once more, aiming at a different section.  Just like his previous attack, a crack formed from the point of impact. 

"Tch, who'd think destroying a rock would be this difficult?" thought the male. He was used to using more force, rather than precision, which hindered his training.

He took a few steps back to reevaluate the situation. "Feel for the weak point huh? It should be around here, right?" he thought as his eyes traced around the rock, searching for valid strike zones.* - Fri Dec 11 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) had to reevaluate his approach. All he was doing was charging forwards and attacking the rock, creating cracks after cracks.  He was either putting too much or too little force.   It was becoming difficult to gauge himself in terms of strength. "Hm..This should do," he thought to himself as he stepped forwards and launched another punch at the rock. 

Just like his previous attempts, this too resulted in another crack forming ont he rock.  This time, an imprint of his fist was left behind.* - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Your so close man. - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) groaned as he could see he wasn't getting anywhere.  He took a deep breath, calming himself down as to prevent his frustration from surfacing.  "Hm..."  Tetsu decided to begin from another approach. He'd approach the rock and throw a light jab into its side.   He then glanced at the point of impact and noticed that there were no signs of harm to the rock. "Again," he thought as he jumped back to prepare himself for another strike.* - Fri Dec 11 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) charged forwards once again at the rock. He threw another jab at the impact zone of the previous strike. His fist rattled the rock, causing a crack to form along the point of impact.  The crack traveled about two inches away from his fist. Tetsu reeled his fist back, glancing at his knuckles as they were covered in dirt and sediments. "This is nothing," he commented, preparing himself for another go.* - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Uhhh, come on man. - Fri Dec 11 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Break this thing. - Fri Dec 11 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) could see the previous strikes were nothing to the rock. "Ugh, this sucks," he muttered, cracking his knuckles. The merchant took a deep breath, allowing air to fill his lungs, then flow out from his nostrils.  He was set on destroying this rock, even if it took forever. 

Tetsu tightened his fist as he took a step forwards, pulling his fist back in preparation for the incoming strike. When he got close enough to the rock, he lashed the fist forwards, striking at the rock.

At first there were no response, but suddenly a crack began to form from the point of impact. Then multiple cracks began to form all around the rock, spreading along like a net.  Suddenly, the rock burst into pieces, causing fragments to fall down below and some to fly about.  

"I guess I got it," he muttered, looking back at his fist.  He then formed a smile along his face as he turned to Paine. "What now?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:01:04 2015
