<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked over towards the side of the fence and lowered his body onto the ground. He'd extend his arms out, stretching them in the process before plopping himself onto the dirt. His arms folded behind his head acting like a pillow, just before closing his eyes.  "Wake me up when she gets here," he called out as he drifted off to sleep.* - Sun Nov  8 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was sprawled on the ground asleep. He'd been sleeping at the exact spot for quite some time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) slowly opened his eyes as his conscious drifted out from his sleep like state. He raised his upper torso, positioning himself upright. His eyes swayed back and forth in a drozy haze. "Ugh, what time is it?", he mummbled, scratching his shaggy black hair. 

His eyes would soon set upon Asteroth, Ichiro, and finally "Sado". "Yo," he spoke out in a casual tone, still showing signs of his lethargy as he raised a hand to greet the group.* - Sun Nov 15 21:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked over at Asteroth. He paused for a moment, raising his hand to his chin as if he were sizing her up. "For an "ugly wretch", she's got a bod.  Wait..Didn't you say your wife was the "Queen" of this place? This is her right?", he commented, now crossing his legs indian style. * - Sun Nov 15 21:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) hoisted himself up to his feet as it was common manners.  His eyes followed the monarch as she approached him. A smile formed on his face as he grasped the woman's hand with his own for a shake.  "Pleasure to meet you."  Just as he did so, he chuckled at Sado's comment.

"She's wearing gloves." He commented before directing his attention back to Asteroth. "No reason. I just saw this place while walking around. That's about it."* - Sun Nov 15 22:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't know she'd have such a reaction to having a handshake.  But hey, what's done is done.  There was nothing else he could say besides, "My bad."  His shoulders raised as he let out a harmless shrug. "Well, here's the thing, I'm basically homeless right now.  My first home was destroyed, my second annihilated, and so here we are.   So, to answer your question, yep. I intend to say here for a while.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm surprised you didn't follow them. - Mon Nov 16 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: She left rather hastily... - Mon Nov 16 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And I'm a rather slow individual to be honest. - Mon Nov 16 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh..is that so.. - Mon Nov 16 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'm sure you're not slow in -every- way. - Mon Nov 16 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Of course not. - Mon Nov 16 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Mon Nov 16 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I hope your decision is positive. - Mon Nov 16 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) had been sitting on the side line, silent as everything was going down. He didn't have much to say, mostly because it wasn't his problem. After all, a fight is a fight and the strong always come up on top. His vision washed over Ichiro, then Sado and finally Shiro. "Mind if I tag along? If Queen Fickle-chan left, I doubt I'd have much to do here anyway."* - Mon Nov 16 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 16 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't mind. - Mon Nov 16 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We're just heading to the village. - Mon Nov 16 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I have to make my Pet-chan stronger. - Mon Nov 16 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Yaaaay.~ - Mon Nov 16 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's see.. - Mon Nov 16 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I suppose..we should head there soon. - Mon Nov 16 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Pet, how much longer must you rest? - Mon Nov 16 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, you say we're going to Kirigakure? - Mon Nov 16 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 16 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Is that a problem? - Mon Nov 16 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Nope.  - Mon Nov 16 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I actually feel a bit excited to see how the village is doing since Koeki died.  - Mon Nov 16 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I mean, yeah she ran it into the ground. Then shortly after, a new Mizukage took the title and that didn't solve anything. I heard it was Kirie. Honestly, I never saw her as Kage material.  - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, I'm kind of interested in how it's fairing after having two failures in a row. - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: True.. - Mon Nov 16 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: When I saw it..they didn't seem -that- bad.. - Mon Nov 16 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That bad as in? - Mon Nov 16 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I mean.. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They were attacked by a monster. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: A monster? - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mhm.. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What, another Zetsumo or something? - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Nope.. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: A giant slug. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: A giant slug? - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Didn't think slugs were dangerous. - Mon Nov 16 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Heh. - Mon Nov 16 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Meh. - Mon Nov 16 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Mon Nov 16 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We'll move out soon. - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 16 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I may have to go visit Suna.. - Mon Nov 16 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm..I might join you. Never been to Suna to be honest. - Mon Nov 16 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Sado-sama.~ - Mon Nov 16 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: We can go now. - Mon Nov 16 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sure. - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We're going now? - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, first to Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) raised his arms above his head as he began to follow the two. He stopped for a brief moment, turning his head over towards Ichiro. "You coming?",he questioned. * - Mon Nov 16 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He's waiting for Fickle-chan. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright then. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: See yah. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to follow the two over towards Kirigakure's boarders. His arms remained rested upon his head, as if he had no worries in the world. His expression seemed rather bored, but intreged with the idea of seeing his home village once again.

A smile formed on his face, lowering his arms as he turned his head towards Sado. "So, about this giant slug. What did it do? Did it breathe fire? Ate everything in its path? What?", he questioned.* - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It seemingly can melt anything. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It also sprays a nasty gas. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is quite beautiful.. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Seems pretty cool. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I want it. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh? - Mon Nov 16 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh it's gone. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Dead. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well whatever Gezo wants to do with it. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Damn..That sucks. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It would be cool to have it as a pet. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Heh. - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It would've killed you. - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That, or ignore you. - Mon Nov 16 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Who knows. - Mon Nov 16 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've seen the beast twice. - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Twice? - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Did you fight it? - Mon Nov 16 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: In a way.. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I did. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That doesn't matter. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I suppose so, since it's dead now. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You got it.~ - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a yawn as he walked along with  Nigen to the gate. "What a shitty boater," he muttered, glancing back at the man rowing himself back to the otherside of the sea.* - Mon Nov 16 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled, "You're a priest? Wow.. Well, whatever floats your boat," he commented.  * - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I have no idea.  I don't really follow religion.  - Mon Nov 16 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Mon Nov 16 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to stroll towards the gates with Nigen. "Next time we see the boater, we should give him a "tip", if you know what I mean," he commented, winking at the male.

He had failed to notice the battle, chucking it up to just a common spar. He recalled it being rather crazy in Kirigakure the last time he was around. His eyes looked around, quickly realizing the battle after a short period of being in the area.

"Oh...Sucks for them," he commented, continuing over with Sado.* - Mon Nov 16 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: This guy... - Mon Nov 16 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Is here to try and steal Nigen's cold stone heart from me..... - Mon Nov 16 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Slither-kun! - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do..we have to sign up, or something!? - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think so! - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just walk right in! - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: S-Slither-kun? - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right-O! - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Right-...O? - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: O like...... - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: A hole....? - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: So Nigen's been in sexual contact with the snake-man. - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: And has seen his 'snake'. - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: 'O' is the shape the mouth forms when it's opening for such an object.  - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Master Nigen is so naughty. - Mon Nov 16 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) paid no attention to the two fighting, rather it wasn't his business to bud in. Whatever happened between the two happened. He was fine as long as he wasn't dragged in. Following behind Sado's lead, Kida began his pace once again, now stuffing his hands into his pockets. 

"I wonder who is the Mizukage now?", he asked.* - Mon Nov 16 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't think anything of Shiro's nudge. He raised his hands and placed them on his head, continuing his nonchalant stroll into the village. "I guess so.  They die to quick. Well, except for the Old Man. He seems to be doing well," he added.* - Mon Nov 16 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Old Man? - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You mean the geezer in Sunagakure? - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'm sure he'll get his own personal tombstone. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He used to be here with me a while ago. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: As well as a name in a record book for longest alive. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So you're from Kirigakure? - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Probably. But he's pretty strong. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Was. - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's pretty strong, you say. - Mon Nov 16 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Maybe he'll provide amusement. - Mon Nov 16 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I left after Koeki took the title of Mizukage. She almost caused the entire village to get massacared. What an idiot. - Mon Nov 16 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, I left with Niza and some other people to Kumo.  Now Kumo is gone, I'm with you guys. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Koeki? - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Sounds like 'cocky'. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So who's Niza? - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She was. I honestly didn't see what was so special about her, besides that weird chakra thing she had. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm... - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Niza was an old man. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He was the Raikage.  - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Pretty fun. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He wasn't old. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Raikage and an old man? - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Psh..he might as well have been old. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He was like in his 20's. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yeah, he respected my ways as a priest. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I enjoyed his company, even if he was a monk. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yeah, he died. Heard he got kicked into a mountain by Kenshin.  - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yeah...the cool always die in the best ways.. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I wasn't in the village when it happened, so I didn't see it. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kenshin.. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Always hated that guy. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
