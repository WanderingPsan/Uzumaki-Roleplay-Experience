<br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: If my real enemies are anything like the mist-nin I've been sparring...I am getting stronger and stronger. This fight would have been over if I could use my deadly techniques. - Tue Sep 15 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) found himself restrained for the time being. His elbow was gripped by one of the clones, and he could hear the rattle of the others. With a smile on his face he quickly pulled his arm from the clone's grip using all of his strength. From his earlier experience with the clones, he was certain that he possessed more physical strength than the original.  He however was growing tired and drawing out his full strength was starting to become a challenge. 

"Damn," he muttered to himself as he turned his head and found a fist slam into his jaw. His head tilted upwards as he soon found himself kneeling upon the ground after his stance was attacked from behind.  "I guess this might be my loss," he thought to himself as he glanced around the clones who got closer. 

Unsure of what else to do, he decided to perform a last ditch effort to take a large mass of the clones out.  Using the last bit of energy he had to expend, he stood up on his legs and sent out a left hook towards the first clone his eyes laid upon.  Should the clone start to fall apart, he'd turn to another clone and begin a series of combos.    He'd lunge forwards with a flying knee at the chest of one clone, then use said clone as a spring board, he'd jump to another with a high elbow. 

Once he was back on the ground, he'd flip another clone onto their beck. By now he was completely exhausted, continuing on the fight with just the last bit of his reserves.  His body began to drag, dulling his responses.  He didn't want to give up, but it was time to. A single knee touched the ground as his body was completely soaked in sweat. "Looks like it's your win," he called out, throwing himself onto the cool dirt floor. * - Tue Sep 15 03:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't want to go to bed, and instead asked the clones to leave him there to rest so he could watch Hassan fight against Koji and Violet. He also wanted to listen to the sounds of the partially destroyed waterfall.* - Tue Sep 15 03:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced over at the sparring party. He raised a brow, unsure of what was going on. From what he was able to hear, he guessed that Hassan had somehow robbed her of vision. It was rather odd, yet his interest in the battle grew.* - Tue Sep 15 03:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're thinking that we should flee in the end? - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That sounds like a bad plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's a terrible plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'll explain why I believe the plan is bad. First off, we don't know of Edge's location, nor his forces strength or size.  Second, we are currently in war with Zetsumo's forces who is allied with Ame. They are positioned around the village, as far as I recall.  - Sun Sep 20 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, Edge is more powerful than you think, Flexus. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Suna is not that place. Our presence and activity there will alert Zetsumo, plus I think the adjustment from a place like Kirigakure to Sunagakure is the worst, especially with resources being sapped constantly. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The moment we send a large force out to locate and deal with Edge, they will spot and attack.  Then there's the problem of war fatalities. We are already pressed with our forces. We don't have enough strength to split between Zetsumo and Edge. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just know that in our curent situation, it's best to deal with what's before us first.  Also, what advantage would we gain from dealing with Edge? - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gain no advantage, Honestly, Edge is better left alone. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Edge only wished to Unite Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stood up from his seat and started to approach Niza. "Mind if I tag along? I don't see a reason for me to stay here when there's no will to survive in this village. There's no order, just constant bickering and ideas that will just cause us to crumble." He had a serious expression on his face, and after carefully thinking of his situation, he came to a solid conclusion.* - Sun Sep 20 16:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) wasn't paying attention to the situation behind him. He did however hear the drawing of a kunai. Out of curiosity, he turned his head and he soon found himself to be the victim of an attack.  The shinobi quickly raised his arms into a defensive position, but alas his body didn't move as fast as he wanted it.   The sharp sensation of a blade cutting into his flesh caused him to wince slightly.  Before he knew it, blood started to trickle down from the fresh wound. He instinctivly looked over at Erebus and raised his arms, readying for combat. 

"What the hell was that for!?", he shouted with a mix of anger and shock.* - Sun Sep 20 16:22:24 2015

"I don't know what your problem is, but if it's a fight, then I'll fight you," he spoke. His eyes burned with intensity.  

The shinobi then dashed forwards at Erebus. He'd throw a swift right jab towards the male's jaw, then followed up with a left kick towards the shin. * - Sun Sep 20 16:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) wasn't fast enough to evade the blades. He saw the blade come from the male's back and slash across his chest.  He was defenseless in regards. Even with his hardened muscles, the blade cut deeply into his chest. One after another, the scythe carved his body covering his figure in the crimson liquid known as blood.   He yelped in pain, trying to defend himself, but his opponent wasn't someone he could go up against on even grounds. 

It wasn't until he noticed the blood spraying from his body that this was a fight for his life.  The shinobi gritted his teeth as he jumped back from the last attack. His vision had started to double. "Shit..," he muttered, clenching his chest as the blood continued to spill.  "Who would of thought that this would be happening," he added, feeling the strength of his legs slowly leave.  At first, it didn't seem like much, but the scythes had actually caused more damage than he though. * - Sun Sep 20 16:48:00 2015

The skin stitched up on it's own, returning to it's original condition. All of the external wounds that he'd suffer was healed.  Even the blood that was pouring out moments ago ceased.  

He slowly leaned up from the ground, grasping his chest and feeling groggy. "Ugh.." he moaned, coughing out some blood that had gotten into his throat.   He looked down at his chest, seeing his blood soaked skin and clothes. "This feels disgusting," he thought to himself as he got back to his feet, glaring over at Erebus.  He then looked over at Koeki and bowed. "Thanks Koeki."  Kida then turned his gaze over towards Ushinawa, "Thanks as well. I owe the two of you my life. "* - Sun Sep 20 17:08:28 2015
