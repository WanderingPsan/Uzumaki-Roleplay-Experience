<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Then I'll show you something. - Wed Dec  2 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smirked at the female as he extended his arms out, stretching and moving them about. After limbering himself up, he faced forwards and brought his hands to his chest. Utilizing a single seal, his entire body became consumed with chakra. The inner workings of his chakra system began to surge with energy. Various receivers activated one by one, energizing his body in preparation for the technique to come.

"Pay attention," he announced.  Kida lowered his hands and stepped forwards. Instantly, he vanished from sight, leaving nothing but a trail of dust.  His frame had not vanish, in fact it was leaning up against the vending machine. In just that instant, Kida went from one location to another, all in one movement.

"See? Surprised aren't yah?", he called out. * - Wed Dec  2 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ninjutsu, that's how. - Wed Dec  2 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's a technique called shunshin. - Wed Dec  2 07:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's basically teleportation, but it's not. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You are a fucking idiot sometimes. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, it's a technique that seems like teleportation, but it's actually high speed movement. - Wed Dec  2 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: When it was taught to me, I was told in this way. 'Imagine getting a jumpstart of energy, and using that energy you move to a location that you visualize.' - Wed Dec  2 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Trust me, I had trouble learning this. I ran into a tree, bushes, a wall. A lot of stuff. - Wed Dec  2 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why didn't you say that at first then and get all pissed when I asked for it. - Wed Dec  2 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The technique uses the ram seal. Try it out. I'm sure you can learn it. - Wed Dec  2 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh right. I almost forgot. You're going to feel the inertia. - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You'll get used to it eventually. - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Erg... - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just watched from afar. His arms were weaved together, resting at his chest. He chuckled as his eyes followed Kariudo. "Ah, I remember those days.  At least she didn't hit a wall, or a tree, or almost drown," he muttered to himself, keeping watch of the female.* - Wed Dec  2 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked over towards Kariudo, kneeling beside her. "Aww, now your cuteness just came back," he stated with a sly grin.  His arms were positioned forwards, resting along his knees. "So, it seems like you've had enough for today huh? Well, you know it now. So, I'm sure you'll get better."  Just as he was about to stand back onto his two feet, he noticed what seemed like a closed eye. "Huh?", he thought, raising a brow. However, he ignored it and stood back onto his feet, lending the female an arm.

"Let's get back onto your feet."* - Wed Dec  2 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not going to bite, so you can relax. You should know this by now. - Wed Dec  2 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, I know. - Wed Dec  2 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) placed his hands onto his hips as he let out a grin. "One day, just one day. Just keep that adorableness up and you'll be golden," he spoke. He then let out a yawn, quickly covering his mouth. "I'm going to bed. I'm a bit tired. I guess this is good night.  I'll see you guys in the morning, or afternoon. Either or," he added, turning his body towards the apartment complex.* - Wed Dec  2 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Hi there. - Thu Dec  3 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned on his heels, directing his gaze towards the southern portion of the village. He remained silent for a moment, then broke said silence when he looked over towards Mizumi. "Is it just him and Kariudo, or is there another person around?", he asked.* - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Right, alone, follow me. - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) approached from the north with a leisure disposition. His left hand was resting in his pants pocket, while the right waved back and forth in the air.  A lazy grin formed upon his face as he approached Ichiro. "So, what's good? Anything new?"* - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That'd be useful. - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Nothing I can think of. Maybe Mizumi, since I'm sure he trained with Tethys, or Hassan, or one of the other Kiri shinobi back then. - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I should train too. I can't let you two leave me in the dust. - Thu Dec  3 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a grin as he began to crack his knuckles. His eyes glanced around the area, searching for a suitable target.  After a few seconds of scanning, he fixated his attention to a nearby tree. It was probably the best thing to test his fists on.

"I need to get stronger and faster," he muttered to himself, stepping forwards to the tree.* - Thu Dec  3 00:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) raised his fists to his chest, kneading his knuckles with each hand. After a few seconds, he lowered his arms and began to take a few deep, long breaths.  He'd inhale through his nostrils and exhale through his mouth.  He allowed himself to calm down, focusing on one thing and one thing only; the tree that stood before him. 

Kida spread his legs slightly, sweeping his left foot along the ground to bring it to his rear, while his right was positioned forwards. They were about a shoulders width apart, and both were pointing towards the tree. A sinister smirk formed on his face as he brought his fists up.  He took a basic fighters stance, both hands balled up into fists, his dominant being closer to his chest, while the left was etched out.  

His eyes continued to fixate on the tree before him. His fist tightened as he cocked back the left, and sent it hurling at the tree base. A loud noise echoed from the impact. Portions of the bark broke apart and split, revealing its wooden innards.  Kida quickly brought the left back and threw out the right, once again striking out at the tree.   Thwack! The tree cried with every punch. Splinters began to fly around, clinging onto his clothes and the surrounding area.

The male's fists reddened with each hit. Every single hit tore more and more flesh from his skin, revealing torn and crimson colored knuckles. He reeled his fists back, glancing at them for a moment. "Tch, child's play," he muttered, resuming his assault on the tree.

Kida started to get into the groove. He had his own beat and rhythm when he attacked, allowing him to focus more into his training.  Beads of sweat began to roll down his body, moistening his clothing. He was like an engine running on full power.  The savage soon began to bob and weave around the tree, using his midsection to position himself into better standings.  He wanted to use as little footwork as possible, opting to focus entirely on his upper strength. As a kicker, his legs were already dangerous, but he wasn't satisfied with just having legs as a weapon. He wanted his entire being to become a deadly weapon. Everything from his hair follicles down to his toe nails.  He was just that type of person.

His body soon began to show signs of slight fatigue. His breathing became heavier, but he maintained that through proper breathing techniques and maximizing his movements. For every movement he made, there was a reason. The slide of a foot to gain distance, the curling of a finger to create a fist; it was all for a systematic purpose.  

Kida kept his steady pace of punching into the tree. By now, he'd reveal a large portion of its bark. His punches became more and more deadly with each strike. He kept an eye out for soft spots, and soon became more accustomed to moving his upper muscles. * - Thu Dec  3 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to treat the tree as his personal punching bag. The tree had become worn down from his constant assault. A large hole had formed at its center from all of the constant punching.   

Blood began to trickle down Kida's fists, leaving remnants behind along the tree. His fists were cut up and bruised. They weren't seriously damaged, just damaged enough to cut open his skin.  The pain felt like nothing compared to the times where he'd received a full blown kick from Shiro.   His mind recalled the experience. It was akin to being hit by a truck.  From the instant that he received the blow, he understood pain. 

Playing the scenario back in his head, it began to anger yet motivate him in his endeavors to become stronger. His initial punching rhythm began to amplify at a relentless pace. The initial one two combo turned into a barrage of jabs and liver shots.  His fists moved akin to machine gun bullets as they pelted the base one after another.  He refused to let up, opting to allow his desire to become stronger fuel his body and mind.  

He halted his barrage for a moment, only due to the fact that he noticed Kariudo from the corner of his eye. He glanced at the female and raised a brow just before stuffing his bloodied fists into his jacket.* - Thu Dec  3 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to monitor Kariudo's training.  He could see she was going into the right direction, thus nodding his head.  He'd quickly throw himself onto the floor, suspending himself only with his arms. They were stretched forwards at a shoulders width, his legs were pressed together. 

"Keep it up. You got it," he spoke, continuing with his own training. He'd allow his arms to lower his body, then quickly lifting it up again. He'd continue doing the push-ups, all while frequently looking back at Kariudo.* - Thu Dec  3 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stayed to the ground, keeping up with his exercise.  His arms pumped back and forth, causing his body to rise and fall from the ground over and over. "You should be careful," he spoke, ignoring the female's crazied movement.  She was still inexperienced in using the technique, but he believed her to become proficient eventually, given she doesn't quit over the vertigo.

A smirk formed along his lips, as he looked up once again. "So, seen that Akira chick lately?"* - Thu Dec  3 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled to himself as he pushed himself back to his feet.  "That's funny. She does realize that I was going to abuse her right? Oh well.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stood up from his seated position, chuckling at Mizumi and Kariudo.  "You're making me want to pinch your cheeks and keep you to myself," he teased. He let out a happy grin as he approached the two. He'd crouch down below, carressing Kariudo's hair with his hand. "Tired huh?", he asked, now looking over towards Mizumi who was currently still ontop of the girl.* - Thu Dec  3 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled as he reeled his hand back. He then stood up and combed his fingers through his hair. "I think he's knocked out," he commented, looking his arm around Mizumi's frame, setting him to the side. "We should fix that thing of yours," he added, now placing his hands on his hips.* - Thu Dec  3 05:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) could see how flustered Kariudo became. It gave him a warm fuzzy feeling inside. His lips curled up into a wide grin. "This is why I want a little sister," he commented.   "You're too shy that you're adorable. It's perfect," he exclaimed.  

He then paused as he noticed Kariudo's forehead. The closed eye was revealed, and out in the open. Even though it was for a moment, he saw it again. At first he believed it was just his imagination, but now he was sure.  

He remained silent for a moment, frozen in time. His gaze was fixated on Kariudo as his facial expression became as blank as a white canvas.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ... - Thu Dec  3 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a loud yawn as he awoke from his daily nap. His eyes glanced straight ahead, staring into the blue sky. For a moment, everything seemed peaceful, which somewhat bugged him. He quickly hoisted himself up into a seated position, quickly shaking away the grass that clung to his hair and body.  It was time to continue with his training.  He helped himself up to his feet, further wiping down his clothing from the grass and dirt that was around him.

"Tch, I got to stop sleeping outside," he muttered. The male extended his arms out, stretching them as far as he could. Soon, his figure began to contort back left and right like a spring, whilst his arms motioned behind, prepping his body for his training. 

The last time he trained his fists, he struck against a tree and demolished it. This time however, he decided to take things up a notch. Instead of striking at a tree like a punching bag, he decided to strike out at something more durable.  This was solved by the finding the remnants of broken down armor. It was already battered, but it was surely stronger than wood.  From his gaze, he could see that it was some metal of some type.  

After tinkering around with the worn out armor, he had created a training post of some sort. He used the wood he acquired from the previous training to act as a standing post, then fitted a sand bag on top, with the armor equipped. It was the perfect punching bag. A grin arose on his face as he quickly got into a fighters stance.

His fists were balled up and positioned just above his chest. With the left stretched further out than the right, he quickly pivoted his body forwards to begin his training. Just like prior, he prioritized his upper mass, only relying on punching and moving his torso and up. Kida began with a quick one two combo, starting off with the left and ending with the right. The training dummy bounced back and forth with each hit, akin to a bobble head doll.

The added armor proved to be an added challenge, not only for improving his strength, but toughening his knuckles enough to produce calluses. His fists hurt like hell, but this was only the beginning. Instead of allowing the pain to control his actions, he pushed through it, striking out at the training post once more.  One after another, he'd throw his fist into its body. The ringing of his fist connecting with the armor echoed around the area. 

As he continued to strike out at the home made punching bag, he'd start to bob and weave his body. He'd side step to the left, then the right, all while aligning his punches properly to make the most out of his movements.  The more he punched the humanesque dummy, the more accustomed his own body became with such foreign actions. 

Suddenly, he recalled his latest sparring session with Ichiro.  It brought memories back, particularly the clinch. It was something he knew those who fought with their fists used, but he wasn't entirely familiar with it.  He closed his eyes, recalling Ichiro's movements down to a T. As his mind played back the memory, his body began to mimic the hold.  He began by stepping closer towards the dummy and reaching his left arm out, hooking his hand along its "neck". Swiftly, he pulled the dummy closer to his own body and fired out a kidney shot.  His fist echoed upon impact, rattling the very base of the punching bag.

Kida's lips curled into a smile as he reeled his right fist back and launched another kidney shot. He'd fire two more in rapid succession before releasing his clinch. However, that wasn't the end of his training. The fighter threw his left fist into the upper portion of the dummy, followed by a right, then a final left into the center body.  

Even though he was striking out at a practice dummy, he understood the flow behind his own movements.  It was now becoming clearer to see how well his techniques would transition into an actual foe. However, since he had no partner to test his limits on, he continued to use the dummy as necessary. 

 He took a few steps back, readjusting his distance to bring out the most from his strikes. His eyes glazed along the silhouette of the dummy. He quickly readjusted his stance, allowing for more focus on offense rather than balance. In a single motion, he found himself on top of the dummy, sending countless punches in its direction. One by one, he'd send blurred fists at the post. His knuckles bruised and his skin began to peel. His knuckles became bloodied, and started to paint the punching bag in the lukewarm crimson liquid.

Kida heeded no attention to his injuries and only focused on his own progression. He was driven by the need to obtain strength, and this was the only way he knew how. He was like an uncontrollable beast, throwing his fists back and forth against the frame of the dummy. He'd alternate between simple one two jab combos, to body barrages, to various clinch holds.  The feeling of slamming his fist into something had to be engraved into his mind. If he wanted to become the strongest, he'd have to go through hoops and flames to achieve it. 

The fighter kept with his assault, striking over and over. He'd switch up his footing once in a while, choosing to lean his body to the left, and then the right, followed by a swift hook. The practice dummy was now riddled with fist imprints and torn apart from his erratic movement. He treated it as anything else in his way, a punching bag.

Kida briefly took a rest, backing himself up from the training post to catch his breath. His entire body was soaked in sweat, glistening in the rays of the sun. He glanced down at his fists. They were a bloodied mess. His skin had peeled off and revealed the pink flesh that laid under the epidermis. Blood was spread all along his knuckles. Some of it had dried up while some seemed fresh.  His fists weren't hurting, but that was probably from the adrenaline rushing through his head. 

He reached into his bag and took out a few pieces of cloth, wrapping them around his fists to turn them into hand wraps. His fingers compressed against each other, testing out the tightness and functionality of the wraps. They weren't too tight, but they were tight enough to prevent his fists from further bleeding for the time being.  Once his resting period was over, he began his rampage once more.

He started off by bringing his fists up to his chest. His arm laid across his stomach, while the left reeled back.  As he did so, he'd twist his body to supplement the stored potential of the punch. After a brief moment, he stepped forwards throwing his left fist out all while putting his body weight behind the attack. It was a punch, but held more power due to the added forward movement.  The training dummy rattled quite a bit, almost enough to knock it off of its post.

That wasn't the end.  He jumped back before pushing forwards and throwing out another barrage of punches. He kept his fists tight towards his chest and his body to the ground.  Like a hungry wolf approaching its prey, Kida unleashed his fury onto the training dummy.  His first blow was a right punch towards the lower body, followed by a left which hit the midsection.  A few more punches were thrown into the mix, al climbing up along its body. Upon reaching the upper portion of the dummy, Kida launched a powerful hook in which he stepped into, followed by another from the right.

From the constant abuse and battery from Kida, the training dummy's wood post once again rattled. During the final hit, Kida placed enough strength behind the punch to uproot it from the ground, sending it towards a nearby tree.  His eyes glanced at the now downed post, breathing heavily.  A smirk materialized along his face as he lowered his arms.  He had grown fatigue from the constant punching, but he felt as though he obtained something.  "I think that's enough," he muttered, throwing himself onto the ground to rest some more.* - Fri Dec  4 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) casually walked into the academy courtyard. His eyes glazed around the area, feeling a sense of nostalgia. "Ah, it feels good to be back," he whispered to himself.   He had his arms tucked into his kimono as he arrived.

The male wore purple and black clothing. A black kimono with a purple overcoat.  He also sported a fox mask, covering the entirety of his face. A smile formed from behind his mask as he raised his hand, waving at those in the area. 

"Hello everyone," he spoke in a cheerful tone. * - Sun Dec  6 21:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned his attention to Kyubishu. His brows raising due to the weird form of communication. He squinted his eyes over to where he was etching into the ground, taking notice to the words being formed. "Ah, so he's speaking through writing," he commented in a surprise.

He then took a few steps forwards, kneeling next to Kyubishu. "Hi, I'm Daki Aragami. And you are?", he asked, extending a friendly hand.* - Sun Dec  6 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I see, he's recovered quite a bit.  - Sun Dec  6 21:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took a step back, now standing straight. He placed his hands on his sides,  glancing at the others. "Hm..Quite bunch huh?", he spoke out.* - Sun Dec  6 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Business? - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Business here. - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled then pointed over at the headband that was wrapped around his leg. "I'm a shinobi here," he spoke.* - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I like to be forward. - Sun Dec  6 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: May I ask, how am I odd? Is it because of the mask? - Sun Dec  6 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Three things. - Sun Dec  6 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The mask, the clothing and the fact I have never seen you before. - Sun Dec  6 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: If you're wonder why I have one, it's because I suffered severe burns on my face. I don't like to show people them. I'm self conscious about it. - Sun Dec  6 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: My clothing? What's so weird about my fashion sense? - Sun Dec  6 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And you realize how large a village we are? You won't meet everyone. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's very...masking. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Isn't that the purpose of clothes? To hide your nude self? - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And other things. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It matters not, I just have a hard time trusting those I cannot judge. - Sun Dec  6 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hopefully we can get over that. - Sun Dec  6 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I doubt it. - Sun Dec  6 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't even like my own squad members, don't take how I am personally. - Sun Dec  6 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't like people. - Sun Dec  6 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. You shouldn't be so sceptical of others. Especially your squad mates. They'll save your life one day. - Sun Dec  6 21:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Ryo's at it again. - Sun Dec  6 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why do you believe that? - Sun Dec  6 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because I do. - Sun Dec  6 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: We should have Lord Mizukage come over here to confirm if you're truely a shinobi. - Sun Dec  6 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's not that hard to kill one of our own, dispose of the body and then. - Sun Dec  6 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Take their headband. - Sun Dec  6 21:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That sounds like an over assumption. - Sun Dec  6 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why is everyone so hostile? - Sun Dec  6 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If he were here to kill us, I doubt we'd be talking right now. - Sun Dec  6 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh and we were attacked recently. - Sun Dec  6 21:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Scary? - Sun Dec  6 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Try having your eye and tongue taken out, for some sick reason. - Sun Dec  6 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: We are shinobi, we aren't supposed to be scared. - Sun Dec  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Woah! Is that why you have your headband covering your eye, and writing on the ground? - Sun Dec  6 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That's pretty sickening.Who would do such a thing? - Sun Dec  6 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Some dude name Ichiro and Kida. - Sun Dec  6 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ichiro and Kida? Never heard of them. - Sun Dec  6 21:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: This was suppose to be a group activity, but noo. They had to be asleep.  - Sun Dec  6 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I knew Kirie and Tethys. - Sun Dec  6 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Oh, Kirie. Shame she died, it really is. - Sun Dec  6 21:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's ok. It's what happens when you take the title of Mizukage. Many people come after your head. - Sun Dec  6 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Yeah, indeed. That's probably why we were attacked, I'm pretty sure Kana has plenty of enemies. - Sun Dec  6 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She's strong, so I don't think she'll be taken out so easily. - Sun Dec  6 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took notice to Ryo's movement. He tilted his head to the side with a confused expression. Of course, his expressions were hidden behind his mask. "Is he a squad mate?", he asked, referring to Geo Dude.* - Sun Dec  6 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: I wonder what'll happen if I attack him. - Sun Dec  6 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: I told him he was worthless because of how weak he is and that he was better off dead. Primarily because he refuses to work as a team and get stronger. - Sun Dec  6 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: He only trains by himself. - Sun Dec  6 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, you guys will eventually make up, hopefully.  - Sun Dec  6 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Squads are usually like that. - Sun Dec  6 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: A bit. But I wasn't too far off...If one doesn't get stronger in this world....Then worse things than death could very well occur. - Sun Dec  6 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Shut up Geo. - Sun Dec  6 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Until I can confirm that from Kana, I don't believe it. - Sun Dec  6 21:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a sigh. "Why is it that everyone is so hostile here? Nothing has changed," he spoke. He lowered his head, turning onto his heels. "If I'm not wanted, then I guess I'll leave then," he added, walking slowly towards the academy gates.* - Sun Dec  6 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just waited until whatever it was Anugo was about to do began.  When he used the genjutsu, he recalled the sensation.
