He let out a sigh, thinking to himself. "I wonder if she's trying to hit on me. Well, sadly for her, I'm already spoken for. Besides, it's not like I have any room to spare. I don't want my dick chopped off." He then leaned back, crossing his arms across his chest.  "Sounds fishy, but whatever.  What about your friend? He looks like he's enjoying the view," he added, nodding towards Thirteen.* - Sun Nov 29 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I thnk I'll have a little fun with these two. - Sun Nov 29 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) broke into a smile.  He'd rest himself further into the chair, now planting his legs up onto the counter.  "Let's play a game.  Nothing fancy, just a simple game of luck," he began.  He'd quickly remove his legs from the counter, now standing himself up from his seat.

The male placed his hands into his pockets, ruffling around as if he were looking for something. After a brief moment of silence, he pulled out a  couple of dice, four in total. "Well, there's three of us, so I'll just put one away," he added, removing the extra dice.

"The game is simple. A game of answers and questions.  Roll an even, you answer a question, roll an odd, you ask one.  Simple right?  If everyone rolls an even,  you share something about yourself; odd, you don't."* - Sun Nov 29 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Good thing I swiped these from Shiro last night. - Sun Nov 29 03:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Besides, one would probably attack, another would probably..Hm..What would she do? Eh. Well, let's just say I'm one of the calm ones. - Sun Nov 29 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Good good.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I do like calm. - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So Goldylocks, not joining? - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm not much of a fighter after all.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shrugged his shoulders, grabbing ahold of two of the three dice. "More fun for us," he retorted. With a simple hand motion, he tossed one die over at the strawberry-vanilla swirl.  "Punishments huh? Didn't think much of it.  Let's see..," he paused for a moment, twisting his face around, thinking for a solution. "Can't think of anything civilized. What do you suggest?", he asked.* - Sun Nov 29 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Wow, I've had blood and sex on my mind too much lately. - Sun Nov 29 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) started to laugh just moments after the words slipped from his mouth. "Kidding of course."* - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Sex? - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Silly me.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But let's not dwindle on what my horrible punishments were. What's your idea? - Sun Nov 29 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmmmmm.... the person who doesn't want to answer has to do something the other person wants them to do. But if you refuse to do the action then the game ends.~  - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Neither of us want the game to end. - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright then. - Sun Nov 29 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So it's easy to assume we will be reasonable, while still testy.~ - Sun Nov 29 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Let's begin. - Sun Nov 29 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) rolls his die along the counter top.* - Sun Nov 29 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...both odds? - Sun Nov 29 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh right.. - Sun Nov 29 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Who is your leader? - Sun Nov 29 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Damn, forgetting my own rules. - Sun Nov 29 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We have none. - Sun Nov 29 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't say Kiri.~ - Sun Nov 29 04:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Question two: What are your names? - Sun Nov 29 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Your group that kicked everyone out, do you plan to stay here and establish a leader? - Sun Nov 29 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess this is what happens when you make things up out of thin air. - Sun Nov 29 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And I'm not entirely sure. We're just using this as a base for now. Depending on how we like it here, maybe. - Sun Nov 29 04:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not him. - Sun Nov 29 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So you only get mine.~ - Sun Nov 29 04:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If your group was offered incentive to stay in this village and run it to bring it to fruition, under one of your people's leadership and rule with someone as an 'investor' or silent partner to be allies in the future would you agee? - Sun Nov 29 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm...Me personally, I suppose I'd agree. After all, you can't rule a village with only a handful of people. You need money and trade.  So I'd say yes. - Sun Nov 29 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Another roll? - Sun Nov 29 04:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm sure most would I suppose. - Sun Nov 29 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I can't really say for sure. - Sun Nov 29 04:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why are you so interested in the village and our group? - Sun Nov 29 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *legal owner - Sun Nov 29 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Legal owner? - Sun Nov 29 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Since? - Sun Nov 29 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The one's you ran off only thought they owned it. - Sun Nov 29 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It was passed down to me through inherentance from the previous owner. - Sun Nov 29 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Fickle-Chan? - Sun Nov 29 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Or should I say, 'Queen' Fickle-Chan. - Sun Nov 29 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: She was the one 'placed' but believed she wasn't. - Sun Nov 29 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Huh? - Sun Nov 29 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: She was... - Sun Nov 29 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: An unknowing surrogate. - Sun Nov 29 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: She ran the village because she was manipulated into the position. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: To keep the village prospering. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But she abandoned it. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: More like she got kicked in the head, then fled out of embarassment. - Sun Nov 29 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: She had nice tits. - Sun Nov 29 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. So, how did you come across being the "legal" owner of the village? - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Besides, I never heard of such a term for villages. I thought if you took the leader out, or if there were no leaders, it's free reign. - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are cheating.~ - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I was nice and answered a few extra questions. - Sun Nov 29 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, my bad. - Sun Nov 29 05:10:11 2015
