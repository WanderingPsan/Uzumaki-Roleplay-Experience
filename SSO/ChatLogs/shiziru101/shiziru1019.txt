<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked over at Shiro.  He was somewhat skeptical about the female, but he wanted to see just how far he could push himself, and just how strong Shiro was. After all, to get to the top, you needed a lot of experience.

A grin formed on the males face as he took a few steps back, turning his body towards Shiro. "I'm down for one.  I can't gaurentee anything though," he spoke, shrugging his shoulders.  "I might or might not be a let down. Not too sure," he added. * - Mon Nov 16 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Never really did identify them, probably couldn't if I tried. - Mon Nov 16 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) quickly got himself into a combative stance. His body twisted slightly, with his left foot forwards and right behind. His fists were closed ready to attack. Just as Shiro lunged forwards, he did too.

A smirk formed across his lips as he kicked off the ground using the strength of his legs to dash forwards. He instictivly resorts to the usage of his legs, raising his right to strike out at the womans thigh.  However, just as he lifted his leg to go onto the offense, time seemed to have stopped for a moment.

His eyes were drawn onto the female's leg, rearing itself into his own body. "W-what? When did she?", he thought as he began to curl himself to brace for the attack. His own attack halted in favor of defense, lowering his right elbow to try and absorb the attack.  Just from her movements and form, could tell that the attack would hurt like hell. 

When the female's leg made contact with his mass, he could hear the cracking of his bones. She indeed carried strength in her legs.  He'd quickly pivot back, gripping his side as his arm shot up in pain. "Shit, didn't think that," he thought, checking a quick glance of his arm, which now showed signs of brusing.  He wiggled his fingers to assess if his arm was still usable, but every tendon and muslce that he moved caused an immense sensation of pain. "Nope, guess I'm at a disadvantage...Shit that hurts," he muttered, feeling the pain in his ribs as well.* - Mon Nov 16 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm... - Mon Nov 16 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well, do take care of Heiwa. - Mon Nov 16 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was at the mercy of the female's attack rush.  She moved far beyond his body allowed him, which caused a great problem.  Even if he was able to dish out damage, he wasn't fast enough.  It reminded him of the time he sparred with Maloth. However, this situation, his opponent beat him in speed.

He gritted his teeth as he flexed his stomach muscles, preparing for the next attack.  As his eyes followed Shiro, he hopped back to lessen the damage dealt.  The only thought that surfaced in his mind was to avoid the strike at all cost. Even if it were impossible, try to minimilze it.   

His eyes remained on the female even after she launched him into the air.  However, something felt off. The kick was too light. It stung for a moment, but the right side of his body still suffered pains from the initial strike.  

"Shit, I'm becoming a rag doll," he thought to himself as he crashed against the water, submerging himself into the lake.  He'd remain submerged for a few seconds before coming up to the surface.  "If this goes on, I'm going to have more than a few broken bones," he called out, waving his left hand in the air.

"It's your win," he groaned. * - Mon Nov 16 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thought it was the end, but nope.  God wasn't so merciful.  As his body was sent hurling to the water, he took notice to Shiro's form hovering above his own. 

That's when he realized that he fucked up.  Shiro's leg slammed into Kida's stomach, further pushing him down into the water.  His body sank like an anchor. 

Inside the water, his body slowly began to surface but he began to question the sense of pain.  Did he even recieve the injury, or was his ribs and arm hurting so much that his mind failed to register the new sensation.   He was in a daze for a moment. Not because of the pain, but because of how utterly useless his body was during the short spar. It was completely one sided, and it annoyed Kida.

Upon reaching the surface, he'd generate chakra all around his body to keep himself afloat. Once he got his entire body above the surface, he'd stand ontop of the water, holding onto his side and smiling over at Shiro.

"That was fun," he spoke shortly before chuckling to himself. * - Mon Nov 16 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Heh.~ - Mon Nov 16 07:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro, if you see the Mizukage when I'm not around. Tell him that you're with me, and you're looking for work. - Mon Nov 16 07:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) strolled into the academy with a casual expression on his face. He glanced at those around, instantly approaching Shiro and Ichiro. "Yo," he spoke out, waving his left arm in the air. * - Tue Nov 17 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) casually strolled into the academy courtyard. It was in much better shape than the last he had seen it. Then again, the last time he paid attention to the sake of the village was when he was actually a shinobi here. A smirk formed on his face as his eyes glazed about the area.

"Hm, I guess they left me behind. Shame," he commented. He'd then turn his gaze towards Nori, the medic who saved Heiwa. "Hey Heathen Child chick, you know where the guys I came here with went?"* - Wed Nov 18 00:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just watched as Liu raged at Kyubishu.  It brought back some plesant memories from when he lived in Kirigakure.  Tethys would set those astray back in place. It caused the male to chuckle. "Looks like Kiri finally has a Kage with backbone," he commented.* - Wed Nov 18 00:44:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida, Ichiro.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: There you assholes are. - Wed Nov 18 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I apologize Lady Shiro. - Wed Nov 18 01:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced over at the two. "I've been looking for you guys."* - Wed Nov 18 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see. - Wed Nov 18 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Uh huh.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Anywhoooooooo. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go do something fun. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida, Ichiro, how about you two spar or something. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And I can watch. - Wed Nov 18 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. Kida? - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: It'll probably be like the last. - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Then let us find an appropriate space to spar. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I doubt we should have to stray from the confinements of this complex however. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: There's the lake behind the academy. There's enough space there. - Wed Nov 18 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That should suffice, I suppose. - Wed Nov 18 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Com'on.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Let's go.~ - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Lake~. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Two men swimming together while rassling. - Wed Nov 18 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Out of respect. I shall allow you the first action. - Wed Nov 18 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) arrived at the lake, glancing over towards Ichiro and Shiro upon their arrival.  He took a deep breath, preparing himself mentally and physically as he took up a basic fighters stance. "Very well, I'll give it my all," he spoke. 

As the words flowed from his tongue, he dashed forwards towards Ichiro, clenching his fists. Without skipping a beat, he began to use the strength of his legs to launch himself into the air.

His body turned and rotated as if he were an acrobat, transitioning his body into a somersault.  Quickly, he'd slam his left leg downwards, hurling it down into Ichiro's frame.  From his previous experiences, underestimating his opponents cost him dearly. Thus, from the get go, he wasn't going to hold back.* - Wed Nov 18 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Oh, oh, oh! - Wed Nov 18 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: HE CAN USE KICKS TOO. - Wed Nov 18 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt the impact of his initial strike, but upon observation he realized that it didn't do much. Or at least it seemed.  He was taken back a bit, his face showing signs of amazement.  "Woah, you're sturdy," he called out quickly before realizing his foe had countered with his own.

"Nope, not today," he thought as he fliped back a few paces, drawing distance between the two. "That was close," he thought, now jumping from leg to leg.   "That was no rookie punch," he thought to himself in regards to Ichiro's counter.  It had weight and that showed signs of a fighter.

A grin formed on the males face, he loved battle and the challenge.  It was the greatest thing in the world.  Without a care in the world, he lunged forwards once again. This time he'd launch a low kick aimed towards the male's lower body.  

A good foundation always rested in one's legs.* - Wed Nov 18 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) could tell this was going to be fun. The fact that Ichiro took his kick straight on was something. There weren't many he went up against who were able to handle the ferocity of his kicks. 

As his leg was beginning to pull back, regaining his footing, his eyes shot up towards Ichiro's hand. The male had grabbed his head, all in seconds of Kida's recovery time. 

A grin surfaced on his face once more as he allowed Ichiro's momentum to guide his next move. Using the pushing motion from Ichiro's head grab, Kida pulled his body back, while releasing his footing, to deliver another swift kick.   This time, he'd resort to his opposite leg, aiming to strike in the male's side. Of course, there was less force in the kick as he had no ground to generate force from. Kit or miss, he'd allow his body to fall down in the afterworks, hopefully pulling Ichiro down as well. * - Wed Nov 18 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Cool... - Wed Nov 18 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) found himself now falling backwards into the ground after Ichiro released his head. "Damn, I'm in a tricky stance," he thought as his body weight worked with gravity to pull him into the ground.   However, everything seemed to move in slow motion as his eyes followed Ichiro's movements.

The man took an awkward stance, at least awkward to Kida at least.  Before he knew it, a crashing punch was sent to his own leg, which was positioned much higher than the rest of his body as it was in the process of assault. 

In just a few seconds, it quickly became a matter of who was more skilled in their field. Kida with his legs, or Ichiro with his fists.  Sadly, with the lowering of his own body to the ground, such an outcome was already decided.

Ichiro's fist slammed into his own shin, causing his body to wince in pain, but he was able to deal with it. Before he knew it, he found himself on slamming into the ground, quickly rolling himself over to gain some distance.   Not wanting to give Ichiro any openings, he quickly jumped back to his feet. * - Wed Nov 18 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was having some of the most fun he's had in a while.  Fights of the such caliber were the best.  It was almost as if he were on a high. He once again took a step back, preparing for his assault as his eyes continued to follow Ichiro.  He wasn't the fastest, but he was capable. 

Kida too lunged forwards, quickly throwing his legs into the air. His body rotated clockwise, gaining momentum, launching his left, followed by the right. The first few kicks were aimed to intercept and parry Ichiro's, but the kicks afterwards were aimed to deal some damage.* - Wed Nov 18 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) ended his barrage of kicks and pivioted forwards towards Ichiro. He was once again on the offense.  He'd pivot to the left, then right, aiming to trip up the male's awareness.

Upon closing the distance further, Kida launched himself another kick, this time aimed towards Ichiro's head. As his leg whiped out, he'd used the initial force to rotate his body, provinding more force behind the attack.   Just in the last seconds of connecting his leg upon Ichiro's head, he'd snap his right leg in a reverse motion, to strike at his foe's knee.  * - Wed Nov 18 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) braced himself as he realized too late of Ichiro's counter. He felt the male's fist slam into his body, sending waves of pain to travel his body. He lacked the sturdy body that Ichiro displayed, but he wasn't too far behind.

He received the combo, bringing his arms up to lessen the damage. It was the only choice for the time being. The instant he saw a chance, he'd dash back to escape from his goe's attack range. "This is more fun than I imagined," he called out, lowering his arms from his torso.* - Wed Nov 18 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was growing tired from their bout, however he failed to display it.  His fatigue was rising, given that his endurance levels weren't high to begin with. They were about average, but with his constant movement and extreme attacks, they were all building up.

By the time Ichiro rushed in to deliver the punch, Kida was already feeling the sluggish effects of his own fatigue.  He began to move and react in ways to save his energy. The male grinned as he welcomed Ichiro's punch. However, at the same time, he'd deliver his own strike, snapping a mid kick into the male's ribs. 

His plan was to give and receive all in one single move. Using the momentum of the punch, he hoped for maximum damage. Then again, Ichiro was rather the tanky fellow.* - Wed Nov 18 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt as though time stopped when the two exchanged blows.  What felt like an eternity only lasted a few seconds. Before he knew it, his perception of time returned to normal with the hurling punch from Ichiro.  Quickly, Kida leaned his head back, trying to keep out of Ichiro's reach and to minimilze the impact should he receive a hit.  

While doing so, he'd take a step back, in preparation for what was to come next. His torso ached from the initial strikes, and his own movements continued to slow down.   He raised a hand, aiming his palm towards Ichiro as if to call for a ceasefire. 

"Let's call this a tie. I'm sure we both are running out of steam," he spoke out in a rather casual tone. * - Wed Nov 18 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) grinned as he transitioned his outstretched hand into a shake. He'd grasp Ichiro's hand, lifting it up in down in a respectable manner. "That was pretty fun.  You're more tanky than you look. You remind me of Maloth."* - Wed Nov 18 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Maloth? You're the second person I've heard mention him. - Wed Nov 18 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Who was the first? - Wed Nov 18 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Some female. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I forget her name. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Mmmmm. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So you two are done? - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aah. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yep. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Indeed, Lady Shiro. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Well that was fun. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I didn't know I had two Taijutsu practitioners following me around. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It was. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It seems like the three of us make a nice team. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Possibly. - Wed Nov 18 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Well. - Wed Nov 18 04:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Probably a mixture of both.~ - Wed Nov 18 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: A wild card? - Wed Nov 18 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: In a way. - Wed Nov 18 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So, who won again? - Wed Nov 18 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Oh right, it was a tie. - Wed Nov 18 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 18 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov 18 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So who am I supposed to give a prize to now?~ - Wed Nov 18 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Also, don't take that the wrong way. - Wed Nov 18 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Allow Kida to take it. Working for you is enough for me. - Wed Nov 18 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: AWWWWW.~ - Wed Nov 18 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You're so cute Ichiro. - Wed Nov 18 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ...Thank you. - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Come here Kida! - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Um, alright. - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Seize your prize.~ - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Close your eyes. - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was a bit curious as to what was going to happen. He shrugged his shoulders and slowly closed his eyes, awaiting for the "prize". A few scenarios appeared in his head as he started to wait.* - Wed Nov 18 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt a soft sensation and thought nothing of it. Especially since Shiro mentioned a kiss. He honestly didn't expect it, but hey, a kiss is a kiss.  The inner Kida screamed in joy as if he had achieved victory. "This is a pretty good prize. Never figured this from Shiro. Heh," he thought as he puckered up allowing the tongue to enter his mouth. 

His tongue swirled around along with that of the detatched tongue as he started to get into it.  However, something dawned on him. The texture of the tongue felt off. It was cold, and had a bad aftertaste, like really bad. Almost as if it were moldy.  

He opened a single eye slightly to see what was going on, and behold! There he saw the truth. The shinobi immediately jumped back, with his eyes open in terror. He had a look of utter defeat.  His dream was crushed.

"What the hell!!?", he called out, spitting out the saliva and whatever remained in his mouth from the "kiss", onto the ground.  * - Wed Nov 18 05:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned his head away as he blushed a bit out of embarassment.  He'd fold his arms together, taking a few steps back. "Let's forget that ever happened, ok?"* - Wed Nov 18 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Awww, com'on. - Wed Nov 18 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was left speechless. He absolutely didn't expect those turn of events, but hey he couldn't complain.  A smooch is a smooch.  He let out a grin as his inner self danced and exploded in joy.   Of course, he'd blush a bit as he was still ripe in that sort of field.  

"Y-yeah, let's get food. I'm hungry too," he added, shortly walking ahead.* - Wed Nov 18 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not the greatest cook either. I just grill stuff until it's edible. - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Same!~ - Wed Nov 18 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) had almost lost his sense of ettiquete after being on the road for quite some time. However, upon returning to Kirigakure, some of the lost manners came back. When the plate was setted before him he gave a thumbs up to Ichiro out of respect for the man's skill.

"Time to eat," he said to himself as he clasped his hands together, grabbing ahold of the fork and knife that were set beside him. He'd stab the fork into the steak, hacking away with the knife, reducing the large slab of meat into minature portions.   He'd scoop the cut meat up with some bits of rice before inserting it into his mouth, allowing his jaws to chew and mash the food up.

He'd repeat the process over and over until his plate was completely clean. It had been a long time since he had such a delicious meal. All the while, he remained silent only applying attention into the food at hand.  When he finished his plate, he leaned back, patting on his stuffed stomach.

 "Props to the chef," he spoke with a casual grin.* - Wed Nov 18 05:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waves over at Kyubishu. A smile rose on his face. "Howdy."* - Fri Nov 20 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ... - Fri Nov 20 01:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Let's do this by the waterfall.  I don't want to hinder anyone around here. - Fri Nov 20 01:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ok. - Fri Nov 20 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) led Kyushibu towards the waterfalls.   As he walked over, he'd stretch and extend his limbs, limbering them for the sparring session to come.  Upon reaching the desired location, he'd bow at his foe.

"Please take care of me," he'd say in a nervous tone.  He'd look left then right rather nervously as if he were unsure of his own abilities.  "Shall we begin?", he questioned, throwing his arms up into a fighters stance while spreading his legs just slightly to reach his shoulder length.* - Fri Nov 20 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced up at Kyubishu like a predator scoping out their prey.  He'd stick his tongue out, licking his lips before dashing forwards.  His cheeks rose up as his lips curled upwards to revealed a smirk. 

The genin lifted his hands and began to weave a set of handseals together, forming them one after another in a systematic sequence. After doing so, he'd lower his arms and continue his pursuit forwards.

Without skipping a beat, Kuro pivoted to the left, evading the incoming shurikens. He'd pivot once more to the right upon seeing the shinobi excete a wire like substance from his hands.

"Interesting," he thought as he neared the snow haired youth.  Once he got with in reach, he'd snap his left leg forwards towards the foe's ribs. * - Fri Nov 20 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Fri Nov 20 02:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ICHIRO. - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: SADAO-SAMA IS RETURNING. - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: OH MY GOD. - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: AND HE REMEMBERS THE MISSIONS. - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: FUUUUUUCK! - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Help, help, help. - Fri Nov 20 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: What to do... - Fri Nov 20 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We could...just say we've done them... - Fri Nov 20 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to smirk as he quickly performed a backflip, contourting his spine to curl backwards, resulting in his lower half to spring backwards. While doing so, Kida snapped another leg out, kicking in an upward axe like motion just as the male went to grab for his leg.  He'd apply a greater amount of force, now that he was done sizing up his foe. 

His leg would rise up in a blur, slamming against his arm should he be fast enough.  As he did so, he'd plant his arms onto the ground, supporting his body for even more kicking power.* - Fri Nov 20 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ....Okay. - Fri Nov 20 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: He extended...bones...from his body. - Fri Nov 20 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) couldn't stop the movement of his leg slamming into Kyubishu's physique. He was met with a sudden solid force, almost like a wall, yet much more brittle than one.  A sudden warm sensation began to trickle down his leg and onto the ground as he quickly backed up from his foe. 

He'd readjust his fighting position, now standing upright and glancing down at his now cut up leg. "Ouch," he muttered, realizing that blood was spilled from his legs.

"That's an interesting technique you've got there. I wonder if I can break it," he chuckled, now cracking his knuckles.  "Alright, no more playing around," he'd retort as he now lunged forwards once more. 

Kida's lips curled once more into a sinister grin, one that a predator would have when hunting prey. He was currently in the thrill of the hunt. He'd pivot left and right as he approached Kyubishu before jumping up into the air and twirling his body around. While suspended, he'd contourt his body to perform a forwards somersault. During his descent, he'd extend raise his left leg high into the air and hurl it downwards towards the male's collar bone, bringing it down like an axe into a tree.  He'd use all of the downforce of his fall and his own leg strength to empower the kick, putting his full strength into the attack. He was just beginning.* - Fri Nov 20 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Kida.~ - Fri Nov 20 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You can start off. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) lazily approached the scene. His hair was discheveled and his appearance was unkempt.  It was as if he had just awoke from a long relaxing nap. The male let out a loud yawn, patting his fingers against his lips. 

"What's going on here?", he asked, now sratching his stomach as he stood in the center of the road to watch the two spar.* - Sat Nov 21 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Isn't that the kid who ran before? - Sat Nov 21 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I don't like him. - Sat Nov 21 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to watch, and suddenly he became bored. His eyes followed the two as they exchanged blow after blow in their "intense" sparring session.  His arms crossed as his body stood still, observing.

"Tch, you know what? That little brat pissed me off.  Time to finish what he ran from," he thought to himself as a sinister grin formed along the folds of his lips.  

Kida lowered his arms, leaning his upper torso back just before jetting it forwards as he entered a sprint.  His arms remained at his side as he leaped into the air.  Without speaking a single word, he'd jolt his left leg out at Kyubishu's torso, followed by another kick with his right leg. He'd continued to send a barrage of kicks using both the left and right leg, one after another, all using the rotating force of the aformentioned kick.  For a moment, it looked as though he levitated in the air.* - Sat Nov 21 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) kicked Kyubishu's chest.* - Sat Nov 21 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: L-Little brat pisses you off? You're such a pussy that you couldn't do it all by yourself. - Sat Nov 21 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Once I recover, you better watch your back Kida. - Sat Nov 21 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Or do as you wish. - Sat Nov 21 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I know his comments will spark something. - Sat Nov 21 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced over at Ichiro then over at Kyubishu. A devilish smile formed across his face. "Oh, don't worry.  I don't plan to do anything really.  I just wanted to get him back for running," he'd say.   He'd then stuff his hands into his pockets as he towered over the injured Kyubishu. 

"But this was a spar. No need to be so angry. I just finished what needed to be finished," he'd retort. His smile widened even further.* - Sat Nov 21 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Hehe. Our generation is full of pussies who can't even take people on by themselves. - Sat Nov 21 04:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, I can take you on by myself.  To be frank, you wouldn't be in this situation if you didn't run away in the first place. - Sat Nov 21 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You're acting like I 'ran' away from a real fight. I was also called away, asshole. - Sat Nov 21 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to smile, now raising his leg and pressing it against Kyubishu's. He'd apply a suitable amount of force, enough to set the shinobi off his high chair. "Does this hurt?", he'd ask in a playful manner.* - Sat Nov 21 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Say Ichiro, you think Shiro might need some new props? - Sat Nov 21 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Keep our little lady Shiro company. She's the apple of our eyes. In fact, she's pretty timid and sick.  You seem like the right person to cheer her up. - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Right Ichiro? - Sat Nov 21 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: This was all a test to see if you're good enough. You barely passed, but you passed. - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I hope... - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You can deal with this feeling every day. - Sat Nov 21 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It'll also serve to be great training for you.  After a day with her, Ichiro here became a tank.  She has some magical powers I tell you.  - Sat Nov 21 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: If she's sick. How is she busy causing people pain? - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's because she's sick.  It hurts our hearts to see her in such a state.  I cry every night seeing her. - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She's really a sweet girl. - Sat Nov 21 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what do you say? Want to join us? - Sat Nov 21 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) lifted a hand from his pocket and extended it outwards towards Kyubishu. "We aren't really bad guys. Trust me," he'd say with a friendly smile on his face.* - Sat Nov 21 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Sat Nov 21 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) gripped his hand with Kyubishu's as he pulled the downed shinobi closer to himself. A wicked smile cracked along his lips. In just one fell swoop, he pulled out a kunai from his pocket with his opposite hand and lunged it forwards towards the male's eye. He wasn't aiming to kill the man, just injure him...a lot.  "Stupid!!", he'd call out in a crazied tone. * - Sat Nov 21 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Incredible. - Sat Nov 21 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'd have thought...You percieved the malice... - Sat Nov 21 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to push the kunai deeper into the male's eye socket.  "Sorry idiot, but you really pissed me off with that earlier statement.  It really hurts me to do this, but we can't let you ruin our fun.  You know the saying, 'Snitches get stiches'.   So of course, you're going to have to get a lot of stitches after we're done with you," he spoke in an almost merciful tone.  

Kida quickly pulled the kunai out from the male's eye and jammed two of his fingers into Kyubishu's mouth, searching for his tongue. The moist interior of the male's mouth didn't bother him much as he continued to wiggle his fingers inside  to grip onto the shinobi's tongue.  Upon gripping it, he'd pull it out and turn his head towards Ichiro.

"Want the pleasure?"* - Sat Nov 21 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) had actually forgot all about Baen and his usage of bones.  He was already too close of a proximity to Kyubishu to efficently dodged, so he just rode the wave.  The few bones that shot out fro Kyubishu's form indeed penetrated into his skin, but they didn't penetrate deep. In fact, they were more or less flesh wounds akin to something you'd get from playing at the playground. 

He chuckled as a malicious aura loomed over Kida's silhouette. "I was really going to let you live, but after all of this,  you still have spunk. Looks like I'm going to have to train you a bit," he said in a sadistic tone. 

Kida released his initial grip from Kyubishu's hand and grabbed ahold of the kunai which he partially had a grip on.  Using his hand which was currently latched onto the male's tongue, he'd pull it out and glide the blade of the kunai in his opposite hand along its flesh. He'd dig deep inside, penetrating the flesh, allowing the tip to pierce upon both ends.   Usually, he wasn't a sadistic person, but today he felt like fitting said role.  In fact, it was actually fun. 

He continued to grin as he motioned the blade through the male's skin, tearing his flesh slowly until his tongue was completely removed. Once removed, he'd take a step back to see the handywork of the two.* - Sat Nov 21 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) now had a fresh, bloodied tongue in his hand.  His eyes looked upon the tongue, then Kyubishu.  He leaned forwards and grinned, "What's wrong? Got something to say?" he'd begin just moments before inching closer towards the mutilated youth. He'd lower his ear to Kyubishu while placing a hand over it to magnify his hearing, as people usually do when hard of hearing. "Huh? Said something?  You'll have to speak up for me to hear you, you know?   What? Cat got your tongue or something?", he'd speak, flapping the detatched tongue in his hand like a toy.

He'd chuckle at his own joke, returning to his original stance.* - Sat Nov 21 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Before Baen died. - Sat Nov 21 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: He was given a spear. - Sat Nov 21 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You mean Tetsujin's spear? - Sat Nov 21 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A spear that belonged to a man named Tetsujin. - Sat Nov 21 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Wait, where is it if he died? I kind of want it. - Sat Nov 21 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Unknown, although, I too, want it. - Sat Nov 21 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But that isn't the point. - Sat Nov 21 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The point is. - Sat Nov 21 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This spear was given to Baen to set their duel in stone. - Sat Nov 21 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This one in your chest. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I remember that.  I heard Baen won. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: My spear. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A spear of gold. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Quite durable. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: When you're ready. - Sat Nov 21 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: When you feel like acting upon your malice. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Find me. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Use it against me. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Kill me. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: What type of sick people are they? - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And possibly. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Just possibly, you'll make it somewhere in this world. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Otherwise, you'll stay here like trash. - Sat Nov 21 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stuffed the tongue into his pocket and began to clap at Ichiro's words. It brought him fond memories of when Tetsujin was challenged by Baen. "Ah, I remember that day.  Good memory too.  Well, hopefully he survives this. I mean if he's like Baen, he can make more bones," * - Sat Nov 21 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The deed is done. - Sat Nov 21 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The hate is fuming. - Sat Nov 21 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I want to see how he grows. - Sat Nov 21 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I wonder if he'll be able to kill us in the future. - Sat Nov 21 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: From now on, we must be more lowkey. - Sat Nov 21 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And some advice. - Sat Nov 21 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Avoid using names. - Sat Nov 21 05:27:15 2015
