<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Come. - Sat Nov 21 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I thought you might ask for something physical. - Sat Nov 21 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And I think I was spot-on. - Sat Nov 21 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well this is physical in a way. - Sat Nov 21 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'm aware. - Sat Nov 21 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Com'on. - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So basically. - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ---Ahem! - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ? - Sat Nov 21 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: So. - Sat Nov 21 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Bend your knees. - Sat Nov 21 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Squat really close to the ground. - Sat Nov 21 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) says: ... - Sat Nov 21 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) nodded as he began to follow Shiro's instructions. He'd limber his arms and legs shortly before emulating her words.  His body stood straight for a moment before he spread his legs out into a shoulder width's length. Slowly, the shinobi lowered his center of gravity by folding his knees.  He was sure to retain his balance as his form compressed itself to reach as close to the ground as he could possibly get without hindering himself. 

"Alright, now what?", he'd ask, directing his gaze towards the female.* - Sat Nov 21 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Leap forward. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Up into the air. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And then move towards your opponent. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Bend your knees in mid-air. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And then kick out when you arrive at your destination, before you move any forward. - Sat Nov 21 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Make an imaginary foe. - Sat Nov 21 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, I'm kicking my foe into the ground from the air? - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Basically. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Ground Zero. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Get it? - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I kicked you into the water because there was no ground. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: If there was ground there. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I think your head would've been fractured quite a bit. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: Who's that new guy? - Sat Nov 21 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) kept his body low as he listened to Shiro's words. They all made sense. The whole principle connected in his mind. He'd smirk as he'd gained a rather basic understanding of the technique. 

Using the muscles in his legs, and his compressed form, he'd propel himself up into the air like a spring. His body soared high into the air as he began to imagine an imaginary foe.  By now, doing such a thing became as simple as blinking one's eyes. "Here we go," he'd shout as he'd twist and contourt his body in the sky as he positioned himself closer to the foe.  

Following behind Shiro's explaination, he'd collapse his legs as he made his approach. Once he was positioned over the opponent, he'd thrust his legs with all of his force into the silhouette of the opponent,  sending it crashing down into the ground.

He'd make a descent into the ground, landing without any problems. He'd turn around and glance over at Shiro, "Was that it?", he asked, placing a hand onto his side.* - Sat Nov 21 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: ....... - Sat Nov 21 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You aren't the same in the bedroom hopefully. - Sat Nov 21 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: Oh...They're together. - Sat Nov 21 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ..... - Sat Nov 21 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aren't you suppose to be the innocent one? - Sat Nov 21 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just so happened to turn his head, catching a glimpse of Way. "Oh, look, someone new," he'd say. A smile would form upon Kida's face as waved over towards the male. 

"Yo, don't be shy. We won't bite."* - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But I do. - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'm -trying- to be the innocent one.~ - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled at Shiro's response. He'd then shift his attention over towards Edge. "Really now? See, you're just going to scare that guy off. You have to draw their attention by being nice first, then break them down...Well, I wasn't going to break him down, but you know, figure of speech," he'd say in a rather casual tone.

He'd smile over at Edge. "So, got a name?"* - Sat Nov 21 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) crossed his arms as he placed his left upon his chin. He'd glance up as if he were trying to remember something. "Edge....Edge...Edge...Oh! I remember. You're the guy who destroyed Kumogakure! Aannd...I heard something else..Let's see..What was it?", he spoke, trying his hardest to recall everything he's heard about Edge.

It wasn't the first time he has heard the name, but it was a name that was brought up very few times to Kida. In fact, it was a name he knew, but he couldn't link it with much.* - Sat Nov 21 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what brings you here to this dump of a village? - Sat Nov 21 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: What brings me here to Kirigakure? - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Nothing in particular, really. - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I simply wanted to.... - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Test the waters. - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I haven't been out in a while. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I've only been testing my jutsu. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'd like to get some fresh test subjects. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: Test....subjects? - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, there's the Mizukage. He seems like a good test subject if you want a punching bag. Oh, there was another genin we just beat up a while ago. Not sure how useful he is since he's missing his tongue and eye now. - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, there's a bunch of kids here. - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: They make great dummies. - Sat Nov 21 07:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Let's see..Oh, there's a bunch in Sunagakure too. I wonder how strict the security is there though.. - Sat Nov 21 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Shiro, you said Sado was coming back right?  - Sat Nov 21 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm sure our boss can help you if you're patient. He's pretty interesting. - Sat Nov 21 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: Boss.... - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Or, you can take that kid over there. We don't know him. - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: . . . - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm sure he has no quams about being a test subject. - Sat Nov 21 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He'll probably learn a thing or two with you. - Sat Nov 21 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: ....Mmmmm. - Sat Nov 21 07:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: By the way, by testing what do you mean? Are you a medic like Koeki was or something? - Sat Nov 21 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm no medic. - Sat Nov 21 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm far from it. - Sat Nov 21 07:38:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You have a woman hiding behind your back; I'd assume so. - Sat Nov 21 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Relationship? Oh her? Hm..I doubt it. - Sat Nov 21 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She's heads over heels for Sado. The three of us just work together. - Sat Nov 21 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) says:                    - Sat Nov 21 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: Right.... - Sat Nov 21 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: What, ten seconds away from breaking your arm? - Sat Nov 21 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Save your tongue the trouble of speaking. - Sat Nov 21 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: It's mundane and useless. - Sat Nov 21 07:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hell, it all started after Tethys died and Koeki took over.  I wish whoever killed her did so earlier, otherwise the village might have made it. Oh well. Not like I care much about this village anymore. I don't live here. - Sat Nov 21 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: .. - Sat Nov 21 07:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) would raise his head above his head and walk back to their house. It wasn't far off, in fact, it was just a few paces ahead. He'd enter the house and toss himself onto the couch, quickly falling asleep.* - Sat Nov 21 08:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just strolled into the courtyard. "Yo," he'd call out in a casual tone. He'd wave at everyone around, then positioned himself near Ichiro.

"So, what's going on over here, Engi?", he'd ask, glancing over towards the group.* - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It was a test, or at lest I believe so. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aaah. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Daki's the name. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I like long walks on the beach, and beautiful women. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hired out to you? - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I was not informed of this. - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . ..  I wanted to stay there longer. . - Mon Nov 23 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckles to himself as he let out a smirk. He'd stuff his hands into his pockets, glancing over at the group.  He'd then glance over at Ichiro, then back at the Mizukage. "Yah, I don't recall that either. Oh well," he'd retort, shrugging his shoulders.* - Mon Nov 23 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was utterly confused as to what was going on. He just stood there with his hands in his pockets. Almost as if he wasn't bothered by what was going on.  He shrugged his shoulders and soon found himself encased by the jutsu.  The next thing he knew, he was in the training fields of Sunagakure. 

"Oh well," he muttered. * - Mon Nov 23 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hi, Mirai. What were ya up to? - Mon Nov 23 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Was talking to Koji. - Mon Nov 23 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just stood still with his hands in his pockets as the Maneki Neko transported him into the center of the Sunagakure training field.  He could instincitvely feel the difference in cilmate when the creature fanished.  

"Well, that was a ride.  I wonder what that was for," he'd ask, looking over at Ichiro.   "Oh, and what about, you know?", he'd ask. * - Mon Nov 23 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: Should we use the codenames here too? - Mon Nov 23 04:15:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yep, I'm good..Oh wait, you're talking about that chick?  She seems alright. Don't worry too much about it. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Oh it's you again kid. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I wonder what our little masochist kitty is doing.  - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Damn. . So we gonna. .  - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pretend like they didn't just pop out of nowhere? - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nah. - Mon Nov 23 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Our arrival here was...forced. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They should be escorted to prison. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I apologize for intruding. - Mon Nov 23 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked over at Hassan. His eyes squinted, recalling the old man.  His eyes then lit up, "Ah,  it's old man Hassan! What's up?", he called out, waving at the old timer.   

His head cocked to the side after hearing about prison. "Prison? Why? What's up?", he asked.* - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Where are the police when you need them? - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I got it covered. - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Police? We do something wrong? - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ithink it's precaution. - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You guys did kinda pop out of nowhere. - Mon Nov 23 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why are they being arrested? - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. Makes sense. You can blame the Mizukage for that. He kind of just randomly sent us here after saying some crazy things.  - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've intruded upon your village, ignoring your policies---despite it not being my choice. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'll go willingly. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I think he's off his rocker. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Oh. Well, I'll give you guys a cozy cell or whatever. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Just question them. - Mon Nov 23 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If they are harmless send them off. - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I'm not here by choice, nor am I going to get the Old Man angry. I've seen what he's done with Kenshin to Zetsumo.  He's scary. Heh. - Mon Nov 23 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai. Do you want to come with? - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) removed his hands from his pockets as he took a few steps forwards towards Sanoke.  He'd shrug his shoulders, waving his hands slightly as he began to follow the shinobi. "Just our day huh?", he asked, shifting his head towards Ichiro.* - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I suppose. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Walk ahead of me! And hands where I can see 'em. - Mon Nov 23 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: You think this might have to do with that one kid? - Mon Nov 23 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) whispers: A whisper is futile, they can hear us from such a distance. - Mon Nov 23 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: You think this is a game?! - Mon Nov 23 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) sat in a chair rather casually.  He'd lean against it, hands above his head, with his feet on the table. "I have no idea to be honest. I never met the Mizukage before. Hell, I can't think of any reason as to why I was sent to Sunagakure.  Maybe it might have to do with that Edge guy I ran into.  He did destroy Kumo, then again, I doubt the Mizukage knows about that."  He paused for a moment, as he readjusted his seating position in to a proper one.  He'd lean up against the table, and continue.

"Well, let's see..Ah! I think I might know! It's probably because I left the village when Koeki became Mizukage, right after Tethys died and the Old Man and Kenshin killed Zetsumo.  That has to be the reason.  He's probably mad that I showed up- Wait..That doesn't make sense either..Well, I'll fall back to my first response. No idea."  He'd shrug his shoulders, he honestly couldn't think of anything at the moment.* - Mon Nov 23 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai! Do you have any questions to ask, or anyway to interject? - Mon Nov 23 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Mon Nov 23 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't feel like putting up a struggle, let alone try to complicate the situation.  He remained seated and let the man do his job.   When the question came up about hostile actions, Kida responded.

"Nope. I didn't do anything hostile towards the village."* - Mon Nov 23 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Good. Lastly, you didn't harm anyone or anything within like. .  the last two weeks that could have irked the Mizukage enough to send you teleporting to a different location? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: H-.hey..? - Mon Nov 23 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We're sort of busy. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right.. - Mon Nov 23 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was still under the effects of the genjutsu. He paused for a moment, placing his finger upon his chin as he thought long and hard for an answer. He'd then open his mouth giving his answer. "I had a couple sparring matches here and there."* - Mon Nov 23 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've no idea. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . Well your friend checks out for the most part. i'm going to check on you with a single question. If you check out, I'll have you guys wait in a cell as I report. - Mon Nov 23 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: mmm... - Mon Nov 23 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wait for the Mizukage to answer. - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Actually just let them go. - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That seems like the proper course of action.  - Mon Nov 23 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what now? - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I would very much like to return to Kirigakure for Shiro. - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But that is a horrible course. - Mon Nov 23 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sunagakure's policy bars us from remaining. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We can always ask the old man. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You can. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I won't remain. - Mon Nov 23 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're going to head on out to Kiri then? - Mon Nov 23 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Mon Nov 23 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Although. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ? - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: When the course of things change. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: And I do return to Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I will send word to you. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well I don't want to be in Suna by myself. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So I guess we're sticking together a bit longer. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That is fine. - Mon Nov 23 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: The first destination. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Kumo? It's a wasteland now. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Good. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: At least last I heard. - Mon Nov 23 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's still the designated location however. - Mon Nov 23 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a sigh. "Well, let's get going," he spoke out, placing his hands atop his head. He'd start to trail along behind Ichiro, taking the entire situation as if it were a game of some sorts.  "So, why Kumogakure of all places?", he asked, increasing his pace to line up side by side with the male.* - Mon Nov 23 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It holds no substantial weight of importance. It's a place where individuals such as us can grow without some sort of interjecting power getting in the way. - Mon Nov 23 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Or at least, it should be. - Mon Nov 23 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I suppose that's true. - Mon Nov 23 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Looks the same as I left it. - Mon Nov 23 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This is good. - Mon Nov 23 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This is a land with no value to any of the other villages. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: They will not relocate themselves here. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That's true. - Mon Nov 23 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glances over at the Kuwabara looking loser. A grin forms on his face as he skated along, stopping infront of him. "Howdy," he'd begin,pausing for a moment to await a response. * - Mon Nov 23 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Enjoy your social interaction. I'll be looking around for a bit. - Mon Nov 23 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stares at the man, pressing his face closer by the second. "....." Nothing. Kida let out a mental sigh as he raised his hand, closing all by his index finger. He'd then press it up against the male's cheek, rubbing it in a circular motion.

"Hellooooo~. Anyone there?", he'd taunt.* - Mon Nov 23 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ....... - Mon Nov 23 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a sigh as he took a step back, stuffing his hands into his pockets. "You're just like a statue," he'd comment. Shortly after, he'd turn around and catch a glimps of Eiyu.  

A friendly smile formed on his face as he waved at the male. "Yo."* - Mon Nov 23 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Just a passerby. Why the long face? - Mon Nov 23 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Just feeling a little fatigued, and why do you mean? - Mon Nov 23 06:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: No where anymore. Got no home. - Mon Nov 23 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Where were you born? - Mon Nov 23 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I did, but you know. Stuff happens when you have an inept kage. - Mon Nov 23 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why the questions? You're not falling for me are you? - Mon Nov 23 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) would lean forwards as he continued to smile.  He'd laugh then rear his head back, straightening his pose.* - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The inept Kage. - Mon Nov 23 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The Yondaime, correct? - Mon Nov 23 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, she's no longer an issue. - Mon Nov 23 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yah. All she was good for was opening her legs.  - Mon Nov 23 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And bending over. - Mon Nov 23 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Tch. - Mon Nov 23 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Repulsive. - Mon Nov 23 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Do you have your Kumogakure ID card? - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I bet she'd be a sweet one. Oh well. Not like I care. - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ID card? - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Just.. It's a form of identification... - Mon Nov 23 06:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a smirk as he brought his hands out before him. He'd quickly weave a set of handseals, building up chakra into the pit of his stomach. He'd then expel the converted chakra out through his mouth, releasing a thick fog of white. The fog would expand rather quickly, covering the area.

"This just isn't my day," he thought to himself as he began to charge forwards.* - Mon Nov 23 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't expect such a reaction, but it mattered not. With a single handseal executed just moments after releasing the fog, his entire body became energized with chakra.  He'd take a single step before vanishing into thin air.  

The guards would most likely be left in confusion after being hit by stray techniques. Kida of course would appear outside of the ring, waving off at Eiyu as he dashed away. * - Mon Nov 23 06:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shifted his body towards Ichiro. Since his appearance had changed quite a bit, it was difficult to tell from first glance.  His eyes squinted for a bit, but he gave up.  He'd wave at the male, "Yo..We've met before or something?", he asked, getting a familar vibe from the man. He just couldn't shake it off.* - Wed Nov 25 04:01:55 2015
