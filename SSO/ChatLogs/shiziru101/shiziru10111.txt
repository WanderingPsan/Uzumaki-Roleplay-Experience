<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just had a blank expression for a second. It was almost as if it took an entire second for his mind to process the entire thing.  He instantly broke out into smile, "Huuh? What was that? I didn't hear what you said," he spoke out, placing his hand by his ear and leaning it towards Shiro.  He spoke the words out in a rather playful way.  He understood what she meant, but he just wanted to have a bit of fun, a byproduct of being around the two.* - Fri Nov 27 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) got what was coming to him. He leaned over, reaching over for his testicles, gripping them in pain. "Fuuuuuuuck!", he called out. For a moment, it sounded as though his voice went up a full pitch, but that was probably someone's imagination.  He hurled over for a period, waiting for the pain to fade before trailing behind. * - Fri Nov 27 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't see the reason as to why he kept his disguise on, so he tore it all off. He'd start with the belt he wore, then the robes. Before you knew it, he had stripped himself down to his under clothes.  "I hate wearing disguises," he muttered, glancing shortly before raiding the closet of the room.  He'd quickly find suitable clothes for his style, dressing himself.* - Fri Nov 27 01:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thought to himself, imagining Shiro bringing a bag of blood to the two. He chuckled for a moment before regaining his composure. Upon witnessing the ramen being delivered to him, he smiled and nodded his head. "Thanks," he spoke as he grabbed ahold of some chop-sticks. 

The sticks rested inbetween his hands, suspended above the bowl of ramen. With a simple use of force, he separated the sticks, turning the singular item into a duo. He held the sticks in his right hand, gripping them in such a way as to allow him to grab and hold items. 

He dug the tip of the sticks into the broth of the ramen, using the sticks as a pincer to grab ahold of some noodles. Once he had a firm grip, he'd raise it up to his open mouth and began to chow down. One after another, he slurped and chewed the noodles. He'd even drink some of the broth with the use of a spoon. 

"I missed your cooking. Hell, having to eat squirrels and whatever using a camp fire is not the best," he squeezed in between scarfing his food. In just minutes, he was already halfway done with his meal.

"So, what happened after we parted? I know Ichiro went to Kumo, what about you Shiro? Stayed in Kiri?"* - Fri Nov 27 02:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked over at Ichiro, then at Shiro, the back at Ichiro again. He let out a sigh, shrugging his shoulders. As awkward the stituation was, he followed through. Kida turned his body towards the bed, directing his vision to Shiro and Shiro only.  He was going to refrain from looking over at Ichiro's direction due to the situation.

He took a deep breath, placing his thumbs into the inner bands of his pants, gripping ahold of the band, lowering his trousers.  The pants fell down below his knees, revealing his male member. * - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright, I'll try. - Fri Nov 27 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stood infront of Shiro, hands by his side, eyes facing forwards.  The last time they had an interaction similar to this, led to the male being knocked into a lake.  He let out a sigh, recalling such memories.   "Alright, here I go," he spoke out.

Instantly, Kida  positioned his left foot forwards, placing his right foot behind.  He relaxed himself, readying his body for his next movement.  In a fluid motion, he raised his right leg, snapping it forwards towards Shiro's side as fast as he could.* - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) lowered his leg as he realized Shiro had dodged his strike effortlessly. "Woah, didn't think you were that fast," he commented.  He shrugged his shoulders, taking a rather carefree attitude. "Well last time, I wasn't able to show you much, mostly because I became a human punching bag." He chuckled.* - Fri Nov 27 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Why can't -you- ask some of the questions? - Fri Nov 27 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright then. Hm..Why are you so head over heels about Sado? - Fri Nov 27 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Not head over heels about Sado... - Fri Nov 27 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's just my Master. - Fri Nov 27 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took the kick to the stomach as he was unprepared. He hurled over, clutching his gut. "T-then what was with all that talk before?" he added.* - Fri Nov 27 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: He's my fucking Master. - Fri Nov 27 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Am I not supposed to be endearing to the person who made me who I am? - Fri Nov 27 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thought to himself as he found himself falling onto the ground.  "This is a 180..Why am I getting kicked?".   The next moment he realized, he was down on the ground, sprawled out.  "A bit kick happy huh?", he uttered.* - Fri Nov 27 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) seemed a bit dazed. Everything felt as though it were going fast.  His heart started to beat faster and faster as the clock ticked.  He was speechless, unable to utter a word as he watched Shiro climb on top of his frame.

His mouth moved slightly, but no audible sound came out. It was as if he were paralyzed. Even though the words failed to come from his mouth, his eyes were able to speak. They had the look of desire and lust.  He knew Shiro was the type to play around, but was she doing so now? His mind began to race, trying to comprehend the situation. For now, he couldn't get a clear understanding.* - Fri Nov 27 03:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Sorry.. - Fri Nov 27 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) thinks: . . . Asshole. - Fri Nov 27 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) lowered his gaze with a look of defeat.  His lower half had started roaring, but the upper wasn't entirely.  He let out a sigh, sitting himself up and looking away for a moment. "I am, but..I don't know," he uttered. He let out another sigh, standing himself up onto his feet. 

He takes a few steps back, leaning up against the wall.  "You just took me by surprise is all,"he added. * - Fri Nov 27 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Damn, I didn't expect that to happen.. - Fri Nov 27 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Come here. - Fri Nov 27 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) said not a word as he approached Shiro. He stood before her, hovering over her frame.  His eyes climbed along her legs and rested upon her face. His face continued to redden, showing just how nervous he was about the situation. 

Kida's mouth opened, and out came sounds; words. "W-What is it that you want?". He turned his gaze away slightly, then resting it back onto her frame.  He was seeing Shiro in a new light. He was used to her sadistic, rude, and brutish attitude. But before his eyes, she didn't have that aura. To him, she looked alone and fragile.

It was if his eyes were playing tricks on him. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was a dream, but deep down, he knew this was reality.  He took a deep breath, calming his nerves for what was to come.* - Fri Nov 27 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) too didn't have much experience in the opposite sex.  Truth be told, this was his first encounter, of course, he couldn't tell his partner this.  His heart started to beat rapidly as he leaned closer and closer to Shiro.  "Alright..I'll lead," he repeated.  

His lips was only centimeters close to Shiros.  His inner lust began to flare, slowly taking over his entire body.  He wanted to enjoy the exchange, but upon learning of Shiro's experience, he held back a bit.  

Kida pressed upon Shiro, lowering down into the bed as he pressed his lips upon hers.  The lustful male's hands began to grab and grope her frame, first brushing her hair, then lowering his hands onto her shoulders, then the waist. * - Fri Nov 27 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was slowly losing himself to his lust. The presence of Ichiro became void to him for the time being. The warm embrace from Shiro motivated him to lose himself into more of his lust.  He allowed his hands to continue traveling around Shiro's body, now gripping for her butt. 

He removed his lips from hers and placed it along her neck, slowly transitioning down to her collar.* - Fri Nov 27 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) halted his actions for a moment as he heard Ichiro's voice.   Flares in his mind began to go off, prompting him to raise his upper torso to glance around the room.  However, it was too late and the male had already left.   Kida himself wasn't sure if Shiro knew, but he knew that their third member had just witnessed such actions.   "You heard that?", he whispered into her ear, lowering his torso once more to continue. Kida continued to grope and grab along Shiro's body, groping harder at her rear. He just enjoyed the feeling.* - Fri Nov 27 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled at her response.  "Bold aren't we?", he whispered. He had a fixation on her butt. It was well defined and toned.  It wasn't far off from what he had imagined all those times he caught a few peaks.  

Upon feeling his partner grasp for his lower member, his sex drives increased. His member was already ready to go, but from the slightest touch it became more stiff.  He was so ready, it began to hurt, but he held on.

Kida would release his right hand from her rear, slowly moving it along her thigh, to her crotch. His hand washed along, centering his fingers just before her folds.  A devilish smirk formed on his face as he lowered his head, tracing his lips and tongue along her the edges of her collar, just before her clothing began to hide some of her flesh.  

His fingers rested along Shiro's crotch, moving and squirming around, entertaining her lower region through the fabrics of her clothing. * - Fri Nov 27 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smiled,  "I guess you're right," he answered.  When he got the go to from Shiro, all gates were released. It was go time.  His eyes began to sparkle and his senses began to direct themselves down to his eager member. 

In a bold statement, he motioned his hands towards her torso, gripping along her waist band. With a single motion, he removed both her pants and panties, yanking them off and tossing them to the side.  He'd then move his way towards  Shiro's shirt, quickly removing them from her person.  In moments, she was in the nude. Not wanting his partner to feel left out, he too removed his clothing, tossing away his shirt and pants, stripping himself down to his bare skin. 

There he stood, his body muscularly toned and defined. He didn't have an overly muscular frame, rather his frame was average, save for the well defined contours of his body. His hands rested along his waist for a moment before stepping closer to Shiro.

"Let's go for a ride," he whispered, locking his lips with hers. His hands once again began to grope along her contours; the left groping her breast, while the right kneading her butt. He aligned his body over hers, pressing his skin against her, member rubbing against her crotch.* - Fri Nov 27 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt his head go blank as their tongues wrapped and coiled around each other.  His body temperature was rising from the intimacy between the two. He too was growing impatient, but he just couldn't get enough of Shirp's lustful sexy self.  He had seen so much of her in the last months that his entire image of her has changed drastically.

His senses were tuned to the moment, ignoring Shiro's nails penetrating into his skin.  Slowly, he lowered his left hand, moving towards her waist. He continued to move his tongue around, uttering the words "Ready?", in between breaths.  

Without waiting for an answer, he removed his right hand from Shiro's rear, gripping the base of his own member.  His lower frame pushed out as he aimed the tip of his errection towards the entrance of her vagina.   While aligning it up, his tip brushed against the folds, moistening his member right before he penetrated it in. With a deep thrust, he drove his penis into the interrior of Shiro's vagina.  

His mind blanketed upon experiencing this new sensation. Warmth, moistness, and tightness. It was wordly.  His crotch was pressed as far as it could up against hers, resting for a moment before he slid out partially and dug back in.  He began to take long, deep thrusts in and out of her, never removing the tip from her grasp.

Kida let out a few moans himself as he entered Shiro's womanhood. He was surely enjoying every moment of it, and he believed Shiro to be as well.* - Fri Nov 27 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt that dagger, but he played along. He gritted his teeth, pounding into flesh like a beast. In-out-in-out. Over and over.  His errection maintained it's strength, constantly thrusting like a mad dog.  One would expect with how fast he was going, he'd tire out rather quickly, but that wasn't the situation.  

"Damn...," he began, grunting in between words. "I...cant..get..enough..of..this,"  he moaned. His body, now glistening with sweat, wasn't letting up.  A wicked grin formed on his face as he motioned both his arms towards Shiro's left leg. His arms wrapped around her leg, moving it along to the right, all while keeping his penis inside. 

"I'll, make..you..cum..first," he panted, now moving for her right leg to transistion the sex into the doggy styled position.* - Fri Nov 27 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked down at the magnificent view he had before him. Shiro had her back arched to him, her ass slamming against his crotch.  His hands had a mind of their own as his left pressed up against her crotch, edging his fingers towards the rose like bud. 

"You...have..no..choice," he uttered, panting like a hound.  He continued to maintain his speed, rapidly thrusting his member in and out.  With each thrust, his penis penetrated deeper and deeper into her vagina, assaulting her sexual organs like the beast he is. 

With his left hand positioned along her crotch, he inched it further, allowing for his fingers to rub against Shiro's clit.  "I've..got..this!" he panted, rubbing and playing with the little bud.   For his right hand, he placed it upon her right butt cheek, kneading it like fresh dough.  He'd slap and move the right cheek, spreading it about to get a better look at his bloodied member penetrating her womanhood, and her anus. * - Fri Nov 27 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) did as he was told, feeling more pleasure from the thrill.  He'd thrust harder and faster, more and more, going full speed.  His grunts, moans, and pants resonated with Shiro's flooding the room with their lust.  

As his left hand continued to assault her ciltoris, his right began to crawl forwards, assisting the left.  "Fuck!", he howled, arcing forwards as he applied his body weight into his thrusting movements.   His left leg was positioned on the bed, aiding in the speed and power of his thrusts.  He'd lean further more, nearing his head to Shiro's as he listened to her cries of ectasy.* - Fri Nov 27 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was nearing his end, holding it in as much as he could.  His pride was on the line as he focused on his rapid thrusts against Shiro.  His legs started to wobble. Despite his own better judgement, he felt some sort of kinship that went  beyond just bodily lust.  His inner self chuckled at the notion, prompting Kida to focus more on his savage assault

Just as he thought of Shiro's stamina, he felt her nether reigion quiver and tighten around his own member.  "S-shit...y-you..got...tighter," he voiced, allowing his sexual desires to go with the flow.  Unbeknownst to him, this was a sign that Shiro had orgasmed, but he wasn't entirely sure due to the constant screaming and moan emitting from her mouth.

As he wasn't done yet, he continued to thrust in and out, locking his lips with Shiros.  Their saliva mixed together as he took control, coiling his tongue around hers, hands still ravaging her clitoris.

"I-I'm about to..cum!!," he uttered in between. His scrotum began to pulsate as he felt a sensation build up around his base. As he continued to thrust, the sensation increased more and more, and his own control weakened with each second

"H-hurry, where...do..you..want it?", he panted, holding back his orgasim for the time being.* - Fri Nov 27 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) held on for as long as he could, but he couldn't hold on anymore.  He let out a roar as his semen exploded out from his penis, throwing itself forwards with an incredible force.   His legs buckled all while the white fluids plastered all across Shiro's breast and face. A large portion entered into her mouth.

"Ugh!" he cried, losing his ability to speak for a moment.  It was the greatest orgasm he ever had, and watching his seeds plaster Shiro's body made it even more worthwhile.  

He smirked as he regained strength into his legs.  He'd lower his hand, gripping the base of his shaft, rubbing it some more to pump out what was left.* - Fri Nov 27 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled, shrugging his shoulders. "I told you that I was in the forrest on my own. You think I'd rub one out and allow a bear to claw my dick off?", he responded in a playful manner.  

He cleared his throat, averting his gaze for a secon upon realizing what had happened. He wasn't ashamed, more like he didn't expect to have his semen plastered upon Shiro's upper body. It was hot, and if he were to think more, he'd probably be ready for a second round.  

When he saw her reach out for him, his chest tightened.  This was all still new to him, but he went along.  He reached out, grapping her hand and pulling her towards his own frame.  He'd twist himself, allowing the two to lay upon the bed.* - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) really couldn't feel akward around the two, especially with their synergy. He chuckled, holding Shiro in his arms. "I don't think you'll be cutting it off anytime soon," he jeered.   He then paused for a moment, realizing the words that came from Shiro's mouth.

"As if I'd cheat. I might sound like a dog, but do you think I'm really one?", he asked.* - Fri Nov 27 08:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just remained in the bed, chilling.  His eyes moved along the contours of Shiro's body. A sly smile errupted as he placed a single hand onto her butt.  "Why no bitch jokes? Afraid you'll go in heat?", he let out a chuckle.* - Fri Nov 27 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was knocked onto the ground, and rolled around a bit.  He was in the nude, so his member fluttered about.  He quickly got up onto his feet and noticed clothing by his feet. He lowered himself and grabbed ahold of the first article, which just so happened to be his draws.  He placed them on, looking over at Shiro. 

"You didn't have to toss me off," he muttered. * - Fri Nov 27 08:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: You have a high probability of doing so because of your fragile body. - Fri Nov 27 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt unusually energetic today. Was it something he ate, or perhaps the recollection of the activities of the night prior? Either way, he was full of energy.  He left the small room in search of something interesting to do.  Since Ichiro was there, he couldn't let his lust go wild.

He let out a sigh, realizing their talk of the prior night had excited him a bit too much. His eyes closed for a moment, recalling the events from his own perspective.  The panting, the grunting, the moaning, the musky scent, the exchange of fluids.  It was all fresh in his mind.  The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. Before he knew it, he had a raging hard on.

"Shit," he muttered, releasing a sigh from his breath. "Rub one out, or let it go," he thought to himself as he just stood alone in the fields. It wasn't his style to fap out in the open, but after his conversation with Shiro, it didn't seem like such a bad choice.

He took a deep breath, sitting himself onto the grass, opening his legs.  He'd glance around quickly to look for anyone near by before he lowered his hand towards his crotch.  ".....,"

Kida began to have a cold sweat. Multiple emotions and reactions began to take place in his body. His fingers traced along the slit of his pants, gripping ahold of the zipper and lowering it. It didn't take much for Kida Jr to pop up. 

His penis was exposed and erect. It was out for the whole world to see.  It was a bit awkward, but there was no one to see what was going on. He motioned his left hand onto the exposed base of his penis, gripping it firmly.  "Damn you..I wouldn't be like this if I didn't meet you," he muttered as he furiously stroked his penis.  

Faster and faster his hand kneaded against his member. He wasn't pressed for time, rather he wanted it to be over with quickly.  He had initially came out to train, but now he found himself rubbing one off in the fields alone.  He tightened his grip as he went all out on his crotch, rubbing it viciously like a beast.  

Pleasure rose throughout his body, plunging his nerves into sexual bliss. He gritted his teeth as he felt a tight pressure swell up from his scotum. "!!"  With a few more knocks, out came white fluids.  The fluids splattered out from his urethra, spraying onto the ground. Milky white ropes dangled from the tip, reaching towards the ground.  Kida looked down, feeling a sense of shame.

"Shit..," he muttered, quickly cleaning himself off with some foilage. Once that was settled, he placed his member back into his pants and stood up onto his feet.

"Ok, time for the real training," he uttered, folding his knees to lower his body. Almost like a spring, Kida compressed his body, storing more energy into his legs. "It was like this," he thought, further crouching down.

He began to visualize an imaginary foe, one who stood before him. "I just noticed, I'll need something to start this up with," he thought, realizing the schematics of the technique itself. 

In a single leap, he launched himself up into the air.  The height was all thanks to the strength of his legs.  In an instant he found himself twisting and turning in the air, hovering above the phantom opponent. His cheeks lifted as his lips curled upwards into a devilish smirk.  

He continued to manuever himself in the air, positioning his body directly above the shadow image.  His legs collapsed once more, pulling themselves towards his chest.  He awaited for a moment, timing the strike just right. When the time was correct, he thrusted his legs down, striking into the phantom foe.  

He allowed gravity to take over, driving his force down into the ground. The aforementioned attack caused a small creater to form beneath his feet.  He looked around and placed his hands onto his waist.  He felt both a sense of achievement, and a sense of shame.* - Fri Nov 27 23:46:20 2015

"Documents?", one asked.  Kida raised a brow, crossing his arms. "I got none.  I'm just looking for someone, and I figure I could be allowed," he retorted.  The guard looked at Kida, then over at his partner. There was silence for a brief moment.

"Soo?", he spoke, breaking the silence.  One of the guards could see the impatience in Kida's eyes, and hurried off to the village, seeking the proper personel.* - Sat Nov 28 02:29:20 2015
