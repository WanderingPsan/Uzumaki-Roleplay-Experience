<br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) had nothing better to do than to train on his form. He found himself in an open field with no one to distract. The swordsman stood in the field and slowly grabbed ahold of his katana. With a fierce motion, he drew the blade. It was a magnificent blade that has seen years of use.

"Let's begin," he muttered to himself as he began to initiate his daily training. He took a chu-dan stance, a standard sword wielding stance where the user holds the blade infront of their body with both hands. He raised the blade up, and sliced downwards with great force.

The air was sliced from the sheer force and speed of the blade's movement. Quickly, it rose up again and descended, repeating the motions over and over. He'd continued to do this for a while until he reached his quota of 100.* - Mon Aug 31 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) continued with his daily practice. He had finished his initial warm up session and was now to begin the real training. He maintained his initial chu-dan stance, and began to swing the blade in sharp, wide arcs. Each arc was swung with precision and speed, enough to easily lop off a limb or two.  "Ziya!", he shouted.

It was somewhat a tradition to shout and grunt while swinging a katana. He didn't know who started the tradition, but it was something that sort of stuck to him. Yuan kept on swinging the blade over and over, mentally cutting down enemy after enemy.  He'd step to the left and cut into the chest, step into the right and cut the leg.  Each strike had a destination. This was his mental training.* - Mon Aug 31 01:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) had spent enough time in the village of Sunagakure. He had learned quite a lot from his stay, alas, it was time for him to go.  He wanted to return back to Kumogakure. Even though his journey wasn't over, he felt the need to at least return periodically.

Yuan made his way all the way towards the village's caravan service. The man who had brought him to Suna was long gone, and was replaced by another driver. The man gave a warmful smile, "Howdy". Yuan nodded and spoke back, "I want to travel to Kumogakure, is it possible?"

The man twisted his mouth then looked back at a large sign post that looked to be a map. "Let's see..I think it should work. Sure, I'll take you there. It'll of course cost ya. Also, it'll take a bit for preparations. It's a long journey."

Yuan nodded and walked off after agreeing to the terms of service. He then made the proper arrangements for the journey. After a while, he returned to the caravan and awaited for the driver.* - Thu Sep 03 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) waited for a while until the driver approached him. "Alright, everything's ready. Let's go," he said. Yuan rose up from his seat and mounted onto the caravan. The driver smiled, looking back at Yuan from the back. "Travel often?" "No, not really."  "Ah, well be sure to look at the scenery. It's beautiful." "I'll be sure to keep my eyes open." Yuan smiled and looked to the left, out into the desert lands. Even though it was somewhat void of life and vegetation, the sight was astounding. 

Thus, the journey began. The scenery changed from time to time. The further north they went, the more greenery appeared. The transistion from desert to forrest was a bit surprising. He remembered seeing a similar sight when he first came to Sunagakure, even then he was taken aback by the lush colors of the lands. * - Thu Sep 03 19:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) rolled up to Kumogakure in a caravan. The driver parked to the side and allowed Yuan to get off. "Well kid, there you go. Have fun," he'd say before dismounting himsself and doing what ever it was that caravan drivers did.* - Thu Sep 03 19:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) looked over at Niza, "Yo," he called out. He raised his hand up in the air as a means of saying hey.* - Thu Sep 03 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) walked into the Raikage's mansion, glancing at everyone. He'd notice both Niza and Amai, along with an unfamilar face.  He raised a brow after realizing that Niza was wearing similar clothing to that of Klaus. "What's with the clothes?", he'd asked, approaching the desk.* - Sun Sep 06 15:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) walked over towards Amai and took one of the tags. He looked at it, then stuffed it into his pocket. "Alright."* - Sun Sep 06 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) stopped in the road after noticing Amai. "Hey," he spoke out.* - Sun Sep 06 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) looked over at Keyshawn. He recognized him from before, but he didn't have a name to attatch to him. "Hey," he replied, waving his hand a bit.* - Sun Sep 06 19:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) pointed over towards Amai's direction, assuming that the male didn't know who she was.* - Sun Sep 06 20:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) was obviously confused by Keyshawn's speech. * - Sun Sep 06 20:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) followed the crowd.* - Sun Sep 06 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) was amongst the hundreds of men and women dispatched to the war. He wore his standard shinobi attire and a scratched kumogakure headband that rested alongside his belt. It's wear and tear was a testament to the struggles he suffered as a shinobi. 

He took a deep breath, calming himself for the battle that was to take place. The group had planned various moves and strategies to counter Zetsumo, but he himself wasn't sure it would work entirely. Fear and doubt crossed his mind, but there was one thing he believed in fully, his skill as a swordsman.  People lie and fool themselves everyday, but in the face of battle, a sword will never lie. It reveals the truth. Once he had calmed his nerves, he gripped the scabbard of his blade tightly. "We can do this," he muttered to himself, trying to not only reassure himself, but those around him. 

When the forces began to move, he too moved with them. He however didn't go along with the front lines, instead he stayed towards the back. He wasn't a coward or anything, he was just cautious. This was enemy territory, foreign lands. There was no telling what could be on the other side of the wall.* - Sun Sep 06 20:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) nodded at the orders he was given.  "Alright. Should we send a flare to let you know that we've captured the hospital or no?"  He too walked through the walls, keeping his guard up and maintaining his grip on his sheath. This was the first time he was in war, and he was going to make it count no matter what. * - Sun Sep 06 21:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) did what he could to survive. He'd draw his blade, cutting into the mud wolves. There was too much to be done to remain in one place.  His blade cut through the wolves like butter, temporarily dismantling them in the process.  He wasn't worried about them, he was only interested in getting through. The reforming wolves, he had left to the doton and raiton corps of their forces. 

"Let's hurry!", he shouted, fleeing from the battle.* - Sun Sep 06 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) was already on his way away from the battle by the time Zetsumo's group arrived. It only made things a bit more troublesome for him.  He didn't look back and instead kept on running at full speed to complete the mission he was given. Before he knew it  the sounds of battle intensified. At first he assumed it was Kumogakure's troops finishing the traps, but after hear the sounds of explosion he was sure the enemy had arrived.  

The instant the ground shifted, the force of the attack launched him further from the battle, causing his body to tumble and roll along. Quickly, he got back onto his feet and started to run once more.   As he continued to run, the roars of battle flashed.  People were murdered, the ground was torn, it was just pure distruction.  "I hope I can make it," he muttered to himself.* - Sun Sep 06 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) was already out of the range for most of the large scale attacks.  He took cover behind a tree. "Damn it," he muttered to himself as he tried to make sense of all that was happening. He peeked out, looking over at the opposing group. Even with their large numbers, the joint efforts of Kumo and Suna were easily getting toppled. It was a shame. 

"I should go after the weakest one," he thought, fixating his eyes over towards Kitora and Katsune. Between the two, he couldn't tell who was the weaker, but from what he's observed it's safe to assume that taking out Kitora would prove to assist in their forces plans.  He then shifted his attention to the large black monsters. "I think I've found something," he muttered.

For the time being, he decided to refrain from attacking until the time was right.* - Sun Sep 06 23:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) continued to watch from behind the trees, keeping an eye for anyone who seemed like a key part of the ongoing battle. He was currently in a safe location, or at least he assumed for the time being. "Those masked creatures are really weird," he commented.

Instead of remaining stationary, he started to move through the trees, heading southwards.* - Mon Sep 07 00:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) was already alert of what was going on. He was keeping his eye out for anything and everything. Suddenly, he he caught glimps of a series of kunai all heading into his direction.  He felt something was off from the attack and jumped behind the tree, using it as a shield.   "This won't stop me," he muttered, dashing from outside of the tree and towards Kitora.  

From his observations, she was a key player in this war and had to be dealt with swiftly. Wasting no time what so ever, he slashed out in a swift arc, aiming to lop her arm off. * - Mon Sep 07 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuan(Shiziru101) watched as the crimson fluids spewed from the wound he had just inflicted upon Kitora. His eyes were cold as steel. This was war, and there was no feelings behind war, just views.  He was a swordsman in body and mind.   He watched the female fall. "Thats one d-", he began. 

The swordsman looked down at his stomach, eyes remaining cold. There he saw a large mass sticking out from him, piercing straight through his body.  Blood covered the spike, dying the green grass below.  He chuckled as blood started to flood into his lungs. "So...this is how it ends?", he spoke softly.   He'd cough some more, now with blood dripping from his mouth. He was literally at deaths door,and there wasn't much that would save him; especially since he was right in the front lines of the battle.

Before he knew it, he felt all the strength in his body fading. "I..need..to..finish..this..," he forced out from his mouth as he put a single foot forwards, followed by another. He was determined to finish Kitora, he wasn't contempt with the injury he gave her.  It was his dying wish to bring honor to the village, no his sword.

Every second felt like an eternity to him. His bodily functions were shutting down from the blood loss, and he was quickly losing conscious due to a mix of shock and blood loss.  There was very little hope of him surviving this battle, and he knew exactly what the risks where when he participated.  

With every step, it brought him closer to the end. His body cried as he tried to dismount the spear that was currently piercing him. Blood squirted with each movement, but it didn't matter.  Just as he was about to take the last step, everything went black, and then a strong force crashed into him. At this point, he didn't know what it was, and all of the pain receptors in his body had stopped. His body had become void of pain and simplied slouched along the spear that protruded through his body. * - Mon Sep 07 01:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) sat alongside the bench alone. He'd been sitting there for quite some time, daydreaming about various things.  It wasn't until some time had passed that he snapped out of his dazed state. His eyes glanced around the area, "I wonder what's going on," he whispered to himself.* - Mon Sep 07 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just listened in to the discussion. He didn't have any input, to there was no reason for him to bud in. Besides, it was pretty rude to just force yourself into someone's conversation.* - Mon Sep 07 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked up to Hassan, hands in his pockets. "How much should I bring? And do you have an axe?", he questioned, all while keeping eye contact with the male.* - Mon Sep 07 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled at Hassan's comment towards the one known as "Douchebag Haircut".  That was quite a random comment, but a funny one. He smiled then started to walk off in search of an axe for his mission. It shouldn't be too hard to find an axe, right?* - Mon Sep 07 23:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was now on a quest to get an axe. As far as he knew, ninja stores didn't sell axes. In fact, that was something he'd have to find at a hardware store or something.  Even then, he didn't really want to spend money on an axe that he'd use for one time.  He let out a sigh.

"I wonder if I can borrow an axe from someone," he muttered to himself as he walked around the village.  He'd pass through various people, big and tall, looking for an axe. After what felt like an eternity, he came across a man that looked to be a lumber jack. 

"Hey Mister, do you have an axe that I can borrow?", the genin asked.  The man looked at him. He was a middle aged man with bulging muscles and a full on beard.  To most, he looked rather intimidating, fitting the usual description of hunters. "What's it to you? What would a runt need an axe for?"he spoke in a deep voice.   Kida just looked at the man with a smile, "I'm getting wood for the village and I need an axe. I don't want to waste money on buying one if I'm only going to use it once, so I came to you. You looked like a lumber jack and usually lumber jacks carry wood cutting axes. And now we're here."

The man paused for a moment, rubbing his chin as his facial muscles worked in unison to create a rather difficult to read face.  After a moment of silence, the man opened his mouth and began to speak. "Sure. Take it, but I want it back when you return. If I don't get it, I'll file a thief report to the officials. Got it kid?" "Yeah, I got it. Thanks." The lumber jack then reached over towards his side and tossed a large object at the shinobi.

Kida caught onto the object and looked down at it, seeing that it was an elongated item that was wrapped up in cloth.  It had some weight, but it didn't bother him. "Thanks again," he said with a smile as he made his way to the vilalge's outskirts to gather the wood.* - Mon Sep 07 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't have to travel far for the wood, especially since there were plenty of trees around the village. After walking a bit, he stopped infront of a single tree. It stood at least twenty feet tall.  He stood infront of the tree, axe in hand, and looked right up at it. For a moment, it felt like it was an impossible task due to it's height. "Wow..Alright, time to get started," he whispered as he removed the cloth that wrapped around the axe.  

The axe shimmered in the light, it's ebony blade reflecting beams of light onto the tree.  Kida simply raised the axe above his head and hacked away. One, two, three, he hacked and hacked.  The axe chipped at the wooden base slowly, but surely.  * - Tue Sep 08 00:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took a step back and stopped cutting at the tree for a moment. His eyes laid upon the now wounded base.  After all of the cutting he did, there wasn't much damage to the tree. At most, he'd just "broke open the skin".  "This is going to take more time than I originally thought," he muttered, resting the axe against his shoulder.

He kept staring at the for a breif period, collecting his thoughts in his head before resuming with cutting the tree.  He pushed forwards and swung at the tree with all of his might. A loud crack rang as the axe made contact with the tree base. *Thwack! Thwack!*

Each blow he applied more strength, while keeping an idea of where he was. After all, it would be bad if the tree fell on him.  Kida kept cutting into the tree over and over. Hopefully he'd gain some progress.* - Tue Sep 08 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was starting to breath heavily after all of the strainous activities concerning the tree. It had been at least 15 minutes, and he still didn't make it at least halfway to the base.  "Ugh, this is taking forever!", he roared.   The genin released his grip on the axe, leaving it embedded in the trunk.   He took a deep breath and a few steps back, glaring at the axe that stook out. 

"Two birds with one stone I suppose," he mutterd before running forwards towards the tree.  He'd jump into the air, curling his legs while twisting the lower half of his body clock wise. His right leg locked into place as he got closer to the base. The instant he got in striking range, he lashed his leg out, straighting his foot and springing his lower half counterclock wise.  

The genin's leg slammed up against the tree, shaking it's very foundation.  His shin dug into the bark, leaving an indentation in the tree.  Before he knew it, he felt gravity take it's toll, pulling him down onto the earth. However, he wasn't done. Kida began to unleash a series of powerful kicks left and right against the tree as he descended down. All along the trunk of the tree were indentations left and right.  Upon reaching the ground, he jumped back and got a better look at the tree.

It was now riddled with cacks up and down it's base, yet still looked as if it wasn't going to fall anytime soon. He let out a sigh.* - Tue Sep 08 01:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) sat onto the ground and took a quick break.  He was somewhat annoyed with how long it was taking to cut the tree down. He'd kick it a great deal of times, and he even hacked it up, but it still wasn't falling.  "Almost there," he muttered, glaring at the axe again.   He took a deep breath and stood up once more. "Time to finish this," he spoke as he approached the tree once more.  

He stopped infront of the tree and took a deep breath.  Quickly, he brought up his left foot while spinning on the balls of his feet. In an instant, he lashed out at the base again with a powerful kick.  Once again, the tree shook from the force, not once, but twice.  In the midst of his first kick, he used the momentum generated to kick out at the trunk, striking it twice.   The trunk chipped further, now revealing the inner bark further than prior.   It was only a matter of time before the tree fell.   Kida continued to kick from the opposite side of where he started to chop, hoping to lessen the load while also improving his leg muscles.* - Tue Sep 08 01:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) jumped back once more to get a better view of the tree. By now, a good portion of it had been either smashed, or cut.He was making noticable progress.  A smile cracked on his face as he stepped up towards the embedded axe.  He wrapped his hands around the base, pulled it out from the tree, then resumed cutting into it.  He put his body and soul into each swing.

*Thwack! Thwack!* The familar sounds repeated over and over. Beads of sweat began to drip from his figure, drenching his clothes.  "Almost there," he said to himself as he continued to push through.  By now he had already reached the center of the trunk with the axe.  Just a few more swings and the tree was surely going to fall down. 

The anticipation fueled him, his fatigue was disappearing. "Almost..." he repeated in his mind as the sounds of metal cutting against wood echoed in his ears.  Suddenly a new sound entered his ears.  *Crraaacckk!* Before he knew it, he'd cut through the tree's support and gravity was now taking it's toll.   The tree came tumbling down onto the ground. It's branches broke apart, and some of the ground was damaged from the impact.

A dirt cloud lifted into the air, slightly blocking visage, but it was no big deal. Kida smiled. "Finally! Now to bring it back to the village," he spoke.    He stood infront of the tree in a puzzled expression.* - Tue Sep 08 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) took a few steps towards the downed tree. It's branches were all over the place with leaves blanketing the ground. He decided to head for the easier to carry limbs, and set them to the side.   Afterwards, he took the axe and started to cut into the base once more.  This time since gravity was assisting him, he was easily able to go through the logs.  

In no time he'd cut the tree into different fragments, leaving nothing to waste. "This was a productive day," he said to himself, wiping away the sweat that blanket his face.  Kida looked over towardsd the tree limbs that he had set aside and pondered.  "I guess I should ask the lumberjack for assistance. It's not like I can't carry this all, but it'll be difficult," he thought.  

After a few minutes of planning, he decided to call for the assistance of the lumber jack from inside of the village.  Unsure of how to secure his lumber, he wrapped his arms around two logs and walked back into the village with them.  At least he'd have something to bring if anything were to happen to the lumber.* - Tue Sep 08 02:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) finally met up with the lumber jack. He smiled at the man, showing him the two logs that he'd have on his persons. "Thanks for the axe, but I have another favor of you. I need some help bringing all of this wood back. There's a lot, a whole tree's worth. I'll give you some bundles as thanks." 

The lumberjack looked at Kida in silence, rubbing his hand against his chin. An akward silence lingered for a few moments before the gave a reply. "Sure. Let me just get a few things. I suppose three wagons should be good to bring everything back," he spoke.  Kida nodded his head, and the Lumber jack departed to make his preparations.  

"Ok, now that's done, time to go back," he thought to himself, turning around to return to where he had cut the tree down.* - Tue Sep 08 20:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) looked at the logs when he returned. All of them were still there surprisingly.  "Looks like this is going to be easy," he muttered, gathering even more of the cut wood and putting them together. 

There were about three different piles of wood; logs, branches, and everything else. The piles were stacked up to about five feet each, with wood on top of wood.  Since most of his work was done, he sat beside one of the logs and rested until the lumberjack came with his wagon.* - Tue Sep 08 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) didn't wait too long as he heard the wheels of the wagons rolling about. Louder and louder the noise became, signifying the proximity. In just moments, the lumberjack arrived with three empty wagons and two additional men.  "We're here," he called out, signaling his assistants to disembark the wagons to load the wood. 

Kida got up from his seat and walked over to the Lumberjack, pointing out what was needwed and what wasn't in terms of wood. The man nodded, listening to every word the genin spoke. After a short discussion, the group began their work.

Kida grabbed a handful of logs and loaded them onto the wagon that was labeled for his mission, while the other two started to fill their carts. * - Tue Sep 08 23:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) worked side by side with the three men. Their muscles bulged with strength. The sun's rays bathed the men, giving rise to glisening skin covered in sweat. This was the definition of manual labor.  One after one, he hoisted logs onto his shoulder, carrying them over to the wagon to load.  "You ok kid?", one of the men asked, directing the question to Kida. Kida looked over at the one who addressed him, wiped the sweat from his face using a rag, and ansered "Yeah, this is nothing. I train like this a lot." "Alright. Just don't over do it. No need getting a kid hurt, even if he's strong like you." The man then laughed and resumed what he was doing. 

After what felt like an hour, the men had all loaded the carts. "That was a work out huh?", the lumberjack said. The two assistants and Kida nodded in unison.  "Alright, time to bring this all back and we'll be done for the day," he added, now mounting onto the wagon.  "Thanks once again. Oh right, before I forget, here's your axe." Kida spoke out, handing the lumberjack the clothed wrapped axe.   The man took the axe and placed it right beside him, saying thanks.  

"I'll leave this cart to you, and the others I'll take," he spoke, leaving the area with two carts.* - Tue Sep 08 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) had already agreed to the rewards towards the men, and since one cart would be more than enough to fulfil his mission, it shouldn't have been much of a problem. He waved farewell to the men as he grabbed ahold of the cart, pulling it back into the village.

To be honest, the wagon was heavy, and had he not built his muscles then he'd probably be unable to pull such a heavy weight. "Igh!", he grunted, using his body weight and leg strength to drag the cart filled with logs.  If he had to describe the sensation, it was almost like running through mud.  He was able to gain traction with his footing, but wasn't able to go far. 

He grunged through, using all of his strength to gain momentum. After a few steps, he started to pick up speed, lessining the struggle of the cart ride. Now that he was in motion, it was time to bring the cart back to Hassan.* - Tue Sep 08 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stolled through the village with the heavy cart. His breathing intensified due to exertion,  while his muscles ached from all of the physical activites he'd perform just to get to where he was.  It surely was a good work out, but he couldn't go over board.  

The wagon squeaked as it's wheels rotated. Every second it squeaked, and every second the contents rumbled from with in.  From an outside perspective, he looked like a lumberjack himself, or a farm hand. His clothes were drenched in sweat and dirt, giving him a dirty look. It didn't matter to him since he was only doing his mission. * - Wed Sep 09 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) slowly approached the village's square as he dragged the wagon filled with timber. He looked around, trying to find Hassan. "Hm..I don't see him..," he muttered to himself, stopping right at the sign post.   He released his grip on the wagon, allowing it to slouch over. "Hey, has anyone seen the that one guy, um...The one with the eye patch? He's old.  I brought the wood he requested for my mission," he spoke out, trying to find answers to his question.* - Wed Sep 09 00:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smiled as he said those words. He then turned over towards the wagon, grabbing ahold of it's handle and dragging it over towards the side. It was heavy and had a good amount of log in it. 

Once he put it over to the side, he took a deep breath and wiped his forehead once more.  "Thanks for doing this. By the way, I'm Kida," he spoke out, releasing the cart and extending a hand over to Violet.* - Wed Sep 09 00:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) frowned and retracted his hand. "No big deal," he spoke. His eyes then shift over to the new face that approached the two. "I'm Kida, and you?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) laughs at Violet's question. He pushes the sides of his jacket away, revealing his headband buckle that rested on his waist. "Yes, I am. See?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a sigh. "I am a shinobi from here, if that's what you're trying to get at.  I don't even have the skills to burst through the village's defense."* - Wed Sep 09 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smiled at Violet's words. "Alright, I promise I won't get in your way. By the way, are you alright? You seem a bit worried about something," he commented, turning his head to the female.* - Wed Sep 09 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shrugged his shoulders as he started to follow Violet. As he began to follow the female, he started to shadow box, throwing jabs left and right in the air.  A one-two combo, a left, right, jab combo. Such techniques were displayed. It was all for the sake of both training and warming up.* - Wed Sep 09 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) watched Violet slash at the air. He was awestruck at the speed and accuracy of her strikes. "Woah," he whispered. He then smiled, feeling a bit excited from watching her.  In inner flames of passion began to burn in his heart as he stomped his left foot forwards, shifting his body weight in accordance.  In a flash, he launched a left jab into the air, then a right, shifting his upper body weight between punches.  Each punch had significant weight to them, but something felt off. 

"I know I can hit harder than this," he thought to himself, punching the air faster and faster. * - Wed Sep 09 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) kept up with his pace, breathing in and out with each punch as to not outwind himself. He'd start to bob and weave between blows, making his jabbing session a bit more dynamic.  

His fists cut through the air with each movement, almost as if it were a type of dance. There was grace, beauty and ferrocity in the synchronization of his punches. Left, right, one, two, jab, hook. The rhythm he displayed with his strikes were both basic and effective.   He suddenly lowered his arms and turned his head over towards Mizumi who was just sitting there.

"Not going to train or anything?", he commented, tilting his head slightly while regaining his breath.* - Wed Sep 09 01:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waited for a few more seconds before resuming his session.  He stepped forwards and began to throw a series of jabs and hooks.  As he did so, he'd bob and weave his torso back and forth, simiulating an actual fist fight. He was shadow boxing.  He didn't have much experience against other fighters such as himself, so he didn't really have anyone to visualize, so he just came up with a rather generic individual.  In his mind, the imaginary boxer had an average frame, and moved similar to himself.  It was a poor method of training as focusing on one's own moves tends to cause the individual to miss out on improvements quicker.   But for now, it didn't really matter much.

He placed his left leg forwards and kept his arms up. They were positioned just infront of his chest, tightly packed to transition from both offense to defense. The objective of this training was all focused on the upper body.  If he wanted to be a successful shinobi, his body had to be limber and quick.

While visualizing the opponent, he threw out a left jab, quickly pulling his fist back before connecting and throwing out the right.  He'd follow with leaning his body to the right and dealing a low uppercut towards the ribs.  Quickly, he repositioned himself and opt for a left rib blow, followed by a hook to the chin. * - Wed Sep 09 02:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) kept his eyes on the prize, continuing to punch and dodge his imaginary foe. "What if you ever got into a situation where you needed physical strength? Then what?", he asked.* - Wed Sep 09 02:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shrugged his shoulders, now lowering his arms and returning into a basic non combative stance. His eyes drifted off towards the lake. He just stood there in silence in a daze, until he sat down onto the ground, folding his legs. "So, that's your training huh?", he spoke, diverting his eyes over towards Violet. * - Wed Sep 09 03:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) decided to cut the conversation short. He rose up from his seat and began speaking, "Well that's all for today. I guess I'll see you around. Don't forget to give Hassan my message. Later." He then waved good bye and walked off.* - Wed Sep 09 03:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned his head over towards Mitsuru, "How come? and what happened with your arm?"* - Wed Sep 09 11:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) starts to imagine a very skinny boney figured male, who looks like he could be a serial killer or something. * - Wed Sep 09 12:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) shifted his gaze over towards Jin. "What are you trying to do? And are you alright?"* - Wed Sep 09 12:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was somewhat bored with all of the standing and talking. The time spent chatting away could be used for something productive, thus he took the productivity route.  

He walked over towards the side, keeping note of his reach and distance. He didn't want to hit anyone by accident. The genin took a deep breath, raising his left knee up, while balancing on his right leg. 

He began to bounce on his leg, building up kinetic energy and momentum. After a few short hops, he jumped up into the air and whiped his left leg into a high kick.  Using the generated momentum, he pulled his left leg back and swapped it with the right, sending a mid-roundhouse kick into the air.   He'd repeat the process once more before landing on the ground. 

"No, that's not it," he muttered, repositioning himself for another attempt.* - Wed Sep 09 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) felt off about the initial series of kicks he unleashed. He just couldn't put his finger on it. Was his distribution of weight, the momentum, or was it possibly the fact that he just didn't time the attacks properly. Either way, he was ready for another go. 

Instead of lifting his knee in preparation, he decided to go about the kick in a different way.  He spread his legs out, putting his dominant behind his body, with his left positioned forwards.  His body was positioned straight, enabling him to effectivly switch between offense and defense with the greatest efficiency. 

Kida quickly swung his rear leg forward, raising it up to his chest. Quickly, he brought the leg down and performed a swift leg sweep. Occasionally he'd swap legs, but he maintained the same rhythm; a mid kick transisioning to a low kick. * - Wed Sep 09 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) upon hearing the words taijutsu, he stopped his kicking session, and shifted his head over towards Tethys. "Do you know anyone who is good at taijutsu by chance?"* - Wed Sep 09 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) left the area just as well, following the steps of both Leon and Kirie. However, his destination was different from the two.* - Wed Sep 09 13:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) had been searching all over the village, and had finally found his target.  "I've finally found you! I've gathered the wood that you told me to get. It's all in a wagon. I don't know if Violet gave you my message though," he spoke, directing it all towards Hassan.* - Wed Sep 09 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waved at the two as he started to walk off. * - Wed Sep 09 13:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) glanced over at Jin. "Mind if I join you? I need to do some more training myself."* - Wed Sep 09 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stood there in silence. Since he had nothing to do, he decided to train himself. He turned his head towards Tethys and began to speak, "Do you know of anything that would compliment my fighting style?"* - Wed Sep 09 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) arrived at the waterfall. Upon arrival, he noticed both Mizumi, Tethys and Himuira. Just like Himura, Kida too decided to watch the bout take place.* - Wed Sep 09 15:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Lord Hassan? - Thu Sep 10 21:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: ( (*Ossa, Baen his jaw dropped to the floor as he contemplated the insult. It was clear that Tethys wouldn't just let this slide, and if he did...well Baen would probably be too shocked to even say a word. In the meantime, he glanced towards Jin, and maintained his stupified look. "Yo...." He took a step to the left as shit was about to get hectic. "He about to kill a Gezo heir. He about to become the most infamous man alive. He's about to pull a luffy." He thought to himself. *) ) - Thu Sep 10 23:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just watched the entire situation with a confused expression. He didn't participate in the assault against the Gezo Prince, rather he felt like it had no merit. He'd heard rumours about people who opposed the Gezo, and most of the time it ended badly. Thus, he sat at the sidelines shadow boxing.* - Fri Sep 11 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) stopped punching the air and looked over at Mizumi, giving her a look of disgust, then back to Mizumi. "Hey. And not really," he replied. "Why is she worrying about her hair when it can just grow back?", he thought to himself.* - Fri Sep 11 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: Is she always like that? - Fri Sep 11 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a disappointing sigh.* - Fri Sep 11 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled at Mizumi's question. "Just because you don't see me in the act, doesn't mean I don't do it," he responded with a grin. Seeing Mizumi circle around him sort of annoyed him, but he figured the genin was just trying to get better with his footing. It wasn't a bad idea, but the method he was using, seemed a bit tedious and troublesome.* - Fri Sep 11 01:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to watch Mizumi, ignoring his "command" to perform fifty push ups. Instead, he started to follow the genin. Just like Mizumi, Kida started to focus on his footing.  He'd step with his left, then right in a systematic way. "This doesn't seem so hard," he spoke out, hands in his pockets. * - Fri Sep 11 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) continued to walk in a moderate pace. He wasn't really focusing per say, just walking around in circles. Each step ruffled against the stone pavement. There was no way that he couldn't be heard.  He paused for a moment, crossing his arms and entering a deep train of thought. "I should really practice on my foot work. I'm sure if I can reach my enemies without them noticing, then it'll be a peace of cake." He then smiled as he stopped following Mizumi and started to stand on his toes. 

"Alright, let's see if this helps," he muttered to himself as he started to hop from one foot to the other. With each jump, he'd try to reposition his weight in such a way that the sound would muffle. Sadly, his efforts were resulting in failure.  Each time he switched feet, the clammer of rubber against rock resonated against people's ears. 

The sounds weren't loud, just noticable.  Occasionally, he'd glance over at Mizumi to see how he was doing. It was obvious from anyone watching that the two were working on something similar. * - Fri Sep 11 01:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) just looked over at Jin with a brow raised. "What's the purpose of all of that? I mean, I've seen you constantly try that over and over. Is it suppose to do something?", he commented, tilting his head slightly due to curiosity.* - Fri Sep 11 20:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Good practice for  you, try and guess what it will do.  - Fri Sep 11 20:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I need to learn how to break genjutsu... hmm.. - Fri Sep 11 20:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Its in the vault, you just have to ask tethys for it. - Fri Sep 11 20:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: The vault? - Fri Sep 11 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: A bunch of donated jutsu scrolls. - Fri Sep 11 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Huh. - Fri Sep 11 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yep. - Fri Sep 11 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Back in my day you had to create jutsu if you wanted to learn a new one. - Fri Sep 11 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ah. Old man Muhhamed, I finished the Wind Release training. I owe you for the training tips. I still can't quite use techniques though. - Fri Sep 11 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Also, mind showing me how the Kai technique works? Clearly Tethys is... dazing off. - Fri Sep 11 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I don't feel like it.. - Fri Sep 11 20:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ugh.. - Fri Sep 11 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see why I have to wait ten minutes for a demonstration that takes a second. - Fri Sep 11 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why are you complaining? He's offering it for free. - Fri Sep 11 20:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Why do you find it desirable to throw yourselves in my situations? - Fri Sep 11 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not throwing myself into your situation.  If you don't like my comments, then either ignore them or just don't sound like a spoiled brat. - Fri Sep 11 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see how disliking a man that can't mind is own business classifies as being spoiled. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Did she even listen to me. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hnf. Men. Always trying to justify their annoying tendencies. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Think what ever you want. In my eyes, you seem like a spoiled brat who wants everyone to drop what they're doing to serve you. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Just stop it Kida, I'm sick of fighting at the moment. Its an important skill everyone needs to know. - Fri Sep 11 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't trust men. I dislike them, as well. - Fri Sep 11 20:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I didn't ask to trust or like them. - Fri Sep 11 20:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) chuckled at Jin's comment. "I'm not fighting, just voicing my opinions. I'm sure if we were actually fighting, it would be physical fighting.  And as for you missy, I'm not above duking it out with a woman if that's what it takes to squash this." He then diverted his eyes towards Mizumi who he didn't realize was there.

"So, what happened with the whole tip toeing and what not? Got better at it?", he questioned.* - Fri Sep 11 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I see. - Fri Sep 11 21:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What about it? - Fri Sep 11 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . . - Fri Sep 11 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: How has it been going... - Fri Sep 11 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh. It's been going alright I suppose. - Fri Sep 11 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I've been looking for someone though. Everyone says he has the best technique in terms of physical combat. - Fri Sep 11 21:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I think his name was Lido or something. Tethys said he wore all green and looked like a "taijutsu scrub". - Fri Sep 11 21:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Oh.. - Fri Sep 11 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: That's descriptive... - Fri Sep 11 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I can't remember the name exactly. But everyone has told me to look for him. - Fri Sep 11 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I actually haven't seen anyone that would look like that... - Fri Sep 11 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Do you know anyone who is good with taijutsu? - Fri Sep 11 21:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And I mean in terms of skill and technique, not brute strength. - Fri Sep 11 21:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: No not really... - Fri Sep 11 21:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I see.. - Fri Sep 11 21:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) let out a sigh. He then waved at Mizumi and started to leave the area. Since there was nothing to do here, he figured he'd find something to do elsewhere.* - Fri Sep 11 21:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked off towards the village waterfall. It was a nice and quiet place to train. There was no interuptions, and the ambience seemed to motivate and relax him.  He took a deep breath, bringing in all of the scents of fresh water and greenery into his lungs.  "Alright, time to start," he said to himself, readying himself into a combative stance. 

The genin started to limber his legs up, stretching left and right. Once he was finished with the preparations, he whipped his left leg out, swinging it in arc. The leg flashed for an instant, then suddenly another leg whiped out as his body rotated.  The leg motioned in an arc, utilizing both the movements of the leg muscles, and the momentum generated by twisting his body.  "Ha!", he shouted as his leg rested back onto the ground.* - Fri Sep 11 21:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) started to hop on his legs after executing the chain of kicks. His body swayed left and right as he bounced from one foot to the other.  His arms were up, fist balled up, and ready to go.  Kida stepped forwards, twisting his hip and bending his right knee. Using the accumilative momentum and movement of his hip, he snapped his leg out, dealing a high sweep.  He then quickly readjusted his body, sending out an equally dangerous low kick. Had there been anyone in the striking zone, they would most likely suffer some serious injuries. 

The moment he planted his feet down, the genin curled his legs and lowered his body. As if he were a spring, he jumped up into the air, flipping forwards while extending his left leg outwards. He made a clear conscious effort to have his foot positioned in such a way that it would strike into an opponent's body upon the descent. "Jaguar Kick!", he howled, bringing down his descending foot like an axe. * - Fri Sep 11 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) landed with his left foot after performing the overhead axe kick. He once again jumped up into the air, curling both legs. Whilst in the air, he began to rotate his hip, then his torso in a single motion, building up mometum and force. "Leaf Whirlwind!", he exclaimed as he snapped his left leg out with an arial high kick.  He'd then use the turning force and kick out with his right leg, aiming for a lower blow while pulling the left leg back. 

The two kicks resulted in a rather loud snap. Upon landing on the ground, he quickly performed a backwards cartwheel, arching his body backwards while using his legs to push his body. As his body hurled back, he whipped his legs out, slashing at his imaginary enemy.  

After the resulting axe kick, he returned to his original combative position.* - Fri Sep 11 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: How skilled are you in Raiton? - Fri Sep 11 22:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) walked into the main courtyard, body covered in sweat.  He stretched his arms out as he casually walked straight towards the vending machine. "I hope this thing's filled," he said to himself, putting a coin into the machine.* - Fri Sep 11 22:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: I didn't think Setsuna would like lollipops. - Fri Sep 11 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Tsh... this is boring.. - Fri Sep 11 22:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) waited for a moment after putting the coin into the vending machine. The machine hummed and rattled, then out came a water bottle. He reached down into it's slit and pulled out the bottle. For a moment he just stared at the bottle, then suddenly he unfastened it's cap and started to guzzle it down, cooling his body and what not. Damn, that was some good water.* - Fri Sep 11 23:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Tethys remember that mission you told, Me and Himura would go on. When are we exactly doing that. - Fri Sep 11 23:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Not for a while. The information I got from a outside source advised me to stay in the village just in case something went down. - Fri Sep 11 23:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Anybody down for a friendly spar then? - Fri Sep 11 23:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I see, then mind handing me another mission for me to do? - Fri Sep 11 23:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) turned his head over towards Ken. "Sure, I'll go for one," he spoke out, walking over towards the fellow shinobi.* - Fri Sep 11 23:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) was rather interested in what Ken was doing. He noticed the genin with his hands together, as if he were in preparation for something.  This of course just spelled trouble.  Unsure of what possible technique Ken was going to display, Kida began to move in a zig zag motion towards Ken. "I can't let him finish what he's doing," he thought to himself as he got closer and closer to the genin.  

However he wasn't fast enough and Ken was able to execute his technique. Out of no where, a straight beam of lightning shot forwards straight at him.  It crackled and roared as it traveled the air and towards his location. Instinctivly, he raised both of his arms and crossed them, putting up a shield with his arms.  

The jutsu struck his arms, sending a shock all throughout his body. He gritted his teeth as he held himself up, feeling his entire being ache from the sudden jolt.  "Guh!" He stumbled with his footing, halting his advance. "I need to get closer," he mumbled, lowering his arms which were now stinging from the shock. * - Fri Sep 11 23:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) smirked as he charged head first once more towards Ken. Since he was a bit more aware of what the shinobi had in his arsenal, it became that much more easier to anticipate what was to come.  Instead of blocking like prior, he opted to move as much as possible to lose the male's focus.  He'd dash to the left, then right, all while maintaining his approach. As he did so, he pressed his arms up against his body.

"Does he have any plans?", he thought to himself as he jumped up into the air, over the incoming projectiles, and curling his body slightly. As he avoided the attack, he snapped his right leg out just as his body began rotating forwards. "Taste this!", he called out, bringing down his heel onto the male's shoulder using the combined rotation and gravitational pull.   The heel of his foot came crashing down upon Ken's shoulder all with enough force to potentially bring him to his knees. * - Sat Sep 12 00:10:27 2015

"If this is too much, we can always stop," he shouted as he stopped right infront of Ken. He quickly began to send a series of quick strikes towards the male; a left kick towards the thigh, a right left jab combo to the chest, and a knee to the stomach.
