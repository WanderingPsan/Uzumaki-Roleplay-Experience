<br><br><font color=yellow>*Token(K9-Snow) was far enough behind the corner that an explosive kunai to the corner wasn't going to do much but make the cavern ache and drop a few pebbles here and there. She grit her teeth and simply waited without moving, he wasn't going to get her with an attack like that with how she was around the corner, nice attempt at causing a cave in though.

As him and the shadow clone had stepped forward initially, as soon as the shadow clone stepped forward he had stepped on a pressure plate. Suddenly two kunai would fly out, these would unable to be avoided by the shadow clone most likely unless something -drastic- was done to avoid them. Thus, the shadow clone would be disipated.* - Sat Dec 12 19:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Token(K9-Snow) pursed her lips as she heard traps going off and whirling winds of rotation. She waited listening while a trap was triggered by Koji but he would be fast enough to activate the second rotation and block the attack. As he was busy dealing with that she was trying to time out an attack at the right time. A burst of chakra from her mind and through her entire body as her muscles tensed and stretched in severe amounts of pain but she was used to it by now. 

Waiting for his rotation to end she then darted towards Koji. Her speed was a blur, even he would have trouble keeping an eye on her as she aimed to quickly twist her body and aim to send a sudden attack in a backwards twist of her leg in an upward attack that attacked so quickly that there was a literally whirlwind around their leg and body in the spin. After doing so they had dashed away from the male again through the traps she had already learned the locations of from testing in her own way long before Koji arrived. She had done this so quickly it would be impossible for him to track which steps she took.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Token(K9-Snow) had a few attacks land----and although she was going to dart away from him his first few attacks landed heavily enough she wasn't capable of enduring the pain. She fell to the ground crying out in pain and staring up at him through her tinted blue goggles trembling. Perhaps she was a little too scared, and a little to shy to be in an exam such as this. She wasn't dead... only laying there in pain on the ground. What would Koji do?
