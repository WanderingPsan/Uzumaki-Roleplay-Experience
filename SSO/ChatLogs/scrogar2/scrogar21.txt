<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kizu(Scrogar_2) walks into the room, unsure of why he was there in the first place* - Sun Sep 06 18:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kizu(Scrogar_2) sat down, crossing his legs as his face looked pretty plain. He watched as Masayoshi climbed up the mountain. It was probably fun, but it was also pretty dangerous.

"I'm fine."He would reply honestly* - Sun Sep 06 21:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kizu(Scrogar_2) was sitting around, not knowing what to do. The entire village was pretty boring and he had nothing to do. He could probably go ask someone for a simple mission, but no one was in the mansion. He sighed as he felt like he was going to be the first person to actually die of boredom. The sack(?) on his back was a bit heavy, and he thought maybe he could play around with it later. Thats when he noticed the person walking towards the mansion.

"Uh.....can I help you sir?"He would say to the shady looking person* - Mon Sep 07 11:54:01 2015
