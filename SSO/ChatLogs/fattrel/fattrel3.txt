For a moment, she simply stared at it before looking to Toudou. In her eyes, it seemed that he was enjoying it and therefore deemed it safe enough for herself. Using the chopsticks, she took up a piece of her own and placed it in her mouth, chewing at it. Her worried face becoming a bit more elated from the taste, a nod following after.* - Tue Oct 27 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I had another question. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Is your hair naturally blue? - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes...Why? - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I've never seen a girl with natural blue hair. - Tue Oct 27 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh....Yeah, I guess it's not really so common... - Tue Oct 27 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh huh. - Tue Oct 27 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: My hair is naturally orange though, so what am I to say. - Tue Oct 27 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) looked over to the glasses of water as they were set, simply drawing hers in a bit closer. A light chuckle came from her, an obvious attempt to show interest and entertainment.

"So um...What kind of weapons do you use?"* - Tue Oct 27 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I use chakram. - Tue Oct 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh? That's new. I've never seen anyone with those before. - Tue Oct 27 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's definitely not common. - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So, why did you want to be a ninja? - Tue Oct 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I just wanted to get strong...so I wouldn't have to be scared. - Tue Oct 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ah. - Tue Oct 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Scared of what? - Tue Oct 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Dying. - Tue Oct 27 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Dying, huh? - Tue Oct 27 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Bypass death...with friendship? How does that work? - Tue Oct 27 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Friends protect you. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Everyone's got strength. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You got strong so that you could avoid death.... - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: People get strong to avoid death too... - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But when people have the same motives. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The same goals in mind. - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't they cooperate? - Tue Oct 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...Well...When you put it that way...Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's say I don't want to die. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And let's say you don't want to die. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And our chances of survival are x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You can be 1x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I can be 1x. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And let's add them. - Tue Oct 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: 1x plus 1x is 2x. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'd have double the survival. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Mm...Yeah, It makes more sense now. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I never thought of it like that before. - Tue Oct 27 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded, giving a genuine, light laugh this time. 

"Yeah."* - Tue Oct 27 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We should hang out more. - Tue Oct 27 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think we've got good synergy. - Tue Oct 27 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Really? - Tue Oct 27 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah? - Tue Oct 27 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I mean, listen to yourself. - Tue Oct 27 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: When we first met, you were all shy and shaking. - Tue Oct 27 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Now? Heh. - Tue Oct 27 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...You're right. - Tue Oct 27 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I didn't even notice... - Tue Oct 27 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's how synergy is. - Tue Oct 27 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You don't notice it. - Tue Oct 27 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It just happens. - Tue Oct 27 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's just like love in a way. You never notice that baby Cupid creeping up on you, but when you finally realize, he's already shot you once or twice. - Tue Oct 27 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) looked down for a moment, bringing her glass of water to her lips as she sipped it. She seemed to be blushing as she did so. When she set it down she of course swallowed hard.

"Mhm..I guess hanging out with you is a lot different from the others."* - Tue Oct 27 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Social Butterfly? Seems to fit you. - Tue Oct 27 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Aha. - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Really? - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Thanks. - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'll take it as a compliment. - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe next time we can hit up a hot springs. - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Or one of those classy restaurants. - Tue Oct 27 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Maybe. A hot spring sounds nice. - Tue Oct 27 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Then it'll be a date. - Tue Oct 27 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: A...date? - Tue Oct 27 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: A going out of two people. - Tue Oct 27 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I mean...I know what it is...I just.... - Tue Oct 27 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Didn't expect you to say that... - Tue Oct 27 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Why not? - Tue Oct 27 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Because we just met. - Tue Oct 27 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Tue Oct 27 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You go on dates to get to know someone, right? - Tue Oct 27 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I guess... - Tue Oct 27 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't worry. - Tue Oct 27 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think we're thinking date in two different ways, pal. - Tue Oct 27 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh....Yeah I think we are. - Tue Oct 27 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So. - Tue Oct 27 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Hot springs next time. - Tue Oct 27 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Then after that. - Tue Oct 27 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe we can go to a museum? - Tue Oct 27 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Mm...Sure. That'd be different. - Tue Oct 27 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh huh. - Tue Oct 27 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Different's what I normally like. - Tue Oct 27 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So, I'll see you some other time then. - Tue Oct 27 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yeah...Thanks for bringing me here. - Tue Oct 27 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: It was good. - Tue Oct 27 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh huh. - Tue Oct 27 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't mention it, Mai. - Tue Oct 27 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) stands as well, her eyes falling on Toudou. A light blush on her face as she smiled. 

"Until next time." She'd then take her leave afterwards, unless stopped of course..* - Tue Oct 27 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I just shinra-tensei'd the group - Sun Nov  1 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Bryson, ya have alot of work ahead of ya. - Sun Nov  1 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wonder If I should... No.... - Sun Nov  1 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) whispers: Yo, Mai. - Sun Nov  1 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) whispers: You want to go hang out? - Sun Nov  1 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) whispers: Sure. - Sun Nov  1 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: WHoever this girl is, she needs to end this now! - Sun Nov  1 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So where are we going this time. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The hot springs, right? - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go. - Sun Nov  1 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) followed Toudou to the hot springs, not even opposing his suggestion for the family bath since it only made sense considering they were to be together, not apart. She nodded at his suggestions.

"Fruit milk? Sure, that sounds pretty good."* - Sun Nov  1 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed as Toudou worked the vending machine, only responding with, "Banana."

After they'd gotten their beverage of choice, she followed him along to the family bath, "Right." * - Sun Nov  1 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) seemed to be entirely fine up until they got to the actual point of changing. Her observation of Toudou resulted in a blush from the girl but of course she shook it off eventually. Afterwards, she changed out her clothing for a towel, which she wrapped tightly around her own body, letting it cover the essentials.

"Of course."* - Sun Nov  1 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) followed Toudou's lead upon arrival. Her eyes peered down at the water before she eventually lowered herself in. It felt different to her, but relaxing nonetheless. Strange for her in reality though.

"No, but there's a first for everything."* - Sun Nov  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) laughed at Toudou's joke, finding some delight in his humor. When he came close, she blushed once again, but did nothing against it. It was a simple gesture, and she figured it meant nothing more. Attempting to keep their chat going, she simply spoke again.

"I wouldn't plan on it."* - Sun Nov  1 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...Well, I don't really use a lot of jutsu other than this one with my nails...It's kind of like a cat. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Oh. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well I use nails technically. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The nails of my chakram that is. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Think of it like throwing wheels at people. - Sun Nov  1 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I wish I could throw mine...But I think that'd probably hurt me too. - Sun Nov  1 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Haha. - Sun Nov  1 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah, don't throw your nails at me please, miss pussycat. - Sun Nov  1 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) smiled at him.

"You don't have to worry about that. I wouldn't try it."* - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Good, good. - Sun Nov  1 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So Mai, have you always lived in Sunagakure? - Sun Nov  1 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Mhm. I have. - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I see. - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Never been out of Suna, huh? - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's a vast world out there. - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Well, I left once...but the guy I left with abandoned me, so I just came back. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ah. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll go on a mission sometime, I'm sure. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You got a house then, in Sunagakure? - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Or do you live in that inn or something? - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I stay in the inn, I don't really have the money to afford my own place... - Sun Nov  1 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Sun Nov  1 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You can always stay at my place. - Sun Nov  1 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I live alone at home. - Sun Nov  1 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I get what pay I get from missions and bounty-hunting. - Sun Nov  1 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And I can pay the rent enough for the two of us. - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh really? You must get a lot then... - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I get my fair share of money, Mai. - Sun Nov  1 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm not a mafia overlord or anything though. - Sun Nov  1 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) laughed a bit at that, "I wouldn't suspect you of being one. You do seem like you work hard though."* - Sun Nov  1 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm a little bit lazy if I described myself. - Sun Nov  1 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Hm....I don't know, maybe once I get to know you better I may see it. - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sure, sure. - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So, what do you say to rooming with me? - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'll take the Fuuton and you can take the bed. - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll share the bathroom and you can cook dinner. - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think that's a nice living arrangement. - Sun Nov  1 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I like the sound of that. - Sun Nov  1 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Then it's already a deal. - Sun Nov  1 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's get out of the hot springs then. - Sun Nov  1 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Grab some fruit milk. - Sun Nov  1 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Dry ourselves off. - Sun Nov  1 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Head to my place. - Sun Nov  1 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded silently as she raised herself up from the hot spring, waiting upon Toudou as she neared the entrance to the changing room.* - Sun Nov  1 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) passes through, smiling at Toudou on the way in, "Thank you." Once she'd entered, she went to dry herself before doing anything else.* - Sun Nov  1 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) changed into her own clothing once she was dry. She'd never noticed Toudou's sly looks but proceeded to take up her fruit milk afterwards, eyeing it at first before oppening it. She did take a few sips before looking over to Toudou, waiting on him.

"This is great."* - Sun Nov  1 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded, following after Toudou. She was a bit excited to see his place.* - Sun Nov  1 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Sun Nov  1 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's nothing too big or fancy. - Sun Nov  1 07:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: This is pretty nice. - Sun Nov  1 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Better than your inn room probably, huh? - Sun Nov  1 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You'll be living here now. - Sun Nov  1 07:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Me? - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I take showers. - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I go to the bathroom to do my business every so often. - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And then I like cooking food in my spare time. - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Mainly meats. - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sound pretty average, now that I think about it. - Sun Nov  1 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yeah, it does. - Sun Nov  1 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: So...Is there anything else you wanted to do today? - Sun Nov  1 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) casts her hand out before her face, observing the soft backside of her hand. For a moment she does nothing with it, then with the application of chakra she allows each of her nails to extend, creating a set of claws. The second hand raised and she developed another set as well. While Mai stood there, she only observed her claws as she was still intrigued by her own skillset.* - Sun Nov  1 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) wandered the sands of Sunagakure as she looked for a place to hone her skills. She assumed that most traditional training posts would be overly crowded and believed her choice matter had to be one that was rather uncleanly. Eventually she came to the end of a sandy path and found herself looking over a large boulder. Her mouth a bit agape as she eventually stepped around it, eventually bringing up her right hand as she ejected a few claws from her hand, letting the ends of her finger nails extend before her eyes. Her lips curled and she eventually held a smile of innocence drawn on her face before bringing them forward to scratch the outer surface. A simple test, although it didn't seem like her tools had done much.* - Fri Nov  6 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) continued to attack the rock, now extending the nails of her left hand as she brought this one upwards. Her soft face looking directly at the solid stone before her before raising her arms upwards like a prowling cat. The rock, although large, had ultimately been the mouse in her mind. A mewl was released before she carried herself forward, plunging her claws into the side of the rock before looking it over, trying to see if she'd cut any deep.* - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) paused her actions as Rachetta approached, using strange dialect as she talked to her. Her claws had retracted and she simply glazed over the women with her eyes for a moment. She had no idea what her intentions could be but she believed it was better to respond than just gawk and stare at the woman like she did everyone else now that she was the focus.

"Y-Yes."* - Fri Nov  6 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) continued to observe while she remained still herself. Her eyes in reality did all the speaking without really enunciating. She took in the features of this woman standing just opposite of her, enjoying the difference between her and most of the population really. She made for an interesting person. "A little."* - Fri Nov  6 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) continued to observe momentarily, intrigued even more by the dialect and movements of her opposite. Eventually though she nodded and stepped forward, proceeding to extend her own hand to accept the fried chicken. It wasn't something she'd ever had before and she was unsure of why it was pulled from such a peculiar location but nonetheless, she remained respectful and complained over nothing. Her short response only being, "Thank you."* - Fri Nov  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) took a bite from the friend chicken, chewing it and eventually swallowing before speaking once again. "Oh...I-I was training."* - Fri Nov  6 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...My n-nails. - Fri Nov  6 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Nails? Gurrlll...Like mine? - Fri Nov  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed the change in the female before her with an expression of suprise. Her mouth opened a bit as she stared, not truly believing the sight she'd just seen. It was sort of like Mai's dream being achieved by someone else. At least somewhat. However, she realized what she was doing and shook her head a bit before speaking. "S-Sort of."* - Fri Nov  6 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) turned, observing the females display. She remained silent during such, finding that they both shared similarities when it came to the usage of their claws. "Y-Yeah."* - Fri Nov  6 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed the thick woman performing another technique. In place, a cat was summoned and Mai gawked once more. She had the hopes and dreams of stepping towards it to lay a single hand on it but thought against it. She didn't want to seem overly enthusiastic by the display and simply asked, "H-How did you do that...?"* - Fri Nov  6 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded, practically jumping at the chance to make a connection with the cat as she lowered herself. Her hands slowly caressing the soft fur of the cat and giving a tender and gentle touch as she did so. After a few seconds, her eyes returned to the summoner. "Summon...Type...Jutsu?"* - Fri Nov  6 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Yea gurl, I can make cats appear an' stuff. Like, they just appear yuse kno'...I don't kno' where theyse come from but theyse due. - Fri Nov  6 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Fri Nov  6 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: C-Can you...teach me that? - Fri Nov  6 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Ugh, sure why not. - Fri Nov  6 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded as she listened to the explanation, figuring that she should start with the contract first of course. Mai simply extended a single nail, allowing it to become a short claw as she brought it to prick one of her fingers for the moment. Afterwards, she took the blood that lingered on it and placed it on the document, assuming that was enough to sign it.

She gave a short exhale of breath afterwards before proceeding to use the handseals, having observed them before the signing took place. Typically Mai had no need for handseals, but her intrigue for knowledge made the display simple to her, allowing her to figure the handseals out with little trouble.

After completing the short series, she lowered herself to put her soft hand directly into the grainy sand, assuming that she'd done enough to perform the technique. Following her action, a cloud of smoke would take place and a single cat would appear before her, following a black gray color pattern.* - Fri Nov  6 08:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rachetta, DeyQuanda(ByeFelicia) says: Gurl, yuse a natural. - Fri Nov  6 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: T-Thank you. - Fri Nov  6 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed the female as she made an attempt at summoning another cat. As Mai stood there she excepted a rather large creature to take place, but rather it ended in the passing of DeyQuanda. The event causing Mai to take a step back, her eyes widening at the sight considering she had no idea what to do in a situation like this. This was quite literally the first death she'd seen firsthand rather than hearing about it from word to mouth.

A single hand raised and Mai held a palm over her mouth as she stared at the body shifting in the sand before settling. For the moment that Mai remained, she simply uttered several inconsistent sounds, almost like she was trying to speak but simply couldn't bring herself to the task. Regardless, she chose the action of turning and leaving the scene, assuming that someone would come along or she could tell someone what'd happened and have them take care of it.

The main thing she felt bad for was never learning the woman's name before her passing though.* - Fri Nov  6 08:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) gazed off into the distance as her mouth seemed to form a little O shape. With her eyes, she percieved the combined efforts of Koji and Yan moving to opress Leo. A single hand raised and eventually touched her chin, showing a pique in her curiosity. Although, she never did anything more than observe the few in the moment. She simply kept to herself, only wondering why they deemed the lone runner a threat.* - Fri Nov  6 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) continued to observe, still remaining conent with her choice of silence. Or so it seemed. In reality, she had a problem with hearing the word 'kill' repeatedly and proceeded to step forward. Moving rather slyly, or attempting to, she had the intent of placing herself within view of the three who seemed to be in control of the situation for now. She understood she was just a lowly genin but possibly a feminine appeal could sway the situation is all she thought.
