In an attempt to keep her attention focused elsewhere, she simply performed a few handseals.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) finds herself now accessing the Kuchiyose no Jutsu. Her hands simply move through the necessary handseals with very little trouble before eventually, her finger is pricked. A tooth is applied to do so. Following this, Mai presses this finger into the sand below and looks directly at the cat that took place before her.

Within a span of a few seconds, Mai was simply petting the cat.* - Sat Dec 12 22:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) put her hands through the process for the Kuchiyose no Jutsu technique. With ease, she weaved her hands throughout the seals, utilizing her teeth to prick open the thumb. Eventually she found her digit amongst the sand and a small cloud before herself. In place, a cat remained and it easily brushed against Mai, obviously showing the affection the two had between each other.

Her hand soon extended, petting the cat now.* - Sun Dec 13 19:59:44 2015
