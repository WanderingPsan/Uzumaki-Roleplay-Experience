<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Mon Oct 19 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Why come all the way out here? - Mon Oct 19 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tetsujin is someone I wouldn't want to fuck with. - Mon Oct 19 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...Is he...a bad guy? - Mon Oct 19 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Eh, it depends. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: On? - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: In someone elses eyes, he could be doing something good, or he could be doing something bad. Just depends. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: He also ate a large blade in one bite. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: It was hardcore as fuck.. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...I guess that makes sense. - Mon Oct 19 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Pick up that paper. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And use it for me. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded, her mouth still remaining agape a bit as she let her hands take the paper up and her eyes drift along it. Typically, she used paper to write or draw on, but she recognized a slight difference with this paper, and therefore applied her chakra to it. A sigh released from her body and her control allowed a sliver of her own chakra seep into the paper. The result, causing it to smolder and ignite into a flame, resting between her hands before she allowed it to drift away into the sand beneath her.* - Mon Oct 19 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Mhm...Katon. - Mon Oct 19 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 19 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Looks like I can teach you after all. - Mon Oct 19 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) thinks: Good...I chose correctly. - Mon Oct 19 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm.. - Mon Oct 19 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright, let's get going then. - Mon Oct 19 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) had of course followed behind Hideki, feeling a bit more comfortable in the man's stead now. As she carried herself, she seemed to make a few sounds, resembling that of a cat. It seemed more like these were rather impromptu and she couldn't really control such a thing. Regardless, a half-smile stayed drawn on her face while they traveled.* - Mon Oct 19 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She makes cat noises.. - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What the fuck. - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Could she be a lycanthrope? - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What fire techniques do you know? - Mon Oct 19 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ....None. - Mon Oct 19 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) raised her head and her eyes began to track along Hideki's form, observing as he began a set of handseals. Her observations allowed her to catch sight of each one, especially considering the reduced speed. A simple nod came from her and she returned a response. "I think I can do that..."

Following her words, she stepped up, facing the region of presentation and allowing her hands to access the handseals needed for the technique. Of course she did these slowly at first, attempting to get them down correctly for the most part. Meanwhile, she did prepare chakra for usage and eventually let it flare, bursting into a heat in her gut. Afterwards, she opened her mouth, making an attempt to pass the chakra from within to the outside world, yet seemed to fail in this, a flame coming out as a sort of belch.

A hand came to her mouth and a blush across her face. Her eyes tracked over to Hideki for a second, and then she made another attempt. Withholding more chakra inside of her body, she let her hands access the handseals, having a better hang on them now. After inhaling, she then exhaled, letting flames creep from within her and roll out across the the ground before her, spreading until they came to make a full circle, yet it was obvious that her attempt wasn't on par with Hideki's.* - Mon Oct 19 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed Hideki now as he sat there. Her eyes seemed to take in the shape and form of the man. Without any real background information, she could tell he'd been through some things. A moment of silence before she broek free, asking a simple question. "Is it safe to assume you're not from Sunagakure?"* - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I am from Sunagakure. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: You are? - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yep. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Strange...You don't seem like the rest. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I travel a lot. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I figured. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was a Sunagakure Genin, then a Kumogakure Jounin.....Then I became the Hokage of Konohagakure, to where I left. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And now I travel the world. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...Ho...kage? You were...the Hokage? - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Assassin241) says: Yep.. - Mon Oct 19 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...That's...Impressive. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Eh.... - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was suppose to be the Raikage....But they didn't want an emotionally unstable shinobi as their leader. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So I left. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...I'm sorry to hear that...You don't seem emotionally unstable to me. - Mon Oct 19 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I've been through a lot....Uh....What's your name? I never caught it. - Mon Oct 19 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh. My name is Mai. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nice to meet you, name's Hideki. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Nice to meet you too Hideki. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But anyway, I've been through a lot. Seen a lot of deaths. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Been pretty hard. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) had of course noticed Hideki's movements, assuming it was their time to leave. Therefore, Mai let herself follow afer the male, not even opposing the movement from the sand that she called home. Travel would've been necessary sooner or later.* - Mon Oct 19 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) stood by Hideki's side, allowing her hands to remain behind her back as she rocked back and forth on the ball of her feet and the tips of her toes. Her eyes seemed to track over the water, a disturbing feeling coming over her as she looked down upon the liquid. A fear drawing out over the girl, but only a minor one.* - Mon Oct 19 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Something wrong...? - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I'm...Just not a big fan of water. That's all. - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Come to think of it, you seem to resemble a cat.. - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You make cat noises....And not a fan of water. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you a lycanthrope? - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: A lycanthrope? No. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: They're just some habits I picked up... - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: This is very tame...compared to Sunagakure. - Mon Oct 19 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's not as hot. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So, tell me a bit about yourself, Mai. - Mon Oct 19 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...Well there's not much to be honest... - Mon Oct 19 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nothing interesting? - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No boyfriends? No Friends? No Family? - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ---- - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: N-No.... - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Any unique abilities? - Mon Oct 19 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um... - Mon Oct 19 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I can...use my nails for jutsu...Does that...count? - Mon Oct 19 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Of course. - Mon Oct 19 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Ah...Alright then. - Mon Oct 19 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed the clone technique for a bit. Afterwards, Mai took a seat upon the ground, finding herself to grow a bit tired herself, well, tired of standing at the least. In response, she allowed herself to draw forth a single finger, extending it towards the ground before applying a bit of her own chakra. The result, a single nail extending into a long sharp needle like tool.

Mai had easily begun to draw in the dirty with this.* - Mon Oct 19 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: By the way. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Hm? - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you don't feel safe around me, or in this general area. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Up north will be Konohagakure. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I think I'll be fine with you. - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) continued to let her single claw move throughout the dirt, finding it rather hard to keep a sharp point on the tool. Her eyes trailed along the edge, watching herself pick up dirt along it. However, she could care less, allowing herself to continue drawing out the shape upon the ground. It seemed she was creating the face of a cat in the ground before her.* - Mon Oct 19 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) still had her single claw dug into the earth below, letting it drag throughout and make a shift within the surface of the Earth. While she understood that this place was more than likely subject to being attacked, she had no care and allowed the face she drew to shift into a map of sorts, almost as if she was drawing house blueprints.* - Mon Oct 19 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) found herself waking, still within the same spot as before. The rush of the river behind her led her to believe that she must've passed out whilst drawing in the dirt with her claws. A loud yawn and she was soon on her hands and toes, allowing herself to crawl from one position to the next. A cat-like meow escaped her throat and she let her own eyes cascade the area for Hideki.

Yet, he was nowhere to be found.

Then, Mai recalled his words, remembering the village of Konohagakure being to the North of her position. A moment of pause and she found herself squatting, her long, luxurious hair patting against the ground as she projected a single claw from the tip of her finger and allowed it to inscribe a message upon the ground should Hideki return and find her gone.

With that, she'd come back to a full stand, eventually slinking down into her cat-like pose and run across the ground, making her way along the bank of the river in hopes of finding a bridge if possible. Otherwise, she'd have no like and would probably find herself returning to the initial point.* - Mon Oct 19 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) approached the great doors of Konohagakure, finding her cat-like movements to come to a sitting position, or rather a squat of sorts. Eventually, her knees touched the ground and she sat there astonished, her same look of astonishment setting on her face. Her mouth sat agape and eventually began to water at the thought of people with great power being behind the massive walls.

With that, she began to creep her way in, making it past the gates of course and heading for the massive building that could normally be seen by all.* - Mon Oct 19 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) approached the gates of Sunagakure, or rather, the walls, considering there wasn't really a door for such things. As Mai stood there, her hands came together, beginning to twiddle her thumbs as she looked at the guards. A mewling sound seemed to draw out from the female as she looked the two over, wondering how to establish her wish.* - Tue Oct 20 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observes the female as she touched down. Mai's wide eyes opened, and she continued to observe the females form. As she stood there, a blush of nervousness crossed her face and she still proceeded to mewl. Obviously unsure of how to initiate conversation at this point. "

"U-Um..."* - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hi there. You uhm...Want in? - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Or something? - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Y-yes. - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm? - Tue Oct 20 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded silently, making her approach through the gates. Her hands continuing to twist around each other, another sign of her nervous appeal.* - Tue Oct 20 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: You sir, are a foundation of youth, something I wish to become in due time! - Tue Oct 20 20:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: .... - Tue Oct 20 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) proceeded to walk forward, attempting to go deeper into the village. A light wave was given to Izutora.

"U-Um...Bye..."* - Tue Oct 20 21:18:43 2015

Just like every day it seemed, only difference being this one seemed only to be about half the normal size of their raves. Mai's hands came together and allowed herself to begin fidgetting with her fingers a bit, twiddling her thumbs. She was obviously a bit nervous. A mewl came from her before she proceeded to ask,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) allowed her own hand to extend, accepting Izutora's now as she returned the motive. Of course, she'd also heard the offer  Saeza, finding hers to be rather calm, of course, compared to Izutora's at the least. She found herself appreciating the feminine appeal better and proceeded to slink away after Saeza and Susumu instead, simply stuttering out a reply, "S-Sorry."* - Thu Oct 22 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) stood there amongst the training yard now observing both Saeza and Susumu's practice of course, considering it -was- the one she was invited to look over.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 22 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed the two, finding that there was a lot less taijutsu than she had expected. If anything, it was simple, basic, academy level taijutsu in her eyes.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes ma'am. - Thu Oct 22 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Very well...Do you have any basic taijutsu ability? Such as what's taught in your academy? - Thu Oct 22 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Yes, I only know what they taught me really. - Thu Oct 22 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Very well...I guess I can teach you some basic taijutsu techniques. And when you're ready, you can learn some stronger ones. I don't know very many advanced techniques, but you can always learn from one of the powerful taijutsu users in the village. - Thu Oct 22 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Alright. Anything will help really. - Thu Oct 22 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) observed Saeza now as she seemed to begin teaching. Mai's eyes followed along Saeza's form while she listened to the girl's words. A nod after the initial explanation of the technique, and she now took place against the wall. A sigh and she simply stated, "I believe I can do that."

With a push off the wall, Mai was rushing forward, sprinting a few feet ahead of the start position before lifting up into the air, performing a jump. Mid-air, she attempted to extend her leg and let it reach outwards, trying to imitate Saeza's form. However, it was rather obvious her strike lacked the power Saeza exhibitted.* - Thu Oct 22 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm...Close... - Thu Oct 22 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Try to build up speed -before- you perform the jump. - Thu Oct 22 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) moved back to her initial spot, understanding that she had missed a few points required to execute the technique perfectly. Of course, she took in Saeza's words of guidance, attempting to adjust. Rather than moving at such a slow pace, she picked up her speed, trying to move a bit faster before making her leap. However, with her focus being more or less upon the speed, her jump came late and couldn't extend her leg.

Another attempt began of course, Mai simply moving back to where she had started and allowing herself a moment of pause, breathing a little bit before entering another sprint. Moving forward, she found herself making the sprint and jump combination. Yet, it was the extension of her leg that left a somewhat sloppy impression, considering it appeared to be too high of a kick.

Exhaling now as she returned to the beginning once again, Mai found herself gaining a silent sense of confidence as she accessed her speed again. Running forward, it seemed that Mai leapt into the air, extending her leg in the right formation and of course, got brought forward via the momentum of her own strike. Once she was on her feet again, she turned to look at Saeza, "How was that?"* - Thu Oct 22 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Ooooo what was that? - Thu Oct 22 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That was great! - Thu Oct 22 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hey saeza. - Thu Oct 22 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) smiled a bit, feeling a bit proud of herself for doing so well.

"Thanks."* - Thu Oct 22 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That's good...Now....Try it on me. - Thu Oct 22 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) was taken by suprise a bit as Saeza wished for Mai to utilize the technique against her, but figured it would be good practice. Exhaling a bit, she began to rush forward, running directly for Saeza before picking a good point to leap off at. Now as Mai moved forward, she raised her right leg, aiming to make some sort of connection with Saeza of course.* - Thu Oct 22 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) found her target gone, or rather, dodging her attempt at the Dynamic Entry technique. Something expected of the teacher of course. Yet, she hadn't expected the kick that would suspend her in the air, leaving Mai to sit there mid-air like prey to Saeza.* - Thu Oct 22 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Wow, didn't know you could do that. - Thu Oct 22 06:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Really?  How your turtle friends? - Thu Oct 22 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pretty good. I ain't chat them up in about a week, though. - Thu Oct 22 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Can I have one? - Thu Oct 22 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: A turtle. . ? - Thu Oct 22 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: No a shell. - Thu Oct 22 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It helps with speed and stamina right? - Thu Oct 22 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mai(Fat Trel) nodded after listeneing to Saeza, understanding what she had meant. It surely didn't appear like a technique you could just train in the middle of nowhere. Mai had now begun to participate in trying her hand at the technique--or rather her foot. Stepping forward, she tried to use the upward kick against Saeza, however, failing in the effect that she didn't move the female at all.

A second attempt was started and Mai found herself moving in again to attempt the technique again. Closing in, Mai extended her leg to perform the upward kick yet strayed from the necessary target, not gaining the same effect and removing balance rather than suspending the female in the air. Therefore, another attempt was made once again.

In this attempt, Mai extended her leg, performing the upward kick against Saeza once again. With this kick however, she hit the right point, sending the girl up into the air for the float maneuver, yet, Mai failed on her imitation part, finding the situation resetting once more before exhaling a single breath.

Going in once again, Mai found herself repeating the same old kick manuever, looking for her chance to complete the overall technique. This attempt began with the upwards kick and then followed afterwards with Mai leaping in to copy her float. But finding herself at a loss for what to do afterwards seemed to bring it to an end, especially when the 'float' hadn't lasted too long.

Now figuring she could go for one more, final attempt, Mai looked at Saeza with determination in her eyes as she proceeded to move in and deliver a kick once again. Following this, she seemed to float in space behind Saeza, choosing to make a grapple as the final step, and a throw of course. Yet, with the difference in skill-level between them both, Mai didn't expect her attempts to do much.* - Thu Oct 22 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! Yeah, I got ya. - Thu Oct 22 06:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: But you said a turtle first.  Is that even possible? - Thu Oct 22 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I mean to give away a turtle? - Thu Oct 22 06:13:20 2015

Now as Mai arrived, she casted her vision to the addressed problem, and her eyes seemed to droop and her legs stopping as she observed.

Of course as Mai looked at the dead body, she could only think of how this refers to her own safety. She knew people within Sunagakure liked to get rowdy and do some crazy things, but she never expected blood to be spilled amongst the sands. Her jaw dropped a bit, showing her suprise of course.

Of course however she did attempt to keep her thoughts to herself, attempting to remain as a 'background character' within the village matters. It was better for her safety.* - Sat Oct 24 00:05:32 2015
