<br><font color=yellow>*Lance(Guest-699203328) walks from his home in the south of Amegakure for his daily exercise. "This is going to be a rough one." The boy says as he grabs his bokken and weights before leaving out of the door. He holds the things close to him and heads to the west. Izaya was the son of a blacksmith and a baker. His mother was the personal blacksmith to the whole of the village before her death and a powerful sword weilder. His father was a top-class chef, though he retired after an incident that occured during his younger years; he now simply bakes in his free time.

Izaya carries the things all the way to the river to the far west of Amegakure. "This is it." He says as he places the weights on the ground. He sits down and stares at the water for a few moments before shaking his head. "Time to get it together." Izaya places two straps to both of his legs and then puts two on his arms. He takes small slabs of iron from the bag he was carrying. "Fifteen in each." He says as he takes the mini slabs and places them into the bands on his arms and legs.

The weights in the wristbands and anklebands weigh him down a rather noticible amount. They slow his movements and force him to work harder to complete every move. "Alrighty.." The boy remarks as he walks over to his bokken. Bending over and picking it up, Izaya nearly falls over. "Gosh, I have been out of it." He says as he brings the bokken above his head. "Chya! Chya! Chya!" he says as he swings it over and over. Izaya's body is jarred slightly with the effort of each swing but he doesn't allow that to slow him down.

Izaya keeps one leg out in front of the other as he brings the sword down over and over. He is attempting to better his stance. The boy is in training to become a ninja, he aims to become a helpful citizen in his village. After the civil war, his country became mired by debt. There was no way the county would be able to survive without everyone putting in their fair share. Izaya wasn't very good at smithing like his mother, and he could never cook like his father, so being a ninja was all he really could do.

His parent were both ninja but neither of them was a very traditional ninja. His father was a medic who used his culinary talents in his work. His mother was a refugee from a war that had occured way before his time. There was a group of Samurai that were basically demolished, she is the child of their leader. She was left homless and destitute. She was found and adopted by a family who was from Amegakure. They took her in and raised her as their own.

Izaya's arms begin to burn as he brings the sword down for the one-hundred and fiftieth time. "Gah.." He says as he brings it down one last time. He then sticks it into the ground, point first. "Now I have to practice running." He says as he goes over to his bag. He pulls out a canister with water in it, drinking deeply from it he sighs. "Push-ups first." Izaya says as he lays down flat on the ground. He gets into a push-up stance and begins to work at it. "One, two, three...." He says as he works his body.

Izaya's mother and father at first didn't want their son to go into the military. They felt that it would be entirely too dangerous, especially since some places were still being contested after the civil war. They didn't want to lose their son. After his fifteenth birthday though, their opinion on the situation changed after he began to train by himself. He would steal metal baubles from his father's shop to use as weights and bokken from his mother's study. He did everything he could to train his body and mind to become a shinobi.

Nearly two weeks after his birthday he told his mother and father that he had enrolled himself in the Ninja academy. At first they were extremely angered with him. He was in a great deal of trouble and suffered for it for it for a while. One night, Izaya's mother woke him up at three in the morning. She took him out into the forest and threw a bokken at him. "If you want to be a shinobi, then defend yourself." Was the only thing she said to him before she attacked. 

Izaya's mother was amazing. She didn't leave any room for error. She quickly swung her sword, keeping her feet moving the whole time. The only thing Izaya could do was watch and attempt to defend himself as his mother came at him with a real, steel blade. He had no idea how she expected him to survive. For the first few seconds Izaya attempted to deflect her blows but realized it would be futile. She swung the blade once and shattered the bokken. "How do you expect to become a shinobi....If you can't even beat your own mother." She remarked to him as she swung her sword one last time. In doing so she knocked the piece of the bokken in his hand into the air, knocked him down, and left a ratehr large cut across his face from his right cheek up across his right eye and to his forehead. 

"I will become a shinobi!" Izaya says as his hair suddenly flares upwards from his body and his clothes begin to ripple. His chakra flowing around him in visible arcs. "H-Damn....I wasn't counting on this." Izaya's Mother says as he flicks the blood from the sword and stares down her son. Izaya's body language completely changes as the chakra dissappears. He stands there staring at his mother. His eyes are crimson red and his hair is now running down his back. "Mother...You attempted to keep me chained away...Why is that?" Izaya says in a voice that isn't his own.

"Damn..." Izaya's mother says as she drops her sword into the ground. She makes a ram seal and begins to focus her chakra ."I should have known this was going to happen...Why didn't we make that seal stronger.." She says as she stares at her son. Izaya was no longer himself, his consciousness was forced back, deep within his mind. He was now under the control of another person. His brother, Rikkuyo. "Mother, you tried to seal me into Izaya, you should have known the twerp wouldn't be able to handle me." He says as Izaya seemingly dissappears.

He comes back into view directly in front of his mother and smirks, his face mere centimetres from hers. "Why do you not love me mother...." He says simply before his face contorts evily. He quickly spins his body, kicking her through the air. He reappears directly where she was to land and kicks her upwards. "Die." He says as he makes several handseals. "Raito-" He begins to say before he is suddenlly cut off. Izaya's father had slipped in from seemingly nowhere, his hands covered in chakra. "Why my son......." He says placing his hands upon Izaya/Rikkuyo's back. "Good night..." He says as he surges his chakra.

The boy's body contorts violently as he drops to the ground. "Kirie..." The man says as he walks over to his wife's body. She was barely alive, the kick her son had performed had shattered her ribs and broken her spine. "I-ikuro...." She says as she lays there, blood dripping from her mouth. "W-we must seal him...Further...But...I fe-I fear I won't live through this...U-use my life fource...To finish this." She says to her husband. 

With tears in his eyes Ikuro picks up his son and carries him over to the side of his wife. "I love you...Kirie." He says as he performs several handseals. Upon completing the seals he places a hand on both his wife and his son. His wife's life fource was literally converted to chakra and pushed through the jutsu. The energies that made up Rikkuyo began to coalesce to a single points. "Forbidden Sealing Technique: Second Person Seal." Ikuro says as his elder son was sealed back into his younger child, this time he was forced deep into Izaya's subconscious mind. He was seemingly placed inside of a barrel which was then covered by chains and rooted deep within a chamber, deep within Izaya's mind. 

"May you never find your way out..." Ikuro says as he grabs onto his wife's hand. He stares into her eyes as the lights in them go out and her life ceases. "Kirie!" He roars as he leans forwards onto her and cries heavily. 

That night was a long time ago, none of it was remember by Izaya. He was told by his father that his mother had left him. Ikuro never showed Izaya where she had been buried deep within the woods, had never told his son about his brother whom was buried deep within his subconscious. The monster that dwelled within. 

Izaya finishes his pushups and sighs. He packs his weights and bokken up and stands at the ready. "Egh, I was going to do more...But I'm pooped! I wonder what dad has cooked!" Izaya says as he runs back towards the village, in hopes a warm meal made by his father.**
