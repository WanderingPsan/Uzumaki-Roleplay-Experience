<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jubei(Parris111) allows the veins on the side of his eyes to protrude. His right leg coming to a stop before his person, dropped low, his left hand inclining slightly. His right hand shifts forward, the opening of his Gentle Fist stance coming to frutition. He lunges forth his speed very impressive for someone of his rank. He intends an open palmed strike towards Lyric's torso in the attempt to stop the fight just as quickly as it started.* - Fri Sep 25 00:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jubei(Parris111) retracts his attacking hand, it would be possible for Lyric to continue fighting. Jubei had only struck one node but internal damage had been dealt already. Nothing that was serious - he did avoid hitting the pancreas and instead ventured into the intestine. His opponents outcry was something he did not care for in the slightest. He intends his arm forth once more, his heavily bandaged digits finding the boy's shoulder if he didn't move.

If he connected the boy's shoulder would've been dislocated as a result. 
"Keep fighting."* - Fri Sep 25 00:46:04 2015

Perhaps this was one of the few times Jubei's face would soften. His hand comes to a stop over the boy's shoulder, this time however he corrects the injury instead of causing one. "I apologize..." * - Fri Sep 25 00:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jubei(Parris111) says: So, Hideki.. How about a spar? - Fri Sep 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jubei(Parris111) ironically, Jubei could keep up with Hideki even in his form. However, there was a part of him that was truly wondering how he was able to change his form. What he thought to be a human was clearly not so, so, it was fair to say he'd have no reservations going the hardest he could against his opponent. The boy quickly moves out of the way of the charge while extending his palm forth, attempting to catch the Snake on his side.* - Fri Sep 25 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jubei(Parris111) <What is he doing?> Jubei's optic nerves constantly fed his brain information. His synapses flashed vibrantly, coordinated muscle movement giving the male an aura of grace.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) ||The youthul male known as Kojiro was killed in battle against the infamous Speedstar. His memories, who he was, and were ripped away, fading into obscurity. The necromancers vile energies seep into his pores and rip what vestige of vitality that remained. No part of his body was spared, her prowess in the arts of neromancy changing him from the inside out. His entire digestive system changing along with his muscle fibers. The essence of death now holding control over flesh. 

Monstrous noises resonate from his body at this point. It wasn't likely that he felt pain, but the process of being turned into a harbinger of death itself was a gruesome process. In the end he raises, three words leaving his mouth.

"What...... Is.........This......?"
His ghastly utterance was enough to turn milk sour.* - Sat Oct 10 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) says: I apologize lol - Sat Oct 10 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) <Rebirth?> 

No, Kojiro knew nothing of his past, and knew nothing about the lady that stood before him.

He looks at his hand, and see's the riddled appendage, and then back to the ladies flesh that was without flaw.

"Tell me..... What.... What am I? Who are you?"* - Sat Oct 10 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) could feel the encroaching darkness descend upon him. Her power was great, and he knew their situation from here on out would be nothing more than him fulfilling her every whim. He was simply a tool to be used at her leisure. One would think that would work againt her, the fact that she commanded him in such a manner but they would be wrong.

The fact is Kojiro didn't know any better. It came with having his memory scrubbed, his loyalty to this woman had been a combination of chance and careful planning, and due to the fact she had done this in an isolated area it made it all the more convincing, not that he had any questions.

"I serve....." His voice is cut, the energy she used against him actually causing him to tremble.

He falls on his knees.
"You... Master..."* - Sat Oct 10 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) If there was one word to describe Kojiro's physical power, and durability it could be described as lacking. He hadn't really been alive long enough to train his body against the shinobi world properly, and it showed as he attempts to slam his foot against the mountain side beneath his feet. <Not strong enough....>
 
But, he accelerates on the rock-face, the rocks were actually unable to tear into his feet and he was actually fairly capable spped wise. He slows, his feet crushing the rocks at his feet, the dust settles. 

"...This is all I have."* - Sat Oct 10 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) <..> There wasn't really any reaction given to her when she asked for his name, but it did make him curious.

<You created me, why are you asking for my na-.. Second life...> Not really important to be honest. He wasn't the smartest, moreso now because he was nothing more than a ghoul.

Inadequate, indeed.
He was nothing more than a walking simpleton, but perhaps that would change in time.* - Sat Oct 10 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) is still holding her. His mind was one dimensional at this point, he didn't really know too much, but the gaps provided enough for him to get a general idea of where he was going. He stops, decayed feet nearly tumbling over themselves as he saw the human.

"Grrr."
Sub-vocalized growls emit from his core, his body is poised to fight at a seconds notice, but he would not attack.
Without permission.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) moves quickly, far quicker than most could react. He didn't care about being injured, he couldn't be killed conventionally. His right hand shoots out with immense force , a fist rushing to slam against his temple, hopefully his movement speed was more than enough to confuse him. He also stood into account the direction he was currently standing.

* - Sat Oct 10 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) <Heh...> In reality Kojiro could've eaten the hit by chose against hit. His mind was still partially sentient and he would avoid damage where he could. "Nuh." He aimes to slip his arm through the hole through the base of the windmill, and pull it free using his strength as a mean's to pry it from his hands, if he is able to do this he would use it in the attempt to slam the projectile into his windpipe.* - Sat Oct 10 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: How powerful is he. .? - Sat Oct 10 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: One is an undying ghoul ..  The other is a mere man. He cannot be outlasted. - Sat Oct 10 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) <...His body..> Kojiro certainly wasn't able to really do any sort of damage at this point.. "Die..." His voice comes off lower than before, its essence saturated with vehemence.  He dashes to the side, pivoting away from the strike aimed at his knee.

<He is slow....> The windmill spins while in the course of his palm, and he attempts to push his body against the wall, using the projectile to secure him if he was hit.

Using this make-shift wedge, if possible he uses his powerful muscles to keep the force up.

The small of carrion no doubt filling the male's nostrils.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) "-." Kojiro was about to pounce, but no there was no need for that. It seemed his master had that under wraps, so, with this he aims to gouge the shuriken wielding Lycan's eyes out. It was true that one could train certain portions of their body, but much like he bled when he bit his tongue he attempts to strike a portion which he thought would also be exposed.

The thin membranes on the eye were subject to breaking easily, but perhaps not it was all a matter of chance.* - Sat Oct 10 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) moves once more, it didn't matter. He aimed to grasp the man's wrist with his left hand to stop his movement, while in the same time with his right he aims to take his eye regardless of his protest. It didn't really matter to him in the slightest, he saw humor in this situation. How quickly sharp toungues were dulled by the threat of death, and with a potential death, a potental meal.

He begins to salivate black matter.* - Sat Oct 10 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) the hand would sink into his eye-socket, he didn't care. There wa no pain, there was nothing at all. 

He was a zombie, and as such these sorts of injuries were not really much to slow his progress. He aims to dig his fingers into the male's eye-sockets even more- attempting to penetrate any flesh he could.

His other hand reaching for his neck in the attempt to hold him fast.* - Sat Oct 10 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Kojiro(Parris111) <Blood...........> The sight of it was something that the Zombie loved. It drove him mad, he aims to pull out whatever matter he could out of the already exposed flesh, and perhaps drag into his mouth, he cared not for the man's pain. He was no longer human, and so all of this was nothing more than another meal, nothing more, nothing less.. 

He had to feast afterall.
