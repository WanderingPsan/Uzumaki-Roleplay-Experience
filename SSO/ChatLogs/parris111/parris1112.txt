<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||The scene is set perfectly. It seemed like this settlement would be a nice place to set up. The entrance leading into the Land Of Grass was open, the gate itself was guarded by two burly looking men with swords in their hands. They looked to be your typical run of the mill bandits who did nothing more than to exploit peoples pain.

"Eyo, two dandy mutherfeckers in the distance. The first bandit grips his sword and heaves it over his shoulder. "I'm gunna have some laughs takin you down." 

Both of them charge with their weapons in half, intent on cleaving the two Kumogakure shinobi where they stood.

[Tier 2 Speed, Tier 3 Kenjutsu]
One for each man.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5FeKFKLvwA
"Fuck, gurhugah!" The first guard is impaled, Eiji certainly had the advantage of range at his side, so too, did Takuma. But alas, that was only one down, the other bandit skillfully evaded the shoots rising out of the ground. 

"Heh, feck you." The male twirls the blade to expose the sun's radiance towards his line of sight. From there he attempts to execute a snap-kick localized in the direction of the Kiriaski's abdomen.

If one were to pay note to their surroundings, they'd note faint whimpers playing in the foreground.

It seemed to come from one of main-buildings which was the Warlord's base of operations.

Upon hearing this tune the bandit becomes scared for his life, he drops his weapon and runs away. Yes, this battle had alerted someone, or something.

"La, La, La, La, La..."
"Fe, Fe, Fe, Fe, Fe,"
"Ma,Ma,Ma,Ma,Ma..."

Whatever was taking place in that building was sinister.
The building was three stories. 

There was a door leading into the building on the first floor, and windows for the second and third. 

What would they do?
* - Mon Nov 23 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||The Bandit had fallen to their combo, for such a lavish, yet morbid building it seemed the grunts were very weak. "V-vile...." The giant gash in the males chest destroyed his cavity. His ribs were outside of his dermis, protruding outwards like mighty poles.

He was on the brink of death.

"V-vile..." 
Why would he tell them anything now that he was dying? 
"Rguh." He vomits blood - his vision gradually darkens.

How would they continue?
"The singing never stops. In-fact several voices seem to resonate in unison."
"The door is open...."

Takuma would see the door open.
Eiji would see it closed.* - Mon Nov 23 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||Eiji had been saved by his previous injury. Due to the pain in his abdomen he was able to resist the Genjutsu, even if he hadn't known of it's manifestation. Takuma, however was a different story, upon him attempting to reach it, if he continued with his action a metal prong would extend from the base of the door meant to rip through his head like a knife through butter.

This Genjutsu was subtle, the trigger being the voice of those who spoke, and they were able to suggest things, although it was confined to realism. The advantage would be lost if they still survived.

<That was sure to have killed them...>

But alas, it also extended far enough to strike Eiji as well, if he were not careful. But this only seemed to be a one way trick, as the voice falls deaf after this. 

There is activity in the building at this point, the man in the top floor begins to descend.

He is now at the second level.
* - Mon Nov 23 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||The male makes his way to the first floor, and then the entrance.
"For Takeichi.."
He mutters lowly under his breath.
The male glances at both Takuma, and Eiji.. He fit the descriptions in his report, a balding man who wore a leather carapace around his torso. 

The male extends his arms downwards in time for the senbon to go flying , about four spin in the air, as if it was undergoing an act of stasis, then the male caught the descending projectiles with the edges of his fingers and fired four of them towards Takuma's chest. 

He had already noted Eiji's injury, and he assumed he was out of the game, assumptions were bad, weren't they?* - Mon Nov 23 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) <No. .. . I ...> The mud-balls ended the females life just as quickly as her entrance. The Henge transformation is broken upon impact, of course it would be revealed that their target was a child. She couldn't have been over Thirteen years old.

Perhaps if they had paid attention to detail they would've noticed the discrepancy.

'For Takeichi..' 

Why would they say that if they were the man in question?

"It seems my hand has been forced.." The male on the top floor mutters as he looks out the tinted window.

"You've served me well, children.. But for now I must take my leave.."
He takes this time to push on the windows exterior, and walk along it's surface, after he's running across the surface of the building he jumps away out sight, hopefully.

Perhaps if one of them had refined sight they'd spot him?* - Mon Nov 23 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) ||<Fuck..> The male attempts to accelerate, he hadn't counted on his target being able to see him. His strengths relied on converting the children he had harvested from certain individuals to be the perfect tools for slaughter.

He didn't want to get in close-quarters combat with these shinobi.
"Hmph. Die." He mutters from a distance as he throws a knife in his attackers direction, upon his elevation. It was aimed at his torso as he rode his descent. 

<I can't let them take me..> Eiji would be upon him if he was able to defend against this.
* - Mon Nov 23 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) <No...> The male simply continues to run, as he deems it possible to elude them at this point.

It was all on Takuma now. 

He didn't know what was to come now, perhaps he would escape?

Perhaps he would not. 

This was resting on the Gingers hands now.* - Mon Nov 23 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hidomori Takeichi(Parris111) || Hounsenka worked really well for what it had to do. The male is burned on contact and tumbles over in agony. This time however there was no ending of his transformatiaona. He was the real deal, as he descends from the skies like a mighty corckscrew rippling into the Earth, he is reminded that he was a monster, and that his creations, namely those children would welcome him into hell.

The snap of his neck ended his life.
He was now home.* - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015

Everything in the roam was meant to force him into his shell. The walls themselves were black, even the shackles around his arms and legs were of the same obsidian make. This was to ensure he lost all concept of time, night and day? No, he had no idea of the date or anything for that matter. He simply existed, and living like an animal was sure to bring out his inner-beast.

"Do you mean literally free? Or is this another tric-." His voice his cut off, the metallic chains that run around his wrist rattle as he reaches for her neck with his right hand. 

Though he couldn't manage it.

His irides transition from their lavender composition to a distinct green finish.
"Time to start killing."

He had to get a fair bit of distance from them however, lest someone be caught in the cross fire.* - Fri Dec  4 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Twelve(Parris111) doesn't make a sound. He was intent on just ending lives, he didn't care for who in particular. If anything, this was just his way of getting back at the world for his own misfortune, it was said misery loved company and it was true. 

He just keeps moving forward.* - Sat Dec  5 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Twelve(Parris111) ||Perhaps this would be the first time he would be able to show-case his ability to the others. Stand back. Twelves hands come together and a very heavy fog drifts from the corner of his mouth, it practically engulfs several members in a matter of seconds. Those who inhaled the toxin started to undergo horrific suffering.

With enough time they wouldn't even be able to move, and prolonged exposure meant certain death.

"I've got this.." Is all he muttered.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Twelve(Parris111) was currently engulfed in some sort of velvet fog. Though, when he surfaces from the plum of despair he walks forth unharmed, and indifferent.

So, the Kush wished to provide a 'crutch' in their plans? Well, so too would Twelve, his feet crossing the flanks of those he was working with, he strafes, and instantly there is a back-lash, a dreary fog rebounds and would be upon them at this moment.

He'd unknowingly provide a means to fuck the child's plan over if he went through with his next step. This also would most likely eradicate any hopes of advance for their attackers.

The only word coming from Twelves mouth however, had been.

"Move."* - Sat Dec  5 01:22:20 2015
