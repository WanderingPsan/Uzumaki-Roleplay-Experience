<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would follow the others awkwardly. He had never met these people and they just decided to invite him for training. He followed them into the basement, heard the locking of the door, and thought "Eh, maybe training is a private thing for them?"

When he got down and looked around, he noticed all the corpses and blood and everything and needless to say, he isnt like everyone else. He found this a bit disturbing, in a paranoia kinda way. What if this is a setup? What if he's next? What if he's just fabricating all these  bodies? What if they were just already dead?

He didnt say anything and tried to hide his feelings about all of this, particularly because he didn't like to offend people, although sometimes he did it without realizing. He wasn't too thrilled on the whole of the venture, but there was still the chance of making friends right? Even if they are experienced murderers, at least he'd have people around him that knew how to fight, since, well, he had little to no experience fighting. Ever.* - Mon Oct  5 16:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) is starting to feel veeeeery uncomfortble but, unlike Kilm, he actually has something between his legs (yes that was a refference to what sai always says to naruto, deal with it) and he stepped forward to allow her to test this new jutsu on him. He wasnt exactly important or anything so it wouldnt matter if he got hurt a bit or maybe lost the use of a leg.* - Mon Oct  5 16:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) yells out in pain, but not quite as loud as he could have. He yelled about as loud as if someone gav ehim a 1-inch cut on his shoulder instead of ripping through his muscles.  As usual, he tries hiding things so that people don't get offended or thing less of him. But yeh this hurt like HELL. He clutches his arm as his vision goes blurry. The more he tries to ignore the pain, the more unbelievably it hurts.* - Mon Oct  5 16:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's the same as asking me to give her my blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would think for a moment as he concentrated on which element he was best at, he would have liked to excel in his others, but at the moment, the only thing he could do at all whatsoever was fire style. And he only had one jutsu for it under his belt. "All I got i fire style..."* - Mon Oct  5 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can you show me how you train? Let's see what you can do. - Mon Oct  5 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would take a deep breathas he had not done this in a while. He began to concentrate his chakra to his center, letting it build up. He would then focus this chakra to his mouth and use it to start making a flammable oil in his mouth, tasteless so as to not make him puke.

After making this oil, he would spew it from his mouth, igniting it afterward. This would create a massive amount of fire seem to spew from his mouth, when it was actually the ignited oil. He kept spitting it out, getting every last drop out of his mouth, as he really did not feel like swallowing it.

He would repeat the process a few more times, just to get a feel for it. Build up chakra. Focus said chakra towards mouth to create oil. Let oil build up for several seconds. Then spit it out and ignite it as it sprays forth. It was rather simple, but also draining, as he was very inexperienced with training his jutsu, never really having any need to do so.* - Mon Oct  5 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not bad. - Mon Oct  5 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Perhaps I'll be able to teach you. - Mon Oct  5 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I've trained so hard today . . . I think i'll overwatch his training for now . . . - Mon Oct  5 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Keep going. - Mon Oct  5 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would breath heavily as he focued on replicating what he did earlier, a bit tired from his previous uses of the technique. He would gather up his chakra, concentrating it to his center so as to build it up. This was a bit difficult for him, as he was not used to controling his chakra in such a manor, but he managed it all the same, learning rather quickly. Then, he would channal it to his mouth so as to form the flammable oil needed to make the technique work.

As he built up the oil, he made sure it was tasteless and made sure his throat was blocked so as not to let any oil escape down his throat and cause potential harm to his digestive/immune system. He was getting quite skilled at making the oil tasteless, as this was a key part since he didnt want to puke and spit it up everywhere. He was getting great at the not swallowing part too. He finished the oil and was ready now to move on to the next stage.

He built up the oil and puffed up his cheeks, thinking to himself "Well.. here goes... again.." And the would then spew the oil out of his mouth, igniting it with his chakra as it left his mouth, just far enough away not to burn himself as this was quite the major part for the technique to be successful. What point is a technique if it damages the caster more than the target? He exhausted all of the supply of oil he had built up and panted heavily, rather tired from all that work.* - Mon Oct  5 19:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would take a deep breath, he was still kinda if-y on the whole jutsu training thing, seeing as it always left him so exhausted, depleting most of his chakra and making him look like he just ran a long marathon. But he figured if he kept doing this over and over and over and over and over again, eventually his hard work would pay off and lead him to being able to use higher level jutsu, while his lower ones barely drained him. That was the plan anyway. For now he had to deal with low level jutsu tiring him out like hell.

He first did his beginning step, which he figured not many other people do, but he thought it made things much easier. He channaled his chakra into his center, so as to gather it up easily and quickly. Then, he would focus that chakra towards his mouth, letting it all pool there for a moment. After he did this, he would begin to convert his chakra into oil, a lot of oil that was highly flammable and quite tasteless. He didnt want to have to taste something that would make him spit the oil out all over the place, because then if someone decided to ignite it, he's go up in flames.

The next step was pooling this oil in his cheeks so he could spray it out of his mouth and then ignite it. This was a little risky because if he ignited it too soon, he'd end up lighting himself on fire, and that doesn't sound too pleasant now does it? He finally sprayed out the oil and then sent out his chakra to ignite it, causing a stream of fire to seemingly burst from his mouth, instead of oil covered in fire. He then noticed that this technique hadn't drained him as much as it usually did. This pleased him, and put him in a SLIGHTLY better mood than he was in previously.* - Tue Oct  6 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Learius(Josh1220) would sigh with relief as he had seemed to begin to master this jutsu. He wasnt as tired as he normally was after using it at least. He now figured if he kept doing this over and over, his hard work WILL pay off and lead him to being able to use higher level jutsu. This jutsu was already starting to take less of a toll after all. That was his current ultimate goal for now. To train and train and train until he was able to use this jutsu several times without complete exhaustion and eventually get better jutsu with which he could do the same.

He first did his beginning step, which was seemingly different from the number one step of putting the chakra where you want it to go first for the jutsu, but he thought his way made things much easier. He would FIRST focus his chakra into his center, so as to gather it up easily and quickly, since he was able to pool it from his whole body to one central area, then move it where it had to go. Then, he would move that chakra up, towards his mouth, letting it all gather there for a few moments. After he did this, he would begin to create flammable tasteless oult using his chakra, a lot of oil that he could use for his jutsu. He didnt want to end up vomiting from the taste of the oil and get it all over the ground around him, as this would make it so he could get set on fire by anyone nearby who decided to light it. Not the best thing for a battle.

The next step was moving all the to his cheeks so he could spray it out of his mouth and then ignite it, his mouth being in the shape it is when someone whitstles or squirts water at someone. He then squirt the oil out and then sent out his chakra to ignite it, being careful not to ignite it too soon or too close to his mouth, as this would cause him to be fried like thanksgiving turkey. He then noticed that this technique had drained him the same as last time, meaning he wasnt quite at the next level of mastery for the jutsu. He wasnt yet able to use it efficiently enough to make it less draining. More practice makes better right?

He now decided to do it all over again, so he would again build up chakra at his center. Then he pushed it to his mouth and started creating the oil needed for the 'Flame Bullet' which he usually made more of a flame stream, than the bullet. He then puffed up his cheeks with the oild and let it rip. Now he ignited it somewhere between half and inch to and inch and a half past his mouth where the oil came out, making sure not to do it so close that it catches his lips, or the rest of him, on fire. That would hurt like hell now wouldnt it?* - Tue Oct  6 13:51:34 2015
