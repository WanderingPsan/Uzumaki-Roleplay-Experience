"Alright, this'll be fun."* - Wed Nov 11 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saitoma(Ren Sezumi) blinked, staring at liu as he'd rush towards the man. He simply stood there, being kicked in the mid section as the male moved back, but stayed on his feet. Glancing up at the giant snake coming down, he'd have ahold of liu's leg the moment it made connection with the man's midsection.

"Hot potato." He'd grip the man's ankle tightly before tossing him up towards the giant snake as it came down...Of course, saitoma immediatly aiming to leave the vicinity of the snake's body, booking to the stairs.* - Wed Nov 11 04:59:05 2015

He'd simply grab his ankle with both hands..and went to slam the man down into the ground with full force.* - Wed Nov 11 05:05:55 2015

He'd simply aim to ram the man down into the ground, along with his own back...

Of course, if he couldnt and liu's actions went through, the male didn't have that crappy of reflexes. His reflexes and the speed at which liu attacked had a small margain. He'd watch as single punch hit him in the chin, but he'd raise his hand and grab the next, followed by the next punch..Leaving him holding each hand. He'd then slam his forehead towards liu's, aiming to headbutt him.* - Wed Nov 11 05:15:18 2015

He'd point towards jirun, running towards him, "You and me, We're going to team up to defend the village while the others do their job, Alright? I want you to run around and get the villagers to safety." He'd say commandly, he'd been resting for a while, so he was pumped.* - Mon Nov 16 02:34:27 2015

He'd say, rushing past the boy as well. He'd begin going around the village rapidly, rounding up villagers, civilians, farmers..the whole lot, he'd begin to move them away from the rapid combat and fighting..Hopefully jirun and other genin helped, those who weren't in the current on-waging war had to make their keep somehow.* - Mon Nov 16 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saitoma(Ren Sezumi) blinked, the moment he saw the enemy begin to go through seals, he could tell he was going to die here..So he had to at least do one good thing in his small shinobi career, the genin was pitiful and never did much, recently graduating the academy to do absolutely nothing..He had to at least do nothing, with all of his strength, he'd rush towards jirun, spinning around to have his back towards ortho, he'd whisper to the boy, his body most likely covering most of him.

"Don't be foolish, Run." He'd say, trying to save his life..If he were able to do this, he'd feel the water suddenly rip into his back, most likely ripping through his skin and muscles, going into his bones..And the lightning most likely causing internal damage all around his body..Well, at least his short-lived shinobi life ended with attempting to save someone.* - Mon Nov 16 03:29:04 2015
