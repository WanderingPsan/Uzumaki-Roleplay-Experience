<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would smile nervously before walking over towards them.  

She would then leave the area if they left as well. She wanted to see when maloths thirst for fighting was overing...after all...it was bad to be like that all day and all night....she hoped this battle spar was good enough for them.* - Mon Oct 19 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would look back towards maloth was walking backwards . She found it slightly strange but she did not mind....it was probably a cave man thing. The nervous girl would then begin start following behind them rather slowly as they continued to walk backwards.

"mm..?"* - Mon Oct 19 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: Wan' go home. - Mon Oct 19 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be looking between both maloth and the two that as infront of them. She remained silent however  just watching the conflict raise and quickly...and soon after wards subsiding. "m-maloth...il....be l-late...returning to t-the k-kumo...your free to s-stay here....as l-long as you w-wish...during the t-training p-program...that is..." she said....maybe the fights they have here will be helpfull...since they lost two of them....that will only urk them to get stronger for the next time. To not let that happen again...

A small smile would be given towards every one in the room before she made her way towards the exit. She had someone to go....or somewhere she wanted to be at the moment.* - Mon Oct 19 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would go back within her usual meditative position and clothes her eyes afterfinally reaching the mountain she had left for a while. Of course she was happy at the village she had found, but for noew it was just fine enough to stay here...she felt herself changing and became a bit more talkative under maloths influence. A soft breath of air would then leave her lips as she sighed softly and closed her eyes. Her mind drifting away into nothings and her breathing begining to grow slower.  It was time for her to train once more on her own after takeing week or two long break.  They slowly began to leave the world of reality and would later reapear in her mind scape.

_Mind Scape Vision_

The nervous girl rose up rather slowly looking around at her last location...the last place she had fallen asleep. It was the forest that she had just left as she was walking up towards the next gate location. Raising up from her laid down position with her white bunny resting ontop of her head, the nervous girl continued onto her destination whatever it may be. The sounds of the forest had guilded her path with great care...allowing their leafs...to grace her skin with care as they fell down slowly and calmly. She would have missed kyo and Roses company but she was moving onto the next step...The nervous girls eyes lowered slightly feeling this was the only place she could be able to think to herself...or be herself....The nervous girl was forced to talk...or talked out of egarness to get the words she wanted to say out of her mouth and felt embarased after....was that or those words the right ones to say...did the dual training program even exist...however...maloth seemed to have met his match and suddenly just left completely...

That was part of the reason she had went along with them to kohonoha...to make them see what level of training they were at.....whenever he had said she was strong...she had always pushed that comment aside knowing that it had not been true at all...even though they had believed it to be so. However..she herself was not at that level and will never be....* - Tue Oct 20 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary)  would continue her walk along the forest area path as the next gate soon came closer into view. A nervous smile formed from her lips as they saw how big and special the gate looked infront of the small town.What was strange was all the yelling and what not coming from the location of which she was to go. Her calm emerald gaze trailed downwards towards the stairs that she had to climb upon getting closer and soon began walking up them getting closer towards the location. The rabbit that was on her head would slide downwards into the hoodie that she currenlty wore when in her mind scape. "mm..." A soft sound emited from her form as the long walk came to an end standing infront of the next gate she was sopost to walk through...but what she saw rather supprised her. The villagers were scared and some were brutish as well as angry....the place looked dirty like a getto as well as dusty. The town was alive but it was also a different type of landscape from what she was used to. Shots of guns were heard as she began walking though the area and past that gate...the third gate to find the building she was sopost to go to and continue her training.

'help help'

The words echoed though her ears...'leave me alone!'...the next set of words being yeled out loud intertwining with the others. She would continue her slow walk and would reach a building that had a bar. The nervous girl felt the presence and began to make her way down the stairs only to see a bar. IT was dark with white lights along certain area. This was interest...it was different from the Roses House and Kyo's Shrine. Yes...this place was just...warm or a mixture between the both. Upon coming to a stop when she stood just before the bar table and held up the books and placed them ontop of the table."y-you needed t-these" A nervous smile would be given to the rather tall women as they nodded a slow nod.  Placing down the cloth and the glass that they were cleaning, The stack of books was soon picked up and placed on the ground behind the counter before taking the note that was attached to it and raising back up. The tall women opened it and read it with a calm emotionless gaze before suddenly changing into a death glare almost as if she read the first words and got completely mad or angry....more or less...the first letter. * - Fri Oct 23 13:46:52 2015

Note:

' hello my lovely kitten....my little bunny has just finished her training....hhahahha....training... and ive sent them off to you....please treat her with care...they get dissipointed in themselfs easilty....i hope they treat you well in that certain area you live in...Zen'

The tall young women named zen crumpled up the paper before tossing it into the garbage behind the counter. Both hands were then placed on paines shoulders as they scanned around their body looking for something which made paine watch them curiously wondering what exactly they were looking for. It was then zen looked directly at her and she jumped slightly as they began gritting their teeth slightly.  Anime comedic circles took place of her eyes as she spoke,"w-what....is i-it.." her nervous calm emerald gaze looked away from their form as she never had a person this close to her before like this. Zen soon spoke in their blank voice."Kyo....did not harm you....did he?" She sounded curious and worried...as a fellow women would towards a man whom they deamed dangerous. A nervous smile would form on her lips as she shook her head rather slowly meaning no before speaking. "r-rose was there...w-watching them" Zen would soon lean backwards with a slight supprised expression on their face. Rose actually cared about her...this was new. ..that ment she was sopost to be extra carefull. After a few moments pause a small smile appared on Zens face as she spoke. " wellcome to my home...uhh...make your self at home...and take a seat il make you something to drink before we begin...how does that sound?" The nervous girl looked up to them and nodded that it sounded completely fine as a nervous smile appared.* - Fri Oct 23 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) // 

The nervous girl would watch as zen turned around and got a bottle of apple juce and another bottle of wind. Opening them both, they poured it into a glass carefully making sure not to put too much and not too less. Picking up a spoon, she began mixing up drinks before adding ice and spinkling half a tea spoon of sugar into the cub before picking it up...handing it off to paine and saying. " give it a taste.." The nervous girl would nod rather slowly before giving off a small smile and picking up the glass and taking a sip. A nervous blush would appare on her lips as she took another longer sip and placed the glass back onto the table. "i-its...good" A small smile would appare from the nervous girls lips as took one last sip finishing the drink before raising up and following her teacher towards the back rooms. The first room they saw was her room....then it was the bathroom...and later was the sparing arena...everything looked expensive...kyo sure did knew his people. As they entered the arena, paine came to a stop as her new teacher zen walked forwards a bit more before turning around to face them. "Put up those hands paine...its time to start the spar"

Paine would stare at them curiously before doing as she was told, the both of them charged towards each other. Blured punches were sent towards the both of them and the sound of something being smacked against was heard as well as each person blocked the incoming attacks while sending forth another. Zen saw this as a good thing and also noticed that paine remained with an expressionless expression while they fought her...or other foes....that must of showed her focus and determination...not wanting to mess up or something of the sort. A soft breath of air would of left zens lips as she blocked an incomming punch.....It was time to test her students awareness* - Fri Oct 23 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

 Zen would step on a certain space on the wooden floor board and a hold opened from the side. Suddenly something shot out from the side..it was a rubber ball coming at paine at full speed. As the nervous girl sent a punch towards zen, her reflexes kicked in and her calm eyes looked over towards her right  and pulled forwards her head a bit. A hurricane like wind began to surround her form slowing down the ball as it was suddenly sent flying off away from their form. The teacher would of had their arms in a X position as they slid backwards and later lowered them to their side. More rubber balls began to charge at the nervous girl from many direction aiming to hit them on the back, shoulder, thigh..knees  stomach as well as back. The nervous gril began running forwards towards her mentor before suddenly going into a slide and crouching down her body lowly to avoid the two rubber balls towards her shoulder, her body twisted to the right as she swung up her foot kicking away the ball that was sent towards her stomach and right knee.  However as her right foot touched the ground, her left knee was hit and she fell onto the ground  in a roll towards her teacher before coming to a stop.

The nervous girls eyes were closed before opening and stareing at her big brested tall teacher...she noticed that it was big because it slightly blocked out her face. A nervous smile was given towards zen  whom stared at her for a moment before giving her a small smile. Her hand extended outwards to help her up and she took it before being pulled back up to her feet. "were not done yet....get back into your place...and lets go at it again.." The nervous girl gave a nervous smile before nodding and walking back to her previous location. Nodding showing she was ready, the nervous girl charged at her teacher once more and began throwing punches towards them at in a blurred motion. 
 * - Fri Oct 23 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be currently meditating in the middle of the bridge over the waterfall. The nervous girl seemed to be focused not really noticing a presence around them at the moment. She was confortable in the serene environment and it soothed her heart. The sound of the wave of rushing water...to the sounds that ran though the forest. It was the best place to be if a person wanted alone time or time to themselves...either or. 


When a person came close to this individual while meditating, they would notice a large hurricane like of wind surrounding the nervous girls form and expanding outwards. This started happening a little after and slightly before the death of zetsumo,,,,it kept her cool and nice...* - Sat Oct 24 05:04:12 2015

Zen sent forwards a punch towards the nervous girl and paine blocked it before sending forwards a blurd punch towards theri stomach area only to have her teacher twist their free arm downwards blocking the punch but there was not enough stature causing them to skid backwards. A crooked smile appared on the the tall womens lips before the phone suddenly began to ring. They both suddenly froze and rose back up into a standing straight for a moment. " we will call...this training session a post poned one.....and i believe thats for you..." They said in a monetoned voice as they walked over towards the table and later tossed a towl before walking towards the exit. Paine blinked for a moment before suddenly leaning backwards watched a ball pass by her eyes. Blinking for a few moments, she noticed that her training session helped her improve in more areas than one. A nervous smile apapred on her lips before walking towards the table and picking up the phone. "h-" It suddenly stoped speaking as the noise echoed though the area,

The nervous girl put down the phone noticing it was a blured voice from the world or reality. Drying off her sweat, she sat down in a chair that was besides the table and stated at the traning room. A soft breath of air left her lips in remeberance of the children that was still at the shrine before her gaze slowly looked up towards the bunny that crawwled up upon her head.Tiling her head downwards slightly, she raised up both hand to take hold of her bunny and place it upon her in her arms.  The bunny had pure yellow eyes and pure white fur. Closing her eyes, she slowly began to drift out of her mind scape and into the world of reality.

____Mind Scape Vision End-_____

The nervous girls eyes opened slowly as the hurricane like wind slowly came to a stop. She breath inwards and later outwards regulatively untill it was back to normal  Her calm emerald eyes would then look up towards Mirai...she saw someone like them before....maybe in suna perhaps...For now the nervous girl only stared at them with a curious expression..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would stare at them for a moment before raising up her right hand and hesitating for a moment before fully shaking their hands, just as she had done before with the other people she had just first met. They had left the village just as she had done...but probably for different reasons than herself....even though they had said that the village was her home...it did not feel like it was at all..or just did not feel like she deserved to belong.. As these thoughs ran though her head, her smile lowered into an expressionless one for a moment before giving them a small smile when they had finished their words.

"u-umm...im from o-over seas....im not from t-the shinobi l-lands....."

She said with her voise slowly lowered into nothingless as she began to feel nervous from their stare. Her calm gaze slowly looked away from their form.
