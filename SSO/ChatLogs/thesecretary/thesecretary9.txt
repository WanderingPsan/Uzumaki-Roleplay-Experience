<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be exiting the mansion when she noticed Erebus walk in. Looking up towards them, a nervious smile would be given. "u-umm...." shs paused for a moent unsure of what to say as she stoped. Her mind a bit lost to what occured earlier,  but the whole situation of dropped in the back of her head....it seems...there will be more interesting things to learn about in this village....The pause between their words seemed a to last a while before she spoke again. "u-umm...is...y-your chest o-ok..." she asked rather curiously...unsure if she should since they were umm...still walking about.

"m..mm.."

Her head lowered to stare at his stiched up chest, eyes lowered slightly..she was curious to why..they had to make such a point and in turn stab themselfs. The fear it induced probably shook the room clean....but the confusion this one act brought...left reminance to simply flow back into the room...the situation...was fustrating. Currently..everyone was still getting mentally prepared for what ever action Erebus was going to do next...

Her calm eyes looked back up towards Erebus' face as she awaited their response.* - Sat Sep 26 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink for a few moments as the question took a moment to regester in her mind. They....wanted to have a drink of sake with her...but she the the most un interesting person of the group...the type that most people would lose interest in talking too. A hand raise slowly and was placed over her heart as she breathe inwards and outwards slowly....calm emerald eyes slowly closing to relax her nerves as she replied towards the jashinist. "s-sure...i would l-love to.." Her hand slowly lowered to her side as a soft breathe of air left her lips followed by a small smile soon afterwards. They were ready to go out for a drink...but...one thought suddenly crossed her mind....why sake...

"mm.."

she would begin following erebus with her mind on...why it was sake they had to drink...she did not say anything due to what the drink had done for the soul...her dad once said that sake soothed wounds for people whom were terribly hurt and what not..slowly healing them...mental and emotional wound seeminly gone when it was drunk....but..to be fearfull of the addiction that it will bring...oh dear..

"d-does sake..t-taste good?"

she said looking over to them as they were walking towards their destination.* - Sat Sep 26 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would walk over and rather sat across from them since this was her first time drinking with them to say the least. As she scooted in the seat and sat close to the wall, both hands were placed on the seat as she lowered her form a bit...looking down at where they were sitting and if she felt comfortable in the seat at all. Raising up her hands, she allowed them to rest on her lap before giving them a nervious smile. "u-umm....you dont m-mind if i keep on my h-hat...do you?"

She asked curiously..she did not want to offend the person whom offered her to drink with them.* - Sat Sep 26 16:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) a hand would raise to slightly cover her mouth as a soft laughter left her lips for a breif moment.

"i....w-wish i can do t-things like j-just talking more o-often..."

her hand rested back down on her lap as she looked back towards them with a small smile...this was rather...the first time she had done something like this since she had been traveling her most of her life before she became reconized as a shinobi in sunagakure.* - Sat Sep 26 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) mouth opened slightly as her smile suddenly vanished upon hearing his words.....no..judgement....from what she says or will say and being an equal in his eyes. Was she really able to speak freely towards them...to spill out her problems in hopes that he will actually understand where she was coming from....the ability to rant on and on about what disturbed her...what irked her like the people whom she saw during her walks though the village after training for a few hours with no breaks. In her heart...they always had wished to..be like them. However..her mother always said that she was unique in her own way...the question was...what exactly was unique about them...

"th-..."

The nervous girl was about to speak when two cups and a sake bottle was placed on the table causing her to slightly jump in her seat. Her focus was mainly on Erebus..but the new visitor whom was the waiter caught her off guard. The waiter poured sake into both of the cups before placing the bottle back onto the table. When they were finished....a smile was given to both of them along with the words 'enjoy'. Paine would give them a small smile before looking down at her cup....extending her right hand, she picked up the cup of sake and raised it up motioning Erebus to knock his own against hers.

"m-mm...ive seen people d-done this before....i-i always wanted to try it.."

A nervious smile was given.* - Sat Sep 26 17:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary)  cup was pulled back a bit  after she took a small sip of the drink and later placed it back upon the table. 

"t-thankyou.....for your kindredness....i-i...will...try to s-speak freely"

She would say pausing for a moment as she watched the soundwaves that her cup of sake made. Her gaze then back upon Erebus. "u-umm...d-do you know..w-" she stoped once more inbetween her words as she heard someone enter, looking over to her left, she would see Kilm ...her face was currently holding no expression at the moment....she was going to ask a question...but felt a clentch in her heart which stopped her when they heard them enter. Soon enough the voice of Taiga was heard and her mind felt heavyish...she was lost.. 

Her gaze slowly went back upon Erebus as a small smile was given...maybe...she could ask a person like them...later after sometime has passed...since kilm probably had some need for them...in one way or another.* - Sat Sep 26 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I guess i'll leave. - Sat Sep 26 17:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod. She of course did not mind them sitting with them..but they left or ended up leaving. 

Watching as they left, she looked back towards Erebus watching the aura that they had being enclosed and covering their form no matter how much they tried to cover it. Looking back towards erebus, an akwardish nervious smile appeared as she began to speak. "u-um...d-do you know....w-where one can go...when...t-they c-clear place..they can c-call home..." she said as she reached for the cup and brought it back to her lips taking a sip and lowering it back onto the table. Her calm eyes lowered slightly as she continued after her breif pause. "what....to do...w-when your to w-weak to protect someone t-that is in pain.........what path...y-you should t-take....w-who you should t-trust...the feelings that b-blind...your decisions..and choices that gives you a f-future..o-or takes i-it away..."

The nervious girl's questions were blasted onto them...each one given seemed to want a response..begging them for an answer so her heart can be soothed in the slightest. Her mind lost to ponder around these thoughts....was,,,this even the right person she could ask...."a-are..these questions...o-odd...i-im sorry.." she said giving them a weak nervious smile as she stared down at her cup...they felt bed for talking to them about things like this...someone she just met that is..being the first time they had met up to talk and things.* - Sat Sep 26 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //" a home...is a place...i ...the people...i love the most are there....a home...being a place to sleep and...not worry.....where...i feel most comfortable..." She paused for a moment repeating their words before speaking again. " i wish....that place...can be found soon...." Her gaze went back upon them....as a small smile was given. She was happy for the words and the help that was given to her. 

This person gaze many answers..and they seemed understandable.Raising up into a standing position, a nervious smile was given. her feelings...being wiped...her goals being blocked...she had...to know to trust her self..she had control of herself...but also douted them selfs as well. "u-umm.....i-i need to begin training now..l-like i originally planned....w-would you like to join?" she asked unsure of whether they would actually join or not....they just wanted to get the thoughts she currently had out of her head.


The feelings she felt that downed when punches were thrown..her wants and needs only drowning when the adrenaline kicked in.....the path she should take...clear to her...when she becomes focused on her opponent....they wanted to ask them more questions...but that could happen later.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink for a few moments as she stared at his hand. "mm..?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giveing them a small smile as her hand left his grasp moving bit more over to the right.


The nervious girl began jumping up and down slowly, her feet slightly leaving the ground as she turned sideways with her gaze on the field infront of them. A breathing remained calm following the movements and rythme of her body. Her calm eyes lowered slightly as she began to focus on what she believed to be important at the moment which was her kicking ability which she was planing on striving in, but for now...they were waiting untill she was comfortable enough to send a strike towards the invisable person infront of them. "u-umm...w-what do you t-train in?" she asked curiosly. She had only seen them weild a scythe so they were curious to what they actually did...

Suddenly she pushed off her feet and twisted her body in a blur. Her leg stuck out and a round house had happened. As her foot touched the ground, the figure paused for a moment before beginning her jumping once more. They seemed to begin talking while they were training.* - Sat Sep 26 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would look over towards them as they got ready as well. She did not know they loved training in taijutsu too.  "y-your devoted fully t-to taijutsu as w-well?......o-or c-complimenting w-with taijutsu" she asked curiously, they seemed to be complimenting since they were using a scythe earlier in her eyes...but she asked to be sure....taijutsu was an art someone had to be fully devoted...she went into the art because they rather did not understand it really to well...shinobi have the taste of mud in their mouth and even hold  fire...there must of been a gimic...darn those magicians...

Her body bagan shifting in blurs from left to right as she began sending kicks into the air infront of them. Each kick was swift and retracted as quickly as it was sent out. Leafs began to surround the area around them and slowly drifted to the ground. this was one thing she liked about the area...the way the leafs fell from the trees...it always made a calm feeling in her heart when the wind carried them from their harsh fall to the ground...A nervious smile formed on her lips. The sound of an object cutting through wind would be heard coming from her location.

She was determined.
They seemed to be focused.* - Sat Sep 26 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod, they intended to complement their taijutsu with kenjutsu..but chose to use the both of them to their fullest intent. Her movements began to grow slower as her gaze fell upon them. Their eyes were closed begining to become focused in what ever action they were doing....the jashinist was training for an actual first time as they had told her. Paines calm emerald eyes looked back towards the path ahead of her,....her soft breath left her lips as a kick was sent forwards to continue the motion she was doing before. It was time to do what she had done before when she herself was training.

 As the last round house kick had been sent though the air, her right leg was retracted inwards and her left knee bended by a bit as her spin continued sliding across the dirt ground causing the dust to float upwards into the air before ceaseing to exit. When her right leg had ended by resting behind her left foot, she pushed upwards into the air forwards twisting her body in an anti clockwise direction. Her right leg retracted while her left leg was pulled outwards with all her strength as a violene hurricane began to surround her form.

"mm.."

A soft breath of air escaped her lips as she landed on the ground. She rose back up. "u-umm...i wish i could t-teach you...but i-im not to good at t-taijutsu" she said giving them a nervious smile. The nervious girl was rather modest with her self...she often called others better than herself in terms of teach fundementals and what not.* - Sat Sep 26 20:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be meditating for the moment in her place next to erebus as they trained. She had only left for a short moment to use the bathroom before coming back to this spot and doing her meditation. The leave was nothing important...but coming back after they had left ment alot in other words. Her body leaned backwards slightly as they took a deep breath before exhaling that air out towards the area infront of them slowly.  Her body that was slightly tensed began to calm down...going into a relaxed state. The world around her beginning to turn fuzzy...the world that they were being drawn to. This is the land of which they had come from...her mentor whom trained her untill she was ready for the next. 

Paines eyes lowered before closing. A whirl wind  expanding outwards surrounded her form. The figue seemed to focused on this taining...she did this to help her mind....no her interlect...pass a certain degree in close combat....it alreo raised her chakra levels.  They were determained at the moment even if * - Sun Sep 27 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would arrive at the training grounds which were currently very empty at the moment. A soft breath of air left her lips as they began jumping upwards and later downwards repeatedly before turning sideways as she had done the days before. Her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly as they turned sideways...arms frailing controlably following her movements. They seemed to be in a state of relaxsation as they did their jumping and her focus also was directly towards her mastering this skill in which she was trying her best to get better at. "o-one...t-two...t-three.." she said under her breathe as a count down before landing and pushing off her feet, her upper body twisted and her right leg stuck out and later was pulled forwards with all her might not wanting to hold back in her strength unless it was maloth she was fightining. 

As her leg touched the ground behind her, she leaned backwards slightly and raised up their other leg. Her foot sending a direct kick towards the stomach area before being pulled back slightly and sent forwards towards the leg before retracting once more and being sent towards the shoulder. Each time, twisting her body as her movements seemed to become faster.

"mmm..."* - Sun Sep 27 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin moving faster as her body turned into blurs with each shifting of her movement. Her kicks seemed to pack much more power as she tried using her kicks to the fullest extent thanks to the breathing technique that rose had thought her. She however has not seen rose in a rather long while...but..they may see them again towards the end of her training. A nervious smile formed on her lips at the thought of seeing her old mentor again. Her hair began to turn a pure white color as her eyes turned into a pure yellow color. Her kicks making a harsher sound as she began to throw a few punches into the mix. As the females body twisted, her body lower slightly as her right hand went upwards in a fist as a jab towards her oppoents stomach before pulling back swiftly.

"mmm..."

Her eyes widened as she suddenly stopped her movements. Her mind remebering what ebrus had told her not to many moons ago. That a home was somewhere....where she could go.as the ones she loved the most where there. A place known.....was there a place where she can call home. The nervious girl never slept for the longest time over the three years....as they were up with zetsumo training hard...no as hard as she could...so she..the nervous clutzs that she was could get better at doing the action she deemed very important....but...what was she to do now....erbus was wise...he knew the answers...like they were planted infront of them...almost as if he was asked these questions before...not to themselfs...but to the people he cared about greatly not to long ago.* - Sun Sep 27 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) seemed to be standing still in a daze..her breathing slightly heavy but regulated like the times she had spared with rose and sometimes kyo when they had decided to train her. HEr mind still on the feeling she felt at the shop when she asked them her question. She did not know what to feel...she did not know what to say...what was he trying to imply....she was happy to hear that their pain was numbed even after they had died...and now she was stiving for a power that was out of her reach...only depending on the words of shin whom tells the nervious girl constantly to stop being so shy...to stop being so modest...to come out of her shell....zetsumo whom still believes in her...the one whom tells her...that shes to slow...to become faster...work on her strength so she could be strong enough to break his doton armor. 

'crack'

Her right foot raised and later stomed on the ground causeing the ground below her to slightly crack.  Yes...she remebered the sound of his doton armor finally cracking under her powress. She remebered the smile they made showing that they were proud of her accomplishment....like seeing a student grow into something that could be deemed to spectactular....yes...that had happened to her....and now...they were gone. The path she should take now....away from her child hood friend...and into the future that would be put before her....she was lost...* - Mon Sep 28 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) shaking her head, her fist clenched at the child hood friend that was now gone. She was sad...but that was not what had made her sad. The thought came across her mind that katsune had given her a place to say which was this village of all things. It was her choice to come here...but why did she choose this path for herself. It was strange in all honesty....but weird in all regularity. No torcher...but peace...ebrus stated that  she had to pick the path she wanted.....the one that she herself felt the most comfortable with....care not for what other people think...for only she had control of what she herself did. A soft breathe of air left her lips...his words clear as day as it passed though her head. Her decision up to now remaining blank....the answer she was searching for....and another question awaiting erebus to answer.

"mm..."

Kicking off her feet, her body twist and her right leg was stuck out. A blur would have been seen as she remained standing still. A small smile left her lips. She was getting faster with her kicks and was proud of her self for this. As the feelings enlightened her...it suddenly went away as she stood up straight as they were wiped away upon remebering the memories of those whom died believing in a clumbys person like herself for different reasons. Her eyes lowered slightly as they changed back into an emerald green hue while her hair turned back to a black color. 

"erebus....a-am...i able...to e-even believe in m-my self...."

she said under her breath in a rather low voice as she began to walk towards the exit of the training area. It was time for her to see what the others were doing and the thoughts she currently had was something they wanted to dampen which training dident help at this point. It was good to get some new thoughts in her head.* - Mon Sep 28 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they moved backwards untill they were by the exit. The nervious smile that she kept on her lips slowly changed into a slightly akward one. This giant brute was now soreing though the air like the muscles mass they with held within ment nothing at all. In turn. Her right hand would extend back a bit....open palm facing them...before being sent forwards to meet their students foot. When both stikes had met, paine's seat would slightly shift before the bute fell and landed on the ground....her own hand would be raised and wiggled a bit getting rid of the stinging sensation as they thought for a few moments about what exactly to say.

"u-umm.."

A nervious smile would be given to them as her right hand went back onto her lap. "u-umm...good j-job....w-we can c-continue training a b-bit later....i-is that a-alight." Raising up her right hand, she would slightly cover her mouth softly yawning a bit before lowering that hand to her side. * - Mon Sep 28 04:33:29 2015
