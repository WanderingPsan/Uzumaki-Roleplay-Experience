<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nods* - Thu Dec 10 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to make her way out of the village with her two friends Mirai and Chikyu....atleast she hoped that they thought of her as one. A soft breathe of air would escape her lips as she tilted her head downwards and stared at her hand. The heat was betting down on her form but her hat made it a little more bearable to walk though the desert.  "mm..." She just remebered the house she stayed at...it was a place that they still needed to tend to...but hasnt at all during these three or four years.

"m-my house..."

She muttered under her breathe as immages of her garden began to run though her head. Sanoke wanted her to stay, but what was the point of staying if her garden was going to get ruined...mm...what was the point...and her mountain would grow wild....then she wont have a lake to swim in....her personal lake that was right behind her house. A soft breath of air would leave her lips as she began thinking of a good time to visit the village. Maybe in another year....oh dear....it couldn't really be that bad by then....or maybe she should go now. "w-when.."

Her mind was begining to become blank...with thoughts only of her mountain, house and guarden...the words of Chikyu or Mirai would begin to go blank as the mission began to leave her mind...but come back at a later date when she remebered again. After their mission in kohonoa, she was probably going to tend on it...yes...that was a good plan....she hoped.* - Thu Dec 10 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Your house? - Thu Dec 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod.

"i-i left my m-mountain.....for t-to...long....i h-hope...its umm...a-alright.."

She said worriedly. It was the perfect home for a traveler and a even better one for a retired women. In all actuality, it was not a house...but a mansion more or less. She loved it very much no matter what anyone had said about it. She had a garden, owned a mountain and the lake below it. It was her land and she could have done anything she wanted with it, but for now, she loved it. The female would be walking slowly though the forests while chikyu and mirai walked ahead of her...it was something she usually did when she taveled with others in the past. 

There was however one more thing that people never knew about, there was a secret base inside the water fall that only she, shin,  zenaki or hanae knew about at this point in their life...since the others died. She had wanted it for that exact reason, she loved the lay out...and served as a great place to stay instead of staying out side. She also was able to get a good sleep there just because of the fact that no one knew of it.

Before she knew it, she saw the gates of the village from a distance.

"u-umm.."

She said as she took a step backwards and turned to face Chikyu and Mirai. A nervous blush would still be on her face but it would also be a blank one. Her mind seemed to be lost as her head tilted downwards a little covering her eyes.

She liked the feeling of being kissed, but the feeling of embarrasment was a little overwhelming for her. "o-or...umm....h-hopefully....you will b-be v-visiting...for the...c-chunnins...a-along with your g-genin..." She would say in a rather low voice. "mm..." A soft hum would leave her lips.

Turning to face then, she went on her toes and kissed them on their cheek. Looking back southwards as she landed back on the balls of her feet, they began walking southwards.

"w-we will be g-going now.....i h-hope to umm...s-see you s-soon..."

Her head would look back to stare at rias for a moment.

"and p-please....be s-safe.."

The nervous female would then suddenly vanish in a blur.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would place her hand in a cross under her chest area. Her gaze was on momura at the moment after hearing that they were going to spar kinami again dispite them holding back or not. This was rather the type of strive she was waiting for them to develop as a nervous smile formed on her lips. A student of taijutsu whom feared their opponent would only make the wrong judgements....that was a student whom she would not want ever under her wing. The nervous females gaze then went back onto Hideo, hiroshi and Tetsu. Opening her mouth she would say the words.

"u-umm...il be u-uhh continuing off o-of what i d-did with umm...h-hideo a y-year ago." 

After those words a small pause was made as her hand raise up and pointed towards the wall eastwards.

"l-line up and s-sit infront of the w-wall...,,,s-stare at it...u-untill you s-seell d-doubles....then t-tell me....how...a r-rock b-breaks...u-use your i-imagination...and b-be d-detailed in h-how it will b-be done..." She wanted to ask them this question, but she wanted to wait a year or two....but now seemed like the perfect time to ask...since a few years had past since she had them a s students.* - Fri Dec 11 01:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give a nod towards each of their answers as they all said it one at a time. She began thinking for a moment or two...her mind trying to remeber what she was gonna say once they almost all had stated what was to be said.  "o-oh..." She finally spoke seeming a bit amazed at what each of them had to say about the question she had asked. " b-blunt force...c-can not umm...d-destroy a  r-rock.......if y-you u-used all y-your s-strength...o-one s-something as s-simple as b-breaking a r-rock....you w-will only o-over e-...umm..e-...exer....e-exert?....mm....umm m-make yourself...m-more t-tired......c-cutting a r-rock.....we a-are...not s-swords m-men or w-women.....we o-only have o-our b-bare h-hands..." She directed towards tetsu before giving them a nervous smile and soon after a soft breath of air left her lips as she hummed softly....as before...till now...hideo rather really did amaze her with his answers....

"mm..." 

She thought for a moment upon moment and time passed for a moment before her mouth opened and she said the words. "i-its a c-close s-solution....the f-force which is c-carried behind you....is w-what c-causes...the r-rock...to b-break...n-not your s-strength....r-remeber that....now a-add onto your q-questions...that y-you f-found...and n-new founded information."  She would say before pointing towards the rocks that gave them a immitating frown. " and f-find out the a-answer...to h-how do r-rocks break....w-what causes them to b-break........h-how to a-apply that f-force...without u-using your f-full s-strength.." She would say before resting her hand back in a cross under her chest. 

The nervous female then awaited Hiroshi's answer as well as the others.* - Fri Dec 11 02:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Lets go. - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: What do you mean? - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would look over and point towards the rock. "i-if that was t-the c-case....when h-hideo...punches i-its cracks...i-it would h-have b-broken by now.....a r-rock is s-sturdy...and a-a simple c-crack...does not m-mean...it is t-the end......d-do not f-forget that." She would pause for a moment as she lowered her into a sitting position. what was she going to say next exactly...which was really surprising as her gaze left hiroshi and went onto tetsu...they seemed to be continueing off of what Hiroshi's words which added a bit for flear. It was rather interesting. Opening her mouth when they had finished, she would say continueing from the pause in her speech. "hmm e-explosives....it i-is or d-does have something to d-do with f-force...but t-that a-amount of f-force to u-use for a s-small c-crack....d-dont you t-think that.....its a-also a b-bit e-excessive......right n-now...we are not n-ninja...but p-practitioners in t-taijutsu d-dispite our b-background....do n-not t-think like t-those m-magic u-users....and t-think...like a t-taijutsu..s-specialist." She said towards tetsu just before pausing for a moment allowing a soft breath of air to escape her lips.

Her gaze then went onto Hideo....he was almost the hardest to find an answer for...A nervous smile slowly formed on her lips as she looked up and stared at the sky blue eye. This fresh air was rather enjoyable...but then again....she was still thinking of how exactly she was going to answer them and their response." mmm...y-your r-repsonse is n-not like t-the o-others...but y-yes...p-percision r-rather than s-strength......the w-weakest p-point...and im g-glad...you d-did not s-say s-strike its c-cracks like the o-other t-two....b-bust yes...y-your g-getting c-close h-hideo. " She would say before pausing for a moment to think...she wanted to lead him to the right direction so she gave all three of them in general another question. 

"n-now e-explain to m-me...how e-exactly....h-how do you...e-emply the l-least...a-amount of f-force...the v-very l-least...a-amount of f-force..to b-break a r-rock....y-you h-have the a-accuracy.....s-so..how do you u-use it to y-your a-advantage...w-with the l-least about of f-force...in w-which...you h-have.." A nervous smile would be given to them as she awaited their response.* - Fri Dec 11 02:37:26 2015
