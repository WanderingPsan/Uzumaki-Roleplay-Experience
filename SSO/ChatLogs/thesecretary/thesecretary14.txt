Turning southwards, she began to make her leave in search of fuji...they had to start their travels.* - Tue Oct 13 05:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) a nervous smile would be given towards them before she continued her way eastwards. Her calm emerald eyes would lower slightly  as her smile slowly faced to reveal an expressionless face...the nervous girl seemed to be lost in thought.* - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) had been traveling all this way to reach kohonoha and later kumogakure. She was traveling in hopes of seeing her student maloth again to see his progress in the technique she had thought them. A nervous smile appared on her nervous girls face remebering the words of yan that was spoken to her saying that they would go...no...get though this together...whatever problem it was...or whatever was wrong with the girl...but was it something that they could cure about the girl.....her need for power...something of zetsumo's need that was welled down within her and made her feel dirty...and sick. Taking a few steps back, they nervous girl bent her knees slightly before running forwards and later jumping up into the air landing on the tree and begining a faster way of travel that she had seen katsune and the others do while she herself just stuck to running in the ground...so they would not hurt themselves while preforming such a feat. The nervous girl's smile slowly faded away when she saw the others doing what they had done....zenaki now had a master...beth...seemed to come off as strange...she had felt a presence behind her..that felt similar to beths and looked only to have them run away in an opposit direction so they could communicate with someone else....sackone...sacone...sakon...was their name...no...it was probably baseless on the fact she did not remeber because she dosed off when they were speaking to her....

"mm...."

The lights of kohonoa were shining dimly as she made past the village....the sounds of yelling men and women heaving and hoving doing their jobs to repare the village that had been sunkin down. Her eyes lowered slightly remebering the blast like before as it was now...just devestating...was someone like that harvoring so much power...that it had to be released against a place where children cried...men worked...women played...and where old people lived out their days, just what drove them to do such a thing to a village that was on about peace and tranquility. Her movements were hastened as she land on a tree brach before kicking off north westwards as kumo was on a more mountainous plane.  Suna...was a nice place...but she had felt that the people there avoided her....and they only spoke to those...that can help them gain something as that was what interested them the most...she had nothing to give them...so she was usual or as usual left alone and was left alone to herself..it was as it should of been...or should be...but now why was she going back to maloth for..should she not just go back to her mountain top and stay secluded in nothingness....but felt the need to see her student before moving back to her location...

"mm..."

Her eyes lowered slightly as she landed on the ground and began running forwards. Her hair began to change from a black color to a white one while her eyes changed from an emerald green to a pure yellow one. Her speed increased a bit as she went into a slide and bent her knees before jumping up into air and over the gap. Landing in a slide, her hair returned back to its black color while her eyes returned to its emerald green. A soft breath of hair escaped her lips as she came to a stop....raising up straight after a moments pause, the nervous girl began to make her way towards kumo...the journy was long...and the distancing was tireous...but the thought of seeing maloth and his goofy way of saying things...and the things that they knew...would prove as something that was much fun.* - Wed Oct 14 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be walking up to the crater before suddenly stopping, she seemed like she was looking to spot someone. Upon stoping and stareing at the devestation they were allowed to escape from, a soft breath of air left her lips in releaf. Suddenly she heard a voice call out to them and looked downwards to see a man with blond here..freckles and tanned skin.

Upon hearing what they were asking of she would say," i-im...here t-to..see m-maloths...progress..." A nervous smile would then be seen forming from her previously blank face.* - Wed Oct 14 01:27:28 2015

The brute had definately been practicing hard and this made paine give them a small smile as both hands raised and later was clapped together in complete happyness of their accomplishment. They had gotten into a stand and send one of the kicks towards the crater they were in and made it another semi-minature crator next the the kages desk. After they had completed the task, her hands went back down to her sides before speaking the long awaited words that they had longed for....

Looking over towards the guards, they would stare at her for a moment before nodding and takeing one step closer to the kage. The nervous girls calm gaze looked back towards maloth as they began to speak once more. "a s-spar right here...the rules are...to s-stay within...the boundry...of t-twenty x fifteen feet...meaning...do not cross t-those boundrys...and you will s-succeed...The less m-movement...a t-taijutsu user n-needs to use...the b-better it will be f-for them...." Turning around, she would walk forwards before placing down a small fish and kuni to mark the distances from north to south.....then moved back to her previous spot.

"i-if you s-step or miss step out of this rectangular shape....t-then you or i will lose....h-how does that sound......and one m-more thing...d-do not d-damge the hokages things...t-that is also..a rule.....and do not d-damage the people s-standing in the a-area..."

The nervous girl wanted to see just how much the brute had improved....she wanted to see the ammount of control they had....for the new found stengths he had achieved.* - Wed Oct 14 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would think for a moment before just giving them a small smile letting their imagination to get the better of them. The nervous girl would begin jumping upwards and later downwards slightly above the ground before turning sideways as her small smile slowly vanished leaving an expressionless face. Both hands raised upwards and downwards freely but controlably following the rythme...her breathing following it as well....it was time to get this spar started...and after hearing her students words...she could not be any happier.

"u-umm...here i c-come.."

Pushing off her feet forwards, her right hand raised and was sent forwards towards their chest area as their right foot landed on the ground. Their left hand raised to her own stomach area...her calm eyes was stuck on maloths frame as they awaited their counter attack.* - Wed Oct 14 21:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nervously smile towards the brute as her left hand raised to take hold of his hand. Her left foot lowered to the ground as a nervous smile was given."o-oh dear....you are much stronger....h-how about...i t-teach you these t-two t-technique..since they c-compliment each other." Lowering her hands to her side she nodded rather slowly before taking a few steps back. Taking a deep breath inwards, the nervous girl exhaled a deep breath as her hair began to change from a black color, to a pure white one while her eyes turned to an pure yellow color. The nervous girled breathing was reagulated and calm...she nodded as her nervous smile soon vanished.

The nervous girl suddenly moved northwards in a slight blur and later returned with a log of wood and placing it on the ground before her. "m-maloth....c-can you do..t-this..." taking a few steps back, she dashed forwards and suddenly vanished, but if their eyes could not track her, the log would of been send into the air and paine would be in a crouching position. The girls elbows would then bend slightly before using it as a sping to push her self upwards and blured kicks were made sending the log upwards into the air....it was heavy...and she needed a repeated attack...and so this was one...

The figure was upside down in the air kicking the log upwards untill it was a steady high in the air before suddenly vanishing in a blur and landing on the gound...this was as far as the nervous girl was going to use the two techinues...it took alot of power to hold yourself up in the air and kick someone upwards....but could maloth do it......

The log would fall downwards ontop of Kyushiki if they did not move from that spot.

"c-can you d-do that?"* - Wed Oct 14 22:37:13 2015

" u-umm....o-once more....and y-you must remain c-completely u-upside down...m-make your k-kicks much f-faster....t-the l-log was t-to heavy...and was w-weight you d-down.....il d-demonstrate once more..." they said as she took a step back and the log fell inbetween them....the earth shook causing the guards to stumble slightly before regaining their composure.

Paine would take a few steps backwards before running forwards in a slight blur as her hair turned to a pure white color while her eyes turned into a pure yellow color. Suddenly light blue aura would surround her frame as her hair began to seemingly levitate like it was being blown upwards softly by something. Almost like the way hair floats in water when you go swiming. "kaioken....times..two.."
She wispered to herself as she suddenly vanished in a blur, when their eyes had finally tracked her...the nervous girl would be in a crouching position sending the log upwards into the air before using their arms as a sping and pushing themselfs upwards as well. Soon after multiple kicks would be sent upwards towards the log at a very fast pace while being upside down as well.

"mm..mm..mm!!" 

A soft voice left the nervous girls lips as she sent each kick to its targeted location.Both arms were held up in fists above her head which tightened with each kick they had given it as they progressed upwards. Their upper part of their body was bended slightly forwards as well to ensure balance as they did the technique. Once it was done, she suddenly vanished in a slight blur before landing and taking a step back allowing it to crash down inbetween maloth and herself.  The earth shook slightly before coming to a stop. Their clothes ruffled ever to slightly due to their aura as her hair floated slightly like it would under water.

Raising up her right hand, she would motion them to do the whole combo one more. The nervous girl wanted them or wanted their kicks to be faster so the weight of the person thats falling downwards would not pull them down as well...this would happen since this teachnique as a whole was a straine to the body....which was why they had so much trouble positioning themselfs after attempting to kick the log upwards.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) body would slightly shift and the log would be pushed forward. 

The figures body would be seen shifting slightly as the log seemingly went up the crator's side with each step they took. 

Those with good eye sight would see a blur kicking the log repeatedly.

[http://stinewoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1.-logs-on-trailer-slab-wood-furniture3.jpg] > Maloth and paines training log* - Thu Oct 15 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would motion her student to do it once more. 

"do it again...more.....when your k-kicking the log within the air....i notice s-slight hesitation...a-and a bit of s-struggle.....when k-kicking it upwards....farther into the air..."

A nervous smile as both hands raised and clapped together once. "mm..?"  With each attempt maloth made, she would clap her hands meaning one two three and so on. The nervous girl wanted them to become faster...or the large log was going to beat them in some way each or every time. 

"k-keep your leg s-straight and b-battle against the l-log....if it b-bends in even the slightest..then you will....o-only be d-damaging your self...."

They would say out loud as they continued to train. Her nervous smile slowly faded away and what was left was a blank face. The girl seemed to be thinking about something as this was going on...they were thinking about zenaki at the moment more or less the situations just struck her as strange."mm..."* - Thu Oct 15 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would take a few steps back allowing the log to fall down infront of her. Thinking for a moment before speaking once more, they would say as the earth shook....

"doing...the s-second technique even w-when mastered p-provies great s-straine on the body...so b-be carefull...and try to m-make your body more used to using the t-technique when im n-not a-around..."

With that, the nervous girl let out a small yawn as her right hand raised to cover her mouth yawning slightly. She was a bit tired now as her hand lowered and rested at her sides. The figure would then speak once more." y-you...have done well.....you j-just need to balance y-yourself more w-while i-in the air.." Jumping in to the air, her body twisted and her right leg was pulled outwards, a violent hurrican like wind surrounded her frame as the log was suddenly hit. 

*crack!* 

The sound echoed though out the area as the log was send eastwards and away from their current area. Upon landed, a nervous smile was given."m-maloth...c-can you do h-hand s-stands?" she asked curiously.* - Thu Oct 15 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would  nod rather slowly as she as well went into a handstand, but fell backwards and landed on her back. "mm..." Shaking her head rather slowly, she stood up once more and leaned forwards...hands going on the ground being used to keep her body up wobbling slightly before retaining balance. "mm...u-umm f-follow me..." 

And so they would begin their journy  westwards before suddenly stoping to regain her balance and continueing in that direction. To be honest...she was used to spinning, but not when it came to staying in an upside down position. She had to get used to this...oh dear.. And so, the nervous girl began her travels towards the location;However, when they had reached, she was just infront of the a trench. 

"a-avoid f-falling i-inside....t-this should help your b-balance when in the a-air"

Bending her elbows slightly, she pushed off into the air and landed back on her hands. Wobbling a bit, she regained her balance before turning around and giving them a nervous smile.* - Thu Oct 15 13:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would walk out of the crator and later stop when she was at a distance before turning to face them. A nervous smile would be given to them as she began jumping upwards slightly above the ground before landing on her feet. The nervous girl would then jump upwards once more before landing on the ground. Her arms would of followed the rhythmic movement as they continued their motions....emerald gaze on the foe before her. Her breathing remained calm to put herself at ease as her hands slowly tightened into a fist. After a few moments, her smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless face.

She was awaiting for to become ready before finally initiating the spar. It was time to actually see how much they had improved...woosh!!

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they began running forwards towards her.

She awaited his strikes and a small smile would form from her lips at the words they spoke. She did not care for the strengths of man...yes...she did not care about how weak they were either..it was....the person it themselfs...behind all the armor they showed...to protect themselfs...which was what she cared about. However...she is waiting for the right one and still is...

Watching as his speed slightly increase, her gaze lowered slightly as a soft breathe of air escaped her lips. The nervous girl raised up her right hand and sent it forwards crashing into his own stoping his movement. A crator soon formed below them as the clash happened. A nervous smile would form as she took hold of his arm and pulled backwards aiming to raise them up into the air and slam them into the ground behind her.

If they were sucessfull,  she would push of her right foot in a one rotation blured spin before tossing them northwards. "c-come on m-maloth...i know...thats n-not the f-fullest extent...o-of your p-powers..."  She felt their attack was stronger...but they still felt they were holding back on their taijutsu master. * - Fri Oct 16 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would of been about to lift them up into the air but his leg was brought forwards. She had thought her student well...they did what she would do...in numerous situations..after all..there was always a way out in terms of taijutsu and maloth had picked up on that all to well.. Pebbles and fragments of rocks that were lifted into the air upon impact would slowly be held up within the air as her calm emerald gaze lowered slightly...the rate of time slowing down around them as she was about to twist her body. The nervous girls left hand extended forwards and later raised and was sent forwards  against his knee causing them to slide backwards.

The nervous girls feet remained planted on the ground as she and maloth skidded backwards a little untill she suddenly tripped backwards at the edge of their crator......The firgure, as they were falling, retracted her right foot slightly before sending it towards their stomach area as dust particalls surrounded both of their forms. If they were successfull, she would pull them backwards before kicking them off sending them in the direction of west.  Raising up rather slowly, they began dusting themselfs off before looking in the direction of maloth. A small smile was given before it suddenly faded away....

Her right hand slowly raised motioning them to bring it on.....she loved that maloth was getting stronger...he was progressing quite greatly believe it or not.* - Fri Oct 16 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would of watched as maloth sped back towards her. Both her hands raised quickly upwards stoping their downwards movement to her sides. Pushing forwards slighty, both attacks were met with one other as her feet bended and another creator formed within the one that she was currently in.  They heard the words clothes line but remained silent as she was completely focused...her calm emerald eyes slightly hidden as she looked directly at their excited face...they seemed to be enjoying themselfs to her knowledge and so she continued...

Her hair slowly floated upwards as her body went backwards before suddenly being sent backwards when their arm launched fowards sending her backwards with a cushioned blow since she did put up her hands in time to accurately deffend herself completely. Skidding along the pavement, she rolled once backwards before raising back up with her gaze on them. A soft breathe of air would leave her lips as both arms dangled at her sides. Raising up rather slowly back into a proper standing position,...she coughed slightly before giving off a nervous smile.

"c-clothes l-line?"

she said  as she rubbed her right arm...it was a little damaged from his last attack.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch they entered gate two pushing forwards towards her form.,,their stature had healed...and their body reenergizing as it seemed they had endless energy...They were now even faster than before which slightly surprised the nervous girl...his development was showing greatly at the moment

Jumping up within the air, her body would of twisted in a blur as her right foot was extended outwards. A violet hurricane surrounded her form as her right leg extended outwards. The wind that expanded outwards would slightly hult their movement or slow them down as well as damaging them a bit leaving way for her right leg to smash against his form. As said by his words and his words alone, a greater creator formed between the both of them causing minature rocks to fly upwards before the violent hurriacane expanded outwards into nothing ness......Those around them would feel a strong gust of wind blow on them...

Upon landing at a small distance away from them. A nervous smile was given as she watched their muscles untence and shrink back to its normal bulky size.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be exiting the village and she would begin walking rather slowly across the vast plane of dirt that seemed unending with maloth.The silence they had walked in was almost almost deffening if it wasent for the earth rattering steps that the the giant took. The nervous girls gaze was on them as she lagged behind him slightly due to their fastened pace led by their egarness to find a fight or spar to partake in. A soft breath of air left her lips as she soon spoke trying to start a conversation...the trees starting to come into view over the horizon. "u-umm.....do you want...to s-spar while t-trying to r-reach our l-location?" The nervous girl asked questionly...they were curious to wheiter they wanted to do so or not. It would of been really helpfull since this could have proved as a good training exerscise. Soon she stopped at the large gap before continueing her speech. " h-how about....we jump over the t-this large g-gap....and w-when we l-land...we c-continue our m-movement i-into the f-forest...h-how does that s-sound."

There was a long moment of pause as she awaited the brutes answer on her question...if they did not accept..she would give a nod before going gate one and takeing a step back...her hair changing to a pure yellow color while her hair turned pure white before dashing forwards in a slight blur and jumping into the air. Gliding over the gap...the nervous girl would then land on the other side before continueing her rather slow walk towards kohonoa...Her body shaking as the earth shook struggling to hold maloths weight when they landed a bit behind and besides them.............However...if they did accept...she would of still went gate one and jumped over the large gap...but upon landing,..as her right foot had touched the ground,...their body would of twisted in a spin aiming to slam her right leg into his stomach area before they landed aiming to make fall back onto the ground before jogging forwards with a barbarian chasing after them.....if she was successful in doing that action...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would sigh slightly as they were sent skidding slightly...the attack was ment for before they landed on the ground not after..but still they tanked it before landed on their feet skidding backwards only slightly. A nervous smile was given as she exited her gate mode and continued onto kohonoa after hearing their words...it seemed they wanted to go directly straight to kohonoha without any sort of spar or stops along the way...however she remained slightly behind them as her pace slowed only by a bit remaining behind the brute that was her student...oh dear...
