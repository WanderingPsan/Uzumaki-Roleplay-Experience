Pushing off the gollems shoulder and higher up into the air, she stayed susspened for a moment as the gollem went back downwards towards the ground...she figured now it was the best time to test out the new taijutsu technique she had been practicing for a while now....soon she can become a rookie in using the technique...but for now...it was just the concept..

Her body tilted backwards as she began to twist her body in a circular motion...falling downwards towards the ground. a hurrane began to surround her form and expand outwards.

A soft breath of air escaped her lips  as she watched the earth tremble before her as it fell backwards and crashing down onto the ground. Upon landing in a crouching position, she rose back up and began breathing inwards and outwards rather slowly....slightly heavily before suddenly calming down her breathing....as her teacher had stated before...if she lost control of her breathing in a fight....they may end up losing instead.

Her arms remained dangling at her sides as a nervous smile formed on her lips as the golem had gotten up guarding its face to defend itself from any more strikes from the female.  Bending her legs slighty she woudl begin jumping upwards  and later downwards slowly slightly above the ground awaiting for the next series of attacks to happen......their arms dangling controlably following the movement. Her calm pure yellow eyes lowered slightly as they realised they would soon be at their limit...so she should trie to find the right certain areas to strike. They had just wanted to hit the head because she thought it was a being of its own.....but instead attacking the head had made it smaller.

Upon hearing the words they spoke however, she looked over to where they had ended up or where the voice had came from. A small smile was given to them as she felt like this had been fun...kenshin probably had fun doing this as well.

"o-oh...t-thanks....i..f-find alot of t-taijutsu users will f-find yoru golem...u-usefull"

She really wants to do this again later in the future...but she hoped they were able to test their golems durability and was great enough as they thought it would be. She douted that only a few people would be able to break it with their fists alone. Maybe chakra blades....she did not know since they did not specialize in those type of things. 

Looking over towards Bryson as she heard them speak, a nervous smile would have been given. "u-umm...n-nice to m-meet you...b-bryson..m-my right t-thigh is b-brused...and i have a few s-scraches...i-is..t-that...bad?" The nervous girls face was slightly covered in scraches and the right shoulder of her robe as slightly ripped revealing the red inner kimono she wore below it.

HEr eyes seemingly closed as she exhaled sloftly feeling a warmth it gave off as she slowly began to be healed why his powerus.

"p-paine....t-thats what im c-called..."

She replied as her eyes opened rather slowly looking up towards them. Her eyes would of changed back to an emerald green color  while her hair changed back from a pure white color to an black.

"D-do not lay up for y-yourselves.....treasures on e-earth.....where m-moth and r-rust destroy and w-where thieves b-break in a-and steal, b-but lay up for y-yourselves t-treasures.....i-in heaven, where n..neither m-moth nor rust...d-destroys and....w-where thieves do not b-break.....i-in and s-steal. For where y-your treasure is..... t-there your heart will be a-also."

She paused for a moment reciting a scripture from the bible she had remebered the pope saying before she arrived at suna. She wanted to be sure they understood...that their hearts would not waver....that he did not choose her as a material position...and had chosen herself...to make themselfs...into a sinful man.....by enjoying the pleasures...of man.....he can recieve all he wants when they go off to heaven....she she herself would be there one day as well...

It was then her hands automatically raised up to catch a bag of rice...it was on reflex. A small smile would be given to them. "t-thanks..." A bag of rice...juse what she always wanted ...yay!!!* - Sun Oct 11 05:25:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would enter the arena at her own rather slow pace before suddenly stoping when she was in the middle it. Breathing inwards, she breathe outwards regulating her breathing and making sure it was calm so she would not hold back her attackes. They wanted to hear the wind that her kicks gave off to make sure it was at a proficent level....it was what her teacher had told her. They began jumping upwards rather slowly into the air before landing on the ground...the movement began to repeat..before gradually becoming quicker untill it was at a moderate pace. Her arms began to dangle at her sides...but controlably following the movement. Under her hat, her facial features was currently emotionless as they seemed to be thinking about something close to them...

Seemingly closing her calm emerald eyes, a slight shift in her body happened but untraceable as she returned to her position. To those with good eye sight....it would of been a blurred round house kick sent into the air infront of them. To those without good eyesight...they were only see the shift in her body as they jumped upwards and downwards..and also  hear the sound of an object cutting though the wind. They decided to take it easy only practicing her kicks...she had to improve...she felt that she had to....she also had to train maloth as she promised to....
