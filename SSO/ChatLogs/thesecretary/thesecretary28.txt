They then doashed forwards before leaping into the air and throwing it downwards towards her. The nervous girls lips slowly formed into a small smile as she bent her knees slightly before kicking upwards towards the rock that was coming down on her. The upper part of her body twisted and the lower half of their body followed suit in a blurred like state. A hurricane began to surround her form as her right foot extended outwards aiming to slam into the rocks side sending it off right.

"mmm..."

Her eyes however stayed on Momura's form as the rock was kicked away in sheer force. She was curious to see what they would do next.* - Sun Nov 22 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as usual, her spin would of continued one more as she had done in every fight and spar she had done since in the past as it was part of her combo. Their right leg would have retracted and their left leg would have been brought out. Both hands clenched as she pulled her left foot forwards and sent it towards their elbow sending them backwards forcefully before landing on the ground in a spinning motion before coming to a stop after one rotation. The female however did not let up just yet...she wanted to see what else the little girl could do with their limited skill set.....

The consealed figure began running forwards before kicking off their right foot while their left was still planted on the ground as their body spun aiming to give the female a round house kick aiming to smash their leg into their shoulder.....but this of course happened when they had almost been back up on their feet.* - Sun Nov 22 17:03:08 2015
