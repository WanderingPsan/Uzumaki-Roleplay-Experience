She guessed this could have been an exception since this was not a technique type of training session. Reaching into her kimono with both hands, it began to lossen a bit as time passed. After a few moments, she took out ten rubber balls which suddenly vanished from her hands before she reached into her kimono once more and took out twenty balls which suddenly vanished in her grasp.  This action was done once mroe but this time their would be twenty more balls vanishing from her arms in a shift of her body.

As she was doing this, the nervous girl would say. "c-chikyu...you may j-join....umm..now then...you a-all...will s-spar me...at the s-same time.....and..." A loud 'CHACHHH' sound was soon heard coming off the walls of the arena which surrounded them as she paused her words before continueing again. " t-try not to g-get hit by the r-rubber b-balls.." A nervous smile would be given to them as she took a step back. A rubber ball would pass by infront of her face before she came to a stop.  "b-begin." A nervous smile would form on her face...they wanted to see what exactly they would do...what they would acomplish working as a team...how this will help them in the future...and if they were ready for this type of training....

However when this action had happened, this caused the whole entire ball to become quished. Her right foot kicked off of the sandy surface soon after and the upper part of her body twisted as she released her pull on momoura and spun around them. During this action a rubber ball suddenly met its mark on her right side as her right foot touched the ground sumbling slightly, her teeth clenched slightly as her breathing began to seem slightly irregular. The nervous female allowing Momura to run past her. 

Rubbing her side as she watched Chikyu and Hiroshi make their way closer to the female, they decided to povote backwards as she watched two balled pass by each of her sides towards her privous location during her backwards movement. Opening her mouth, the female would say "u-umm...they have...i-iorn in the m-middle.." A nervous slightly weak smile formed as she coped with the pain she had just felt from one of her own thrown rubber balls.  Her heart and will...egarly awaiting to see what the three of them would do next since...kinami...once again did not want to train with the rest of her student....or something had been bothing them that she did not know of...oh dear...* - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015

Her focus had remained on them not noticing rias or anyone else, the female seemed to be very serious when it came to training and what not.  Landing on her feet sliding backwards a little before pushing off her feet and running forwards back to momura.  Their body suddenly vanished in a blur...but she ended up in a couching position holding her right shoulder. 

They did this skill to avoid the ball that was aiming to hit the right side of her back where her heart was...that would of caused her some difficutly in moving which may have made her get hit by momuras attack.  As the ball that grazed her was flying forwards past her with momoura infront of her at this time. Her right foot extened upwards kicking against her own ball......the ball being carried by the bottom of her foot to meet against momuras extended hand.

Ther left hand at this time was sent forwards towards the ground while her right hand was going to meet it at its respected side.* - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015

Her hands already onto ground as she pushed off her hands and launched into the air....sideway like a sping....both legs extended outwards.....one coliding with the ball that they had hit which slightly went off target and grazed her ribs. A sturdy 'bang' sound was heard as her foot colided with the steel of their blade. Her right eye closed as she nearly avoided the ball that was headed towards her face grazing her cheek which caused the graze to her ribs to happen.

The left leg that was extended outwarrds would be sent towards them colliding with the ball a milisecond to late as he kick it  only to have it slightly mis directed as both of their feet met. A soft breath of air would leave her lips as she hummed softly towards the slight pain that was delt to her stomach area.  

When both her feet met their oppoents sword and foot...they both would have been pushed backwards before she landed of her feet and jumped into the air, her body twisted and the rest of her body followed in a spinning motion as her right leg extended forwards aiming to hit hideo or chikyu on their left shoulder if hideo had dodged. They were also lined up as well.  The balls had passed by her as she moved....her intent on hitting them...but unsure if her attack can actually hit...* - Sun Nov 29 04:35:12 2015

A violent hurricane began to surround her form and all 40 something balls now swayed off their intended direction and followed the current before droping to the ground as she landed in a couching position. Extending her right hand, she waited for Chikyu to take it.

If they had taken it, she would have pulled them back up to their feet as she was raising up as well before releasing moments later and rubbing her side. That first ball really hurt...* - Sun Nov 29 04:53:58 2015
