<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) a soft breath of air had escaped her lips as she was about speak about how kronos had died...she felt it was her fault that they had met that faith....maybe if they had not left...kenshin's village would not of been over run with a sand tsunami.....that she was luckly able to out of range of when it had happened.....maybe if she had not left.....kronos....would not of had to battle zetsumo....katsune would not have died...maybe she could of helped with  whatever had happened to them....She left them to ask for help of zetsumo....her old friend from kohonoha when they were younger. 

Her hands clenched slightly before it was suddenly released as she heard Bryson's voice and hearing the motion of the both of them dating. Her clenched hands suddenly lossened as her gaze went onto Bryon."u-umm...im not d-dating anyone...." she spoke before lowering her voice into nothingness towards the end. Her thoughts began to go onto what zetsumo had said before about them being not a hero...or just a fake.....were they right....had she loved a fool and was just to dimmed  out to believe other wise....maybe being a fool....was what she was designed to be....Shaking her head a few times a soft breathe of hair left her lips before a nervous smile was given towards the group of people before her.

"u-umm...you wanted....a s-spar....and w-we can t-talk after b-bryson..."

She wanted to get rid of the thoughts she currently had in her head...something to make her forget for the moment....and a spar seemed like the best option...They spoke trying to change the subject...change the conversation....she felt she would be better able to deal with the conversation after...the spar.* - Sun Oct 11 23:50:11 2015

His words echoing in her head for a moment or two before exiting. Her gaze slowly looked over towards Susumu as they walked away towards their spot. She had no reply towards their words..mostly because she did not want to believe it....someone that way because of her...it was impossible. A nervous smile appared on her lips as she began jumping up and down rather slowly before turning sideways, her arms would dangel from her side controlably following the rhytemic movement of her jumping. Her breathing began to become slow and regulated in remeberance of the words her mentor had stated.

"mm..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would notice them bitting their finger....and also began speaking in some random giberish. Suddenly stopping her movement, she began to remain motionless before begining to walk forwards towards Susumo....she wanted this spar to last longer than a moment which was why she did not run. The nervous girl had wanted the both of them to have fun during this fight by using each others techs to their fullest.  Her nervous smile slowly began to fade away leaving an expressionless face....the black hair she had slowly began to turn slightly white before fading away...strands of hair dangling side to slide as her arms waved back and forth with each step they took......Her emerald eyes seemingly closed  as she breath inwards before opening them when she exhaled almost un noticeablly....she was awaiting for something to pop up like zetsumo had done when he summoned his ducks...or maybe this was different.

"mm..."

A soft hum came from her lips as her calm emerald gaze remained on the oppoenent infront of her. She was awaiting the exciting moment of the necromancer to do something great....no regrets in love and war...it was time to get this battle started...rawr!!!* - Mon Oct 12 00:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) shakes her head, she felt the others used tricks like that as well in a spar.....she would only accept if a spar if it was fujitora or someone they now feeling they can fight like that with eachother.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was about to vanish in a slight blur before she heard the words of Bryson. Suddenly stoping, she turned to face them with a face of no expresson...the nervous girl did not mind losing in a spar..they just disliked when it was a dishonest loss...that was all...this training did not help her improve at all...But yes...there should be nothing for Bryson to worry about if they were worried about her in some way.

"mm...?"* - Mon Oct 12 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would listen to the words they had spoken and remained silent as they made their way closer to her. Looking up as they spoke, she heared about them speaking about  the love confession that creeped her out a bit...they had no idea to the response they had given....if it was a curse..then wouldent reciting the words from bible prove worth of being usefull against such.,,,wouldent the bible protect them from the curse. A nervous smile would of then begin given feeling that she was speaking to a tainted priest. "u-umm...i w-will.."

Those were the only words she could say...there was nothing else to say exactly...She was unsure of if it was the right thing or wrong thing...to say...she felt that she was dealing with a priest that had falled off of gods favor...a fallen angel."a-are they t-that bad?"* - Mon Oct 12 01:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would arrive once more at arena, she decided to be alone once more hoping the area had been cleared out...she disliked being around a large group of people and prefered to be alone once more. Closing her eyes, she breathe inwards before exhaling a deep breath of air. She had to get back to her training that she was distracted from a moment ago....maybe....she should ask the priest for a spar...but then again...it felt that this village was not into having fun fist fights with eachother....they were more into magical summonings or attacks and what not....she felt that the only person that can full fill her need to spar would be fuji...or maloth..mostly maloth because she knew they would never give up on sparing.  Shaking her head rather slowly getting rid of the thought, a nervous smile formed from her lips as she jumped upwards and later landed on her feet. She was happy she was able to forget about her previous thoughts before this happened....but now she had to figure out how to counter those type of people...maybe she just needed to get faster like zetsumo had told her before they died.

Opening her eyes rather slowly, they began to jump upwards going slightly above before landing on her feet. Jumping upwards once more, she remained suspended for a momment or two before landing on her feet. Shaking her arms, she jumped once more into the air before landing on her feet at a slightly faster rate than before....but kept the tempo...a soft breathe of air escapeing her lips as her breathing began to become regulated once more. Jumping upto the air, the upper part of the nervous girls body twisted and they began to spin in a blur. Their right leg extended outwards as a hurricane like figure surrounded her form...they pulled their leg with all their strength. Once the attack had been made, during her second rotation...she retracted that leg and extended her left leg aiming for the same area before retracting the left leg and extending her right leg once more as they came downwards for a leg sweep.

A cloud of sand dust would of been  as her foot skidded along the ground before her hurricane like wind extended outwards before vanishing. She felt...off.* - Mon Oct 12 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) remained in a crouching position leaving her right hand to keep its placing on the ground. The nervous girl inhaled and later exhaled softly staring had the rocky wall ahead of her..the nervous girl found herself wondering why exactly she was here..they had come to see how zenaki was doing...but had not seen them since the day before...and she called someone master..it was a strange feeling and seeing katsune take the blame for something happening based on her call occured once more....it seemed she had just motioned them to come in even though everyone else had wanted them outside of the village for one reason or another......the placement of things felt....weird to them...but she as usuall remained silent and said nothing of it....

Their situations usually ment nothing to her...however...if zenaki had taken a liking to him and was so intent on calling them master...then whom was she to tell them otherwise....however...if it was someone causing them to be called that word...it was something else entirerly.....however...she knew how zenaki and the others loved playing twisted games with their pets....it was well....only natural to be called as such...so she never found it as something strange. Pushing off her feet, they now sored forwards into the air...her left leg extened outwards while her right leg retracted.  Paine decided to do a jump kick towards the air infront of them before landing on her feet. 

As she landed, her body twisted into a spin as she aiming to send a round house kick towards the invisable sparing partner that was infront of her form....her training was starting to get better.* - Mon Oct 12 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) , after the round house kick was made, her body was leaned backwards before raising up her fists as throwing punched towards the area infront of them. Her fists began moving in blurs as it was sent towards the path ahead of her as she tried to make her punches faster than it was before and much more swifter. Sure she can throw punches...but for now she wanted to improve in her accuracy. With each punch, she exhaled a soft breath of air before pulling back that fist and extending her other fist in a slight blur before retracting it swiftly and sending the next one. Her mind was currently on what had trying to get stronger...as strong as zetsumo wanted her to be....maybe if she had been strong enough...they would have been to injured to go along with the others to kiri...maybe zetsumo would of lived....maybe...zenaki would not of had to suffer so badly as they are now...

"mm..."

Her emerald eyes lowered slightly upon as each punch was sent as her emerald eyes begining to grow dull. Their hair shifting from left to right as each punch was sent and her teeth gritting as tears began to escape her eyes...she did not want comfort...she wanted the strength to protect the ones she loved...she wanted power...so she would never make the same mistake again.....she wanted friends...whom would be happy enough to depend on her....she wanted....people....that could trust her...She was never good at talking to people and they just left her alone wondering why they left...just stareing at their back as they walked away...

Her life...felt like a joke...* - Mon Oct 12 06:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) hands would continue moving in blurs uncontrolably as tears slowly ran from her eyes. They were begin driven by emotions once again. Her movements trace able to her own eyes, but had not known about the others. They had to become faster...they had to become stronger....for the future. She would train alone just like this and become better...yes that was what the nervous girl was planning to do...but in the end was pulled back by maloth in her new chapter of her shinobi life. The man had asked her for assistance in their training and she had accepted gracefully....she had always wondered if that choice was right...they were the ones whom convinced her to be around people so she could talk to others more on a regular basis...but so far she had not enjoyed it at all....being hit on was an akward feeling to her...and the only person she had loved...had become waste in the ground by now.....they were still recoving from their death and wanted nothing to do with love for now...

The nervous girls punched began to slow for a moment as she sniffled. They needed to get a hold of themselves...she had allowed herself to think about things that were deep within her heard. Shaking her head for a moment, she chose to get rid of such thoughts. They readyed her self to jump upwards into the air, she would of tripped on her own foot before falling onto the ground face first....oh dear...Both hands moved upwards along the ground before being used to push her self up slowly. The nervous girls hair dangled covering both sides of her face while the straw hat she wore covered her front. 

"mm..."* - Mon Oct 12 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) right hand slowly raised as the other supported her body. Soon a fist formed before it was sent back downwards towards the ground causing the ground to crack below her. A soft breath of air left her lips as she banged her hand against the ground once more...her hair jiggling in different direction uncontrolablly from the nervous girls rage...the tears she held back for a long time...trying to reseal them again...she did not like this feeling at all...she wanted to be strong like the other had been...so was zetsumo right.The nervous girls movements suddenly stoped as she stared at the ground...her eyes slowly lowered for a moment as both hands raised to hold her head as they breath inwards and later outwards rather slowly.....trying to make her self calm once more...she had to hold it in....

Slowly raising up to her feet, she began dusting off her clothing...her dull calm emerald eyes being hidding under straw hat. Raising up her right arm, she began wiping her eyes as she began jumping upwards and downwards rather slowly getting ready to continue her training alone on her own...within her own solitude...as some one of her type had deserved...They would not notice anyone enter the arena...but it would look like she had fallen and was getting up to train again after all they were a clutz.* - Mon Oct 12 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would hear the voice of yan and her movement suddenly came to a stop as she looked at her hands that were held up to her chest level before lowering them slowly to her side. Slowly lowering her hands to her side, yan would notice they were shaking slightly...the nervous girls  emerald green calm slightly dulled out eyes looked upon their form.  Her mouth began to open slightly but no words came out...she choked as her eyes slowly began to water again...

they were worried about her...from what she heard  of what they had been saying. His friendly smile seemingly all so welcoming and what not. HEr body remained motionless as she seemingly froze...they did not like people seeing her this way....the way she released her emotions....on things she was sad about...the way she released her emotions...on the things that disspointed her..and yet...this was one of the first people whom saw...

Her tears would begin going down her cheeks...she had to remain strong...in the past....endure all the hatefull comment...on things she had to become better at..she was mostly a dissappointment...and always will be...she suspected in the eyes of others. The nervous girl remained frozen in place with her arms dangling at her eyes unable to speak shaking slightly as tears rolled down her cheek...she...felt...ashamed..* - Mon Oct 12 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be stareing at him for a moment or two before they sudden had extended and arm for her. The nervous girl had stared at the arm which welcomed them....she pondered on wheither she had deserved it...did she deserve a hug from a person with such a warm smile. Her right foot raised rather slowly taking her first step before suddenly stumbling and falling to her knees while both hands rested onto the ground to catch her self. Her breathing became slightly heavy before pushing herself up into a standing position stumbling forwards before placing her hands on his shoulders when they had reached...Her head was tilted downwards a bit.....she wanted a hug...she really did...but did not know if she herself...deserved such a thing from a stranger such as themselfs. 
"d-do....i d-deserve such a t-thing.."She said softly and lout enough for them to hear as she pushed them back slightly. She wanted to save those from terrible fates...she wanted the world around her to be peace without the fear of death...or was that all a lie...what did she exactly want...one person said power....the other said to save others...and the last said peace.....she was not sure what she wanted....she was not sure whom she liked or loved...they were useless and could not think for themselves...but had her own opinions on things and said no when she felt appropreate to say so....so what exactly does she feel...like...and what is this weakness and pain swelling up inside her...it felt...sickening....

"d-do....i...d-diserve...s-such a t-thing..."

The girls grip thighened as her head tilted upwards allowing her emerald eyes to meet their own....the nervous girl was confused...she did not know about herself...her teeth were shown slightly as they clenthed together sloftly....she always drowned out this feeling...but wanted to hear the answer yan had...what was his answer to how they felt...were they just going to comfort the nervous girl with a hug...she wanted to hear his word...his feeling...his will....his power...and his redemption. It was evident...that they wanted to hear their true words...which would sooth the nervous girls heart so this feeling could be forgotten...however...it will stay as a memory of her life...she would stay with or have to stay with forever....but if they could just...ease the pain..in the slightest...then maybe they would be able to move on to the future...without any hinderances...Her clenched teeth slowly stopped and loosned....

"i-im...s-sorry..."

She said as she pulled away slowly letting go of the grip on his shoulder suspecting that she did not get hugged...unless they were pulled into it by them...she would of looked away slightly and stared at the mountain side aiming to forget the action had happened...but...thats...a lie....* - Mon Oct 12 09:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) // "i-"

She would try to say as she was about to pull away but then felt her arm was grabbed before being pulled into his embrace...her body bet his own as her arms remained dangling at her side....his own hand gentily letting go before drifting the arm across her back as the other had done the same as well. Her shaking slowly came to a stop feeling their warmth and they seemed motionless...their words feeling full of life while he had said them....it was the words everyone wanted to hear....it was the words she wanted to hear as well..They...seemed a stranger like them...careing for a clutz like her whom only proved to be a hinderance in the battle field....this person...seemed different...no...angel seemed different from most others....would...they really beable to seek comfort from them...they accepted them.?.....they...accepted them....they....accepted them.....they....will overcome...her problems with her...they will....over come her troubles with her.....will she ever...meet someone like them...elsewhere....

They would hear the nervous girls heart beatting a bit faster as her breathing began to grow slightly faster.....she never really hugged men other than kronos before....and that was four years ago...her hands clenched as her eyes closed. She felt his head on her shoulder...but remained silent for now as her tears slowly stopped and small sniffles were heard. When they had pulled back a nervous smile would of been seen....wanted to say something but could not at the moment.....she just did not know what to say.....it was one of those moments...when a person was surrpised after recieving a surprise hug that they werent expecting to get...* - Mon Oct 12 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) , blinking a few times, an arm slowly to wipe her eyes and face. After a few moments, her hand would lower to her side revealing her emerald hues once again. " t-thanks...umm..." she said before giving them a nervous smile once more.* - Mon Oct 12 10:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be walking along the academy path at her own slow pace. With each step her clothes shifted from left from left to right with each step her took...her hair slightly jiggled while her head tilted downwards slightly to cover her calm emerald eyes that lowered slightly. The sounds of children clouded her ears and the space around her..as their mind began to drift on what had happened last night. A soft breathe of air escaped her lips before suddenly hearing the words of zenaki and suddenly her movements had come to a stop....her gaze slowly looking up towards the taller women whom was before her. Thinking for a few moments about her answer a nervous smile would suddenly appear and was given to zenaki.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervous smile as she followed behind them into the hospital...the area seemed loud and what not which ment the area was very busy probably. A nervous smile would of been given to the nurses as a small smile appared on her lips...they loved helping those whom were injured...or those that were old...maybe she should of done this...but then again they may end up killing patients instead of actually helping them. Facing back towards the path infront of her...she continued on before suddenly stoping when a door was opened and she was later let inside. Leaning against the wall next the enterance as the door closed, she remained silent as they began to work on doctor or medical stuff. Upon hearing a question delivered to her, the nervous girl nodded rather slowly....to be honest...she had only been in a paitents room so the doctors office was a new step in the right direction; However, she wanted to stay by the door because they did not want to touch anything or break anything in a hospital that was trying to be constructed.

"mm..."

A soft breath of air left her lips as her head tiltted downwards slightly allowing her hat to cover her calm emerald eyes as she waited. "i-its..very....n-neat.."* - Mon Oct 12 15:48:28 2015

A nervous smile appeared before walked out the door behind zenaki as she followed them to a new room which was for private practice. When she had reached , the nervous girl sat down on the bed as they spoke about examineing her...She did not mind...not one bit....since zenaki was watching them and their movements...however there was one thing she had to say and was going to say it.

"u-umm...no cutting please.."

she said as both hand raised to pull back her straw hat allowing it to rest at the back on her head revealing her face. * - Mon Oct 12 16:09:48 2015

Turning around, she would begin walking towards the changeing room closed the curtain behind  her. After a few moments had passed, she had taken off her clothes and came back in with a patients clothing. Sitting back down on the bed that was provided for her.  Her hair was currently let loss from her poney tail allowing  bangs to slightly cover both sides of her face and slightly in the middle covering her eyes. She never cut her hair, so it mostly ended up like this when she took it out of its hold.

"u-umm..whats next."

she said with slightly blured vision due to the hair that covered her eyes.* - Mon Oct 12 16:32:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would lay down on her back before nodding meaning that they were ready for them to do what was needed to be done.  When they felt them touch her toes, they would notice she would suddenly shiver slightly before coming to a stop. Her slightly covered eyes were stareing at the ceiling as they breath inwards and later outwards slightly heavily...but remained calm overall to her best ability.

"mm..."* - Mon Oct 12 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would feel nothing but very soft skin, she was perfectly great...but as they reached her thigh areas her muscles tensed as her blurred gaze went onto zenaki.

As she heard that they were about to move onto her upper body, the nervous girl would nod rather slowly...but her body began shaking slightly...she was scared to say the least...but tried to be brave nodding rather slowly towards their request...and zenaki was there....so she believed that it was fine for them to continue. Closing her eyes, they would begin to breath inwards and outwards slowly and calmly awaiting for the body feels to be over..

Looking over towards zenaki as they spoke, she would nod rather slowly...she was feeling uncomfortable to say the truth.  "u-umm...can we s-stop here..."  Looking up towards them, a nervous smile appared...assuming they said yes, she would push herself off the best before landing on her feet....but stumbled and fell to the ground infront of her. The nervous girls body seemed to be shaking ever so slightly as she pushed herself off of the ground and began heading in the direction of the clothing room at a rather slow pace..

Once she had reached her destination, they closed the curtain behind them and began changing out of the paitents clothing and back within her usual clothes. The red and black cloak which was used to conceal her form and the straw hat she wore to conseal most of her facial features...they sat back down on the bench that was located in the changing room as her hands clenched onto the bench. 

The nervous girl decided to wait a while before coming out of the stall.* - Mon Oct 12 18:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would suddenly stop when she was at the arena once more before going into a meditative position. The nervous girl was going to train with her mentors once more in her mindscape ..she felt a bit better about herself...she felt her wounds healing a bit...emotional.wounds at least..but not much. However she was getting better...a soft breath of air escaped her lips as her hands raised and was rested on her lap. Closing her eyes she listened to the wind that surrounded her form before later vanishing  towards which ever direction it or she wanted to take. The dust being kicked up into the air before expaned slowly being carryed by the wind as it dashed back onto the ground....the sound around her begining to become a blur as they focused...going into what was called...her meditative world...where her teachers resided.....to help her achieve the next stage of her training...

---Mind Scape---

Opening her eyes slowly, they found themselves at the tree and felt her head resting on something warm. Raising up her head, she saw kyo before trying to move her legs and notice the little girl was on them...there name....Chi...it was such a cute and the nervous girl gave off a small smile...."ahh so your...awake huh...our training is over...that last spar...was a great one and you seemed to look better rejuvenated...did something good happen...on the other side?" he whispered slowly as he rose from his sitting position at her side before paine rose up as well with a white bunny on her head allowing chi to sleep under the blankets a bit more. A nervous smile was given as they began to lead the way towards the back of the shine before pointing in the northing direction. "u-umm..n-nothing much.." she stated as she passed them before feeling a hand resting on her shoulder. "uhh...not so fast..pick up this stack of books..i so ever so creatively written...and take them with you....follow the path further up the mountain...and dont stray.." A slightly akward smile formed as she had to lift up the heavy stack of books...but when she picked it up...they would notice that it was suprising like this time...which was strange...it was usually to heavy for her to carry...

"..mmm...u-umm...g-good bye.."

The nervous girl stated as she began to walk away from the shrine. Kyo would just watch with a wide smile before the children of the shine surrounded kyo and watched as paine walked away asking him if she was going to come back to them one..day...overhearing such talk...her movements suddenly stoped before turning around to look back at them. A nervous smile of her own would of been given as she spoke. "u-umm...im be back..s-soon...d-dont worry..." she said certain that they would make it back to them soon...but even that she was unsure of...it was all up to her masters...but the next one remained unknown to her...she would just have to guess...however she hoped...that they would be nice...and actually trained her this time....however...what kyo captialized was in resting...and in healing...she hoped..that this would prove usefull...that this knowledge...will help her...in future problems...they may face with themselves.* - Mon Oct 12 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) ,after walking a mile, she sat down infront of a tree after resting the pile of books besides her. The rabit that was on her head would of jumped down onto her lap using it as a resting place.. A nervous smile appared on her lips as she closed her eyes and began to sleep aswell.

__Mind Scape Vision End__

Opening up her eyes rather slowly, the nervous girl raised up calmly breathing inwards and outwards before begining to walk northwards, she also had head to kumo soon...so she had to get ready.* - Mon Oct 12 21:01:39 2015
