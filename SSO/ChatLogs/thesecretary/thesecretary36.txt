"mm.....h-how about you p-practive your k-kicks on m-me?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Y'know, funnily enough, I didn't know that? But I'm not teasing or kidding. If you like me, I'm fine with that- personally, I don't favor either gender, really... beauty is beauty- but I've got a minimum age on people I'd date. - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Mrm. Yeah... and before you ask- no, it's not that you're not pretty. It's that I'd feel like a pedo or something, goin on a date with someone less than sixteen yearso ld. - Wed Dec  2 09:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: No... No I understand, don't worry about that. I really do. I'm.. just surprised theres another girl thats like me. And even if its in a few years, that she might want to date me. - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: You are suprised by this after we earlier this day talked about how Lera and Kiyoko- also two girsl- are getting married? - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh no! I knew there were others like me, like you said Lera and Kiyoko. I just didn't think any of my friends would like people of the same gender, and then beyond that actually like me in return. I'm normally just...used to it being one sided. - Wed Dec  2 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah, I see... Mrm. Well- I mean. I think the way you tend to act is kinda cute, you're fun to fight, generally fun to spend time with.. I get along with you- and I like both genders, so... I mean, I figure if you turn out to have a crush on me, it'd be pretty smooth. I guess that's an odd sounding way to put it- but.. - Wed Dec  2 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: The way I see it, someone I know I can be freinds with, would be someone pretty safe to date? - Wed Dec  2 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Well... I mean I never look at my friends that way. Maybe this event thing has gone to my head a bit, but I really don't want to view my friends as merely crushes. Though- I think you're really beautiful, if you don't mind that coming from a younger person.  - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I guess I see what you mean. Honestly, I'da never guessed you where into chicks if not for this whole thing... - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: You also fun, nice to talk with, you have a really solid way with thoughts and words. I guess fun to fight you as well, though you seem to enjoy it a bit too much. *She softly elbows Mitsunara in the side* - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh, it's whatever, I s'pose... Mrm. I guess I think of dating a bit over logically- but then.. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I think of most things that aren't fighting a bit too logically.. and I think of fighting with almost no logic at all, bwahaha! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ahh.. Heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Gah... You and Rias both said that, I thought it be obvious... Maybe I should wear a badge or something. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: I don't think with much logic in either. Hehehe! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I don't see how it's really that obvious until such time as you actually show attraction to a chick. How am I s'posed to guess someone's sexuality unti they do something to show it off? - Wed Dec  2 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh... I guess so... Hmm, ah that makes this all much harder. I have to be friends with people, as while subtly showing I'm attracted to them without making it seem thats the only reason I'm friends with them... Phhffaa! This is all really hard to think about. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And stuff like this? - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Is why I don't even try to be subtle about that kinda stuff. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Too much hassle. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Hmm... Sounds good... I guess I'll be more obvious about this stuff. I guess I'll test it on you first! I think you look really pretty in that kimono you always wear. - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean, more often than not, I won't be picking up on subtle signals from someone else... and I'm no good at i- - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I really like how the red contrasts the white, though, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Yeah... Well, my dad raised me like a boy for most of time. So I just tended to train without a shirt, and well.... when I started growing these. My dad forced me to wear something, and well... I just don't normally feel comfortable in something like that. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ah? Explains a lot... - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015

They seemed to be standing infront of a large rock that always seemed to be there when they trained. "u-umm..stand h-here....and s-show me your k-kicks...." She stated as she awaited for to show her their skill in the arts of leaf whirlwind. They wanted to see their powers and how much they would of could have excelled in a short or long period of time before asking her such a thing.

"umm...and m-make sure..to g-go as fast as y-you can...and your p-power out put...m-must be s-strong....begin.."

A soft breathe of air would leave her lips as she thought for a moment before raising up her right hand and placing it on momuras shoulder softly....her mouth opening to say the word,"a-again....your w-wind...is b-bearly v-visable......r-remeber when h-hideo...was a-attacking..the r-rock the o-other day.......his w-wind was s-slowly becoming v-visable....with e-each s-strike he had d-done....so c-continue to do your s-strikes...and use k-kinami...m-mirai...and h-hideo as your e-example...and k-keep practiceing....even w-when your off...from the s-shop.

Her gaze over to stare at mirai for a few moment before speaking. " y-your w-wind is v-visable...but there...is n-no c-control....t-try to be m-more balanced with your m-movements....and t-try it o-once more..." Staying on two feet and spinning was different from being off balance and spinning. She hoped that mirai would become better in doing both actions.* - Wed Dec  2 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them both a nervous smile before she nodded rather slowly to herself.  Both of her students had used the skill with a novice level. Now all she had to do was teach this to hideo whom was close to mastering this skill. However...there would be slight difference between each of her students and the wind they produced given their different skill levels of taijutsu. "mm...umm i-its getting l-late...and umm....i would r-rather not t-travel when its d-dark......you two d-did a w-wonderfull job..." She would state before thinking for a moment. 

"mm..."

A soft hum would have left her lips as her almost dulled emerald eyes lowered slightly. She thought about wheither to take a cavern or to walk all the way to kohonoa. "A soft breath of air would leave her lips as she looked towards the exit of the area. Her mouth opened slowly as she said the words. "u-umm....w-when i r-return....il...umm...t-test your m-masteries...of t-the t-technique..." She would say before makeing her way towards the exit. "i w-will know......if you p-practiced or n-not....b-based on your w-wind....so p-please do s-so...on your f-free t-time..." 

She looked back for a moment to nervously smile towards them before looking back towards the road ahead of her....they were off to kohonoha and later her home.* - Wed Dec  2 22:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would have taken the cavern to kohonoa and when she had arrived at the village, she steped off the cavern and waved the driver a good bye while he gave the female a small smile and drove off. When the cavern had went far out of her vision, or well..far enough, her gaze went back upon the viillage as she stared at it in silence.  Workers went in and outwards with various materials trying to repair the reckage that was this village. Reaching into her cloak, her hand rose up to read the scroll saying the words, 'p-paine'.  Were, they mocking her nervousness....were...they..really just joking around...should she really be taking this to heart.

"mm..."

A soft breathe of air would leave her lips as she hummed softly....her mind wondering why she had not entered the gates yet...was it the momeries she had in the past...it had been long since zetsumo had died...but why did she still feel an ominous spirit within this village...why was her heart...no body...so unwilling to enter the village that rias so happily welcomed her to. "m-maybe...i shou-" She was suddenly pushed forwards by the crowd into the village and got out of it when they slightly went past the gate. Gasping for her slight loss of air, she looked back  around and forwards....noticing...finally noticing that she had actually went past the line that she was going to keep away from. Shaking her head slowly, they planned to disregard that feeling just for rias...she wanted to see how they were doing and how she was exactly holding up with the reconstruction and what not.

"w-where.....are...y-you...r-rias.." 

The nervous girl muttered under her breath as she walked forwards further into the village and felt the wind of the land of fire....blow against her....trying to keep her away...no trying to warn her...but the nervous female did not listen one  bit......just where or what exactly...was she going to get herself into now.* - Wed Dec  2 23:15:12 2015
