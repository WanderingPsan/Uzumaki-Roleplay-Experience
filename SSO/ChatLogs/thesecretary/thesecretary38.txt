She did not want to bend their diamond armor...those were rather hard to make..oh dear..* - Sat Dec  5 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink a few times as as a nervous blush appared an her face and her gaze darted elsewhere She was never used to being around good looking people....and had begun recently breathing inwards and outwards slowly to calm her heart rate. When they had laid down her gaze went back on them and both her hands raised slowly hesitating a little before being placed on their back She would feel a warm senseation on their cool body. Her hand woulds would move slowly massaging their back...going upwards towards their shoulders before trailing downwards slowly and loosing the muscles in their arms....she used to do this for her mother...but had never done something like this for anyone else...

Her hands then slowly went towards their butt...before going towards their thights and stoping there. "y-your...t-tense...you m-must..have umm...a l-lot of s-stress.' A nervous smile would form from her lips as she squeezed...softly...but couldnt.* - Sat Dec  5 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would coninue massaging her tights with one hand while her other went back to her butt massaging it slowly and carefully while her other drifted upwards and onto their bear back. The hand that was on her back began rubbing deeply but softly into the stiff areas as a soft breath of air left her lips and her emerald calm eyes lowered slightly...she was wondering if she made the right choice in coming to the elemental nations...did she really belong here with them knowing full and well that she was a forigener.

"u-umm....do i r-really...make you h-happy...?" 

She as curously as both her hands left their desired aeras before resting on her shoulders. They began to focus on that area since the shoulders were the most important area in terms of releaving stress. Her expression was currently emotionless as their almost dulled eyes looked down on her form....but if...they looked back...they would be met with a nervous smile.* - Sat Dec  5 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) hands would drift downwards slowly towards the area just below their shoulders.Her gaze was on the,....they loved her as much as kronos....Where they really this happy that she was giving them a massage. It was probably she herself being so stiff because they did not want to damage them due to her strength.  The female was taking it slow and steady and listened to rias's moans as they spoke...and knew that she could do atleast something right. Opening her mouth, she would say," t-thankyou.....i b-believe you....are t-the only other o-one....to l-love me..t-that much..." She would say softly.

Her hands then drifted downwards sliding along both sides of their body as she learned forwards a little. She hands went past the soft senseation of that being the side of their large breasts before going towards her ribs in which their bell also was. She began massaging that area slowly and carefully hoping to releve the stress their too. After a few minutes, the one hand drifted upwards and began rubbing the side of their left breast....the next time they got up...she wanted the person whom loved her so much to feel like there was no weight pulling them down....they wernt going to do this...but since they loved them so much....she decided to do it 

"t-thank you..."

The nervous female would say under her breathe....her expression still that of nothingness.....as she was thinking about her mother..."d-do you believe....in..umm..l-live..after d-death?" She asked curiously.* - Sat Dec  5 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) movements would pause for a moment as she saw rais turn over. Their nude body was facing her as she blinked a few times and her face showing a slight shocked expression with her mouth opened slightly before suddenly closing as a nervous blush appared on her face....this rather caught her by surprise. A nervous blush slowly appared on her face just before her hat tilted downwards hiding her eyes which slowly drifted away from their form. The nervous girl listened to their words as her eyes slowly drifted towards their face watching their blush. the shadow of her hat.

Both hands then extended forwards resting on both of her arms then went downwards and rested on the side of their breast as began rubbing them softly as she listned to the next half of their words. "t-then....i should...p-put..my m-mind...into...d-doing this?" She asked curiously as one hand remained at their breasts while the other hand drifted dowared towards their bottom half rubbing their thighs...from left to right slowly a slightly roughly aiming to loosen the stiff muscles she felt there...a small part of her wanted to hear them moan more.

A small smile would form on her lips. "then...y-you...dont mind..m-massaging me...n-next time?" she asked curously as she leaned in slightly  wanting to hear their answer clearly.* - Sat Dec  5 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would shiver slightly as she felt rias hand rubbing her thigh. Their left hand that was on their the side of their breast and move upwards and began rubbing the area around their breast but just below the nipples...that was an area she did not want to go just yet. Her ears listening to their words as her eyes were trailing down to where their hands were going before they suddenly seemed forced to their sides. THey were not completely relaxed now were they....her right hand would drift upwards slowly before sliding under their dress and began to rub their clut..but not sticking her fingers inside of their private area....she just wanted to rub most pleasurable and senseitive area of a female..hoping to melt their mind into pleasure and even more relaxsation.

"u-umm...t-thanks...i u-uhh...hope im...u-umm...not o-overstepping my b-boundies at the m-moment..." 

She would say as a nervous smile formed on her lips as she leaned forwards to place her lips rias' aiming to stop them as they were about to respond to her. After a few moments she would pull back allowing them to speak. "u-umm..i c-couldn't h-help my self.....y-your umm...m-moans..are...t-to...e-erotic...its a t-term i heard..h-hanae say before..." She said as a soft laughter would leave her lips as her eyes lowered slightly stareing directly into her eyes.

"and...t-thanks...il be l-looking forward...to...t-that..umm..m-massage....w-when i r-return.."

she said in a soft whisper.* - Sat Dec  5 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was suddenly pulled onto rias and began kissing her passionatly. Her right hand that was drenched with their juice. Pulling back for a moment, she moved that hand to her mouth and licked her finger for a taste before puting it within their mouth allowing them to taste their own erotic juices.  Their left hand would continue to rub their breasts before it moved upwards slowly rubbing their nipples while pulling upwards slightly every few times. A nervious smile would form on her lips as she opened her mouth to speak. "u-umm...i once s-saw....h-hanae...do this to z-zenaki...o-once.." She would say in a whisper as her head moved to lick their neck softly aiming to let moan while they were sucking and licking her hand lean of their juices.

"i a-always...umm..l-looked away...but..was...s-somethings i-interested in h-how it a-all worked.."

She would say in a soft voice..in between slightly heavy breathing...  Her breasts rubbed against theirs while her rright knee rubbed against their private area as well as clit wanting to keep them stimulated and waited for them to cum or squit on her leg.* - Sat Dec  5 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would feel herself hugged intensivly by rias as she felt them squirt orgasm on her leg. Her whole lower body being drenched in their juices. A nervous smile would appear on her lips as she whispered the words. "and...i-i...love you t-to.." She would whisper before saying the words. "is..a-all your....s-stress g-gone now.." A retorical question was given to them as she slid downwards and began sucking on their nipples while her right hand drifted downwards rubbing their clit every few times before drifting into her pussy...she began fingering them as she awaited their answer. Her calm eyes looking up towards them. 

She would stop if they wanted to...there were probably people that needed them for missions and what not...she did not know if they wanted to massage to be over yet.* - Sat Dec  5 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would open her mouth slowly leaving the breasts alone for now. She drifted downwards and placed her underneath their thights as her head drifted slowly as she began to lick their pussy. Her tounge then began to be sent into their pussy going inwards and outwards  She was having fun and maybe after they climaxed once more..she would probably stop.  Their right hand would move upwards and began playing with their clit as she retracted to breath for a moment before saying the words. 

"w-what was that?"

She said gathering her breath for a moment before sending back her head back into the area. She wanted to help the person that loved her to much be completely without stress...so she aimed to make them one more time with in her mouth....she wanted them to make her choke on her  squirting orgasum...they wanted to feel it hit the back of her throat and make herself cum as well...they wanted them to expload all their pent up stress on them...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would feel her feel her self being choked by her cum...it hit the back of her thoat as she began swallowing and drinking it while some of the juice spewed onto the bed. The cum would of hit the back of her thoat rather hard and her body began to get a tingly senseation before she herself began to  squirt her as well. She began peeing herself as she felt pleasure from pleasuring rais. ....crawling forwards as she did so....weakly allowing her own orgasum to drip onto the bed. 

"y-you....really....want m-me?" 

She askes curiously as she leaned forward and kissed them on the lips before retracting and laying down on the bed besides them. She seemed to be breathing heavily. They were glad that this women  loved her.. A nervous smile would appear on her lips.* - Sat Dec  5 08:06:49 2015

She listened to the words in which they spoke of before walking over and sitting down next to them. "mm...c-clan leader.....t-that umm...s-seems like a difficult position..." She would say before giving them a nervous smile when they said that they wanted to go outside. Standing up slowly, she began to walk towards the door since they did not want to ruin their house.  Her expression slowly changed from a nervous smile to an expressionless expression. Her gaze lowered slowly as they made their way to the arena or somewhere else other than that place...she did not know...but it was probably the arena.

Her mind was thinking about what had happened in kohonoa when she had left. Something that was so surreal was happening to her sister...did they like being controlled....they seemed to fear their so called friend which commanded them on whim. She was now appart of this life...the shinobi life and wanted to leave it for a while and just go to her mountain...but people wanted her here...where they could see her....she knows that they needed to stay here...but she did not want to on the inside....the nervous female had to endure every day of the pain that etched in her heart...but just wanted to forget whatever pained her...

They wanted to trap themselves in an induced meditation and train with her mentor...and not be bothered by the needs or wants of the shinobi world....but that was to much to ask...that was to much...for her to have... When she arrived at the arena, she looked in their directed and gave them a weak nervous smile as they awaited for them to use their technique infront of her. They were a little curious being her sensei after all.* - Sun Dec  6 23:15:12 2015
