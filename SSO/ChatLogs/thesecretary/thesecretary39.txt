<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) raising up from her seat on the  bench, they began walking towards the village gates. She decided that it was time for her to search for the slug again and atleast give it another chance and so they did. They were in search of something they quit on finding....when she herself..was lost...people would extend a hand out to her so she could continue to stand....so she should try to do the same to them. The nervous female soon kicked off her feet and began moving in a slight blur outside of the gate of the village and her almost dulled out emerald eyes began looking around from left to right in search of the small creatures trail.

They needed to find it....she knew that she was useless when given a mission to do alone, but she just wantedto do atleast one of them correctly...at least one of them ....by herself....one that she did not give up on or prolong...she just wanted to find this creature....but was this good deed for the creature...or for herself.* - Tue Dec  8 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) movements suddenly stopped in a slide as she saw something that resembled slime. Her right hand stoping on the ground which quicked her stop before kicking off nothwards in a slant before raising up into a balanced position as she charged towards the trail before it had gotten blown over in sand.  Just how far did this snail go within just a few days...she hoped not to far since she may get side tracked again. THe last time she tired to find this slug, she got stopped by a travler to say the least...the things they had talked about were...rather interesting. But by the time she had said her good byes, she waved them off and looked back only to see that the whole snail trail had got covered by sand...

SO this time, she was going to find it....and hopefully the same things that happened to her before would not happen twice. five figures began to enter her vision of sight, but could not get a read of them...they seemed to be looking at something...hmm.* - Tue Dec  8 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) , as she got closer they realised there were hold up the slug. "mm..." A soft hum would have left her lips before she stood before the five people, appearing before them in a blur and a nervous smile was given to them. "u-umm....can i h-have that...u-uhh....s-slug p-please...?" She asked curiously, her eyes were covered by her hat as she asked this question...her hands remained dangling at her sides...the nervous female remained silent as she awaited their response and had gotten one....their words echoing through her ears. " why do you want it?" She should have guessed that they were not going to give give it to her without a reason to do so....paines head tilted upwards revealing almost dulled calm emerald eyes which caused the men before her to take a step backwards as she opened her mouth slowly and continued off the words she had said before.

"i-it umm...b-belongs to s-someone....and i...umm...u-uhh...n-need to r-return it..."

She said as they held out the slug for her to take and she extended her own. As it was placed in her hands, a small smile would appear on her lips. She would say the words. "t-thanks..." Turning around, they began to make her way towards the village, but something was wrong.* - Tue Dec  8 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) when she was about to turn around, something was seen from her perifial vision....a blurr coming towards her and the females right hand raised blocking their own in a blurred state. "u-umm.." she hummed as she placed the slug into her pocket. Her gaze directly on them as she watched his form, her grip tightened as she tristed in wrist to the right causing them to collapse onto their knees. Looking up, she rested her gaze on the others whom were around her. 

"u-umm.....please..."

She heard a bone crack as she twisted it again...his screams melting into her ear before letting go.  The two others charged towards her and her eyes lowered slightly....they wanted the moeny for the slug they had found...and herself...oh dear...The figure raised up their left hand and pushed away their fist that was cominging to her face, her right foot rose and swayed backwards towards the back of their knee sending them into a knee down position as her right hand let of the first attackers fist. That right hand was send downwards onto the back of the second offenders neck causing them to be knocked out. 

Her gaze then looked upwards towards the three whom were frozen in place....* - Tue Dec  8 16:25:36 2015

Her oppenent were hesitant at first, but came running towards her anyway. A soft breath of air would leave her lips as her own lefts bend slightly before she pushed off into the air, the upper part of her body twisted and her lower half followed suit. Her body twisted in a blured state...a rotation as her right leg extended outwards slashing into her oppoents leg which raised up to kick as well. There was a short power struggled before they were send backwards. The nervous female would suddenly drop to the ground just bearly avoiding the punch that was sent towards her shoulder.

"mm..."

Her leg came around sliding across the ground, her combo cut short on purpose so she would make the slug motion sick. Dust was kicked up into the air as her foot was sent against thier legs in a leg sweep manner.* - Wed Dec  9 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as both hands turned in to fists, her rotation not finished yet. Both hands pulled backwards before being sent forwards hitting against their chest area causing them to slide backwards. A nervous smile slowly formed on lips as they were sent backwards while paine remained motionless in a kneeled position with her head slightly druped down. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere, she felt like something was taking control of her....and the feeling felt familar...but it was being surpressed. The nervous female rose up slowly leaning forwards before leaning backwards into a straight position. 

"s-should...i l-leave them h-here..."

She said in a low tone under her breath. They were probably bandits...but she was not like those other shinobi...not that she was one anyways. Looking over to her right, she would notice a travern. Her right hand raised to wave for them to come closer to her....she was going to make sure they got to some where safe....it was only the right thing to do....after seeing those...desert worms..oh dear* - Wed Dec  9 02:05:00 2015

Oh how wrong she war...oh dear. Her speed suddenly became that of a slight blur as she began running westwards, a trail of dust behind her before suddenly stopping in a slide infront of the village gates. Her eyes blinked twice before a soft breathe of air left her lips. Looking into her pocket, she took out a slug and showed it to the gate guards whom just sighed and give the nervous girl a reassuring smile. They seemed to be rather sad that the female had lost the slug, but now that they had found it...it was a sight to behold.

"i-il umm..be h-heading inside n-now.."

A nervous smile would be given to them before she herself vanished in a blur, heading into the gates. of suna.* - Wed Dec  9 02:14:24 2015
