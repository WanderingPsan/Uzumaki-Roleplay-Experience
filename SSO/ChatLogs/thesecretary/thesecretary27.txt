The nervous girl seemed a little proud that they were able to continue their run or attacks on the her. These two were getting better and better as they days went by, however she hoped that hideo finds that rock sooner or later..mm. The female leaned backwards slightly as her sences kicked in. The ball that was aimed towards her went right besides her face while her right hand arm bended inwards before being launched upwards smashing against wrist. Her arm then swayed over to the right which would cause them the be staggered to the left. 

If the nervous female was successfull, her right hand, as it was coming downwards...would aim to slam against her mana's neck area in a karate chop fashion. Their left hand would be sent forwards aiming to slam against momura's stomach area before taking a step backwards keeping her right hand at chest level being cautious towards her two students....however...she would have loved to see what they would do in that situation.

A nervous smile suddenly formed from her lips as her gaze slowly looked back to her student whom was south of her position.  She loved the way they had they had used the balls as a distraction for her not to focus too much on the balls that were bouncing around the arena before suddenly deciding it was time to end the training session. The female jumped into the air and the upper part of her body twisted...the lower half of her body followed suit as she began to spin in a blur. 

A violent hurricane began to surround the consealed figures form as tje ca;;es went into the center and followed the current of wind....straying from their paths like moths to a flame swirling closer....and closer...to the light. After a few moments, the nervous female landed on the ground in a couching position and all the balls dropped on the ground. around her form. "w-we will....u-umm...s-stop for t-today.." The female would begin to walk around the carpet and pick up the balls she had stopped with the use of her techniques.* - Sat Nov 21 01:06:08 2015

A small smile was then given as she suddenly vanished in a blur and reapared infront of the rock wall south of them before kicking it and causing a small rock cunk to fall onto the ground besides her. Raising up, the nervous female before kicking the rock over towards the place where the previous rock was before stamping her foot on the ground and causing a crator for it to seep into. It was now unmoveable before looking over towards momura and giving them a small smile.

The nervous female suddenly pushed them backwards before placing her piece of coral within her pocket.

Sure they were able to make a small crack in it...however this was as far as they were going to get at the moment..

"mm....."

They would probably master this in the next training session they did....so that was something for them to look forward to....however if they wished to continue now...they would need to do this only two more times before finally gaining a grasp of knowledge on the technique.* - Sat Nov 21 02:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would just watch as they went back to their spot behind their rock and she herself, instead of walking away from the area allowing her student to train alone, she would just watch in silence...observing their progress as they progressed and progressed though her self made technique untill they had gotten a basic understanding or grasp of what they were doing...how they were doing it...and the result of doing so. They were following their instructions to the T and she could not be any prouder...however...there was something that stumped her heart as her mind began to drift off to think about other things as she observed in silened. Their slightly dulled emerald eyes lowered slightly as she wondered  about things that seemed or were seemingly meaningless but still echoed within her head. She remebered the feeling that she had felt during jiki's funeral and it just...did not sit well within her heart...she thought that she would get more chances to talk to them...now that she could...hold a small...coversation of something of that sort...but instead she was robbed of that opportunity.

"mm.....your doing w-well...b-breath inwards...and o-outwards slowly...and do it a-again..."

She would say unconcously as she heard the rock being smashed into soon after their meditation had stopped. This the small girl meditate too....she was the only person other than herself...that she knew meditated...however other or many people meditated for different purpouses...some for goot and some for bad...some for joyfull reasons and some for horrible ones. However... she seemed to do so to...calm down their heart...enough to rest for a while before actually...trying the technique again...which was the most smart decision that anyone could make based on the current situation they were in. It helped them in using the technique correctly...well almost correctly...she saw a twitch in their arm which was caused by their tiredness...so she did or had not minded. Her gaze would look over towards yan whom appared to be seated next to her before giving them a small smile before her gaze slowly went off their form before resting upon the two whom were sparing north west of their location...it was...Kinami...they were doing well in their spar...or so it seemed since she had not looked from trom the begining...however it seemed that they were doing quite wel before her gaze went back onto yan and she spoke. "i-im sorry...for not b-being able to j-join you....f-for d-dinner....ive been b-busy." she would say before giving them a nervous smile.

"mm..and umm...t-thanks..a-again...for h-helping me...with m-my paper w-work.."

"mm...m-make a t-tiger seal...and s-sent it f-forwards...i-into the rock and m-make a h-hole inside of t-the rock..."

She would say as she raised both hands and made or formed a tiger seal, she would then send it towards the rocks side and a cloud of dust appared. When the smoke cleared, it shoed four fingers within a self made hole caused by her fingers. Pulling them out slowly, her arms would then lower to her sides before speaking once more.

"m-make sure..n-not to bend...y-your fingers...o-or they w-will b-break....so..t-take it e-easy...and a-apply as m-much f-force...as y-you can s-supply...."

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink for a moment as she looked down at her menu that was laid down on the table infront of her.

Her calm slightly dulled emerald eyes lowered slightly as she awaited a response.* - Sat Nov 21 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervous smile before saying the words. "r-ramen..." She just wanted plain ramen like she had always gotten when she was in kohonoa. The nervous female always liked the low amount of portions what was given since she did not eat much at all. Her gaze then went back onto rias as she listened to the second half of their words but her thoughts were on the first part. "i...h-have had...a b-boyfriend....but he d-died...in the m-most terrible...of w-ways....and i b-believe...it is m-my fault...it had e-ended up that w-way..." She would finish off before looking up towards them.

"ive...n-not gone...on a d-date with them....j-just yet.....the k-kazekage at t-the time....n-needed us...or..h-him...all the t-time..." 

A brief pause was mad as she watched her ramen was soon palced on the table before her and later began eatting it. "have y-you....e-ever dated s-someone?" She a-asked curiously trying to stray away from herself and onto them....she was sure they ahd their own peoples...and she did not want to make them depressed by telling her their own...it felt...impolite.* - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink a few times before she heard the word cute as a nervous blush appared in a line across her face. The female would then nod rather slowly before seeing their face grow blank...did she ask something wrong...

"i-im..sorry...i..d-dissapointed you...didn't i.." 

She would say knowing this would have happened....she was just bad with epople..and maybe they wernt ment to talk or be friends either. She had listened to their words towards the end, but her mind had stayed on the the expression they had on their face..she wanted to hear their responce, so she did not really touch her food yet feeling as if they had unintentionally made an enemy.* - Sat Nov 21 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would feel her hand being touch touched by rias'  and a nervous smile would would form.

"i..a-also..w-wanted his...k-kids...but...i...r-regret..not being a-able..to s-say that to...h-him.." She would say as a soft breathe of air escaped her lips. "I...r-really wish...h-he was s-still around..." She would say before looking down to stare at her ramen.

"mm..."

A soft hum would leave her lips as she smelled the aroma from her ramen which later caused her stomach to rumble a bit. A nervous and slightly akwards smile was then given to rias whom was holding her hands.* - Sat Nov 21 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nods giving them a nervous smile. Rais looked very lovely and also made her feel a little jellous...but decided not to mind it. They looked liek a real knight whom protected all evil and things like that...she was really stunning to look at. Opening her mouth, she would say.

" but o-others....like my o-old friend...did not w-wish to c-call them something....l-like that........he...t-tried to c-change...my o-opinion on them....but...l-love does not...c-change...that e-easily"

Her hands lowered to pick up her chop sticks, before breaking them and begining her meal. They scooped up some noodles before bringing it to her pout and sliping it down. "w....wo....wopa.." she would sound out as her eyes closed and head looked slightly upwards. The nervous girl leanded back in her seat and began breathing inwards and outwards slightly heavily as both her hands remained in stasis onto  of the table.

"g-good.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a nervous smile before pushing off her feet and running towards them. Jumping into the air, her body twisted in a blur and a hurricane like wind began to surround her form. Her right leg then extended outwards aiming to smash into their right ribs. Her calm slightly dulled emerald eyes would lower slightly during her spin as a soft breath of air would leave her lips as contact or if contact was made. 

'swoo..'

Her gaze however was on her opponent as she awaited to see what they woud do. Their mind however was elsewhere as it was stuck with thoughts on Kinami. She was wondering why they wanted her as a teacher if they dont put effort into what she was teaching them....it was un ethical...and unnatural...so would it not have been better just to ask someone else for help in the area...mmm...so strange...Hoever she did not mind it for the most part since hassan ask if she could teach them....but now she was regretting saying yes on the inside because they held no interest.

* - Sat Nov 21 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they drooped down into a crouching position and did a leg sweep. The only problem was she was not touching the ground at the moment and suddenly the nervous girl would land on the ground behind them continuing spinning motion and combo into a crouching position sending her right still extended leg into their rib cage as a leg sweep from behind since they were crouched down. She would watch they forced northwards  and later sprawling onto the ground northwards.

The nervous female would slowly raise up as they awaited for them to stand up as well. She would remain silent as her nervous smile slowly faded away leaving an expresionless face as she wondered why exactly the tryed to leg sweep while she was in the air...however she was sure her student was trying to create some sort of new move or something...she hoped...

"mm..."

Her right hand would raise to straighten her hat as she awaited for her student to raise back up from their downed position if she was successful.* - Sun Nov 22 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as she watched her student rust back towards her. The nervous female's grip on her hat tightened slightly as she suddenly began saywaying from left to right before ducking in a spin to get behind them in a blurred state. Dust on the ground before them began to kick up due to how fast the both of them were moving. She loved the determination that Mirai withheld within themselves and how it was being directed towards the taijutsu user.

However, she wonderd why their hands glowed like that, but she was not one to question  the powers of another taijutsu user....because of how much training it took them to gain that level of power...it was something that she could not...herself...bring into question in a personal conversation with another...but it was something that was ment to be amazed and interested in seeing from a distance of from up close when it had happened...and thats what made taijutsu fights so interesting...win or lose

While right hand held onto her hat while she dodged and avoided her strikes, her left hand moved in blurs to push away or redirect their hands by sending it their wrist pushing it upwards or to the left or right while she swayed in the opposite direction. Her calm slightly dulled emerald eyes were on her opponent as she focused only on them...both their movements made it seem like they were dancing during this spar...she did not strike back because she enjoyed this feeling and can only experience it with mirai which was one of the reasons why she stayed in sungakure.

A small nervous smile would then form on her lips as her body suddenly lowered as she swayed to the right as their left hand's thumb grazed her shoulder. Their body twisted in a blur as the bent downwards into a crouching position aiming to leg sweep them...before raising up while leaning backwards ready to retaliate if she was successfull or not.* - Sun Nov 22 01:21:55 2015
