<br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) walking forwards, she would take a seat next to zetsumo before closing her eyes and going into her meditative state. She wanted to get back to training as soon as possible since she had put it off for a while. After a few moments, she woke up in her dream state in a sitting position leaned against the wall of her japanese styled house. Looking over towards her left and upwards, she would see rose. "oh...your here...move into the table and eat the soup....dont just sit there...get a move on you weakling..." Rose stared at them blankly with a raised eyebrow as paine nodded rather slowly as they moved forwards closer to the table and took a seat. Extending both arms, she began to inspect the soup by pokeing it with her spoon softly. "u-umm..." Roses hand slammed down on the table before giving a squint in their direction.

"what.....is there something wrong..with my cooking?"

The old women stared at paine whome jumped slightly at the sound of their hand hitting the table and listened to their words as they stared in their direction. Her calm emerald gaze looked down slowly towards the soup that was before her. A hand extended to allow her spoon to be dipped into the bowl before raising it back up into her mouth. Her hair began flowing slightly without an air current before taking another sip and another. The truth was, she did not want to be kicked into somewhere unknown because she may just crash into zetsumo or into the desk behind her in the real world.

Roses eyes lowered slightly before raising up and heading towards the garden where they usually trained. " meet me out there when your finished..." She said in a slight annoyed tone, but that was like them...always annoyed but deep down paine always felt as if they secretly liked them alot. Once paine was finished, she began to walk outside into the garden only to see three training logs evenly spaced out and Rose standing infront of her with two hands on her waist.

"ok....hit these log as fast as you can...middle left right in order...and dont mess up alright..."

They waved a hand before walking back towards the wooden path way and siting on the edge. Rose's feet dangled off the edge while her eyes showed a raised eyebrow.

"why didn't you start yet....Begin!!!"

paine would then rush forwards attacking each of the logs trying to become faster in her strikes and changing from target to target."mmm..."  She felt nervious.* - Sun Aug 30 16:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

Her foot landed on the right dummy. There was not to much power as she began saving her full powered kick for middle dummy but still the force of the kick made the ground crackle slightly. Wind would begin to be directed outwards blowing the tress and the grass eastwards. The water from the pond rippled slightly, but the ying and yang fish stayed calm within their swim. Her knee bended as she kicked off of the log in a very fast spin. The foot being pulled forwards with all her power within it and was hit against the middle log. 

"mmm!!!"

Roses eyes would blink for a moment before giving a slow nod. "Hey!!!...Hey!! regulate your god dam breathing!!!!" The old women yelled while pumping a fist into the air in her direction showing she was annoying and angry that paine had forgotten the training she gave her on breathing. Rose scowled before slamming her hand back on her lap before continueing to watch the move set of the trainee. Paines eyes however widened as she exhaled slowly as her foot was pulled back and landed infront of the middle log. The landing was on her toes before they pushed forwards with a brought up punch towards the stomach of the left log. This had started up a volly as she began to send high speed punches towards the log and blocked as the small stick etched into them stopped came at her from the other side. The girls calm emerald eyes scanned the logs form looking  at each side as the rate she had hit the log at caused it to begin moving in blurs shifting from left to right repeatedly.

Paine had to be carefully around this area...or she would be hit when she went to switch logs.

"n-not....yet.."

And so paine waited for a chance to escape since she was told not to slow down untill they said so.* - Sun Aug 30 16:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would raise up her left arm to block quickly and as the stick was send backwards, she kicked off her right foot and spun in the same direction while leaning backwards. When her right foor had touched the ground however, her left foot raised quickly amost touching the log before being retracting when her right knee bended. They kicked upwards into the air in a spin, her left foot rose slowly and and tiped the stick on the left log before landing and raising up her right hand to block the stick that was about to hit her on the side.

"Alright thats enough!!!"

Rose yelled and Paine pivoted backwards before lossing her footing. Falling on her but, she looked down at her lap before exhaling allowing air to flow out her lips. She wasent tired just yet, but was only slightly tired at the moment. Rose would walk up towards Paine and would late place her arms in a cross when they were behind her. Paine looked backwards to stare up at them with calm emerald eyes and a nervious smile. 

A leg soon raised and was brought  forwards to hit against paines rib area. " Get up...i know your not tired...dam weakling..." Rose said angrily before sighing and looking back up at them. "Come at me with all you got...after this training session will be over..."........Paine however, when she raised her arm to block, she felt a bone break and she was sent into the garage that was just finished being fixed. Her body hit the ground  before going slightly above the ground in the air and hiting her shoulder before going back into the area and  her side crashed into to the garage. * - Sun Aug 30 17:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

Paine opened her eyes and leaned backward in her chair but not enough to fall down. She was lucky she was able to block that last kick. She had came out of her meditative state and looked over towards zetsumo for a moment as they spoke.  Her calm gaze then looked back towards Kitoro as she began stripping. Her expresionless face grew a nervious blush as her calm emerald eyes blinked for a few moments. She raised up both hands to take off her hat before resting it on the table. 

"u-umm..."

she would say this nerviously before closing her eyes. She had to prove rose wrong...she had to go back to her training match with them...no....to go past her limits. . . that's what Paine needed to do. The words of Rose, and the efforts made by Zetsumo had certainly resonated within the girl's soul. From that day forth, there was refound motivation, and she'd not rest until her body was not only at it's peak, but able to go beyond the mortal limitations that the earthly plane sought to impose on her. Quickly, her eyes opened as she heard roses blured voice and the real word became only a noises became only a blur. Her minds blocked out any world distractions, and it was as if she had re-entered a different world or universe. Just as the light rays ceased to be a factor, the sound that existed in nature also faded. 

Paine pushed herself up into a standing position and held her right arm. She walked out of the garage to see Roses smile before they dashed forwards towards her. She herself would dash forwards towards them. The drive to get stronger...no her will to get stronger...and prove to them that she can change...
* - Sun Aug 30 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) // 

Paine raised both arms to block her attack. She was sent backwards skidding before coming to a stop. Rose stood stright and gave the scrached up and dusty girl a small smile before turning around and walking back towards the house and later upstairs. 

The nervious girl just stared at them before falling backwards and breathing inwards and outwards heavily before calming down soon afterwards. To tell the truths...she had spared rose for the last hour before they finally noticed she was about to drop with the next punch made. Rose was interesting...she knew just when paine had enough. 

Shaking her head, her eyes closed and she left the meditative world figureing the flowers next to the pond was a safe place to rest. Opening her eyes, she noticed no one was in the room except for zetsumo and herself. Looking over to them noticing she wasent as exhausted in real life as she was in the dream world, opening her mouth, she began to speak. 

"can...we...umm...spar?"

She asked nerviously giving them a nervious smile. Her calm emerald eyes would just stare at them for now woundering what their answer would be.* - Sun Aug 30 19:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly as she began following behind them rather slowly.  Her gave was lowered onto the scroll that she had recieved as they opened it and began reading while walking. Paine was now on autopilot.

"s-severe leaf...hurricane..."* - Sun Aug 30 19:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

She followed behind them into the and would begin walking diagonally away from them as she rolled up the scroll and placed it within her pocket. They were distanceing themselfs from Zetsumo because usually in a spar, the sparries were usually at a distance from one another. Turning to face them, both hands raised behind her head to pull back on her hat since she usually had them on when she was outside the mansion. It was time to spar zetsumo when he was not holding back for her. 

She as usuall remained in no stance. the one she was currently creating was not finished yet so she did what she had usually done...she remained as the no stance women. 

"u-umm...here i go....."

She dashed forwards towards her the person she admired in her child hood time and had decided to help her get stronger than she was when she had first started out. A hand raised to be sent towards their chest area.

* - Sun Aug 30 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

Her hat blinds flowed backwards as she remained silent with her expressionless face. Rose had thought her to remaine calm as her hidden eyes lowered slightly. Her right foot landed on the ground in a slight skid as the upper part of her body twisted slightly. The left hand was brought downwards onto his leg using it to push her up. Using the leg as a stand, she kicked her right foot off the ground quickly while in this instance where time seemed to have frozen for just a moment.

She put all her weight on the leg and pushed herself upwards sideway using her strength following the twist of her arm. The arm raised upwards into the air in a vertical upwards angle as the Threads would damage the cloth of her robe while they went upwards into the air and there was now a whole.

A spin side kick would be sent towards their shoulder using their right in a very fast motion as she aimed to begin her combo.* - Sun Aug 30 20:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

They had not grabbed onto their leg, they only placed their hand on it. When they had sent their leg back downwards, her leg would of still would of still been met with his shoulder. 

Once the attack was made, they would of been send downwards in the direction of the ground . She her body continued the very fast spin as her left side began following downwards and her body began to form a rough darkish hurricane like wind. "like...this...." 

She would say feeling slightly uncertain...she had to do a bit mroe training.* - Sun Aug 30 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly."attack....even when....a-assulted!" she would say with a slight stutter. He was getting more and more proud of her....was she getting stronger....in the least...Her calm eyes shifted towards the left  towards the left as they noticed the gound shifting in mud.  As they were forming seals, her left leg came follwing her right as they had begun a spin kick which in her darkish tornado towards their supressor towards Zetsumo. She had to show him how much she had improved over the years...she had to show them how much better she should of could of became...she wanted to improve herself...she wanted to....be reconized...as not a weakling in rose or zetsumo's eyes...but a strong person...a girl...he could rely on...like beth...or kitora...untill her time with them was over and done. After all...she had to becom

Her left foot followed onto his shoulder as she used this to push herself up into air. Using the platform of his back, she ended up kicking herself into the air and spun up   She then came downwards in a diagonal leg sweep aiming crash her foot against the dragon mud bullet aiming to break it. As if time stoped for a moment while her calm gaze was stared downwards at and noticed black creatures.

"mm...."

She continued her very fast spin downwards and went into a leg sweep. A strong gust of wind would be sent towards the tree mutated creatures closest to the two of them aiming to blow them backwards.* - Sun Aug 30 21:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would raise up into a standing position when the threads let go of her body. She then followed rather slowly behind Zetsumo looking for the right time to strike.* - Sun Aug 30 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) eyes would widen as they began to rush forwards out of the fray...she knew zetsumo could handel deflecting or avoiding the snot balls...but it was time put this to an end. If they batted well...then their pitching must of been even grater. The girl began rushing forwards towards the creature closest to them as they picked up the green slime ball. She had to get to them quickly...she wanted to get to them as fast as she could...to prevent them from having a chance to maybe hit them from the close range that they were at. Her calm emerald gaze looked over towards Osamu for a moment before shifting her gaze back towards the creature. 

"mmm..."

She wanted to train...but this type of fight oculd be counted as training too...and so she fought starting with the closest one next to their group of three people. Paine jumped into the air as they leaned backwards getting ready to through, but it was two late. A leg came forward with exceptional speed and alot of force behind it as she decided not to hold back. Her foot aimed to connect with their head to send them onto the ground to her best ability.

If the first leg had failed...her spin continued as a hurricane like figure surrounded her form. Her left leg came at very fast speeds soon after aiming to crash into their shoulder....their combo was about to begin.* - Sun Aug 30 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) the club would of met her leg as she spun around once at very fast speeds more aiming for a leg sweep but stoped mid-way crashing into the item instead as they aimed to to break it in in half shortening its reach. Assuming success, her leg would of been swirled downwards in her make shift hurricane and her feet would graze the ground as dust followed behind her foot aiming to leg sweep the creature.

*fhwooo* She inhaled and exhaled softly regulating her breathing, she had not expected the club to shoot up, but was glad that she always came down with a leg sweep when she finished combos. "u-umm....then..."

The wind would expand outwards aiming to push the upper part of their body so they would be leaning backwards a bit before being sent backwards due to their loss of footing and the gust of wind being pushed onto them by her make shift tornado before it vanished into nothingness.

When her leg was directly behind her, she pushed herself up with her right foot which was in a kneeling position as she did the leg sweep and went  into the air. Her left foot was brought forward as they aimed to send aimed to jump kick the creature's face.

This would happen if she was successfull with the leg sweep.* - Mon Aug 31 00:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would land on the ground before looking over towards Kitora. She had a expressionless face at the moment as her calm emerald gaze lowered slightly.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) had would tilt downwards slighty as her world went black, her emerald eyes grew dull. She was no good against genjutsu, her arms dangled at her sides. She listened to the questions, but she did not know the answer to the questions. 

"i-i...do...not k-know..."* - Mon Aug 31 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) body would begin shaking as she fell onto her knees  Her head tilted downwards allowing hair to cover her dull emerald eyes. Paine was currently in her mindscape listening to the questions being asked. Her legs dangled off the edge of the wooden path as her gaze stared off at the garden that Rose had grown. 

Beth was digging into her memories, searching for something....something that would be different. Rose would stare up at the sky watching the different memories being looked though before stareing back at paine whome remained silent stareing down at her lap. Rose began feeling uneasy as they sighed and went back into the house.

Going back to reality, paine heard their words and would begin to speak."i...do n-not know......" Reaching into her cloak unconciously and willingly , she would hold up a scroll for them to read.* - Mon Aug 31 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be punched backwards into the wall before wall before crashing into the wall behind her. Blood would escape her lips as she slid downwards slightly before falling forwards onto the ground. Her arms remained at her sides unmoving while her eyes remained pale. She repeated once more the words.

"i...i..do not k..know..."

She had made zetsumo mad...she did not know the answers to most of his questions. They had been though alot...but now they saw her as a traitor...and everything looked bad for her at the moment. Now they wished to kill kronos....they wanted to kill kronos.....she did not know what exactly to do now....she did not know what to say....she could think about an anwer to their question as that question was never asked before...she just had bad luck in this world.

She remained in her mindscape stareing at the flowers that were planted there...she just wished the whole interrigation was over now...but she knows that everything she will answer...would be directed even more to her status in the group being plumited.
* - Mon Aug 31 02:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would think for a moment before speaking unconciously, her dull eyes lowering slightly not knowing where they were at the moment...not void of seeing what zetsumo was doing at the moment.

"m...my loyalty....im not sure...where it l..lays.....but...it is...more in your direction.....you decided to help...a useless noboy like myself....giving me...e..encouraging words...t..to strive for b..better....even...f..following my c..commands when i a..asked to spar me...m..meditatively....but not getting..angry...when you...decided n..not to join in....f..for your own personal reason.....but i...d..did not m..mind it....because...i..its s..something that i should not bother with......you...q..question my...reasons......i..a..am loyal...to my m..mother...and f..father overseas....and your a c..close third....as i can not hold you....above t..them....."

She would say with many pauses before continueing onto the next question.

"h..he...is the only p..person......and i...i am your companion...b..but...i wish..t..to marry k..kronos...."

She said unconciously.* - Mon Aug 31 03:14:46 2015

'm-meet..me...s..south of the village.....infront of the w..water fall...with the c..cave...a..bove the tea v.village...'

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be just leaving kohonoa traveling unconciously towards her destination. They were going to attack sunagakure to today and she was going to be a accomplis. Her arms swayed from side to side not knoing what was right from wrong...wrong from right..she did not know what she had to do...nor know what to do while doing it...this was just a war zone they were heading to and so she followed behind them as the way was silent and no one talked except for zetsumo whom seemed on edge when leaving their village.

They walked past the tea village with the army behind them. The villagers looked over to seea bunch of troups passing them, the fear in their eyes were apparent while their body shook. Paines calm gaze looked over towards them, her emerald eyes seemed unhappy under her blinds, her mind lost on the thoughts of what happened during the interview...she was awear of what had been saying as every word was the truth. Rose comforted her to her best ability and even pulled her back outside to train to liven up her mood a bit...after all, rose was trying her best and she knew this...however...it only helped a little...Zetsumo thought of her as a traitor and even wants to kill....the person......no...she had to do it...in the future...as he may not want her to find...what...was it...no...she could not remeber now...

"mm..."

A soft sound would come from her lips as a hand raised unconciously to block the hot sandy breeze that blew on her.  THey had entered the desert and were soonner or later at sunagakure directly. Zetsumo summoned out four large beast of any kind as they stood infront of the army. She walked up closer to see what exactly was happening, but heard the rawrs of the soldiers as they sharged forwards. The concealed figure just stood behind the last beast unconciously...as they stayed inside their mindscape..sparring with rose..each punch moving in blurs as they were countered and returned....her attempt in achieveing something...greater strength...greater power...something...to...make her..feel like she was...be of use to the others...

The concealed figure would remain unconcious as they awaited the right time to strike the individuals...as the voices of zetsumo and the others  remained slightly blured as they awaited their commands...or something...* - Wed Sep 02 21:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to feel the earth underneath her shaking and soon enough there was cracks in the ground  before it had suddenly turned into mud and was sent forwards towards the gates. She did not know what was happening at this point, however as a procaution, she turned southwards and began walking rather slowly before turning westwards stareing up at the mountain unconciously.

In her mind scape, she was sparing Rose slightly not paying attention to what was going on in reality, but listened to the slightly blured words of kitora. She herself just waited for the moment she could shine in her own area of combat. * - Wed Sep 02 21:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would just be stareing at the fight at hand. She was rather just stareing at all the things that were happening at the moment, not really getting involved before hearing Zetsumo's voice asking her to come over to them and so made her way over. It was then she was suddenly taken by the wrist and was pulled or brought over towards the mountain tops. Her calm emerald eyes hidden by the blinds would stare down at Chiyari. Her body stayed in mid air for a good moment before suddenly twisting her body and spin in mid air as she came downwards diagonally at a fast speed. 

A hurricane like figure began to surround her form as she drew closer and her spinning faster and faster.

"mm..."

That soft sound escaped her lips as her leg was pushed outwards when they were close enough as they aimed to send their right foot down on their shoulder with all their strength in aims of disloging it. Hit or miss, her combo would begin there. She wanted to do her best in her own way...maybe she could be something more.

 The unconciously moving girl would continue her strike as they were lost within their own thoughts at the moment.
* - Thu Sep 03 00:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would come down diagonally as her leg came down on the first of ten soilders that came to deal with her. Her right foot crashed into their side sending them straight southwards off the mountain...the poor man..Paine did not hold back in her strike...but what was this...the attack continued. She continued her spin as she landed on the ground blasting the two soilders that were east of her off the mountain with her leg sweep and her wind that pushed outwards. The two at her front would be sent into the mountain infront of her before while the two infront would be sent in the direction of Chiyari.

The throw shurkiin would hit the two men

The Figures leg slid along the ground quickly ending her spin and continueing the combo. Her right foot behind her bent slightly while her left foot pushed off the ground and out of her current crouching position twisting her body into a very fast spin. The girls left leg would be brought out in a very fast spinning motion aiming to hit the first solder in the shoulder  sending them skidding southwards before her right leg came forward while the left retracted sendingth next soldier skidding along the ground southwards. She came down in a leg sweep tripping the the seventh soldier before continueing that spin and bringing her left leg upwards in a round house kick towards the nineth solder. 

As her left foot landed on the ground behind her right, she quickly kicked off and pulled forward her right foot quickly sending it into the tenth soilders head. Once the hit connected, they would be send backwards into Chiyoki and her pursuit continued. When the landed, she ran forward once more before jumping up into the air in a very fast spinning motion, a hurricane like shape began to take her form as she aimed to stike the male on the shoulder with all her strength into the mountain north of them.

The figure moved unconciouly and followed their mission to a T.* - Thu Sep 03 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was grabbed. When the pull was made, she was recoiled backwards in a spinning motion. SHe would now be in a sittion position tied in Zetsumo's threads on the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would stare at zetsumo for a moment before giving them a nervious smile before siting down and closing her eyes. She did not wait much stanima at all, but was just going to train her mind scape.* - Thu Sep 03 02:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly giving them a small nervious smile. As she was about to walk forwards, they would trip and fall onto the ground face first. Sitting up, both ahnds would raise to rub her face. 

"mmm..."* - Thu Sep 03 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would stand up quickly and anime circles would appear on her eyes. Her whole body shook as a hand slowly raised seeming as if they were reaching out for them.

"i-im..fine....s-sorry" 

She would say as they dusted off their clothes and began to follow behind them swaying from right to left. She felt rather dizzy at the moment.* - Thu Sep 03 21:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would stop moving before giving them a nod.* - Thu Sep 03 21:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) shaking her head from her dizzy ness, her calm emerald eyes would rest back upon Shin. A few long strands of hair would sway downwards and rest at the middle of her face. Paine would remain motionless as she began to breathe inwards and outwards slowly remebering the training she had done with rose over breathing exercises and what not when sparing opponents. Rose....she had treated her differently when she was sad...but remaned mean and cold when she was alright. The old women was something...no someone special to her...who helped her advance in taijutsu over those long three years.

"mmm..."

The wind blew making her clothes and hair sway from left to right as she awaited his attack. She never really sparred with her own comrades, they had only stuck to hitting trees alone. Awaiting the right moment and making her strikes faster....making mind games by doing a different exercise when she had failed...not cheating herself when it came to the monthly or weekly spars they did with zetsumo. There was an empty feeling in her heart now...not matter how much she tired to hide it...it seemed to be all for not...they were searching for something but did not know what it was. 

maby a spar with this one...can help her see the light?...she did not know..* - Thu Sep 03 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would look back towards shin. They formed a seal and multiple versions of them selfs. They began to run towards her one by one and so she complied with their demands. "l...lying..." Her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly...she was of course feeling bad about his death and an accidental one at that. They had seemed to have fallen on a spike and that was the end of his reign as suna's guardian...suna's hero...the person whom they saw as great...and also a person whom they hated. She breathe inwards before exhaling very slowly as her calm emerald eyes went pale and her body would begin moving on autopilot for the spar.

--Mind Scape--

Her eyes opened and she was sleeping on the edge of the wooden pathway. Raising up, her legs danged off the edge while her hand raised to wipe her eyes. This was...the place she found peace in and the home of her teacher whome seemed to be away at the moment. When Rose wasent training paine, she was usually out working as they were delivery peope.  

She hoped off the leg and landed on the grassy ground. Picking up the flower watering pot by its handel, she walked slowly into the garden while nerviously smiling towards the colorful flowers and the vines which interwined with the railings and gates. Paine hoped she could be like those...strong and restricting...meaning stoping movements...maybe she could of shown kronos this one day. With that thought..her eyes lowered slightly but her nervious smile stayed present. Her walk stoped infront of the flowers while the flower watering pot was bought up to her center and was held with both hands.

"i-..mm..."

She could not say words towards the point..she was trapped...The presence behind her that was rose stood silently stareing at the girl whom took notice of her. A bag was strapped onto their back as they shook their head and headed back towards their home. Paine exhaled softly letting out air from their lips as they began to water the plants..trying to forget..not wanting to seek revenge towards kitora about boasting to be the one whom killed the first person whom loved her clutzy self...useless...and undeserving self.

--Mind Scape Vision End-

Paine remained motionless and her emerald eyes were pale as they were lost in their mind. She charged forwards before jumping up into the air. Her right leg was pulled forwards as they aimed to send her right foot into their right foot into the first clone.

 A hurricane like figure had taken her form as they came down in a leg sweep. 

A strong gust of wind was sent forwards towards the path infront of them. 

Which one...was the real one...* - Thu Sep 03 22:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would continue fighting trough them clones. Her fists would be sent towards the multiple clones that stood before her. Her breathing stayed regulated not tireing out at all. Gust of wind being send in multiple areas with every leg sweep made. The wind would send the clones backwards and would allow her to regain stanima as they rested for a few moments by standing completely still before strikeing again once more. Paine wanted to take her time in this fight and probably win as this probably took up chakra to keep on this type of skill. However, she continued to do her combo with routinely rests...This type of battle was going to be a stand still.

She wasent focused on this fight and just let her body move automatically. Jumping jump, she placed her left foot on the fence before kicking off it in a spin kick looking for the only dazed shinobi whom took the hit of her gust of wind. When she had found them, she went downwards at a very fast speed aiming to stike their chest area. They wanted to end these mind games once and for all.

-Mind Scape-

Rose walked back out to see Paine still doing gardening work and stoped to stare at the pond. "hey weakling...have some Watermelon..slices.." They said irritatingly trying to cheer up paine whom only looked up at them to show a nervious smile. She seemed happy as well as a bit sad at the moment." t-thanks..." her words finally came out...she finally was able to say something after a long wait. They had calmed down enough. Her right hand extended to take hold of a piece of watermelon before picking it up and eating it.

Rose placed the place ontop of the wooden training log and leaned against it waiting for them to finish their fruit...was there something special about it that she did not know?

-Mind Scape Vision End-

The robotically moving paine came downwards with her kick towards his chest area. If she was successful, they would be sent back skidding along the ground. If a clone jumped infront of her, they would be kicked in their stomach, sent into them and towards the ground.* - Thu Sep 03 23:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would land on the ground.before pushing off her feet and charging forwards unconciously. She felt the heat that was above  around her before it fell to the ground infront of her and between them before she could even reach. As debres shot upwards towards her direction. They began doing round house kickes mid run before sending another kick toward the debree in the opposition direction. They then kicked off their feet and began to send punches towards the debrees. Her hands burned or felt like they did...the pain gushing from her feet and legs...they hurt...but...it was nothing compaired to the pain kronos felts...when they were impaled.

Her fists tightened as they continued their run towards their direction sending punches unconciously angered by her own misability to take down her opponents. She then jumped into the air and came down with a kick towards their stomach as they laid still on the ground. Sweat flowing down from her face as she sored over the pit of flames that was caused by the debrees below her.

Her destination was her partners location with a burned robe shoes and hands. 

The unconcious girl was determined.

* - Fri Sep 04 00:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be blocked,  but they would be send back skidding slightly. She would land in place when she noticed that they were tired. A nervious smile would be given to them.* - Fri Sep 04 00:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give them a wave good bye as she began walking northwards.* - Fri Sep 04 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) appears* - Fri Sep 04 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) gaze would fall onto maya as she took off her hat and lowered it onto her lap.

A nervious smile was given to them."h-hi.."* - Fri Sep 04 01:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would pick up a dango stick and would take a bite out of the first one before chewing. She was litening to the story of zetsumo...his insite...on what was happening in this world...his goals...his wills...no...his dreams..they wanted to turn the world upside down and make it his own. A world without wars...a planet that was all on peace...politics gone and ruled by a singl ruler. They call them the god of war....but after a monarch has had his fill...they wanted peace..they wanted a way out of this unforgiving world.

Her gaze stayed on zetsumo for a while before lowering down towards the plate that katsume reached onto. Paines mind was lost thinking about what the words they had said before they had continued with their speech about them pretending to have the best interest for the society they currently lived in. She began nibbling on her dango slowly as a soft sound left her lips. "mmm..."  

They wanted to make everyone equal and the people whom they killed..were scared to think differently to how zetsumo was thinking. Were they actually just a troubled man wanting to seek peace...she had always watched them from afar in the past...but now after all those years...she finally knew what exactly his plans were...or that was told to them...the real question is....will...the power he soon obtains...will be put to evil...rather than good...

"natural order....e..equals...you...w..want......world peace.."

She would say curiously as she looked up towards them and comedic anime white circles for eyes as she nibbled on her dango that was held up with her dango stick.

The nervious girl was curious.* - Fri Sep 04 02:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) watches, she was about to meditate since this was going to be another elemental just fight, but it was going to be something else this time?...A nervious smile would appear as her eyes seemingly closed. 

They were curious.* - Fri Sep 04 04:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would look over towards katsune before as she watched they formed claws with their hands and fired a lighting ball towards zetsumo following behind it.  They had to attack zetsumo together but she herself dident know what to do. "mm....ummm...."  She would just begin walking besides and behind them...yes she walk as her calm emerald gaze kept on the both of them looking for an opening of her own taijutsu poweress. 

After a few moments, they began to go into a slow spint and began moving towards the left while katsune went directly from the front. She seemed determined in trying to take down zetsumo in this spar...but would most likely not succeed...but non the less she was determined......maybe it would be better than the genjutsu spar she had a few hours before this since they were now actually awake for the fight. Paine would breathe inwards and outwards allowing a breathe of air to escape her lips as she did in her training with rose.

"mm..."

It was time to get serious.
* - Fri Sep 04 04:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) saw the chance and began running forwards towards her opponet infront of her and began rushing forwards in a dash towards her opponent.  By the time they had glanced back due to the delay of katsune's explosive palm, he would notice a black blur of her pony tailed hair flowing downwards. If his eyes trailed down a bit more, they would see her left leg going for a leg sweep aiming to trip them onto the floor. Her clothes ruffled a put as the smoke that trailed from under her foot had followed when her foot slid arcoss the ground showing the ammount of power she had put into this leg sweep.

"mmph.."

She exhaled softly. If she was successfull, the man would of been tripped probably. When fast spin ended, her right foot would be behind her left foot as she pushed herself upwards into the air leaving a ring circle of brown dust on the ground below her. They twisted their body and spun at very fast speeds as a hurrican like shape appeared around her form. Her left leg was pushed outwards with all her might as she sent her left leg towards the leaders left shoulder.

And so her combo began.* - Fri Sep 04 05:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would have her leg sweep clip them, but her spin kick would of hit them and sent them skidding southwards a bit. When they had landed, she seemed to have went into a daze as katsune began to spar them now for almost the whole training session. She seemed to be rather tired, but came back to when the fight was basically over with Zetsumo's foot on Katsume's body..oh dear..that war battle the other day really took alot out of her as they had trained without sleeping. Watching her partner yawn, zetsumo had decided to let them go and sleep and would overhear that he was getting excited and was not tired just yet.

"umm...i-im..ready.."

She would say rather nerviously as she dashed forwards after a few moments not wanting to let his excitement go to waist. She was ready to continue the spar in a one on one and would probably appologize to her partner later. The both of them were corrdinated...but paine seemed to during the begining of the fight. The nervious girl stoped in a skid and twisted her body, her right leg raised and aimed to send her foot into zetsumos' side in a round house kick. 

They aimed to continue their combo.

* - Fri Sep 04 08:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would listen to their words as she rushed forwards towards her opponent. He was right..they were stronger than her in close combat...but he had always had something usefull for when he was in a stressful situation and that was his domu. The only thing that she had trouble fighting against..but maybe that will change in the future....probably...maybe...she could only dream...but non the less her combo continued. The girl was not about to give up just yet.. not now...not ever....or untill..she found...what she had lost.

Her body continued to twist as her left foot pushed off the ground and her right foot slid downwards off his frame in a very fast spinning motion. Both legs retracted as a powerfull hurrican like shape took place of her form damageing them with her own wind aiming to delay them as much as she can as her left leg came downwards  at a very fast speed onto their shoulder blade when their last seal were finished. "haaa!!!!!" they yelled feeling almost completely modivated to become better at her skill in taijutsu.

If she was successfull, they may have a damaged shoulder. If she was not successfull, her foot would meet the ground causing it to crack under her sheer strength. The nervious gril would then raise and proceed towards zetsumo's next location.

* - Fri Sep 04 09:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) her kick would be delayed ever so slightly  giving them little time to relocate, but if they stayed in the same spot next to her...they would most likely be hit. 

However if they relocated and formed the seals, her foot would land on the ground cracking it under her sheer strength before quickly giving chase to zetsumo. Her hands covered in mud as they were used to push herself up, she suddenly stoped in a skid and both arms raised into an X position. They would be sent backwards and downwards onto their butt.  She would look up towards them with a nervious smile...she was a bit rusty in using her techniques, but was getting better as they days went by.

Raising up, she would begin looking around herself just staring at her cloak. Maybe she could wash it out later."mm..." Her calm eyes went back onto zetsumo as she dashed forwards once more aiming to close the distance as fast as she could.* - Fri Sep 04 10:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would continue her run towards Zetsumo. Once they were close, she watched as they formed a three seals and built up their chakra.  As they breathe inwards, paine leaped into the air with a twist of her body, a rough hurrican like shape began to take hold of her form. Her right leg extended outwards and came in a blur once more as she hoped to prace this technique before she had grown too tired to use it.

Her right leg passed infront of  the fireball and the hurrican began to expand outwards dissapaiting the first fire ball. Her next leg came forward towards the next two as they bashed against their leg dissapating. They then came downwards with in a very fast blured spin infront of zetsumo aiming for a leg sweep once more while her hurraine like wind expanded outwards onto them hoping to damage them with it...and her kick.

"Hahhh!!!"

The nervious girl would continue to fight hard hoping to get more acustom to training with this new given technique untill she could not use it anymore.When she had gotten more acustom to using it, they may use it in her combo in the future but for now...they had to get used to spinning this fast..Her breathing was  begining to get irregulated as this attack happened.
* - Fri Sep 04 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would continue to spin, but it was gradually getting slower almost to normal speed as they came down aiming to leg sweep them.  It was then she remebered the other skill she had, it was called leaf rising wint. As her foot touched the ground, her body twisted leaning downwards towards the left as her leg retracted from the side  and they remained in a crouched position. A hand rested on the ground, elbow bent slightly as they rested on their side.

 Pushed off the ground using her left hand upwards into the air aiming to send an upwards kick towards Zetsumo's stomach area as her bent right foot extended outwards quickly. They aimed to probably get a hit in during this training session. A nervious smile would be on her face as they did this , they were still the strongest out of all of them as a leader should be. 

Paine aimed to kick them into the air. It was time to do a make shift hidden lotus

Rawr!!!!* - Fri Sep 04 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) hand would of been swatted just before she pushed off into the air. They would begin spinning side as they pushed off and went behind her landing. Paine breathe inwards and outwards slowly as she stood up feeling a bit fataged. They seemed to only get this way when they sparred zetsumo for the most part...maybe in the future that would change... Her gaze rested upon the fact that they formed a few more seals before executing their next jutsu... 


The mud path began to rupture inbetween zetsumo and herself. They needed to get past this thing, but rest assured, she will find away around it. This time however, not thought brute force as she wanted to use a lower tired spin that she was more accustom to than a higher one that she wasent. Pushing off her feet, she began to run forward towards zetsumo before going into a slide avoiding the first  mud ball that passed over her head before pushing off her feet and jumping into the air as it shot another towards the ground below her. Their bodys swayed from left to right as they landed slightly stumbling before continueing her run.

"mm.."

When the earth dragon shot their next mud bullet she decided not to evade this time and jumped up into the air. Her mudded, torn and ripped clothes that appeared due to her evading had done. Robe flew off her body and fell onto the ground. The nervious girl came downwards in a very fast horrizontal spin slaming her heel down against the mud bullet. "mmmnhaa!!!" She yelled forced her body forwards while bending her knee slightly in this intstance. Her foot rest on the other side of the mud bullet before pushing herself off of it and jump up into the air and over the mud dragon. 

They would then fall downwards with a dynamic entry kick aiming for their chest area. A soft breath of air escaped her lips. 

She was now doing a bruce lee jump kick [http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/26700000/flying-kick-bruce-lee-26727091-1150-762.jpg]

WAPOW!!!!* - Fri Sep 04 12:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) it was true..she came at them with dynamic entry. It was a weak skill, but she chose the chest area for a reason and as the hit was made in turn to activate her combo. A loud thud sound was heard, her body twisted downwards towards the left and her right foot was then extended outwards aiming slam against their head  in a spinning motion before suddenly it was stopped by the threads of Zetsumo wrapping around  one of her body parts once more. Her ankle this time as they were pulled backwards stoping that action.

They were spun and spun around.

She decided to take advantge of this to her best ability and did this instead. During the first rotation, she was first flug backward and rested on her left bent leg while her right was being pulled around. Paines right eye closed to avoice the small specs of mud that flew upwards due to zetumos harsh grabbings. They wanted to work with this.

-Second Rotation-

She pushed off her left foot and began spinning around like a top as they were soon realed in by the threads. Their speed getting gradually faster and faster. Her foot aimed to hit against their stomach area.

A soft breath exhaled her out her lips...as she fell backwards onto the ground wrapped in loose jungo threads infront of zetsumo. They were rather exhausted at this point. She breathe inwards and outwards rather heavily..letting go of her calm and regulated breathing....showing her fatiague.

"p-power......"

She asked curiously inbetween deep breathes..and also taking a few moment to actually get the word correct.* - Fri Sep 04 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) wold close her eyes resting on the ground. She really did have no more energy left to even stand up at the moment...no...actually she did...but not enough to attack effectily. For now...she just wanted to rest on the muddy ground that felt comfortable. Her body was covered with ash and her clothes were burned a burned and cut up a it. This was really a hard fight for her...she wants to grew up from soon.

"i-im..t-tired.."

she would say. Her gaze then shifted towards the new arivals...Was something about to happen?...It was then rested back upon Zetsumo, a nervious smile was given.* - Fri Sep 04 13:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) walks out from the back with her right hand raised to wipe her eyes slowly.

"mm..."* - Mon Sep 07 21:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would turn to face them, they wanted help from her...but for ink. What good can ink do again....she rather did not know since they were a villager at best. An expressionless face with calm emerald eyes would stare at them from a moment or two before two anime styled comedic circles appeard on her face. A nervious smile appeared on her expressionless face while a hand lowered just infront of her chest to point towards herself.

"u-umm..."

They were curious if they ment her or someone else.

* - Mon Sep 07 21:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would blink at them for a moment...they wanted her herself to get them ink. She rather did not want to do that for the most part...they seemed to want ink an aweful lot which is served as strange...then again...she heard the interigation the other day just before they went into their deep mediation as usual. Her hands remained at her sides as her calm eyes lowered slightly...Zetsumo promised her power...something she is still on the path to gaining..but it changed along the way and now she did not know...

"i...i can not do..that.."

They said giving them a small smile. Her body lowered to reach for her hat and cloak before picking them and putting it on. They had a spare cloak from three years ago, so she might as well put it to good use now. Once they were on, she sat down in a meditative position and leaned against the wall. They were planning to train in her mindscape with rose and so they closed their eyes and was off to their world, 

The noise around the nervious girl would begin to turn into blurs and as usual her hands would react if someone tried to take off her hat since they knew the difference from having it on or off. 

"mm.."* - Mon Sep 07 21:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would sit in a meditative position before looking towards the others in their small group. She was wondering what everything was so quiet.* - Tue Sep 08 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would close her eyes and later went into her meditative world. The sounds around her had soon become a blur as they began breathing inwards and outwards rather slowly. Paine herself was usually the one to be this quiet, but to see the others like this was a bit disturbing to her...so they went to train with Rose as they usually did when they were around a large group of people and wanted to keep to herself.

--Mind Scape Vision-

Her eyes slowly opened, her legs were dangled along the edge of the wooden pathway before both hands were put to good use in pushing herself up. Supporting her weight with her left hand, her right was raised and later used to wipe her eyes. Rose walked into the living room from the kitchen and stood behind her with their arms folded. They had an annoyed look in their eyes before they spoke."hey...weakling...the first part of our training is almost done....i just need to evaluate some things..." The old women said these words seriously before putting both arms behind their back and motioned over to the table with their head. Paine's calm worried gaze shifted over towards the table. There was a steaming bowl of soup...two to be exact and there was a male sitting besides it with a bowl of noodles. They seemed to be a bit younger than Rose...but that was only to her knowledge on looks and what not.

"mm..."

Paine was struggling to stand up...but why was everything feeling so heavy...her limbs felt like they have been moving untill definite exhaustion and with each step her knees kept bending causing her to stumble. What excatly was happening...and just who was this person sitting at the table infront of her.

-Mindscape Vision End-

A hurricane like wind would begin to formulate around the Concealed Figure as they remained in their meditative position. It pushed softly.* - Tue Sep 08 21:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would reach the table stareing at the oldish man whom held chop sticks in one hand while holding the bowl with the other. His hair was black and in a slightly long loss pony tail, but of course...their hair held some gray hairs showing his age. Rose stared at the two before sighing and walking over towards them and standing directly behind them as paine droped in to a sitting position. "eh....i had better food from the young girls over in the other village...maybe..two and three villages away?" The old man said with a creepy smile which caused paine to blink before speaking. "t-three villages a-away?" The old man looked over to the young girl with a slightly blushing face and widened eyes. "i..is this the one!?" 

Rose had enough of her old friend and raised up her left leg and kicked him in the face and towards the fall in the back. Paine had her eyes closed before looking up towards rose with comedic styled white circles as eyes while holding a nervious smile. Rose turn towards her with their teeth grinding against each other as they waved a hand at the man with their back turned on the ground against the wall. " you see that thing over there...." Paine did not see a thing...but it was a man instead...so why did they call them a thing...but she decided not to ask and decided just to nod in compliance so she would not get kicked as well...or even worse..punched. "if he ever touches innapporpriately...you come get me...alright...im only a day away..." Rose looked back towards the man she deemed was a thing with comedic angry eyes as the old man  pushed themselfs out of the rubble.

[Roses Eyes] https://media.giphy.com/media/eoZOuZVqMg240/giphy.gif

"I have a name you know.....its Kyo..." They wore a robe that was a old blueish color and white. Rose went walked over towards Kyo and pointed backwards at Paine. She was confused as they began argueing with eachother while she herself stared down at her soup and began eating rather slowly not really sure about what was happening...but hoped that they will get along soon....which...probably may never happen...

Oh dear...* - Tue Sep 08 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) hearing blurs,  of someone wanting to spar they dropped their spoon in the soup while the two old people were argueing and quietly let the living room and sat down on the wooden path way. Laying down she closed her eyes and went back to realitly. Opening her eyes, she would let out a soft breath of air as she stood up from her meditative position.

Raising up a hand she would wipe her eyes before yawning softly." t..training?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) follows.* - Wed Sep 09 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) remained in no stance as usual. To tell the truth, she was still thinking of one to create after zetsumo mentioned that some of the other taijutsu fighters used stances as well. Both hand raised to pull back her hat so it would remain behind her head.  A nervious smile was then given to them as her hand lowered and dangled at her side.

"u-umm...is this area t-to your liking?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) nods as her face turned to an expressionless and her calm eyes lowered slightly.* - Wed Sep 09 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they began sprinting forwards and seemed to move very very fast and without pause as well. Within just a moment, they were infront of her just infront of her. Her right hand raised up and was sent towards their inner part of their elbow in order to cause it to bend inwards. Her head lead back slightly allowing the kuni to swiftly pass through. She blinked twice before quickly taking hold of the arm. 

If she was successful, she would pull them inwards and send a fist towards their stomach area aiming to knock the wind out of them. They wernt going with kicks this time...atleast not in the begining.

"mmm?"* - Wed Sep 09 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) arm was sent forwards, but stoped mid way they jump backwards to avoid it. Paines head tilted slightly to the right allowing a few strands of hair to cover her calm emerald eyes. Her hand lowered to her side as she remained confused to what was going on. They were using so much procaution towards her, but was she really that dangerous. She began wondering if rose saw her this way too and decided to introduce her to a new teacher...that kyo just seemed a bit weird to her and rose had told her to stay weay of them...and to warn them if they had done anything to her. Did rose really hate them that much that she had to warn her about her new teacher..

Snapping out of her thoughts, her emerald eyes stared at kat as they dashed forwards back into them. She was going to attempt to attack her again...mmm..they kicked their right foot against the ground and her body twisted in a very fast motion as a hurrican like wind began to surround her form. They quickly went downwards and aimed to leg sweep them as the wind that circuled around them pushed against them violently aiming to send them backwards..stumble or tumble over and make her blurred leg sweep able to hit. 

She hoped to send them backwards allowing her strong gust of wind to carry them. If their attack hit, their legs would...umm hurt greatly.

This was probably the only time they would use this in the spar they are having right now.* - Wed Sep 09 02:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) left eye caught a glimps of her oppoenets evade. She ended up ending the leg sweep in their direction sending a strong gust of wind in their direction and the hurricane like wind that she possessed around her body would be sent outwards and dissipated  like it usually did. Her body felt a tiny bit numbed, but they she would just have to push through. Raising up into a standing position, the calm girl would give them a nervious smile, they were getting faster and faster and soon she would not be able to keep up.

They pivoted backwards backwards and stepped on the tree before swaying behind it. They hoped the strong gust of wind sent would beable to hold them off for a moment if they decided to charge back in her direction as they moved and tried to recover for the most."mm..." They had to think of something, she still could not get near them either due to their speed or electricity. Paine sighed inwardly trying to remeber what exactly zetsumo would do.

Looking down, she would stare at her hand for a moment that shook ever so slightly as she clenched it. As a pure taijutsu user, she had to think of atleast think of something. They soon began to climb up the tree.* - Wed Sep 09 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would rather not get up that high in the tree yet since she was rather taking her time since they well thinking of a plan, but still at a slightly fast speed. It was then she felt something enter the tree under her foot and they kicked off of it quickly diagonally towards the right and twisted her body in a very fast into a spin. During her pivot, her lower left leg  and right lower leg seemed to been cut at the side due to the spikes that came forwards from the other side.

"n..no...time to rest..." 

She said quietly to herself while in the air spinning towards the next location. They stayed on alert now..the lower part of her robe finally torn by her oppoenets jutsu attacks....oh dear... A huricane like wind would begin to surround her form and they spun around and around and around. Her mind began to drift to her thoughts for a moment. Rose said something about unlocking power...something...about if she did her training...they would become stronger...and now she was almost complete with it. But what exactly did they mean by that.

"zetsumo..."

They said in their mind as they came back to reality. What type of power was he refering to...what exactly did he mean by those words he said long ago..Coming back to reality, she saw herself finally about to lower downwards from her glide towards the ground. They breathe inwards and outwards slowly remebering the words of rose...that a taijutsu user must never show fatage or weakness in a fight....maybe they can do something if she just believes in herself enough...* - Wed Sep 09 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) foot would land on three before bending slightly, They then pushed off it causing the whole three to shake and leaves to fall  or follow the swirling wind around her form. Katsune had her on the run, she can not top the jutsus that this user had used. 

Coming out of her spin still in mid air. Both hands raised as and gave a sign of her giving up along with a nervious smile. They all had their areas of strength believe it or not and paine knew when to stop...that and she was getting tired.

As they landed, leaves surrounded her form and some landed on her head. A hand raised to scratch the back of her head before yawning softly and using the other hand to cover it slightly.* - Wed Sep 09 03:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give them a small smile before putting back on her hat. She wanted to be awake during this spar, so she had it off, but now they would only be semi here as their concealed calm emerald eyes became dull and her face became expressionless. 

"l-lets head b-back"

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) began to sit in a meditative position. Wind began to surround her form pushing outwards softly like a cool breeze as they closed their eyes.* - Wed Sep 09 04:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) shakes her head rather slowly meaning no.* - Wed Sep 09 15:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) the handle would hit her in the face and she would fall backwards onto the ground. Both hands raise to rub against her face as the rolled once to the left and once to the right. A few tears left her calm emerald eyes as she began rubbing her face with both hands.

"w..why.."

She said as she raised up into a sitting position with her head tilted down and both hands rubbing her face.* - Wed Sep 09 15:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) looking look she would give them a nod as another arm raised to wipe her tears. * - Wed Sep 09 15:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would see beth throw a kuni at shin when her hand lowered to her side. Pushing off her feet, they would begin running forwards but was stoped from doing that action by stepping on her cloak and falling downwards face first onto the ground.

"mm.."

Raising up, her hat slid backwards and was held behind her head by the strap that was around her neck. Her calm eyes grew comedic anime styled white circles as her head bobbled from side to side. 

"mm...."* - Wed Sep 09 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) rose up wiping her face  and lowered her hands into balled fists in an upwards position leveled close to her chest. They would then shake her head rather slowly meaning no before speaking. Comedic white circles took place of her eyes. http://38.media.tumblr.com/595c51e07a0bcc3211e88403b6bbe61b/tumblr_n2aat5Gnf81ssxsn1o1_500.gif

"b-but..c-cloak impor-to...no...i..nee..b..but..hides...m-i..need...n-no!!"

They said scared and uncontroably at the thought of losing her cloak. The evil man this shin was...how could he.* - Wed Sep 09 15:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod towards towards them as she pouted slightly and give them a determined nod.

This cloak is the same one that zetumo gave her...one day...she will get a mock two..like in batman Alkham knight...and beable go mock 9 when shooting out of the back car....she was ready for action...in due time..* - Wed Sep 09 15:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would begin to walk on all fours before jumping up into the air trying to slap down the hunny bun out of his hand. * - Wed Sep 09 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) upon landing, in a crouch, they picking it up and rose up before placing it in her mouth. Turning in the direction of zetsumo, they lowered one hand in a fist and bend in an arch backwards while the other rose up in a fist fowards in an upwards position. They then dashed forwards at a rather fast speed and hid slightly behind zetsumo.

Going into a crouching position, they would then begin nibbling on her hunny bun.* - Wed Sep 09 15:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give Amai a nervious smile before walking foward and looking up towards zetsumo before looking back towards Ami with a slight expressionless face blinking a few times...that was right...she did not really know them yet. A hand would raise to wave slowly towards them.* - Wed Sep 09 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would walk over towards Sabo before stoping when she was infront of them. They were ready for whatever they wanted to do.* - Wed Sep 09 17:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) blinked as she pushed off her foot and went into a very fast spin as the flame came towards her location. Her right foot raised into the air and as a round house kick..as a hurricane like wind surround her form. Their right hand raised in an horrizontal position like a karate chop across her chest.

When her foot landed on the ground, the flames would hit against whirlwind of fire while their hand which was raise across her chest swayed to the right diagonally downwards causing the fire to blow away from her and outwards as her violent hurricane like wind dissapated outwards...away from her form.

"mmm.."

Leafs would gentally fall down around her from. The flames that did not run into her would hit the building or something else behind her. Her cloak flew upwards as well as opened slightly ruffling in the wind revealing her black paths and coat she wore before calming down.* - Wed Sep 09 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) nods* - Wed Sep 09 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would have her right foot behind their left foot before they bent their knees slightly and pushed off their feet towards Shin's location continueing her combo. As the first few fireballs were shot her way, she sways from left to right and even went into a slide before jumping up into the air and sending two strong kicks towards the four fireballs extinguishing before coming down in a leg sweel allowing her hurrican like wind to expand once more disburting the flames outwards.

Her left leg ended in a slide behind her right leg as she jumped into the air and aimed to send a dynamic entery towards their chest area.* - Wed Sep 09 18:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would he would of been hit.  She landed blinking a few times, they had not put that much power into her kick, so he should be ok. A hand would extend to help them up.* - Wed Sep 09 18:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) nods giving them a nervious smile.* - Wed Sep 09 19:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give a nervious smile over towards Beth upon seeing them enter the area.* - Wed Sep 09 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod as she pulled on her hat.

"t-they did?"* - Wed Sep 09 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain unmoving, but infront of beth would be two teachers. An old man and old women with both their arms crossed staring at Beth with a sleeping Paine behind them.

--Mind Scape Vision-

They were in a japanese styled house and a garden stood in great beauty behind it showing that it was well taken care of. A powerfull area emited from the two figures which showed their power as they gazed downwards at the young girl. The old women spoke first. " oh...its you..how did you get in here...oh well...you dear tresspass into my house" Their foot stomped onto the ground causing the whole house the thremble with fear...she held an annoyed look on her face.

The old man akwardly placed their hands into the sleves of their robes and held an akward smile while moving backwards stareing at her and keeping watch for anything that might drop on paine from the angry womens rage.

--Mind Scape Vision end-

In reality, paine would end up being unmoving with pale eyes.



* - Wed Sep 09 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

They did not have utter control just yet...they were struggling to move the limbs or even speak straight to make out a complete sentence...they could not make a step forward with out stumbling showing there was something wrong with them. Meaning they kept struggling to say a single sentence and it ended up in many shutter...they had to defeat the keeper of gate one and gate two if they wanted complete control of paine. 

The mental stikes where she excelled at would be proving difficult towards paine in making them to their bidding.

--Mindscape vision-

"the..hell did...you say to me....you dam WEAKLING...." they vanished in a blur and appeared besides them due to the smallness of the area. A leg raised and aimed to strike the infultrators rib cage at a blured pace aiming to send them though the wooden wall on the other side of the room and into the forest....not even paine dodges her kicks....they would be very damaged meaning their head would hurt greatly in reality. The old man however sat down and smiled downwards towards  the sleeping paine.

 "air headed...shes far from it.....i would rather she stayed this way" 

They said lazily with a creepy smile. They would then be pelted in the face with a slipper belonging to rose with gritted teeth before they exited the house. The old women seemed to begin to exit the house and stareing at the direction they kicked Beth in.

"STAND UP YOU WEAKLING....DAM WAIST OF SPACE...." She spit on the ground before stareing back at them if they came out of the bushes. When Beth was hit, they would be at the edge of her mind scape.  " you think im a dam distraction....the one whos been training her after they begged so greatly at my feet....so pitiful.."

Rose began to walk forwards cracking her knuckles." show me your strength....weakling.." they said under their breath.

--Mind Scape Vision End--

In reality, Shin would see Paine struggling to move or talk.* - Wed Sep 09 20:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) // 

The old womens hand raised to block the punch, but they wernt sent skidding backwards but just stood there staring down at them while gripping onto the fist." is...this all you have to offer....dam weakling...." They took hold of the fist before pulling them frowards quickly and sending a punch towards their stomach aiming to knock the wind out of them.

"speak with your fist...not your words...maybe you may even cause some damage.....hurry up before i lose interest.."

The old women said with a annoyed look letting go and soon after and taking a few steps allowing them to grovel up to their feet...but something else would of happened if they were able to block the punch as well.

Back to REALITY

Paine remained standing up motionless and her emerald calm eyes were dull. Her hat would slide backwards and would rest on the back of her head due to the string that was around her neck. This was caused by the step forward and the lean back into a perfect standing position.* - Wed Sep 09 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) // 

Rose stood up straight as they watched the intruder vanished. "mmm....i should tell that old man..oh....oh no..." Rose turned around running back towards the house to make sure that kyo did not touch Paine in any sort of way...she had forgotten that she left them alone with the sleeping paine.

_ Mind Scape Vission End_

Paine remained motionless as they had moved...why wouldent it...but non the less was freed as they released the technique apparently. But something was wrong, her body stayed motionless and unmoving while her eyes tilted downwards remaining dulled out.* - Wed Sep 09 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would suddenly wakes up looking around curiously. Everyone was here, did she miss something..* - Wed Sep 09 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give them a nod wondering what exactly was going on..did something happen?* - Wed Sep 09 21:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary)  would look over towards Amai...they had no ink...or did they...* - Wed Sep 09 21:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would walk over towards amai before stoping when she was infront of them. 

"h-hi..."* - Wed Sep 09 21:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) nods* - Wed Sep 09 21:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nerviously smile towards the group of people. The silence was defining. 

"u-umm....what can you d-draw?"* - Wed Sep 09 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) began to walk off,* - Thu Sep 10 19:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would say douting herself a bit...a nervious and clumsy girl like paine as a taijutsu instructor...that was rather strange on its own that someone would think of them as worthy of being called an instructor.* - Thu Sep 10 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) smiles nerviously as she began to walk over towards them. It was best to speak in person than over a fence.

" s-speed....i-i dont think...i-i can ever reach their l-level of s-speed....b-but i can see them c-coming towards me...w-with slight ease..."* - Thu Sep 10 23:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a small smile. Zetsumo thought that she would be able to surpass the speed of katsune. When she heard about genetics, this rather made her small smile drop and a blank face would be seen. Blinking a few times taking a few moments to regester this face, a worried expression appeared.

"w-wahh...were they in an f-freak accident"

She hoped they were not. maybe that was the cause of their genetic powers. Like spiderman when they got bit by a spider...they now had spider sences which in this world they call...sensory + perception* - Thu Sep 10 23:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) blinked a few times before giving them a nod. SHe was never at her best ablitliy however...just how was she sopost to meet his standards. They usually fought most of the kenryoku with her subconcious allowing her body to move robotically on their own while she herself was in her mindscape resting or sleeping. After thinking for a moment, she looked back towards Zetsumo before speaking once more.

"u-umm...i-il try..." 

A nervious smile reformed deciding to give it a shot...the training could not go that bad...could it......oh dear...* - Thu Sep 10 23:41:52 2015

Pushing off her right foot, they jumped upwards and entered a very fast blurred counter clockwize spin. Her right leg came outwards as a violent hurricane like wind began to surround her form aiming to  send the hell of her right foot against his rib cage. If they were successfull, they would be sent flying into the tree south of them  and probably breaking it. Landing, the wind disbursted and they began to chase after them.

 It was time for their spar...they needed to get strongu.* - Fri Sep 11 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Anything else happened at the spa besides the mud bath? - Fri Sep 11 11:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would continue her run towards the Shin. The things he came up with were so interesting her nervious smile droped and a blank face appared. She charged forwards towards the person in hand woundering what they were going to do next and keeping warey of her surroundings before going into a sudden slide and jumping up into the air. They had to figure out what they had exactly planned to do before she had gotten there but without knowing, her mind began to drift off to her thoughs as they began losing focus on the fight that the both of them were having mentally...but began to fight subconciously.

The nervious girls bodys twisted once more heading towards the tree that nicked her sparring partners body. Her calm dulled emerald gaze that was consealed by the hat she wore saw the whirlwinds that formed around the person. A hurrican like wind began to surround the girls form violently as their left leg extended outwards and was sent towards the tree upon her arival. As their foot hit against the tree, a dented mark was made along with the sound of cracking wood. Bending her knee quickly, they pushed off of it and began soring through the air spinning once more continue her combo while in the air.

Her mind drifted off to thoughts about zetsumo wanting her to be their taijutsu instructor..why her of all people...why not katsune as they were more faster and more proficent in terms of hitting stuff or avoiding being hit rather than her of all people...just they were so posessed on selecting her fot the task at hand. The young girl sighed in her mind scape letting her legs dangle off the end of the wooden path way which was the bridge between the garden and roses living room. Being as early as it was...rose was off working and kyo was off prepareing for her next level of taijutsu training since rose deemed that they were almost done and or showed potential for the next level of fighting.

Both zetsumo and rose had it in for her in terms of pride...could they just be getting their hopes up. She would probably trip and fall while trying to teach their leader to throw a single punch. Her calm eyes just stared off at the garden that she took care of whenever they went into their mind scape...it was thanks in return for roses teachings...it was the least that she could do. 

In reality, her now subconcious body began to spin in the air at very hightened speeds as a violent hurricane like wind surrounded her form aiming to come downwards for a leg sweep aiming to blow them backwards with her strong gust of wind. When her foot reached behind her form, they pushed off their feet aiming to send a dynamic entery kick towards their chest area.

The wind would probably take care of the shuriken as well.* - Fri Sep 11 11:56:35 2015

The leg that was already extended outwards for a leg sweep cut through the air like it was butter before meeting the tips of the flames  and disbursting them making a non flamed circles where they landed, her hurricane like wind protecting her from the flames as it expanded outwards slightly but not gone just yet.

Raising up into a standing position following her still apprent spin, her right arm raised in a horriontal arc across her chest area before finally coming to a stop facing shin. Her right hand swayed ouwards extending horrizontally to the right causing her cloak to flow upwards refealing her black jacket and black pants which went along with their boots.

The violent hurricane like wind expanded outwards dispelling the flames that appared before her and finally ending in a stare towards Shin whom had been at a even farther position away from them. They had bought time to run, and so she should probably try to catch up to them during this time. Pushing off her feet, she began running forwards towards their position....just how did he get so fast she wondered....she rather did not see since the flames rather disturbed the site...

The subconcious girl began chage at their foe....it was time to fight on water...,,maybe...probably...yes..* - Fri Sep 11 12:22:11 2015
