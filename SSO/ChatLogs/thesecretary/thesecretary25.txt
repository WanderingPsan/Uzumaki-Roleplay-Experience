<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to make her way from the settlement and began to make her way back to sunagakure. She jumped into the air and began traveling from tree to tree eastwards. Her movements were slow and calm not wanting to rush...her heart was calm in sence of being able to see that ortho was ok...but she was not able to talk with them as they had needed to speak with his brother like person of a friend. So for now, she was going to leave feeling like she was going to beable to speak to them later on...however that was what she hoped...they were going to offer to help them in what they were going to do...But she never got the chance to ask that...so she was not going to be able  to be besides them....and make sure they stayed alive....othro also said that this sort of thing was called...what was it...preventing the inevitable....mmm.....she must just watch and observe...when friends fight...because straying from her own path was bad...and following another path..was just as bad...hmm..

The nervous girl landed in sand before begining her long walk the rest of her way to suna. Looking to her right, she saw the large cavern that quicken the time to get from one place to another before looking back to ahead of her watching the cavern vanish into the distance. A nervous smile formed on her lips as she began to runn after it practing her speed. Both hands raised as she began to practice her new technique. She suddenly jumped forwards into the air and tiled her body downwards...her right hand touched the ground before they began spinning upside down while sending multiple kicks in a spining rotation around around her body....she felt like this could be used like mirari's rotation..technique...protecting her from being attacked by multiple foes at the same time....As she finished her unskilled version of the technique, she placed her right foot on the ground before pulling herself forwards back up into a standing position. Her right hand was pulled forwards as she pushed the air infront of her and continued her run towards the village. After some time had passed, she reached to village gate and the guards ran over to the girl whom suddenly was on her knees gasping for breath. One of them handed her a water while the other patted her back. Looking up to them...each of them..a nervous smile was given as the had taken the water and later took a sip. She would then exhale softly and had given it back to them giving her thanks before walking further into the village and later into the square...

It was time to see her student...or umm...students...since they all are conviently in suna.* - Wed Nov 18 04:24:32 2015

She could not ever pronounce the terms stated within the text that was in that paper work...let alone answer the questions....so she was not focused on what was in her way from getting up....oh dear.

When yan looked over to her to see how she was doing with her food...a moment would pass before she looked back towards them giving them a small smile as she swallowed.

Zen suddenly turned around and stared at the nervous girl whom was seated before her and gaze them a smile as the last customer exited the shop. "so...your finally up huh..?" She asked in a rather 'about time' type of tone which caused the nervous girl to lower her eyes slightly. Her sensei suddenly sighed softly before placing down the glass she was cleaning and walking towards the bar enterance. They raised a hand to move her bangs out of their eyes before suddenly locking the door and turning around. "come on....follow be to the room....after were done...i have a delivery for you to make" Zen said before walking over to the counter as paine hoped off the stool and landed on her feet. She suddenly felt hands on her shoulders pushing her towards the inner rooms of the bar which she stayed and helped out a bit at times. Their head looked up towards zen in a little curiousity and wonder but zen just sighed and said the words. "come on....the faster we get there...the more delieveries you can make..." And so the duo began walking over towards the training sight before coming to a stop within the middle of the room.

Zen would walk a bit further before turning around and facing paine. "are you...ready?"Paine on the other hand would stare at them curiously before a nervous smile was made and she suddenly vanished in a blur and reapparing in a crouched down position infront of them, her right foot then extended to meet her mentors stomach but notice both of their hands were in a cross before suddenly blocking it. This caused the whole entire to shake slightly as wind blew outwards and around them before retracting her feet. The nervous girl now in a crouching position kicked off into the air and twisted the upper half of her body caused the rest to folow suit in the blur. Her right leg extended outwards aiming to slam her foot into zens side while her facial expression changed from a nervous smile to one of no emotion as they now focused on the spar at hand like she had always done.* - Thu Nov 19 17:30:01 2015

Zen sent forwards their left hand outwards blocking harshly againt their foot before sending their right hand forwards towards her stomach area as their teeth gritted a bit. Paine sent forwards her hand to rip onto her mentors before suddenly feeling herself being pulled closer and later felt a hard object launch upwards into her stomach area. A large bubble of air escaped her lips she watched her mentor pivote backwards leaving her student to fall on to her needs gasping for breath. Zen placed both hands in a cross before hearing her mentor say the words. "are...you really..ready?" she asked curiously as her eye brow raised. Paine couldnt tell if the emotion they were giving off was real however...she did not want to give up on her training....they had started five years ago and had come so far. Every words from her friends giving her encouragement....even the new problems she was facing now....

The nervous girl slowly pushed herself up to her feet and wiggled her body. She was letting the problems of what happened in the real world cloud her mind...and cloud her thoughts during this spar with her mentor....she shouldnt worry about ortho...dieing...but she did...she wanted to change this unforgiving world for the better or for the worst...but how was she sopost to achieve something like that....or was she sopost to persue something like that. How would she...make something of that magnitude...happen. The female suddenly pushed off her feet as she gritted her teeth and began sending multiple kicks and punched towards her mentor zen...each punch that the each of them did was returned or dodged in some sort of fashion....they were begiinning their high speed rally.* - Thu Nov 19 17:56:28 2015
