<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) began running forwards towards amai with a nervious smile on her face. It was time to spar!!!* - Sun Sep 20 15:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would continue her run towards amai as they got a bottle of ink and and began drawing quickly as they smoke. Her face began to grow expressionless...as they heard their words and six ink lions leaped out of the scroll....taking positions around the girl whom she was about to hit...or thought...but it was actually the ink creations that were sopost to take the beating...

The nervious girls emerald eyes lowered slightly....covered by her blinds, this was going to be a ink fight and not a hand to hand combat fight....A small smile would appear on her face as her hands clentched and the three of the lions came towards her. Paine jumped into the air and twisted her body, a hurrican like wind would sound her form as the two jumped into the air to tackle the taijutsuist.

Her right foot and was pulled forwards with all her strength towards the ink tigers face. "mm!!!" She carried that ink tiger slaming it into the next one and causing both to fall to the ground besides her twitching. She aimed to continue her combo from here as she spin forwards in the direction of amai in mid air....surrounded by a make shift hurricane.
* - Sun Sep 20 16:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) remained expressionless as her spin continued, she would feel the side of the lion's tooth ride against the back her leg but did not mind it as a smallish cut was made. In a blur she spun around again slaming her foot into the side of the lion before carring it over to the next lion and of couse it had exploded as stated before.

As she was coming downwards in a spin, she ended up seeing lions jumping up into the air. aiming to bit into her shoulder. This was begining to seem a bit difficult to say the least. But as usual continued her combo...her combo!!!. The nervious girl remained calm remembering roses training...A soft breath of air escaped her lips and was later inhaled,  She would suddenly go downwards from her elevated state and the whirlwind that was around her began to expand  forcefully slowing down their movements in the air. 

When her foot landed on the ground, a strong gust of wind was made as her leg sweeped across the ground sending them backwards. Her foot slid untill it was behind her form before suddenly, she kicked off her feet and went into a run while the ink tigers were recovering from their blasted and put down state as well as amai since they were in range of the attack. Paine then rushed forwards  before jumping into the air and going into a side ways spin coming downwards aiming to stirke amai in the stomach...not at full power.......but if the lions jumped in....she would counter them at full power...* - Sun Sep 20 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch the lions whom leaped high into the air to avoid her leg sweep and gust of wind  come downwards as she saw the shadown getting larger below her. And so she jumped into the air and twisted her body to the right. Her right foot extended outwards at full strength towards the ink tigers stomach kicking it to the side as it left her leg. 


Paines hidden emerald eyes began to grow dull as to began to seem more focused as she landed on the ground swiftly and began her charge towards Amai with an ink tiger that she landed besides following behind her, but the distance was growing to become greater as their body began moving in slight blurs as she continued after them....the tigers seemed to not beable to keep up. Under the hat that consealed her features, paines eyes began to change from a emerald green to a pure yellow color......her hair changed from black to a pure white color...more white than zetsumos....

When she had neared the tigers that left a small space for her to pass though as they began to run forwards into formation, she  jumped into the air in a counter clock ways direction.

A violent hurricane like wind surrounded her form, both legs outwards and the whirlwind seemed to have caused them to explode into ink almost instantainously, if the tiger that trailed behind her lunged towards her at any time during this spin, they would of been crushed as well. When she landed, her form was completely clean as the ink was send away onto the grass that was around them. The concealed figure then landed before jumping forwards into the air unconcously.

Her body twisted into a spin and a violent hurricane surrounded her form once more.... the nervious girl was after the creator!!!!
* - Sun Sep 20 17:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be spinning in the air, a violent hurricane surrounded her form not deciding the land as the snakes that were below her began to be blasted away into the lake or off to the far north due to the strength of her violent hurricane. When the  tigers leaped forwards towards her from all direction as she was about to land, she body arced diagonally downwards still in her whirlwind as a hand was placed on the ground.

Her elbow bended slightly  as her body continued the spin in a blur as an attempt to  side kick one of the ink lions in the neck.

 If it hadent exploded, she would of used that tiger to clash into the other tigers collecting them and throwing them off to the side. If it did, then she would use that leg to clash into all the ink tigers before pushing off into the back into the air in a spin...

The hurrican like wind continued to surround her form as the wind suddenly transfered to her foot as she came downwards in with her left foot extended aiming to dynamic entery Amai in the chest area....the foot had mask of wind infront of it showing how stong the hit was going to be..

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as she pushed off into the air continueing her spin in an anti clockwize direction  like a spring, she would notice both of the ink tigers launch towards her as they were about to leave the ground..

 In turn, her legs extended outwards in a spinning motion aiming to side kick both lions in side the face or at the side of their neck or body depending on how close they were.. as they pushed off the ground.....but assuming the doged again...or exploded...

If the ink tigers still went on with the attack, she would of been spinning diagonally into the air due to the slight push of her body.

she would be in the air spinning while in her violent hurriane as she turned right side up...coming to a stop...hurricane still active as it never disbursed...,,..

the ink that that was ateempted to slash of her form and later turned into snakes would of been met with her feet..being turned into or exploded into ink with her violent whirlwind fending them off as well......

This nervious girl just did not know when to give up...she stayed in mid air susspended for a moment thinking about what to do next.* - Sun Sep 20 19:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would of been finally caught and held down by the snakes and tigers...they were to fast for her by alot.....a nervious smile was then given to her as she finally gave in.

Amai was the victor and paine was still weak against ninjutsu users..As she was bite into, her nervious smile stayed in place unchangeing.* - Sun Sep 20 19:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was currently laid down on the ground, a small smile was given to them but dident reach out to it in fear of breaking her hand mistakingly since they had not released their gate mode just yet.Her hat slid upwards to hide the upper part of her face as she remained covered with ink...after a while her smile vanished to one of no expression..

They seemed to be resting.* - Sun Sep 20 19:41:13 2015

Taking off her hat, she would safely place it into the hole as well as her white robe. Her emerald eyes lowered slightly as she moved the rock back into place. After hearing of zetsumo's death from the soldiers whom had came rushing back, she turned around and began to walk away slowly...zetsumo's promise was left unfinished and she was no longer bound to the man so what now. She traveled across the large vastness of land, watching the cheers of the people in lesser villagers cheer and remain happy for zetsumo's death of wanting to bring world peace...to destroy the main government that had been watching the villages....laughing in their seats taking in the entertainment they had from all of this..

"f-focus.."

A soft voice left her lips as she exhaled and inhaled once more.....the breathing exercises that rose had thought her inorder to keep calm during a fight, if they were ever to have one.......She made sude the rock looked like it had not been moved before turning around and stareing at the watery plane that was infront of her. Both hands had raises as the water fell on her head soaking her form and clothes. Her right hand was infront of her left hand while her left foot was behind her right foot....knees slightly bended and emerald eyes seeming to be gushing with determination. 

It was time to get started on her training.* - Tue Sep 22 10:53:00 2015

Paines eyes lowered slightly..Her punches were much more swift now and she herself was glad for this, but she could not help but wonder if zetsumo had really died and the whole group seperated and decided to do what they wanted to do just because....they were free...yes free.. A soft breathe of air left the nervious girls lips as she wondered what exactly she was going to do now...that she wasent bound to help her childhood friend whom left this world without fulfilling their promise...

"mmm..."

It was then the birds head lowered and stared at paine whom's movements slowly came to a stop. The both of them were stareing at each ofther for a moment before she took hold of it and brought it to her center. Paine was probably used to it since she had a dove that always found her from time to time when needed. Receving the note that was tied to its leg, she read the note carefully...it stated that kat was now the new hokage and she inturn sighed soft before suddenly smiling at their words which spoke of no torcher...experimentation and everything else that she had as well disliked herself after joining zetsumo's group as he had what she needed...

Giving her a responce, she tied the note back onto the birds leg and sent it off. Reaching for her cloak and hat, she put them on once more and began walking westwards towards the village hidden in the leafs...* - Tue Sep 22 14:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) enters the building, a nervious smile was given.

As she was traveling though the forests slowly from her location on a mountain where she laid down stareing up at the sky, they had a blank mind not really knowing where to go next...no where to appear next...she was thinking about being hidden for a long time and training alone...awaiting for the world and the people whom knew her to forget her existance..but she was curious about what Katsune had stated before about Okaruo...okukaro...okuno....what was it called again....oh dear...she was wondering about that name as she was arriving at the gates and later though the gates at her own slow pace.

The villages villagers whom were around would stare at paine in general woundering whom they were. They instantly stoped to stare while the children were pulled away when they tried to run up to her, or pulled away when she had gotten to close. 'Creek.." the door to the office suddenly opened revealing a white cloaked figure wearing a hat which fully consealed their form.. Closing the door behind them, she walked forwards and stoped besides shin.

A nervious smile was given.* - Tue Sep 22 14:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) both hands would extend to hold kilms, if she was successful, she would hoist them upwards untill they were at chest level...palms faced towards her. Letting go, she moved backwards slightly as both of her feet spaced out a bit while her hands raised up as a fists towards chest level....her...right hand closer to her form and her left was held out a bit away. The nervious girl began to breath outwards slowly and later inhaled as she calm hidden emerald eyes lowered slightly....they were begining to become focused on what they were going to do next which was continue the training that she interupted while in the mountains. The nervious girl began jumping up and later downwards slightly above the ground....not to fast...but slow and steady....Her right hand extended swiftly aiming to hit kilm's left held up palm before suddenly retracting and sending her left fist towards his right held up palm. 


Paine was now in the process of finishing up her training exercise with Kilm. May the odds forever be in your favor. With that, her mind began to grow blank as her thought process stoped and her eyes began to grow dull showing her focus...her breathing remained under control as thought by rose...while kyo had her rest and lift heavy things...she wondered why all those children were at the shine as well. Kyo was just strange and his mysteriousness irked her curiousity...but she decided to drown it for now since they wernt going to their mindscape...right now at this moment...but decided to stay present...She wanted her punches to be stronger and swifter.....to no longer be slow and miss its target by a bit...

This nervious girl had a long way to go...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

The building seemed to be buzzling with people coming and going. Villagers carrying different types of scrolls while others held food for the higer officals whome lived in the mountain side to eat. Some rushing in with a new discovery while others came to do a routinely check on everything that was so post to be in place to things that are not. The Concealed figure....well...was sitting in her chair stareing at the pile of papers that was getting larger by the second while katsune left to rest...should she really be doing that...these papers would not really sign themselves...but non the less it began to pile untill they had decided to put some on the floors around the desk....the room had some light in it, but some darkness as well...the water that driped from an  area in the mansion would echo though out the halls...awaiting to be fixed by its user or fully turned off. 

As she heard the door open once more, she would see Maloth enter...butdid not know what the were here for as she watched them get pushed out of the way for the villager entered carrying a few bags and heading towards the back room nodding a sorry towards the person....continuing on their way. The hokage mansion seemed to be a bustling place of work as what could be seen as normal and an everyday thing. Once they walked forward a bit, a nervious smile would be given to Maloth and later the hokage suddenly walked in...she would notice the desk and the floors  around the desk were piled with paper work.

"mm.."

A soft breath of air left her lips. She never knew a place could be so busy...maybe it was because she slept most of the time.* - Tue Sep 22 23:13:42 2015

"u-umm..konohagakure...but p-put them down p-pease"

This person was holding up two people, she wondered why they would be holding them up like that...did they happen to do something wrong towards this rather large man...or did they now want to serve them food any more because of how much they may have eaten or just over stayed their welcome as they seemed to maybe not pay for their meal...or maybe they are going to ask if they can keep them for them for their own personal gain...

The possiblitys were endless, but non the less...the situation was a serious one...and the concealed figure was no stranger to seriousish matters... The floors seemed to creek a bit from each step the cubby man took...the floors irked with sadness from each of this mans steps...The figurers eyes lowered slightly...just how much more were they going to suffer...* - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015

A soft breath of air had escaped the nervious girls lips, but when she heard the large mans voice once again, she looked up towards them for a moment before speaking.

"u-um...w-we train...s-sleep....and u-umm eat...d-dance...and c-converse....or do missions?"

When she was finished, a nervious smile was given.* - Wed Sep 23 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) leaned back into her chair before speaking. "u-umm.." Her eyes lowered slightly as her mind went blank not really knowing what exactly to say.  His mis shaped words sounded like that of a caveman.....but his will to train or talk about training was rather interesting...dispite how large..big and probably strong they were...he still wanted to do so. She was no ninja whom she guessed them to be...or assumed to be....but they still hoped...yes...they still hoped this world would be more like them.....a hard worker.....A few moments had past as her emerald eyes looked back up towards them...an answer she had towards the words they spoke.

"u-umm...h-honey bun....r-ramen....o-our ramen is the b-best i heard the v-villagers say...."

she said on the subject of food remebing when she traveled and later lived in this place just have she had arrived into the country that hoisted the great five nations...not sure on the number since she was a tourist..not being her native land. After the pause, she spoke once more. 

"f-for training..y-your could...punch a t-tree?"

She said curiously...punching threes was a good pass time...however..she hoped that was a good answer...to soothe the large beast.* - Wed Sep 23 01:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) walks enter giving them a nervious smile before stoping on her foot. Leaing forwards  onto the tips of her toes, the nervious girl twisted her body turning eastwards....paused for a moment as her smile vanished leaving a blank face...and began walking eastwards. 

She seemed to be thinking about something at the moment.* - Wed Sep 23 09:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would enter the room thinking about what had happened the day before and sat down quietly thinking to herself about what had happened the other day. Everything seemed so unreal...she was not in sunagakure..but she was now in konogakure....the village hidden in the leafs once more....but under a different persons rule this time around. Katsune had stated she needed more experenced people...no shinobi in general to be within this village...but could she, herself be catergorized as much....was she all that experienced....they had not even known genjutsu or any ninjutsu...but still they had aimed to pin their hopes on her......After a few moments of thinking to herself...the nervious girl had fixed her legs into a meditative position before closing her eyes. Everything felt like a roose....or a game....peoples lives felt to her like they were in the palms of entertainement...was that how zetsumo felt when he had torchered others. A soft breathe of air escaped her lips as she tried to make her mind calm...slowing down her thought process...makeing herself seem or feel more vonerable....wanting kronos back alive but can not have that luxary...and now was alone to wonder the vast plain they called the world...of shinobi...in this land.

"mmm..."

Her mind finally went blank as she slowly drifted away into her mindscape after some time had passed. She was finally able to train in her own way, remaining quiet...calm and collected...just safe and sound.

__Mind Scape Vision__

Paine opened her eyes slowly to see..a blury vision of the shine infront of them. The child with black hair and red eyes whom slept next to them was gone....where could they have gone..oh dear..how long has she been out. The wind blew causing a chill and herself to hold both her arms.  The nervious girl exhaled softly before raising up and walking towards the main room slowly which was infront of her. Feeling movement ontop of her head, she stoped for a moment to look up....with her eyes...at the bunny that was ontop of her head, it later slid down due to the windy wind and fell into her arms...when they raised to catch it. The nervious girl blinked a few times before nerviously smiling and holding the bunny close to her chest, she then began walking towards and later into the shine before walking along the halls. Loud noses would heard from the sparring room as the floors creeked and kyo's voice echoed a few times.

"w-wahh"

She continued walking forwards and later stoped when she saw kyo sparing slowly with the group with a smile on their face. The children around them laughed and later tackled them before falling downwards onto the group. The large shine felt full of life. Kyo...was a strange man...but she always woundered...if they were trying to teach her something...she had yet to understand. Pushing off into the room, she placed the white bunny ontop of her had and stoped infront of a log  that was placed besides the group. Jumping up into the air in a spin, she aimed to round house kick the object...and so...her traiing had begun.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would re-enter the kage mansion woundering why the bell of the academy was run. She was currently training in her minescape, but her body moved unconciously at the moment. Stoping her movements upon noticing kilm, the unconcious girl would give them a nervious smile before heading off back towards their previous location unless stoped for some unknown reason. 

__Mind Scape Vision__

As the nervious girls feet hit against the log a loud smacking sound was heard. She decided to work on her kicks now, her movements seemingly becoming blured and the kids stareing the the older person in awe. The children began to surround the nervious girl  and paine began to feel a bit off...she had come here to train and get  her mind off of things in reality...but felt bothered by the children whom watched her train. It felts weird to her believe it or now...she never really found her self as that interesting...but they rather did since they have never seen people move this fast before...wait...no...shouldent they have...isent ko...a person whom takes care of them...he should have thought them alreast to that level. Paine later shook her head slowly disregarding the thought for now....she felt lost about what her teacher was trying to tell her...

The log began shifting in blurs as it did in the past as eash kick was sent forwards. Kyo folded his arms within the arm sleves of his kimono. "hmm...she should really take it easy..." he said to himself. After a few moments had passed they spoke up." Oi..!!....Paine...slow it down a notch!!!" A crooked grin would form as the oldish man began to walk forwards....Paine would look back towards them as their movements began to grow slower..she had a slight worried expression on her face as well...just what exactly were they going to teach her at this moment...* - Wed Sep 23 11:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

Kyo walked up to the opposit side of the log and seemed to be watching the log shift slowly from each strike. He was waiting for the right moment to strike the log to interupt paine...kyo would normally pick her up if she was sleeping somewhere...but he did not pick her up this time and let her rest. She woundered why he would do such a thing...but thought of it as a lesson to not to fall asleep just anywhere...She would suddenly snapped out of her thoughts when she felt the logs come to an abrumpt. Kyo had had kicked the other side of the log at the same time as paine....The nervious gril looked at them curiously wondering if she should keep going since she had been here for a while...hoging one of the only two logs they currently had in the room...sparing and taijutsu did not seem like a regular thing in this place of learning...

"mm..."

Her calm emerald eyes  lowered slightly not knowing what to do next untill she heard kyo yell out to her. "baka....continue will ya?" The voice was one of taunt and joy in a playful way. When her gaze raised to look upon his form, there was a breath taking smile on this mans face. Maybe he thought that she was alone since she purposly avoided the large group. A soft breath of air left her lips as she drifted away from those thoughts for a moment and look towards them with a nervious smile and spoke."o-ok" A foot was pulled back and so was his own and another was sent forwards at the same time his own was. She felt the shift as the power struggle begin. The two people on opposite sides began moving in blurs sending multiple kicks towards the log trying to make it shift in a direction to their liking...

but paine...was on the lesser end of things...* - Wed Sep 23 11:37:48 2015

The children crowed around them in a circle watching what was happening infront of them. The small girl in general walked forwards to see what was happening and caught a glips of the white bunny that was lent to her ontop of paines hand....and so the girl tried the get a better look at what exactly was going on...as the bunny jumped off her hand and landed in the arms or the black haired little girl...........Paine would continue her strikes focused on beating her mentor at their own game while they decided to strike against her not wanting to lose to his own student. The two fearcely fought on for an hour before suddenly stoping due to kyo holding the log still.

"thats...enough..just realx for the rest of the day..."

His right hand was on hid knee as they were talking with a few breif pauses. A lazy smile would be plastered on their lips and paine only smiled nerviously as they rose up seemingly full of energy again. A hand lowered to rest on paines shoulder spinning them around and pushing them towards the exit. "come on..get goin...just make sure you relax...no mo..training for ya..." they said jokingly as the rached for their book and began walking off. This man kept telling her to rest...was she pushing herself to hard...or was this all a test...this person confused her greatly...was each teach this different in the styles they taught in. Placing her hands in her hoodie, she began to walk off into a different to a different location to rest..maybe in her room...but when she had opened the door, she saw the girl she had met before holding her bunny..they had black hair and red eyes...

Did...they need something of her...* - Wed Sep 23 12:08:32 2015

_mind scape vision_

She had opened the door and stared at her own bed before kicking it and making a wapow sound with her soft voice before looking over to her bed. The little girl was sleeping on it with the bunny next to her sleeping as well. A nervious smile escaped her lips as she closed her door quietly and walked over to them. When she had reached, laid down on the bed besides them and closed her eyes....paine felt as if she had a soft spot for her...and they reminded them of someone...but she did not know whom just yet...so she did not mind much about the question at hand. 

She began to come back to reality slowly. It was time for her to see what exactly was going on.

_Mind Scape Vision End__


Their dull eyes began to turn back to normal as they were now in reality and noticed she was in a clothing shop with beth and shin changing their look. Maybe she had to as well since she over heard them talking. Reaching for a black robe on the stand, she had put it on. Her sunagakure headband was behind a shelf in the mansion...so they were fine for now..

From tree to tree they hoped, over and over and over again moving  at a fast pace as usual. Her mind was not stuck on the mission they were about to do....but was stuck on how she was about to be able to help in this situation at all...she felt that shin should stay outside the village. She herself felt that if they decided to take the male into...a room to get with them...that would be umm...wow...why did shin have to look so good as a girl...oh dear. She knew that she could not interfere with whom ever walks up to them and...well..talks to them...she felt that...well..would cause suspicion on her group...or would it not...mmm..she could not tell...

"m-mm..z-zetsumo...wanted..."

She said under her breath as her gaze lowered slightly. He wanted something that could not be obtained because of the worlds foolishness in wanting to be controled by the gezo government...the world wasent in peace...but in war...just for the governments gain in entertainment and bets on what should be right...bets on what should be wrong...bets on who will win the next war...and between whom and whom..would be sellected as a new king..for some lousy game of blood shead...with out reason...of why they were doing it...

Their response was...something along the lines of...'because i grew bord'...because...he grew bord..he wants to see others die as his own form of entertainment..but he has yet to experience the feeling them selfs....As paine was hopping though the tress, a hand rose and was placed on her forehead as she spoke these last words under her breathe.

Ae she glided, the bird that flew around her in a circle. When she landed on the grassy surface, the bird flew around them one more before landing ontop her head.  Both hands later raised to untie the note and later brought it down to her center to read it.

After a few moment, her emerald eyes lowered slightly...something was definately wrong....a soft breath of air left her lips as her gaze shifted towards her two team mate whom were currently besides her as she began to speak in a whisper.* - Wed Sep 23 13:49:13 2015
