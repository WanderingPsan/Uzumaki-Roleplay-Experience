It was the rather large man from before and believe it or not...she was starting to understand his speech pathern a little bit and was able to interpreate it for the most part. After a few moments had pasted with her thinking of how to answer their question before finally actually answering.

"u-umm....you can g-gain.....strength?...t-together ness....and u-umm...friendship..mmm...im not s-sure what you can do...m-maybe spar myself...o-or..someone e-else...?"

"u-umm...d-do you need t-time to get ready....o-or do you want me to attack n-now?"

she said curiously and patient as ever. She liked to give fair fights, but did not know if they used jutsu or not...This was going...to be...umm..fun she guessed.

While in her slide...her right foot was infront of her left foot....but her left hand was infront of her right hand...a bit extended away from her form. The figures calm eyes rose to look fully upon their form.....right hand being infront was sent forwards aiming to hit against their right shoulder.....A nervious smile formed on her lips as she began to wonder how they would counter...

Raising up her right hand, she stood up straight and began shaking her heands...the brute was rather strong...this was going to be a fun fight indeed...but she wished he was faster and much swifter in her strikes...maybe then she can use her kicks...starting from now...thats what she did...which was using her kicks. Paine would run forwards once more before going into a slide and twisting her body....her right foot rose as she aimed to do a round house kick towards Maloths left rib cage............the attack was slowed down by alot so her hurricane......like winds did not appear...but still...the power behind her kick would still be there....she just hoped he would be able to dodge...or counter...

"mm...i-il t-try..."

A small smiel appared on her lips...she rather liked their enthusiasum...however..she decided to hold back on her speed since she had thought at first that they would be very mobile dispite how big their body....maybe if they worked on that a bit...they would become the best sumo wrestler that ever lived.....or boxer....wooshh!!!* - Wed Sep 23 20:48:12 2015

And so her foot was grabbed by assuming both hands or one, it did not matter...but still she began her slowed down combo....in kats eyes...it was very very slow...but had alot of power behind it. The nervious girls left knee bended slightly as she kicked off the ground in the direction they were going to spin in...her body twisted horrizontally in a clock wize direction in the moment as her left leg was pulled forwards with all her strength.....she aimed to slam the heel of her foot...against the back of his head...she wanted to strike them before the spin had begun...she wanted to get his body ready to react to her strikes when they had become much stronger than they had been now....

Sparing was a great way to do so...but training was a great way to do this as well...maybe sparing was better in her own opinion....umm...ahem.....where was i...yes...her eyes lowered slightly as her face remained expressionless this happened....the hat had stayed on however before of the string she had around her neck...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be sitting down in a meditative position, but upon hearing maloths voice, she looked back a bit to face them as she wondered what had wanted. After a moment had passed...finishing their sentence, a nervious smile was given as she stood up rather slowly and faced them. The trees that were in the area shifted and shifted slowly from side to side.....leafs fell to the whim of the wind towards different locations on the dirt like ground below them....the cloak that the figure wore ruffled slowly before coming to a steady stop. Her eyes lowered slightly as she inhaled deeply taking in a deep breath as she took in the fresh air that was around her before exhaling slowly....calming her form so she wouldn't be alarmed. "u-umm....s-sure....h-how about we start...w-with a jump kick.." she said as a hand raised up motioning them to come closer so they could see....however...when they were close enough....she would speak again...

"mmm....o-or do y-you want to t-try something e-else"

she asked curiously...there was alot of taijutsu skills they could learn from her...but it was up to them in the least to decide what they wanted to learn first from the current things she had known....oh dear... If they had wanted to learn...she would of begun her demonstration.* - Fri Sep 25 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink a  for a moment before a nervious smile appared. "u-umm.." she would try to say as they ran forwards and jumped into the air...the brute had tried to emulate a jump kick....mostly...with this technique...the person using it was sopost to beable to glide though the air towards the destination which was the opponents face...but...for now....how they started out was welll...but she would not question it. Opening her mouth, she would later begin to speak after feeling the ground shake as the landed and began doing shadow punches... The nervious girls right hand extended rather slowly pushing maloths hand upwards.."c-carry your own w-weight...d-dont let your arm d-drop..."

Retracting her hand, it later raised to take hold of her hat...before pulling it backwards and had it rest at the back of her head. Her calm emerald green eyes would look at them and a nervious smile would be seen. It seems that she would have her first student...oh dear....but before kicking and everything...maloth had to...get his punches in check...and she had to over see this.* - Fri Sep 25 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a small smile.

She was now going to demonstrate on how the technique was sopost to be used properly. Takeing  a few steps back, she began breathing in slowly and later exhaled the air that was within her sistem. Her nerves began to relax and her muscles untensed. The girl ran forwards  as her face suddenly took a blank look.....an expressionless face which showed her focus as she jumped up into the air in a slowish spin and their body spun in a circular motion making one revolution at regular visable speeds for maloth. Her right leg then extended outwards towards the direction she aimed to go in and she was propelled in the said direction before suddenly landing in a couching position and raising up.

"i-is that g-good?" 

THe nervious girl turned around with a curious expression on her face. Strands of her black long slightly pony tailed hair would be left dangling infront of her face slightly blocking their calm eyes.....this was going be rather fun for her...she wanted to see Maloth try to do this...but knew it would take some time because of their body mass....and other factors....however...may thee fruits of thine labor....bring greatness.....meaning...if they work hard enough...and was strong enough to hold up the weight they so egarly trained to gain....she hoped they would of been able to do this un accomplishable feat....

Just like herself...a clumbsy girl...was able to do taijutsu well...to an extent.* - Fri Sep 25 07:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervious smile and later turn into a blank expression as she faced southwards. She began jumping upwards and later came back slowly...her breathing slow and calm as it has always been....trying to focus on what was going to happen next infront of her. The nervious girl was focused at the moment...or becoming focuses as her right foot moved infront of her left while they turned sideways. "mm..." she hummed softly...her mind still on whatever shin was  so frightened about...but decided to disreguard her curiosity since the matter had nothing to do with her...atleast untill they had decided to tell her...After a few leps in the air, she twisted her body to the left and to the right switching her feet as her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly. They were working on their stanima at the moment as she was seeing how long exactly they could jump like this...she did not want to burn her self out...so for now...she would remain like this....

'swoosh!!'

The sound echoed though the air as she did a round house kick...her movements blured...as her foot cut though the air infront of her before ending up sideway when the attack ended and continueing her slow jump upwards and downwards waiting a few moments before doing the next strike. In her mind, she was thinking about many things...and wondering what she was to do next....Right now..they were staying with katsune and the others...but what should she do if they die....what should they do...if something awful happens..and everyone seperates once again because of that....would she have a place to go...a place that would not attack her...just because of the clothing they wear...is..or was...difficult...Shaking her head, her gaze went back onto the path ahead of her...she had to focus...focus....THe figure's hand clentched as she sent another blured kick into the air infront of her.

Her combo was about to begin.* - Fri Sep 25 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as foot hand landed, she kicked off that same foot and slightly into the air. The figures body twisted towards the opposite direction she had sent her first kick in before landeding slightly bend down. A soft breath of air left her lips as her calm emerald eyes raised to stare at the dust she had kicked up around them....just floating in the air before ceasing to be seen...by mortal eyes.....The nervious girls raised up and leaned backwards taking a step back or two before coming to a stop. The nervious girl before jumping upwards and downwards slowly before turning sideways....her right foot infront of her left and her gaze on the invisable opponent infront of them.....her arms frailing seemingly lifelessly up and down...but seemed to be controlled with a great about of focus. A soft breath of air left her lips as she began her onslot of blured kicks towards the air infront of them....each going for different areas of the body...one towards the knee cap...then towards the shoulder...a couched spin for the feet before an upwards kick to the chest...

The problem is that she would change the combo every now and then instead of keeping to the same thing....it was a matter of tricking opponents into thinking that they were going to do the same thign as before...but instead...do something completely different and the lesser would end up losing.....The nervious girl did not like prolongged fights...so the taijutsu user had to be swift when the time came......Her breathing began to seem slightly off..but kept it under control as she had to work on her stanima as she had done before.....they had alot of work to do...* - Fri Sep 25 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) the movements her body had twisted in began to become a blured state each time her feet had touched the ground.....the concealed female's hair began to turn into a pure white color under her hat while their eyes turned into a pure yellow color. They began moving even faster than before....the sounds that came from her kicks and punches began to seem slightly louder...but not by much. The nervious girl wanted to become faster like zetsumo had told her over the past three years....if she had gone with them at that...or those two times...would she have been ready to fight against kirigakure...or suna.....they lost kitora....it still pained her a bit that she had to die...but pained her even more...that she could not help her at all..while they were being torchered. The nervious girls eyes lowered slightly...she could not...she definatly could not...bear...to stand by...when people were being torchered....but by human nature...she just stood and watched...fear..consumed her heart...the clutze and clumbsy girl...just watched as the kikaichuu crawled on their body...all over their body....going inside places...that deemed rual...

"ssssa..."

She exhaled softly...her tounge slowly rolling off teeth making a lower s sound before completly stoping. The nervious girl wanted to push herself harder...she could not change her past...she could not stay in the present...but decided...to look onto the future.....not run away from it...does...training in a secluded mountain seem like running away.....justified running away...not wanting to watch someone...go into ruin...because of the pain you will feel just because of the action..when it does happen...Her body continued moving in blurs but began slowing down slightly.

She wasent done...but was now deciding where to throw her punches...her mind lost in a fude of what she could of done then....and what she could not make up for now....everything...

seemed like a game...now...* - Fri Sep 25 16:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervious smile before raising up and following behind them rather slowly at her own pace.* - Sat Sep 26 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be at the village gate waiting for maloth as they went to do something to their own accord. The area was loud...but soon became blured as the many villagers passed by her to get in and out of the village. Her own thoughts taking place rather than hearing the words of the many children whom ran with laughter...their young minds amazed at what the village had seemed to have...as well as seem to achieve...the new friends they will make upon moving back in and getting accustomed to the new village life under someone elses rule. Right now....everything seemed...joyful, calm and paine liked this feeling. It was then she felt the earth below her shake slowly before looking up towards maloth with a nervious smile....yes...it had to be them to break her out of her trans since they were going on a mission together and ended up following behind them rather slowly. The villagers would look towards the both of them making a way to pass as they seemed a bit fightened or curious towards the duo.

As she heard the words of maloth after they had left the main village gate, she looked up towards them with an expressionless face  The brute wanted to punch things or wrestle....they liked wrestling for some reason...and she however did not like the action of doing so either...As their words had finished, she would remained silent for a few moment not thinking of a response while they were saying it....she did not know how to respond to them at all..."u-umm....n-nothing a-at the moment..." she said hoping that answer was good enough for them to be satisfied before looking back towards the path ahead of her. Their eyes lowered slightly as she watched them grab their cart and pull or carry the cart.

"u-umm....to the n-nearest small v-village...w-we carry t-these."

she replied unsurely as she continued walking after a short pause in their movements from his action of wrapping his club around the handel.....this was was going to be a long mission....woosh!!!* - Sat Sep 26 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would follow behind the large brute whom seemed to have stanima for days. When he did, she would watch them suddenly stop and rest for a few moments. That was when she looked over towards the animals that ran by past them...they seemed peacefull and she hoped that they would live long lifes while in the wild. A nervious smile would appear on her lips before looking over towards maloth when they had begun walking again...each time she looked...the view was different believe it or not....the second time she looked....there was a traveler with a wagon whom was in the trade buisness...they happened to be feeding their horses water....When she had walked up them, they offered her a hunny bun and she had gladly accepted.

A small smile was given in return towards the old man as she turned around, walked back and would hold up the honey bun for them to take....The third thime they stoped to rest...she saw an old women with children walking along the path. The women looked so youthfull around her children whom seemed to look five years of age.....The leafs slowly drifted towards the ground around her and themselfs following the whim of the wind that slowly blew....the figures body feeling slighty cooled...and their cloak being ruffled slowly before coming to a stop....her clentched hands slowly untightened...was she tensed...during that time...maybe so...but probably for other reasons since she was a girl whom had alot going on in their head...as usual....The fouth time they stoped was because it was starting to becoming rather late...straying off the path, they began making way towards the heavily forested area.

When they had came to a stop at a decent area, she watched the brute take a seat and would give them a small smile as she turned to the tree next to them. She jumped into the air and twisted her body as it began to move in a blur. Her foot would hit against the tree causing it to shake slightly...upon landing...a soft breathe of air escaped her lips as a hand raised to be placed against the side of the tree softly rubbing it. Upon hearing maloths words, she word..her eyes lowered slightly as they spoke."y-you...really...t-think so..." She said not really sure if she would have made a great wife or not.....no...was she even allowed that luxary....she left the person that she loved..or liked and went off out of dissipointment in herself ......not wanting to hear the harsh words that he would have said....wanting to hear the words...that he would say now...that they were gone...and she could not hear them ever again....

"im..a-a...punch p-person...b-because....its...f-fun..." 

she said towards the brute with a few pauses...the nervious girl was unsure herself....she was clumbsy...but runs fast without fear of tripping on her robe....she was nervious...but trys to use all her strength to talk to those she fears...which was most of the group that was under zetsumo...but...the people whom kept her going along this path was zetsumo saying that she was getting stronger...and great job during each of their spars....was she...even worth the trouble....A soft breathe of air left her lips as she took a few steps back before pushing off her right foot and twisting her body in a blur...the figures right foot extended  outwards and was swung towards tree in a round house kick fashion....

And so the females combo began...while they talked under the night sky.* - Sat Sep 26 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

As they pulled back in their counter clockwise spin. She reached into her cloak and pulled out a honey bun that she had been numbing on. As she looked back towards maloth whom had been eating, she remained silent moving in blurs as she suddenly became faster and faster in her movements. The sounds of the tree cracking would be heard though out the area as her foot cut though the wind making a 'swish...swosh' sound with each counter clockwise and clockwize spin made. Her calm emerald green eyes had turned into a pure white color while their black hair had turned pure white. Her eyes lowered as she focused on the tree that she was hitting.....A few hours had passed but the nervious girl was still going not hearing their words...her breathing calm and collected.....however...it slowed upon noticing what was besides her during her rotation. Suddenly stoping, her arms droped to her side and they rose up straight. The nervious girls eyes raised and maloth noticed or would notice she was not fatagued at all...her calm breathing had let her conserve energy rather than wasted when delivering attacks.....then again...everyone was different in the least.


"o-oh...i-im not h-hungry"

she would say before giving them a small smile. She then began to follow them towards the mission location. Her pure yellow eyes turnning back into a emerald hue while her pure white hair turned back into its black color under her hat. And so they made their way to the next village and later reached the location. The mission was peaceful to say the least but still...she wished almost all missions were like this...but then again...missions could become dangerous at any moment...that was something to be weary about at most times...The sounds around her began to seem blured as her mind began drifting from thought to thought.......maloth had conversed with her alot...but she was sorry for not being much of a talker and they had been doing most of the talking while she followed silently. As her movements came to a stop...watching the items being handed over towards the client...She turned around and began walking towards the gate figuring that maloth would be ready to go once he had finished handing over the goods...mm..

During her walk back towards the gates of the smaller village they had just entered.....she watched the market venders sell things towards the people whom were bustling across the streets.....to the women whom stood by the fences in expensive clothing.....they usually stoped men when she had seen something like this upon first arriving in this nation. The subject in question usually handed them money and the women usually followed....this village diyamo seemed to not care about what happened in the slumbs or any other part of the village....as long as they were still wealthy...everything seemed alright ...mmm...but was it really alright...Turning back towards the path ahead of her...a soft breath of air escaped her lips as she continued her slow walk towards her destination to wait for Maloth....

she just hoped...leaving them alone was not a bad thing.* - Sat Sep 26 04:36:54 2015
