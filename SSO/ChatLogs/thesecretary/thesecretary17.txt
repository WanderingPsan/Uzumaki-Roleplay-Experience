<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would finally leave the village of suna after an extended un intentional stay....but she did not mind because she had gotten to see her close friends for a small while longer. The nervous girl had walked slowly past the gates waving a rather slow good bye towards the guards that were their before continueing along the long path towards the desert. To tell the truth, after she heard of maloths death....all the nervous girl wanted to do was head back to her mountain...she wanted to go home to a place where she could be alone and think about what she could do to better herself in the future...to prevent this from happening again. The nervous girls hands clenched as she began to breath slightly heavily....her heart races swiftly but slowly....the nervous girl was feeling sad as her eyes lowered slightly....This heat was getting to her more or less but she did not mind since she was determined to actually get stronger for her students or whom she had chosen to teach........In the past.....no...a short while ago....over the span of a month to a week...a person named yan told her....something about....always having a home in suna....something that was a lie...but proved not to be over and over again...another named sanoke saying that this area was dangers....but she believed it was not since people dont normally come to these parts...as well as his need for her to become social...which was unnatural to her..

The nervous girl just wished that she could of been as talkative as them...to beable to work up a conversation out of nothing but it was impossible....un common....il willed....she felt...like a disater awaiting its own downfall. Zenaki wanted to meet her, but she could not think of an interesting topic to talk about after actually meeting them. A soft breath of air left her lips as she charged forwards in a slight blur and jumped up into the air. Her right leg was pulled backwards as her body twisted in a blurred state. Her right leg was then extended outwards giving the air infront of her a round house kicked before letting that foot touch the ground. Raising up the other, it began to send an onslot of attacks towards different areas within the air before her. With each kick rotation that had ended, her body turned to its other side and she moved forwards. Due to the kicks being so fast, she moved forwards rather quickly for the most part. After a few hours had passed the nervous girl had finally reached the oasis that was next to the forest and lowered  herself into a crouching position to drink some water. Looking over to her right, she would stare at the camale. A nervous smile was given to the camale before she rose up and began to continue her way into the forest in a slight blur. Jumping up into the air, she began traveling from three to three which was told to be faster than traveling on foot. She went past the tea village and went more northwards into the lands of kohonoa.

"mm..."

She stoped for a moment watching all the people entering and exiting kohonoha...the sellers and venders of couse....some where travelers themselves. They all had smiles on their faces and most of them had greif. They had been thought alot havent they....with the constant wars...sure they make a proft...but maybe they feel a bit bad about the lifes that were lost...they must have a heart too...right?...And so her travels continued as she vanished from her spot in a slight blur and continued towards the location of the land to the east of kohonoa. Her favorite place to be and were her mountain was located. Upon reaching her location, she would be running forwards before slowing down to a stop. Sitting down on the wooden path way, she would stare at the path infront of her  and allow her legs to dangle on the edge......the sound of the waterfall bringing music calmness to her soul...the sound of the waterfall...giving slight meaning and trying to tell her what she was to do next with her life....she believes...that she will be sucessfull...but...its hard to see herself...in the light that everyone else...sees of her...* - Fri Oct 30 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) raising up into a standing position, she soon began jumping upwards slightly above the ground  before slowly falling back down. Her arms followed suit flowing slowly upwards before slowly falling downwards rhytmeicly with her body. After a few moments had passed she turned sidewards with her calm emerald gaze on the forest south of them.She smelt the cigarrete smoke from the group of people to the west of them, however it just seemed to be non existant to her since it clashed with the heavenly smell of the fresh river that was below her. The nervous girl seemed to be focused on what she was doing in a way of developing her kicking speeds. The first thing....no...the second thing she wanted to do was to kick all over the place...but for now...she wished to make her kicking speed much faster than it was before so she can...but first...it was to strengthen her leg muscles....so she could do more than five kicks in a single rotation. ...this move was proving to be more stressfull than others since they used their spinning speed to make their kicks faster than it sopost to be.

A soft breath of air soon escaped her lips as she kept on jumping upwards and downwards while hering the long words that were being said in a lazyish fashion in the direction of where the smokers were. A nervous smile formed on her lips soon after words as they began to breath inwards and outwards rather slowly...trying to make herself calm and not exhale to much air......it seems she was about to start shadow boxing.* - Fri Oct 30 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) after some time has or had past....the nervous girl decided it was time to begin sending punches into the air south of them in a blured state before suddenly stoping when she heard Hideyoshi's voice, her head soon turned to around to stare at them. She wondered what exactly they were talking about when they said the water was high.....mm...was it actually high....it was a river after alll...mm...then again...there was a waterfall. Her emerald gaze then watched as they began to run off eastwards probably going to go home since they said that they were going to go home...probably...mm...A soft breathe of air would escape her lips as she sighed softly and looked back southwards. The sound of the river easing her nerves as  a small smile appared on her lips. They were a bit happy that they were a nice group of people. Bending her legs slight, she began to send kicks into the air south of them like she had done before. Her body then twisted in a blur as her other leg was sent upwards while the previous one was on the ground. 

Her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly as her smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless face. The nervous girl seemed to be hooked on mastering this technique for the time being. it must of been her way of saying that she was greatfull for the technique that katsune had thought her....they just hoped...she saw it that way...since they had seemed bord...and a bit depressed in sunagakure....dispite how active and how everyone was in that place and that area....as well as  kiri....oh dear...* - Fri Oct 30 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) with each rotaton...her body twisted and twisted in blurs as multiple kicks were sent forwards randomly to their proceeded destinations. With each kick, the leg was retracted with precision and later extended outwards again again and again. Her mucles always remained slightly tensed before being send outwards once again. The nervous girl seemed to be serious at the moment as her eyes opened slowly to watch the wind or pocket of air that her legs broke though...the swishing sound that came randomly that meshed in with the river that was below her.  Her breathing begining to seem slightly heaver as she continued on with her onsloth of attack in an attempt to get better with what she was training in which was taijutsu...Her teeth slightly gritted together as she suddenly had done a round house kick...but did not stop there. Her body kept spinning as her body lowered into a meditative position. Her eyes closed as her hair began to turn into a pure while color while her eyes to a pure yellow one. As her spinning came to a stop....the nervous girl was now facing the ocean south of them with her eyes closed and hands on her lap. They were in gate one mode and seemed to be drifting off into their mind scape to continue their training there...with her mentor zen.

__Mind Scape Vision__

The nervous girls eyes opened slowly as she looked around. A nervous smile forming on her lips as she raised up and crawled off of her still messy bed. The nervous girl ventured outside and later into the bars main room and watched as her mentor had put up the closing sign on the door. Then turned around and looked at her student and noticed that they were stressed. Paines eyes slowly drifted away  as her hand slowly tightened its grip on the frames door. Zen slowly made their way behind the counter and began washing a glass as paine made her way over to them and sat down on the stool. She was woundering if this had been the right choice....or if she had done the right thing....trying to get stronger....which was something that was impossible to do...her want...to protect others...and her need...to need to get stronger....other saying that it is not needed...and it is natural not to be able to protect others in their time of need....it reminds of when zetsumo had torchered kitora. 

*thush* 

A glass was placed infront of her which seemed to look like apple juce...but seemed to be a variation. Looking up towards Zen, she would stare at them for a moment before looking back down towards her drink. The nervous gril began to take hold of the drink and later take a sip. Placing it back down on the counter, a nervous smile was given to them...she felt a bit happy at the moment...at the fact she was able to do this...and drink something so...flavorable....almost like soda...but differernt...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

She had taken a sip of the female bartenders drink which was given with a small smile. Her teacher did not seem like one to smill that much...she always wondered why they were here...in her mind of all places...did she call upon them unconciously during her time of distress. A soft breath of air escaped her lips as she suddenly placed the glass back down on the counter and folding her arms. Her gaze looked upwards and rested on her mentors face. 

"d-do...you need  h-help.." 

Zen would continue to stare at the young girl for a moment longer before reaching under the counter and taking out two bags. Standing up from her seat, paine would hold up both of her hands to take hold of the begs before suddenly feeling the drop of the weights kick in. Her arms were brought down steadedly and ached a bit. She began to breath inwards and later outwards a bit heavily as her gaze shifted from Zen to the door.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as they charged forwards towards her, her nervous smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless expression. She was now going to spar someone other than maloth. Her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly a soft breath of air escaped her lips. The nervous girls right hand was send towards their stomach area as she leaned back slightly allowing them to lean forwards into the attack as well. Her left hand would then raise in an attempt to grab their left hand. 

If she was successfull, she would then pull then pull them  towards her while lifting them up. They would then pull forth and  slam them into the ground behind her...with a twist of her body. The figure would then let go of their hand when they were on the ground before takeing a few steps backwards.

"mm.."* - Sat Oct 31 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch cushioned the blow, but she held the arm in that placing as she lifted them upwards into the air with her left hand while pulling them towards her, however....they were still tossed over in the opposite direction behind her in a non difficult manner as her right hand kept his elbow in place.

Unless they had more limbs...it would of been impossible to slow down. However their foot would of hit the air just above her own...unless they had another way of stoping the slam to the ground from happening....other wize...the nervous girl would begin to take a few steps backwards as she looked down towards them awaiting for them to get back up.

She was awaiting for them to get their head straight to see if they were going to charge back towards her or if she was going to go towards them this time.  Her calm emerald eyes raised and stared at their form completely as a nervous smile was given

If they wanted her to charge towards them this time...she would of began running forwards......before going into a short slide. Her body would of twisted in a blur as her right leg extended outwards aiming to send a round house kick towards their mid section. Her breathing was calm and regulated as her eyes while focused..seemed a bit lost in thought..

"mm..."

She awaited to see how they would defend or dodge...she wanted to see what they would do...* - Sat Oct 31 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) did not put that much strength behind the kick so they would be able to block it with a bit of difficulty. The nervous girl was suddenly tripped, they were now seemingly falling face first as her body turned. Their right hand would of touched the ground as her elbow bended slighty and later pushed off of it towards the right continueing her spinning motion in mid air with  her left leg extended outwards aiming to stike them in the same area.

the nervous girl was not going to give up just yet as a small smile was giving to them in their upside down state. She was happy at his attempts as he was doing everything they could to stop her which would naturally work with anyone else but she was different more or less.  The figure, if her attack was succesfull would land on both hands before kicking them up into the air with her right foot being surrounded with  a small hurrican like wind coat of air....they aimed for the stomach area. 

She would of went up into the air with them as her body turned into an upright position after a moment or two.* - Sat Oct 31 02:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) her gaze was remained focused as Sanoke's body suddenly began moving around her at a fast speed. Her breathing calm and regulated as she took her timed. When their hand was sent to attack her, her own right hand raised to block his own strike.that was sent to her rib cage. The nervous girl seemed to be focused directly on them as her movements suddenly stopped in a slide and in a twisting of her body to face them.

"s-shocking...p-punch...?"

She would say as attempted to take hold of his hand. If she was successfull, they would then attempt to send her right hand to their stomach area hoping that he would be able to block.* - Sat Oct 31 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) hands would lower to her sides as she turned to face sanoke.  She watched as they formed a seal and instantly she began running forwards in their direction before jumping up into the air. Her body suddenly twisted as a hurricane like wind began to surround her from as the nervious female began to spin in blured like state.  The hurricane would expand outwards blasting back the wires as she aimed to slam her right leg  into Sanoke's side. after it had extended outwards...but they may have moved...or tried to block...but more or less moved...mmm........The female was happy that they were willing to spar her, but she was looking for a person whom did pure taijutsu instead of half way taijutsu...she wanted to have a heated battle of fists rather than the use of tricks...

"u-umm..they l-lasted...q-quite a w-while...he h-had done...r-rather w-well"

A small smile had soon formed on her lips. She was glad that he had done only taijutsu...it left a warm feeling in her heart...however..she wished she had held back a bit more...so he would not have ended in the hospital...oh dear..* - Sat Oct 31 06:45:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) // 

The female continue her spinning as she landed downwards onto the ground in a leg sweep causing the hurricane wind to suddenly expand outwards knocking away the wires once more before pushing off her feet not waisting time at all....she gaze sanoke no time to rest. Her face slowly drifted away to an expressionless expression to show the ammount of focus she had and all of a sudden sanoke's vision flicked for only a second after he had shot his first wind bullet and her right hand extended to send a punch towards them applying her full strength, her body twisted in a blur following the momentum before suddenly crouching.

 A second was all she had needed...when his gaze when back on them...he would notice that the nervious girl was suddenly gone...But he would notice a whirlwind spiraling upwards and outwards..where exactily had she ended up...was in a crouched down position on the ground with her right leg about the extend upwards aiming to strike them in the stomach and later send them upwards into the the air.

"m-mm?"

The soft humming sound left her lips as she attempted to make contact with his stomach using her right foot. If she was successfull...the nervous girl would of followed them up into the air after using her hands to push herself up like a spring.* - Sat Oct 31 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they suddenly moved backwards,  Her gaze remained on them as they suddenly began to send more wind bullets to her location. Still in her current position, she suddenly pushed herself up into the air like a sping but it was used for evasion this time...the nervous girl would of avoided the first few...but the last had hit her and she fell onto the ground a bit north stareing up at the sky.

"mm..."

Her body slightly ached a bit.* - Sat Oct 31 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be watching the sun and then all of a sudden it got blocked out before all of a sudden. It was Sanoke and a nervous smile was given to them...her right hand was extended upwards before taking a hold of his own. The nervous girl was then pulled up.  "i-im fine...ive g-grown a b-bit resistant to n-ninjutsu.....but...it s-still h-hurts.." A rather slow reassuring nod would of been given before her gaze went over towards Mirari's spar. They seemed to have been going at it...or just started....their battle seemed to probably just begining to start as theres ended. 

"mm...i-i hope...s-she does w-well..."

She would say as her hands slowly drifted to her sides before looking down at her clothes and dusting the sand off.* - Sat Oct 31 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) pulls ortho closer so he could focus on Mirai as well. A nervous smile would be given as she was proud of the style of taijutsu they chose to partake in...which was the ones that required stances.....She, at a time, tried to learn a stance...but ultimately..it was a failure...she was just not good at learning or doing them...it just was not her...mmm..

The chakra that explelled outwards with each blow they made towards eachother looked interesting...and umm...blue....a true expert at their art....oh dear.....there was more elegance in what they did...than what she could do in a long run...mm...woosh...* - Sat Oct 31 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) walks closer towards the group before coming to a stop and looking over towards mirai.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be infront of the rock she had usually trained on. Her hands clenched before unbinding. Her hands shook or were shaking by them a bit before making them motionless. "mm..."  Silence was what happened between her and the pillar before suddenly launching forwards and twisting her body to the side. Both hands raised quickly and clapped together...one in a fist and the other in an open palmed to act as a cushion for the fist. Her elbow stuck out before it was launched forwards towards the hudge rock stature. After the rock had been it, she did not see it break just yet...maby it was the angle she had hit the rock from...mm.. The nervous girl sighed as she took a few steps back...it seemed that it was going to be proven difficult to actually make this move...usefull...in battle.....maybe if it was angled differently...maybe to the right...and more downwards...mm..

The nervous girl would shake her head rather slowly before making her way back towards the square as she tried to rearrange her thoughts....wondering where..and when this technique would be most effective..and how it should be used...exactly...the motions were all too bleak....creating moves were difficult oh dear....The female would be leaving soon...so she felt that it would be best if she could see zenaki before she left and later talk with Ortho about the students she was sopost to be teaching...hopefully the one that specialized in ful ltaijutsu or the one that was ken and taijutsu....would prove fruitfull in the future...

this...will be fun..* - Sat Oct 31 18:37:52 2015

"mm...u-umm..so...i..s-should make them...p-prove their w-worth?"

The nervous girl asked curiously as had not mett the two students she was to teach yet....maybe they should spar them and say if they can make a hit on her...they will succeed....mm...the options were endless...oh dear...
