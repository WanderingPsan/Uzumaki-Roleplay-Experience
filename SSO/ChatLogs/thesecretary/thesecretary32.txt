As time went on, she decided to forget completely about ever learning how to use a blade deciding it was a lost cause. She was happy that she got the chance to spar against lera now and so she began the spar of the two females of swords. The nervous female spun...right hand stick out....blade swaying horrizontally clashing against their blade. 

'ching'

A spark flew but as it was ricocheting upwards, the nervous females spin had continued following the weight of the blade.   Her left foot extended outwards  and lowards on the ground.....pulling her body out of the way...as she watch the tip of their blade bang against the flat end of own swords. Now besides them and slightly behind them....

The nervous female aimed slash at them from the side as she turned fully to face them...knowing they could block...wosh..* - Fri Nov 27 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nervous smile slowly faded away as she warched the blade suddenly  moveto block the blade. Sparks flew once more as both blade clashed. "mm..." A soft hum would leave her lips as she spin continued sliding off Lera's blade. Her calm almost dulled emerald eyes watching as lera had spin around her following the movements of their own blade. When they both met with other staring each other. Their blade seemed to be horrizontal  while hers came upwards in a diagonal fashion clashing against their blades before suddenly placing her foot on the ground stoping her of spin. 

Their blade came back downwards diagonally aiming to make a cut on their shoulder. "t-thats u-umm...i-interesting." She said refering to her opponents sword. They were a bit amazed that it jumped.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give off a small smile. She was using a technique zetsumo had used on her in every spar. A soft breathe of air would leave her lips when she heard the clang. It was then she felt them push against her blade... However, she was counting on this. Then they were in the middle of their first push, her body leaned backwards slightly as she was skidding slowly backwards along the sand not allowing the sword to touch her just yet but it was almost about to touch her. The nervous female then picked off her left foot unlocking their blades as her oppoenet went past her a bit. Paine spinning around then in a single rotation before her right foot raised and aimed to kick them in their back.

"mm....a b-bit...t-to..mm..m-much.."

She said in a low voice thinking about if she should have remained in locked with them for the fun of it. The nervous female remained silent while these thoughts ran though her head as she watched the small crack she would have made if she hit them on their back.* - Fri Nov 27 15:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) spin would continue as her right leg retracted and was placed on the ground. Her right hand swaying diagonally downwards before resting at her side....their blade held in a way that i covered her body in a diagonal fashion. "o-oh dear.." she said as she watched lera slam their sword into the sand and release their hilt. The nervous female could tell from afar that this women infront of her was going to not hold back now.

They watched as she cracked their neck and suddenly spit mud everywhere. The nervous female would kick off her feet before spinning in a blurred state. A whirl wind would begin to surround her form and the mud that was sent to hit her would fall down onto the gound when her spin ended. The nervous female seemed to be standing in the middle of pit. Some parts of her body was dashed with mud but not all of it. 

"mm..."

The nervous female began to run forwards, but seemed to have no problem with it due to zetsumo's training.* - Fri Nov 27 15:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) the nervous female would give off a small smile as she nodded. All of a sudden she vanished in a blur and reapared infront of the first clone and kicked it in the somach sending it up into the air. Before she pushed off her hands  and followed it up there,  After kicking the clone once more, she suddenly vanshed and reapared on the ground in a couched position whiched cracked before the nervous female flew back upwards, her body spinning as combined both hands...one used as a cusion and the other in a fist as support. Her elbow being sent into their spine as they flew back downwards towards the ground in dismay as the ground cracked even more under her strength. 

The nervous female then threw the sword into the air before falling back dowards towards the ground, her right leg extended outwards kicking the second clone in their face. before pushing off her feet in a spinning motion...the ten clones around her charged and went into her range. Her spin in a counter clockwize direction as a violent hurricane began to surround her form....Their left leg entended outwards aiming to slam their heal into each of the clones faces.

The nervous female seemed to be fighting the clones beare handedly as they reformed. She looked for the real one...this was fun...woshh* - Fri Nov 27 15:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) the clones would have charged towards her...however they were a bit to early as her spin did not finish yet and her violent hurricane sill was surrounding her form. The remaining twenty had just jumped into her while went and was later blasted away by her leg that was extended.  As she came downwards, for a leg sweep as usual to complete her combo, the would watch silently as something had hit against her foot as well as whirlwind before she had gotten the chance to even decend...that was how fast their attack was.

"mm..."

The nervous female kept on spinning as the wave of water was pushing her back slightly...the strength of their ninjutsu slightly surpassing the strength of her own ninjutsu by a single number.  When the wave of water had ended, the nervous female fell backwards on her but in a spinning motion before coming to a stop facing her opponent. A nervous smile was then given to Lera. 

"u-umm...a-alright...."

"w-when this r-rock s-shifts t-twenty i-inches...in the s-span of a m-minute...then you will be c-close to m-mastery..."

[repost]* - Fri Nov 27 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was suddenly thrown onto his back and was piggy backed to the wall. A nervous smile would appare on her lips as she nodded a ok. When they reached however, the nervous female stared silently at the ammount of construction work as her arms tightened its grip around sanokes neck..she was nervous and a bit scared of the people around the area as usual.....but tried to fight off this feeling in order to remain brave to her best ability. A soft breathe of air would leave her lips as she whispered the words. "u-umm...can y-you....u-umm....put me d-down..p-please..?" she said. If she was successfull, the nervous female would, after being set down, suddenly began walking rather slowly over towards the first boulder....there were twenty. 

"umm..h-hideo...you take the f-first ten b-boulders...and il t-take...the o-other then b-boulders.." She said as she stared at all the construction men and women stareing at her. Her breathing began to become slightly irregualr but slowly began to return to normal. The nervous female began to walk over towards the first boulder.  Her right hand would extend in a fist when she reached before being sent forwards towards the rock. The whole area around her and the boulder would be comvered in a cloud of smoke as the sound of crumbling was heard from her direction.

The mission had started....divide and concour!!!!!* - Fri Nov 27 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) // 

Would give hiroshi a nod after she came out of the smoke after destroying the first rock. "u-umm...imagine y-your in a d-dungen..and s-see these r-rocks...as...u-uhh...a a-alive and m-moving....i think my d-dad used to s-say.." She would say as she jumped into the air, her body twisted in the blur  as her right leg extended outwards smashing into the second rock in a round house kick. A soft breathe of air would leave her lips ....her eyes catching a glips of her students kicking on the rock. They were happy that he trained in his kicks earlier as it seemed to be getting sharper and faster.  After her spin had ended with her right foot being placed on the ground, they turned one hand into a fist while the other remained open palmed. Both of them were then slammed into each other as they were held horrizontally infront of her body before being launched into the rock causing it to break shaking it into pieces. A cloud of smoke forming as rubble falling to the ground.

"m-maybe you can i-imagine them...to h-have the umm...s-same face a-as..the r-rock...in the a-arena....that can b-be our m-monsters"

A small smile formed on her lips as she dashed out of the cloud of smoke...she was headed towards the next boulder while awaiting Hiroshis response.* - Fri Nov 27 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

She continued her run towards the boulder as jumped into the air, her left leg retracted while her right leg was kept extended. The nervous female right hand remained extended infront of her form while her left hand was behind her and infront of her chest closer than the right hand. It was similar to when bruce lee does a jump kick. The nervous female aimed to sent her foot into the rock and as it hit, the rock cracked extending to all sides of its circular shape before her force finally ended. Bending her knee slightly, she kicked off her leg and the upper part of her body twisted, her right foot retracting as her body spun in a circular motion in a blur...her left leg extended swaying downwards shatering the entire middle area of the rock before landing on her feet.

"o-one and t-two...f-fast and s-swift...p-profesional b-boxer h-hideo...m-makes the h-headlines"

A nervous smile would be given to hideo as she looked over to them for a moment before looking back towards her own rock. Kicking off her feet once more, her right foot extended and multiple kicks were sent towards her rock. After a few moments, she landed on the ground with a heap of rubble behind them before she began running towards the next boulder with hideo besides her running to his own rock.

"mm...i-is that u-usually w-what....umm..t-those r-reporters s-say?"

The female asked curiously...she was unsure about what she said.* - Fri Nov 27 22:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as she gave them a nervous smile. The female jumped within the air as her body twisted in a counter clockwize direction, she did not go full power enough to make a violent hurricane; however, it was still strong more or less. When her foot hit the rock, a part of the boulder seemed to crumble into rubble before she landed on the ground and jumped forwards, the female jumped forwards into the air and her right hand retracted before being sent forwards in a blur causing the rest of the boulder to crack before going into a crumble. A cloud of smoke began to surround her form as she continued her run towards the next boulder besides her student. 

"o-oh my....f-feeling s-super...arnt y-you"

She joked with her student giving them a small smile. in response before suddenly hearing the voice of mirai. The female decided to take their advice and stay away from them for a while untill they had calmed down...since they did not like to talk much when they were mad it seemed. They were in her path as she was running towards them When she was in range, the female would say the words. "u-umm....i d-do not...k-know...what a g-gate of o-opening is..." She said in all honestly before saying something else as she was about to  enter mirai personal space.  "im..n-not..good w-with...w-writing s-scroll...im r-rather a c-clutz...with t-things..umm..o-other than t-taijutsu...il e-explaine it h-horribly...unless i-its in p-person..." Kicking off her right foot, they spun around mirai in a blur and continued their run towards their next bounder with her student whom was right besides her.

"umm...i dont t-think...those r-reportes...are l-looking at m-me.."

She said pointing towards the rubbles of rocks besides her that the construction workers were working on.* - Fri Nov 27 22:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would listen to her students words before a nervous light red blush appared on her face. Her gaze went back onto the rocks infront of her as they heard them laugh at her embarrasment. She was not used to actually being looked at by men since she felt that they usually prefered something more...like a brave and bold women...rather than a shy one like a herself. A nervous smile would slowly form on her lips as she said the words. "u-umm..i-i see..." She would say not really looking over towards the men...not having the strength...no...not having the courage to look over to them. The nervous female suddenly pushed herself up into the air, the upper part of her body twisted and her lower half followed suit. Her spin seeming like a blur as her right leg extended and smashed into the crack causing it to turn into rubble. 

Upon landing on the ground, She pushed forwards and raised up her left leg. Four kicks in blurs was sent to rocks that was a little larger than it was sopost to be. As the nervous female landed on the ground below them, they pushed off their feet out of her cloud of smoke and continued her run besides Hideo. "umm i t-think theres t-two more r-rocks for the u-umm...b-both of us....t-try to t-take out t-two of them...at the s-same time...u-using your t-the c-combo af l-leaf w-whirlwind...as w-well as ...d-dynamic entry.......and d-do not t-touch the g-ground....i w-wish to see how y-you would m-make it w-work. "

She said giving them a nervous smile as she ran besides them. They wanted to see how extactly they would reach the distance of both rocks....this was surely a challange.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would look back to her own rock as she saw her student give a nod...they had understood their request and went on to doing their best. A soft breath of air would leave her lips as she would proceed to attempt the same thing she preached. The nervous girl jumpped into the air..high enough to be above the boulder. Her upper part of her body twisted in a blur as her right leg extended outwards aiming to slam her right foot into the rocks head. After a few moments the cracks spreaded along the boulder before she kicked off of it and it shattered. 

The nervous girls body twisted and her right leg retracted and her left leg extended outwards as she soared though the air towards the last boulder. She was traveling though the air before her right foot hit against the lower half of the boulder. Bending her knee slightly, she kicked off it and twisting her body once more. Her foot soon slammed against the boulder before she landed on the ground. The boulder shattering before her....their breathing slightly irregular.  "mm...i b-believe were d-done.."

Looking back, she would just stare silently as before turning around and facing Hideo as the contruction workers began to work with the rubble they created. "umm l-lets head b-back..." She said as she walked over...before goign behind behind them and pushing him back toward the square. " y-you..umm d-did well h-hideo.."* - Fri Nov 27 23:33:32 2015
