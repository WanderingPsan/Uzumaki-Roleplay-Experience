Once hideo had gotten off, she would raise up her hand and wave towards the driver meaning they could leave now. Her gaze went slowly back onto her mansion like house.

She would say before her hand slowly drifted back to her side. * - Thu Nov 26 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as she watched her student jump into the air. A nervous smile formed on her lips knowing that hideo was not going to hold back...his wind told that much dispite how sloppy his dynamic entry looked. The figure suddenly pushed off their right right foot when hideo came into range. The females body began to spin in a blurred state as a hurricane began to surround her form and her right leg extended outwards aiming to clash against Hiroshi's own foot in a round house kick fashion aiming to send them rotating in the opposite direction she was rotating in.

If the female was successful, when they landed. The nervous female would continue their spin, her right leg still extended outwards as her body lowered closly to the ground aiming to leg sweep their opponent. A nervous smile would then form on lips as she watched the water that her foot had sliced through  kicking up into the air. Her calm slightly dulled emerald eyes stayed on her student as she wanted to see how exactly they would react.

"mm?"* - Thu Nov 26 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would continue her spin would continue but was begining to slow down with her right foot slightly extended outhwards. The nervous girl was raising up while spinning aiming to come to a stop with the motion. As they resubmerged with a foot extended, it would of hit her right foot. The nervous female's gaze would widen as her right foot suddenly planted on the ground before they pushed off backwards in a pivote, her gaze looking for her students shadow under the wayer. THey breathe inwards before exhaling a soft breath of air, she was feeling a bit lost in the fact that she could not find her student that easily underwater if they had gone down far enough. 

"mm...'

Her gaze seemed to be interested in what her student could or would do...what type of sneak attack would get her down...she was awaiting for them to do something that would catch her off guard. The nervous girl was proud of her students accomplishments dispite what others thought about them...so she wanted to see...not only what they had...but the will they had...in orther to keep trying..until lthey succeed in what they do.* - Thu Nov 26 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as she  landed a bit away from her student as they went back into the water.  She blinked a few times wondering hos long exactly could they hold their breath. HEr gaze was kept on the water before she noticed a shadow lightly past her. The nervous femaled body turned, and right hand was raised before extending forwards towards their hand but was a bit to late. Their fingers would hit her thigh as she was pushed backwards sideways before coming to a stop. The nervous female would give them a nervous smile as she turned to face them with rubbing the side of her right thigh. Her student had finally landed a hit on her...the clever lad.

"mm..y-your doing w-well..."

The nervous female would say as say before running forwards and jumping into the air. The female would jump into the air and her body twisted. Her right foot extended forwards as she began spinning while coming downwards with a dynamic entry towards her students stomach area. A hurricane like wind would begin to surround her form as her foot showed the wind as well forming some sort of sheild before vanishing showing how strong her attack was.

She only hopped hideo was having as much fun as she was.

Walking over towards her student whom was resting on the grass, she would motion that they would surely be just fine for a while on their own untill she came back to retreve them. The nervous female then vanished in a blur.* - Thu Nov 26 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be stepping off the cavern with her sleeping student that was on her shoulder. The driver would give the nervous female a small smile and would wave her off before driving away. The nerovus girl would, in return, give them a small smile as well as she watched them drive away. The nervous girl then turned around to see Mitarashi and Kurina. "o-oh.." Her voice was in a lowish tone as she made her way towards the guards before stoping at a small distance behind the two people.

"u-umm..hi.."

A nervous smile was given to the both of them.* - Thu Nov 26 19:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) she said towards the uchiha as she raised up and gave them a weakish nervous smile. Her almost dulled out calm emerald eyes would lower slightly as her mind seemed to be almost lost. The nervous female trusted the words they had to say and remained silent towards each one of them. She considered them family ever since her close friend ortho had offered no...allowed her to call that place home...that lonely settlement home....if she knew he was in trouble...or if they had called...the nervous female would have been there as well...Her hand slowly drifted off his shoulder...slid down his chest area before dropping to her side. She had lost the person whom acted as her counciler...she lost the person whom kept her sane. The memories of this one person ran through her head before being tucked down into storage like the other memories that was lost. 

"j-just...s-stay...s-safe...a-alright.."

Her body began shaking slowly as her head drooped downwards slowly  Tears began to leave her eyes and slowly roll down her cheeks. Her bangs slowly drifted downwards before swaying from left to right following the movement of her body....shaking...not in fear...but shaking of worry...shaking in the tears she was trying to hold back to her best ability...but her emotions as usual had gotten the better of her....but what could she do...what could she say...to make it seem alright...to make her own mind feel at ease. Was she sopost to convine herself that this man was still alive...was she sopost to end up going crazy and begin thinking someone else..was actually him...no...she could not do that...she was not weak minded...she was not going to become.. something zetusmo would hate...a mindless fool whom cant take the fact of death of an individual personally or to heart. Her memories suddenly flashed back to the moment infront of the river...and the long talk they had about her problems and problications. When they were about to leave each other..she sat up from her sitting position and just watched their back from behind as they walked away. She couldnt bring herself..to say that she liked him at all....not because he was dating someone...because he denied to that..but to the fact that..she did not want to ruin the friendship that the both of them had with one another...the bond..they both shared was that great...and she did not want to ruin it..with akwardness in the middle...and she knew that they did not think of them that way at all. And so she left.

"p-please...f-for me...s-stay..s-safe.."

Was the last thing she would say as her right arm raised to wipe her tears..but it kept coming..she wanted her guidence counciler back...she wanted her mountain sitting buddy back....she wanted to watch him smoke on the mountain top besides her...before playing with his friends...she wanted to see their smile..and the lazyiness in their eyes....she wanted...to have her..close friend back...she wanted...ortho..back...* - Thu Nov 26 20:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) her and being squad leader...as well as the people she had behind them acting as squad mates had went around the village gathering what they needed before leaving the village to engage on this mission. After a few moments had passed, they all met up at the gates before waving the guards goodbye and leaving on their mission. It was then she saw something happening at the boarder which seperated the sandvillage from the desert of death.....a place where people could get or be lost in for days if allowed that chance...but the traiders as well as bandets whom knew the route to the village would be safe from harms way.

"u-umm..t-that...seems to be t-them...r-right?"

She asked curiously as she suddenly came to a stop as she watched the traders wagon being charged at by the numerous bandits or whatever they were.  " p-proceed with c-caution...y-yi...stay w-with t-toudou...and m-momura...with me.." * - Thu Nov 26 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) the female began to watch as sand began to surround the area she was in slowly. Their movements began to become a bit slowly but they still went forwards stareing at the sand that suddenly kicked up infront of ehr and her gaze was directly on the wagon infront of them. Her right arm raised to  slighty cover her eyes slightly as she yelled the words, " u-umm...t-toudao....y-yi....go a-around the w-wagon to the r-right....m-momora.....f-follow behind me..."

The nervous female began to run forwards  as her right arm raised slightly to tilt her hat downwards aiming to allow the sand to bash against that...as long as she could see only a little...they felt that they could make it to the enemy. Her gaze would slowly look back to make sure that momura was behind them following before looking back towards the three bandits...as she made her way closer to them. 

* - Thu Nov 26 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would suddenly come to a stop noticing it was none other than a rock that was in the shape of a wagon. This desert storm was evil in most ways. The nervous girl would allow a breathe of air to escape her lips and  would turn around to stare at momoura giving them a nervous smile before looking back over towards Yi and Touda. " u-umm..i.m-marage?" She asked curously towards her squad mates...they all seemed very quiet and wondered why.

The nervous female decided not to move from this spot for a moment. Still holding onto her head, she looked up to stare at the sky a little and of course the storm that was happening even made that action a bit difficult for her to see. It could not have been heat...since it was windy at the moment...unless there was heat...and the cold breeze from the storm was not felt...hmm...Her nervous smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless face. 

"u-umm...i know i-im squad l-leader...but...w-what do you s-suggest we d-do...w-wait for the s-storm to d-die out...or w-wait here..."* - Fri Nov 27 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give her squad mates a nervous smile before something suddenly entered her peripheral vision. It looked like a sharp object as it glissened under the sun. The nervous girl leaned backward in as she watched the first two shuriken graze the side of her arm while the other grazed her right thight. Kicking off her foot backwards slightly in a pivote, the last shuriken would as went right past her its mark and lounge itself into the desert floor below her. Now on the alert, the nervous females gaze looked around rather slowly to see exaclty whom was fireing at them....however...the female was only able to see two figures in the distance.

Their bodies seemed to be cloaked in sand. Opening her mouth, the nervous female would begin to say the words. "s-stay on a-alert....t-toudou...go a-after  m-momura....y-yi...w-with me..?"

They began to chase after one of the shadows.* - Fri Nov 27 00:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent as she noticed the storm conditions were clearing. Her gaze shifting to the left towards yi whom was besides her as she saw a blade coming downwards onto their back from the corner of her eyes. The nervous girl suddenly stopped in a slightly as the upper part of her body twisted and her right hand was sent forwards towards the tantos blade before suddenly holding it in place as her hand clenched onto it. Blood began to spill downwards as onto the ground from her hand as yi ran forwards past the both of them a bit.

A soft breath of air would leave the nervous females lips as her left hand was then sent forwards aiming to punch them directly in the stomach making hole. If she was successful in holding the blade of their tanto in place.

If she wasent then Yi would have been hit.* - Fri Nov 27 01:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin running forwards towards her destination which was momura. The nervous female ran forwards directly behind momura, the nervous female was disappointed that toudou did not follow behind momura...she had told them to stick with them..to go after them...untill they regroupped again...but it was too late..momura was already on the move and toudou was still in the same spot..oh dear. Her right hand extended forwards aiming to grab hold of momura shoulder to pull them backwards as her body twisted around them in a blurred stated. Her right hand aimed extended forwards aiming to block the last four wind bullets. 

The female then dashed forwards as taka had flickered forwards, When their sword was raised into the air, she followed the basic rule of taijursu defence when faced with a sword. Her hand would suddenly in its already raised position, sway to the right aiming to take a hold of his hilt after getting in close while her left hand curved inwards aiming to elbow them in the chest area. 

If taka was not using both hands to slash, he would be be to stop the elbow. 
Rawr.* - Fri Nov 27 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) gaze was currenly on taka as she saw a black blur come out of the poof of smoke. They dashed forwards a few tiles northwards at an impressive speed. Her gaze however the nervous female began circle the individual hoping momura would be able to avoid this due to their distance from taka.  Holding the tanto back handedlly, the nervous female kicked off her right foot spinning in a slightly slicing the though the first vacume wind bullet before pushing off her feet continuing their run. Her direction soon changed after one or two had ripped her clothing while the last grazed her slightly when she swayed to the side.


The person she was going after was this bandit in general...she felt like they were targeting momura personally...it was time..to use this to her advantage. "mm..."* - Fri Nov 27 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as her oppoent was about  to form their first seal, the nervous girl seemed to vanish in a blur and reapare infront of them. By the time their eyes tracked her it would have been already to late. Her right foot was extened in a blur and attempted to slam into their stomach area before sending them upwards into the air. The nervous girl would follow behind them and push up into the air as well, the nervous female was not having any more of this bandits use of ninjutsu...the nervous female planned to attack quick and fast like zetsumo had told her in the past...this was not a game...but a real battle...she was not going to give up now

'swooh' 

A soft breath of air would leave her lips when the attack had hit. If she was successfull, she would have pushed off her hands like a sping and later began sending multiple kicked towards their stomach area.* - Fri Nov 27 02:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they used their hand to block theirattack and instantly broke it. A nervous smile formed on her lips as she watched them pivote backwards as she pushed off her hands like a sping sideways in the air. Like she did to mirai, the nervous girl followed them with her feet extended aiming to send multiple kicked towards their chest area and stomach area while being sideways towards the individual as they were pivoting backwards to safety.

This nervous female was not playing any games. As the first kick had landed its hit, the female would say the word. "n-no..." Before the others were lunched forwards at equal speed towards her oppoent aiming to send them into a world of pain.

If she was successfull or not, the nervous would would land on the ground probably covered in quick sand..or mabe not...who knew...woosh* - Fri Nov 27 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was suddenly released from her trans in genjutsu.  Her gaze looked down on the ground and later back up towards taka noticing that she was no longer crouching. "t-thanks.." A small smile formed on her lips before they suddenly vanished in blur once more and reapared behind taka in a crouched position before they kicked off into the air and their body twisted in a counter clock wize direction. A violent hurricane like wind suddenly began to surround her form as her right leg extended outwards aiming to slam her heel into taka's only unbroken arm sending them to the east of west depending on which arm it was.

On the inside however, she was hoping they would beable to shunshin away so they could come back at a later date to fight them again...hopefully...oh dear...  * - Fri Nov 27 03:25:13 2015
