<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent walking towards the area slightly behind Koji before looking over to her right as hassan appared besides her cracking their knuckles. They also seemed to be in their kage cloak which surprised her. The females gaze then slowly went back onto Ai as she awaited the words of koji to initiate when they were sopost to do something to stop them. The nervous female's eyes would lower slightly as the words that koji spoke of went though her ears. "s-so...we need...to umm...s-stop it?" She said unaware of how dangerous the bijuu was. The girl would begin running forwards towards them unless stopped by a calling just after she had said those words.

The girl would then vanish in a blur and would reapare infront of it...just seconds after they had fired their bomb...this would have been the second time she had seensomething like this happen to someone...the first was with katsuya...oh dear. She was in a crouched position and her right foot extended aiming to kick them in their stomach area....if she was successfull. The females nervous smile would have slowly faded away...and her face seemed to hold no expression.* - Wed Nov 25 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) foot would have been burned, the female would be in a crouching position breathhing inwards and outwards rather slowly and calmly. Her mind trying to ignore the pains her arms...no her body was shaking slowly, however she tried to make her heart calm.  The nervous females hair began to change into a white color before seemingly begining to levitate. Her wounds healing only a little, however...she would beable to last with her burned leg for a while longer. A small cough would leave her lips before her breathing began to seem slightly heavier...showing that she was in pain.

The nervous girl would begin to watch silently as she began running forwards slowly before stumbling slightly and regaining her footing. The Reaching into her black robe, she took out a large shuriken that she usually had used for defence purposed in the past...now she was going to use it as a sheild again...but not for defence...but to punch things. Closing her eyes that were emerald colored once, she would reopen them revealing pure yellow color. Their mind now noting things that she should be aware of when fighting a buji...

Jumping forwards just after the blades of wind were fired...her being right behind them..., the nervous girls body spun in a blur as she put the shuriken infont of her with their arm...as a shield horrizontally as a spun in a head but fashion towards the Ai....."mm..." * - Thu Nov 26 00:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) watched as Ai would find themselfs in a stand still.  They would find them selves being pushed backwards  by the females pure strength of her shuriken headbut. Her spind would continue for a moment longer before her foot touched the ground and her body spun and swayed to the right pulling the shuriken that was attached to her arm. The force she was applying was begining to go away, to the female just allowed the the arm to pass though before it dispursed completely. Kicking off her feet in a haste, the female began to run forwards in a slight blur with her giant shuriken shield that she only used for special situations. 

"mm..."

Her mouth seemed to be opened and their breathing seemed to be slightly heavy...but she still kept on fighting her opponent...with was Ai. She understood that something grave must of happened to them from what she could gather...however, arrived to late to see what the trigger could of been. Strands of white hair from her bangs slowly covered her pure yellow eyes as she. The nervous girl soon heard hassans yell before vanisheing in a blur.

The female actually went into a slide just before a massive wind just blew past her a few times...or a massive ammount of times from above and besides her.
It was...zetsumos air bullet technique....the ones she used to have trouble kicking away...it sure brought back memories...mmm. Her gaze stayed on her opponents...they were going to fight them untill they were all worn out.* - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would raise up after all the attacks were made. Her body would slowly turn as her body slowly looked to over to her right and stared at her half red shuriken strapped to her arm. She felt the heat transmitting into her cloak ...another attack with her shuriken...and the heat would have became un bareable. A soft sight breath of air would leave her lips as she turned northwards and watched as their cloak would begin to face away and ai had returned back to normal due to the words...or loving words of mizora.

"mm.."

The nervous females lips would form a small smile before her pure yellow gaze would look over to hassan or koji on what to do next.* - Thu Nov 26 02:03:44 2015

Iza seemed to have lost an arm and was burned...to her knowledge....since they were found in a 30x30 crator.

Paine seemed to have a burned right leg and was in gate two....she currently had pure yellow eyes and white hair. "i-im..umm g-going back...please..u-umm..t-take care of them..." A nervous smile was given to Chikyu before they vanished in a blur.* - Thu Nov 26 02:29:20 2015
