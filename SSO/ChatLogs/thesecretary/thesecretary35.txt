<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nods, taking the scroll...she began to walk towards the gate.* - Tue Dec  1 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin walking past the gates, her movement rather slow past Hideo and Yuda.  The Traveling merchant would be on top of his wagon  waving towards paine an she herself would give them a nervous smile. However it only lasted for a moment as her smile slowly faded away and her eyes slowered slightly...she was at a loss with herself and her breathing irregular....the nervous female planing to leave the village and go home after completeling the general requirement for the mission and come back within a few days. However, maybe after the exams...she would leave and use this attempt to take a break from this type of lifestyle. "mm..." A thought remained repeating in her head as she slowly continued her walk gradually getting closer to the wagon. 'Come one, get on we dont have all day.' The traveler said in a bit of annoyance. The nervous female looked up forwards them shaking a little before saying the words. "u-umm...im s-sorry..." As she extended her hand only to later be helped up onto the wagon....her space upon the seat a little rough but decided she would have been able to manage.  Her almost dulled calm emerald eyes looking away towards the sandy surface to the right of her and allowed her hands to rest on her lap. Her hair flowed softly following the whim of the wind...slowly raising before returning to its slumbered state.

The traveling merchant stared at the female for a moment...He felt as if something was wrong with her...something he did not want to press on against since it was probably something personal. Both of his hands raised slowly  as his gaze went back onto his horses feeling a little worried...here he was planning to give the female a hard time...but could not muster up the courage...nor the will to do so since they were in such a sad state already. In his mind, he wondered why the kazekage would send someone whom did not have their mind focused  to take part in a mission as complex as this. 'what ever...' 

The merchant mumbled under his breathe as his arms lashed outwards following the loud but brief yell of 'hiya!!!' and the horses began chucking and chucking...buckling and hustling...all along the sandy path which led to the destined area of which she seeked. The sand..dust..drifted up slowly with each step the horses made and with each rotation the four supporting wheels made.....however...the horses....the female...the merchant...and the cargo was not safe ....a two men watched from a distance....telescope in hand.....zooming inwards and outwards...refocusing and unfocusing....trying to read the strengths of this mans protector...but couldnt...was this female...strong?...she did not look physical...she did not look durable...and seemed weak....even the bandits thought this about the female...but may not know not to judge a book by its cover

And so their journy had begun..* - Tue Dec  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would remain silent during the long ride though the desert....the merchant's gaze going on her form...gaze trailing downwards stareing at her strangely before looking away when the nervous girls gaze slowly went onto them. This happened a couple of times before she finally had given in and became curious to what exactly they wanted to ask her. "u-umm...w-what is i-it..?" She asked in a curious tone of voice. 

The merchant kept his gaze on the road ahead of them as she lead forwards slightly still stareing at them. The traveler gazed downwards and formed a slightly akwards smile before speaking. 'just wondering...whats wrong....ya do know that most other girls would be more loud and so on ' His mouth slowly closed as he pulled back the horses slow it would slow down by a little bit. He would rather not have the horses tire out so easily all because finding an oasis when that happened was a bit to hard. The nervous girl had given them a small smile and was about to speak before her right hand raised and touched his head...she soon after pushed him backwards. A kuni flew by his head and the nervous females gaze was on the people infront of her both suddenly jumped into the above them and to each side. 

The nervous female rose up slightly, her right hand extended swiftly as she watched the first banit draw their weapon...which was a tanto in a diagonal slash aiming for the traders rib cage, however was intercepted by her hand being placed on his hilt stoping its movement completely. her other hand shot towards their stomach cauing them to exhale out blood before being thown over of her shoulder and into the bandit behind her. They both rolled off the cavern and as paine jumped off  and her body twised in a blur. Her body turned sideways as her right leg was brought outwards and was later sent onto the bodies of both bandits crushing them both as a cloud of self made smoke surrounded them and herself. She jumped backwards up into the air and out of the smoke...landing on the back of the cavern ontop of it watching around to see if there were any more intruders trying to take the traders life. 

Her body turned and saw the village coming into view...they were close and almost there....hmm....Her eyes then seemingly closed as felt the cool air bashing against her face. Their eyes opened slowly as she began pondering on what to do now...and to how exactly she was going to succeed in this task....was it really going to be as simple as this....hmm.* - Tue Dec  1 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) began walking around the sides of the cavern slowly hoping to find anymore whom had climbed abord the cavern. She started her her side of the cavern only to hear a voice of the merchant saying,' they all gone?'. His voice sounded uneasy, was he scared for his life...then why did he pick the life of a trader if they got ambushed so often....sometimes..she wondered if they liked being ambushed. Then again...it did make mission for the shinobi villages and inturn helps them get money and what not. A soft breath of air would leave her lips as she began to walk around the back and looked down only to see the ruffles of the caverns back. The female slowly turned around slowly and began looking down at the last side of the wagon and saw a bandit crawing  along the edge. "mm.." A soft hum left her lips....her feet kicking off into the air as she spun for a moment....their right leg extended outwards and a blast of wind being cut though swayed away form her form. The female came downwards with her foot sheilded by air as she broke though it......* Crackle*....A loud of ribs breaking upon contact with her foot echoed thoughout the area and sent chills down the merchants body. The female's knee bended slightly as she kicked off of them sending them cashing into the ground and rolling away backwards before coming to a stop. 

"u-um...i t-think that was....a-all of them.." 

She would say as she landed back ontop of the wagon. The female would then begin to walk forwards before hopping down into her seat. Looking over towards her merchant as the village soon came closer into view, he looked like he was sweating a bit more profoundedly...probably it was the heat of the desert...oh dear...it was the good thing they reached the village. Entering the village, they came to a stop and paine hoped off as well as the merchant. "and u-umm..h-here you are....s-safe and u-uhh..s-sound...g-good luck s-sir merchant" A nervous smile would be given to them under her hat which consealed her eyes. Her head tilted upwards slightly revealing almost dulled out eyes which caused the merchant to take another step backwards as he waved slowly...why was he steping backwards...had she done something wrong. Her gaze lowered slightly feeling as if she was going to recieve a bad report from from them...turning around, she began to leave the village and later made her way towards the next location which was back to the village of sand.

They exited the gates and vanished in a blur. It was time to return a mission.* - Tue Dec  1 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would repear a bit of a distance from the village in a crouching position before raising up slowly in a slight jump into the air before landing on her feet. Her walk was a slow one as her mind had reminded her of something that had happened in the past...not the futrue...but also...the present..The chunnin exams or whatever they were was really hard...she failed the test protion...she failed the capture the flag portion and now she was going to fail another thing. A soft sigh would leave her lips...she had finally finished doing these actions...and wasnt planning on ever doing it again because she felt it be unnessary. A nervous smile slowly formed on her lips as she began to reach the gates sunagakure. Deciding not to go yet and to train like she had usually done, they b-lined to the south and stoped infront of the rock. Both hands raised as a soft breath of air left her lips, the sorrow that was reaching her heart...the sorrow that caused her breathing to become paused and un fullfilling...the breathing that caused her to become stronger...and the breathing that caused her to become weak....which one...was she trying to hide...which one...was she trying to reveal. A tear began to leave her right eye as her right hand turned into a fist and was sent forwards towards the rock. A heavy breath of air left her lips before breathing inwards...a cloud of dust forming from where her fist had met the rock...

"i-im...b-but....i-im..am i..r-really...this...p-pitifull.."

She asked herself...she asked to no one in particular....her cries being called towards the heavens. They wanted to know...if she could have actually protected them...the flag....from danger to herself, and others around them. Her body began shaking slowly as that hands retracted and her left was sent towards the rock instead.....the sheild of wind visable as she broke though it...the balance and skill....the will and the thrill...a feeling of excitment of punching something that could take her punches...like this rock here....but the smile only vanshed when she realized that she was holding back....not wanting to damage the rock...she knew herself that she was holding back...not wanting to break the rock...she knew that the gods...that gave her this strength...had given it to her for a reason...but why...what was that reason...why trust her...why trust someone as clumby and useless as her...a power like this...the strength...the speed...and reflex...that was almost god like...to her. The nervous female stared at the rock as the smoke cleared up before she retracted her hand and left it at hersides. Kicking off her right foot, her body twisted in a blur and her right foot raised into the air smashing against the rock. They seemed to be inhaling and exhaling slightly deeply before her techers words echoed within her head. ' breathing technique...remeber?' 

Paines eyes widened as she came to a stop within her training. Was that roses voice. Her right hand slowly raised to grasp her head trying to listen in to that voice but she did not hear it again. Was it just...her imagination....oh dear..Shaking her head a few times, her right arm raised to wipe the tears from her face as she began to continue her walk to the gates.* - Tue Dec  1 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) entering though the gates, the guards would look towards the female whom was wiping her face and allowed her to pass. The loved talking to her, but now did not seem like it was the right time to do that sort of thing. It was not because of fear of how she would react...its just because they did not know what to say to a crying female that wont seem fake. Her hands slowly lowered to her sides as she then began walking towards  the square....gazes from all around stareing that the female whom wore a hat which consealed her facial features to an extent. "mm...."  A soft hum would leave her lips...as her eyes seemily closed trying to ignore the stares that was given to her from all around. They felt uneasy staying in this village because of this...the feelings of hate...curiousty...or jelousy which kept replying in her head each time she walked the streets of sunagakure. As she came upon the square...they noticed a few people...Mirai...Chikyu...Kiyoko and Lera...it was umm...the usual she would find in the square so early in the morning.

The nervous female began walking forwards towards the office or no...the mansion in hopes of giving the motion of her completeing the mission. A nervous smile would then form on her lips as she she hoped the rewards for completeing a mission like this was as fruitful as the other rewards were...hopefully...oh dear...* - Tue Dec  1 13:34:30 2015
