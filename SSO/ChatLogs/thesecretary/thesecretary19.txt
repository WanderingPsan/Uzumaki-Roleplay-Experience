<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly as she walked forwards and later stopped when she was infront of them. "u-umm...sure...i hope the s-spar will be a good o-one..." The nervous girl would give a nod to her self in approval before looking over towards her left and later looking over towards her right. Their calm emerald eyes lowered slightly feeling unsure of where to position themselfs for this spar. "mm......u-umm..." she would say before looking back towards them with a small smile on her face. "im n-not sure if....m-my s-shyness with f-fade away a-at all...in this sense"

The nervous girl said before allowing a breathe of air to escape her lips. Her sparing partner was a beautiful person and skillfull while she was not skillfulll at all...just a clumbsy girl trying to better herself in this world....they envyed this about that person.* - Sun Nov  8 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) remained in no stance as usual. They would then begin jumping upwards slightly into the air before landing on the ground. She would continue doing this repeadly before turning sideways and stareing at her opponent. Their arms dangled up and down following her movements rhytemicly, but controlably. Her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly as she awaited first move. They were now going to spar their sparing partner now. Their breathing reamined controlled as she remebered the words of rose whenever she had began a spar or fight...After a few moments had passed, the nervous girl said the words.

"i-im...r-ready..."

Thier small smile suddenly faded away leaving an expressionless face. It was time to get this spar started.* - Sun Nov  8 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as the blade had come towards her. As they had sent their sword in upwards fashion towards her hip and shoulder. The nervous girl dashed forwards as any other skilled taijutsu user would. Their right hand was sent forwards and placed on their whrist while their left hand open palmed was raised quickly aiming to clam it into their neck. The female wanted them to feel like they were coking badly and cough a bit. 

If she was successfull, she would move backwards and wait for them to raise up. They would go into the stance she was previously using and begin jumping upwards and downwards in a slow motion. Their hands dangling at her sides while her calm gaze remained on the person infront of them. They knew how to fight swords users...so this would be good practice for them to anticipe her actions the next time they spared. They would then say in a slight worried tone.

"a-are...you a-alight?"* - Sun Nov  8 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Time to visit... - Sun Nov  8 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they followed suit while she moved backwards aiming to unlock themselfs from their fighting motion. 

Her gaze was kept on them as they raised back up after being delt with a stagering blow....and pushed forth aiming to punch her in their gut. Her right hand now trailing downwards would of not made it in time, but her left hand was at her side would of as it drifted away from their bladed hand and towards the right blocking the punch before grabbing a hold of their fist in a tight grip. They would then pull them over towards her left aiming to stagger them delaying their attack towards her shoulder...or makeing a bit off their mark.

If they were successfull,

She would recieve a slight scrape on her right shoulder as it touched her while they were being jagged. Their right hand would then aim to be sent towards to aiming to take hold of their extended wrist before attempting  to raise up their right leg to kick them in the stomach area and away from their form as they let go of their form.

Will she be stopped dun dun dun!!!* - Sun Nov  8 23:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would stare at them for a moment blinking a few times\ as they raised back up. A nervous smile formed on her lips happy that there was a person besides her first student maloth to beable to take her lesser powered kick....Their hands lowered to their sides as she remained in no stance staring at their opponent with calm emerald eyes. "i-im not that good...im m-mostly seen as below a-average.....i dont think i d-deserve..t-that type of p-praise.."

Their right hand would raise to cover her mouth slightly as they a soft nervous laughter left her lips...they rather did not see themself like that at all. Their nervous smile would then suddenly slowly drop into an expressionless expression as she dashed forward towards her oppoenet. She suddenly vanished from her their sight.....however if they had good eyesight....they would see a blur trail downwards and pain would be in a crouching position with her right foot aiming for their stomach aera. 

If they were successfull, they would be sent upwards into the air and her next like of attacks would have begun as they suddenly pushed off their feet following them up into the air.* - Sun Nov  8 23:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) tight would be grazed slightly as she followed them diagonally upwards. Her body twisted in an anti cockwize in a blurred state as she did not vanish and re-appear behind the oppoenent as she had usually done, but remained infront charging forwards towards them as she was on the offensive this time. A violent hurricane like figure surrounded their form as their right leg extended outwards aiming to slam into their rib cage.

'swoo'

A soft breath of air left her lips if or if not contact was made. The wind that formulated aimed to blast back their sword if they tried to attack her in mid air as they attempted to kick them and send them westwards tumbling to the ground. If she was succesffull, she would land and later wait for them to raise up again before charging towards them once more if it was still her turn to continue the attacking sequence. "b-better?" she asked curious woundering if they were joking around....or actualy being serious.* - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) , as stated before, she would continueing to run forwards before stoping in a short slide. Her left hand remaiend open palmed and aimed to slam into their neck and later gripping onto it if she was successful. Their right hand would be send forwards towards their left hand wrist aiming to take hold of it in the same motion by swaying i bit inwards so when they were ready to slash their sword, her right hand would curve outwards and would be placed in that area in the given time.

They were not giving them a chance to rest.

Her right wrist now bleeding slowly as their opponent staggared backwards she dashed forwards before suddenly going into a slide. Fulling coming to a stop she decided it was time for the spar to end as they stoped before going into attack range.

Reaching into her pocket, she took out a rock and turned eastwards. Leaning backwards slightly as her hair turned white and their eyes turned into an pure yellow color. The rock was sent flying off eastwards halfway  across the world.

'sh sh sh'

The loud sound something crumbling was heard as she returned to their non supersayain state. Opening her mouth she would begin to speak.

"f-find the rock...that i t-threw.....and here a c-clue....over the m-mountains..u-under the s-sea....im h-hidden..and y-you can never f-find me....but i-if your s-smart...then you will l-look u-under the the h-hat......m-aybe in a r-river...f-flowing like a t-trap....B-Behind a t-tree...o-or house....t-then again...it m-may be a d-draft..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) after getting off of the cavern, she began to make her way eastwards towards her house.

However...that marrisa...she had to teach someone else in taijutsu....and they all seeked her for some reason. She was not all that special at all...then again...if they wished to learn from her, whom was she to argue with them....the least she could do is give a test in hope..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would begin to leave her house once more to venture out to kohonoa so she could use their cavern to get to sunagakure. They were planing on staying scarce fore a longer time, but she had to see if her other student that was in the village, was actually there. The nervous girl began to make her way out of the forest clearing she was in, her movements slow and percise. The leaves she passed by would sway downwards to the ground slowly before being kicked up once again by the wind that tried to pass through the trees but went around instead. This wind....the same that caused her hair to float upwards a bit before lowering slowly back down onto her shoulders. Pushing off her feet, they went up into the air and landed on a tree branch before kicking off of it. Her right hand raised and pulled on her hat while in mid air before continueing her speedy dash westwards at a quickend pace.....gliding within the air and spinning and even going upsidedown  as a nervous smile appared on her face. They loved the feeling of seemingly floating when ever she had done three jumping. The suspence that she had as she levitated within the air for a few moments before suddenly placing her hands on the tree branch quickly and spinning into an upright position continuing her movements. 

Upon landing on a brach just outside the village of kohonoa, she pushed off of it carring her momentum with her as she twisted her body withing the air, her right leg was brought forwards. Her right leg extened outwards before suddenly being pulled forwards in a slight blur. A hurrican like wind surrounded her form....but it was different...a swirl of visable wind came about then nervous girls form going upwards high into the the air as yellow gleaming eyes began to formed from the tip...a head beging to take place of a dragon before suddenly exploding sending wind everywhere in each direction. A women stayed suspended within the air getting cut in all places before collapsing to the ground. Paine slowly rose of as a soft breath of air escaped her lips....she had to make it so she would not get injured by her own technique....this would need...a bit more practice....Activating her gates...her wounds began to heal before she suddenly deactivated it and done a round house kick to make sure she was ok. They wernt at their mansion where maids and what not were...but at a kohonoa...a soft breath of air left her lips as she walked over to the cavern own whome stared at the nervous girl in disbelif.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would have her hand on the chairs head  hesitating for a moment before fully sitting down in the seat. Both her hands drifted onto her lap before looking towards the person whom sat before her with a nervous smile. "m-me?...i umm...i...am a t-traveler.....and a t-taijutsu p-perfessional......looking for a s-student whom is interested...in t-taijutsu...p-purely...but i have n-not found one..." 

A soft breath of air would have left her lips as her eyes lowered slightly for a moment. She was not intesively looking for a student, but she was asked whereever she went after sparing against one person.....they were not that great...but non the less...people still seeked her for help in whatever task was needed for them to better them selfs in that art.....then there were greedy people...whom could hold three professions at once....and being skillfull in all three of them without fail. Then what does that make her...or someone else...whom strives to do better in an art that only they can do...with no skill in either ninjutsu of genjutsu.

"b-but...w-what about your self.." 

She looked back up towards them and gave a nervous smile...not wanting to get lost in her thoughts....the depressing thoughs that filled her head every time the question that triggers it comes.* - Wed Nov 11 03:30:20 2015

"i-i understand...then you m-must find someone else...i a-applogize...for m-making such a r-request...."

She would pause for a moment before continuing from a change of topic. "u-umm...did you have p-parents?"* - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jay(Serori2) says: My mom was annoying. She would never admit she was wrong, and complained about everything. My dad wasn't much better, he just always let my mom walk all over him... But they were both my parents. So I loved them a lot anyways, despite their faults. - Wed Nov 11 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) eyes would suddenly form comedic anime white circles as her body shook. The prices were outragous for a traveler like herself.

"u-umm...u-uhh.....mmm..." 

Her gaze slowly looked up over her menu to look at Jay before looking back down at her menu quickly when she noticed his gaze look onto her. When her name was called, they suddenly jumped in their seat and quickly slapped the menu onto the table. 

"w-water.."* - Wed Nov 11 05:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give Ari an appologetic small smile before looking over towards Jay giving them a nervous smile as she reached for the glass and sippeed it before a second water came . She would then stare as all the food began apparing on the table...but she herself never asked for two glasses of water....oh dear...

"mm...a-are you sure...y-you can e-eat all t-that?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) gaze would drift away from the food as she continued sipping her water slowly. They felt like throwing up after seeing so much food, it was the whole reason she only ordered one thing..However, she kept on her nervous smile that seemed forced at the moment as she watched their person infront of them gobble it all up. When they asked for her water, she then held it up for them to take.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would jump into the air as her body twisted in an andi clockize blur. A violent hurricane formed as they aimed to kick both Jay and Huey away with full strength enough to shatter ribs......the whirlwind was made to also damage them as well...deflect projectiles and what not if thrown at them. The nervous girl just wanted to knocked them both out simply and painlessly....they wanted them to go lights out....the resturant was no place for a battle.....however if this was elsewhere....then...then she would have just watched...

Upon landing, a nervous smile was given towards the cheift and the waiter.

"mmm...t-this seems...p-problematic..."
