Her gaze then slowly went back onto the rocks during the short pause she gave them to answer her first question.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a small smile. Turning around she would begin walking towards the gate. "m-maybe...umm...n-not.." She was going to complete this mission with Mitsunara now since inazanami was missing...the only question was whether they were gonna take a cavern there or walk there...when they had reached the cavern, the nervous female looked back and stared at mitsunara for a moment before coming to a stop. A soft breathe of air would leave her lips as her mouth opened and she had said the words.

"d-do you....umm...w-wish...to take...a...c-cavern?....or would you p-prefer to umm...w-walk..."* - Wed Dec  9 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin maybe her first ever mission with mitsunara...she just hopped that nothing bad hapened in kiri when they visited. They were to find out the well being ot kirigakure so sunagakure can help them recover from whatever mutt they were in like they had done for them. Maybe it was one of those, il help you now so we can be even, type of deals...these were common in the shinobi land. There was then those whom betrey just because of not likeing the opposite sex....she always wondered why it was like this at all. Her gaze would look over towards mitsunara for a moment listen to the soft sound of her arm....she always did wonder if their sword and spear...were so dark.and hellish.....why was their hum....so light....and heavenly. 

"mm..."

She allowed a soft hum to escape her lips...but did not sound as gentle as Mitsunara's....they were probably better than them in the singing department too...not that she sang at all...hmm...what did Mitsunara sound like when they sing....THoughts like these would cross her mind as they both made their way across the boarder.* - Wed Dec  9 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would shake her head rather slowly meaning no. "umm i h-havent....back t-then....t-things were uhh...a b-bit different..." She said, they were rather on the other side of the law...she was about to head to the village at one point in her life...but was immediately called back due to pour judgement on the leaf kage's point. The only time she had ever seen it was when they first entered the elemental nations all those years ago...oh dear. "umm...o-oh...umm i n-noticed k-kinami umm....r-ruined your b-body....are you...uhh...o-ok?"

She asked curiouly remebering what had happened....she had disbanded kinami as a student...untill she knew how to control that power hungry side of hers. It was turning her into a monster.* - Wed Dec  9 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly as they were walking down the path of flowers and and trees. She loved walking though them and smelling the calm sent they gave off....the trees that allowed their leafs to slowly drift downwards onto the ground was also another thing that made this place worth the walk. Taking a cavern usually made a person miss out on the special sights that was all around them and she rather was not the type to like missing special things...however there were always those moments when the lazyness really really does get to you...mmm. Reaching into her pocket, she took out her pet slug and placed it on her shoulder so it could see the views too..

"u-umm...i f-found this p-pet..uhh...s-slug that the umm o-owners did not want a-after i c-completed a m-mission.....but i havent f-found a umm...n-name for t-them..."* - Wed Dec  9 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a nervous smile, the both of them crossing the boader before getting in a boat to actually get to the village. They were taking the civilian root rather than the ninja root....they wernt here to fight after all...just to see how their allys were doing. The boat ride was rather long and piecefull, the boat driver would look back occasionally to stare at the females but mostly on the consealed one which seemed rather suspicscous.  The waves sounded rather soft and calm to her ears, the constant rocking made her feel a little queeze though...however they still went along on their way. Once both of them had wounded up on the shores, she would step out of the boat and would offer to help Mitsunara as well before turning around....and towards the gates.

"u-umm...how do y-you uhh...t-think they w-will umm....r-react?"

She asked curiously.* - Wed Dec  9 23:08:48 2015
