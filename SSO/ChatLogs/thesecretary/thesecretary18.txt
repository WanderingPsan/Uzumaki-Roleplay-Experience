She had though she was strong because of how well she fended off Sanoke....oh dear...but they seemed to have learned the leaf whirl wind technique. Blinking a few times after they had spokeing once more, she would begin to speak.

"o-oh...so you know the l-leaf w-whirlwind....w-what about...d-dynamic e-entry..?"

She asked questionably, the nervous girl was unsure of how much they have or had advanced in most taijutsu techniques they had learned or would have leanred. She was more or less impressed, but for now....remained silent as her smile slowly faded upon awaiting their response.

"mm.."* - Sun Nov  1 03:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervous smile before speaking once more.

"t-the d-dynamic entry.....i-is a jump k-kick into the a-air.....your r-right o-or l-left foot is e-extended outwards when y-you jump i-into the air....it is m-mostly d-directed towards a p-persons h-head area to k-knock them o-out c-cold...b-beginers are f-free to take a r-running head s-start...but u-upon m-mastry.....you can jump into the a-air in a o-one r-rotation s-spin before extending your l-leg forwards in a k-kicking m-motion.......that p-push will s-send you f-forwards....f-for example..."

Paine would demonstrate this technique herself. The nervous girl would start by bending her knees slightly before jumping up into the air...her body twisted once as she went into a spin before her right leg extended outwards in a kicking motion and stayed in place when it was fully extended outwards. A barrier of wind encasied her foot as she was sent forwards  towards the rock pillor. The wind showed how much power she had put into the kick...but not enough to break the pillar...it wasent hers after all..

The nervous gril would then bend her right knee slightly and kick off the rock before landing on the ground. looking southwards towards Mirari, her emerald eyes lowered slightly as she spoke once more after the actions had been done.."d-do...you w-wish to g-give it a t-try.....y-you may need a r-runing s-start...f-first.."* - Sun Nov  1 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly seeing them do the technique. "i-ive...been told to have more...c-confidence....m-many times....i j-just...w-wish....it were that e-easy..." Her calm emerald eyes would look back up towards them before exhaling a breathe of air. They began thinking about all the times shin had told her to have more confidence in he ablilitys...but something like that seemed impossible for the most part. However...she did try to full fill others needs in being less fearfull about the out comes of many spars and was just happy to do them more or less...

"d-do...it again...y-your k-knee was s-slightly b-bent...k-keep it s-straight.....d-dont let y-your m-momentum...b-beat your p-positioning...and m-miss the t-target area..."

She would state at first as she raised a hand motioning them to do it again A small smile was given to them...however she wished the confidence that everyone else had was with her as well...this was what she had envyed the most... * - Sun Nov  1 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would givwould nod rather slowly as they had much less mastered the basis of the technique. She would motion them once more to do it again as she spoke. "w-when you jump into the a-air....m-make sure the leg you are s-striking with is s-straight....the o-other leg is retracted i-inwards.......w-when in the air...m-make sure to b-balance yourself g-greatly...do not t-tilt........when your f-foot h-hits a-against the r-rock..make sure it i-is s-straight...a-allowing the m-momentum...to p-pass by before b-bending your k-knee and k-kicking off........"

She would state before taking a few steps backwards towards the west as she folded her arms under her chest area. Her nervous smile faded into an expressionless expression as she thought to herself for a moment....maybe if she worked on it, they could become of confident as them in a few years....mmm...this was something to think over or on...they would then speak before they began to try it again...

"w-we dont...w-want an i-internal i-injury.....f-from u-using this m-mmove...now d-do we..."

She said focusing on Mirai's development....she wanted them to do it correctly....if it was mastered and done the wrong way...they would recieve alot of leg pains in the near future.* - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would arive at her place of resting before closing her eyes as she went into a meditative position. The nervous girl was going to begin her training once more ...but this time she had to deliver the things she had told her master that she would deliver. A soft breath of air would have left her lips as she slowly began drifting away from the world of reality and went into her meditative world...She was busy developing a technique that would help her greatly in the taijutsu world...but she hoped that it would prove as something usefull and not something poisenous....it was still underdevelopment and would take a bit longer untill she actually had the move down.

___Mind Scape World___

The nervous girl dull eyes began to turn fade into color as she looked around slowly, she was still walking unconcously and had been halfway across the town....A sigh as releaf had fell upon her form as she felt rather lucky that she had not....well...umm...run or walk into any wagons..Her emeralds calm eyes looked up and stoped infront of a building that looked bleak....men of all shape and sizes came in...and moans...they came out....These type of people seemed as if they were done with life....done with the life that was given to them...the path that was chosen for them to take.....the workers wanted something different but could not help to phantom quiting because...whom would hire them with their current skill set. Her calm eyes lowered slightly as she looked down at her box that their mentor had given them...

"r-right...u-up..there..."

The female continued her rather slow walk forwards up the small upwards hill. Over to her right there was a spacing as she suddenly stoped when she was directly besides it before reajusting her grip on the heavily weighted box. The sounds of the mafa like village echoed in her ears...as she heard gun shots around the corner but at a rather large distance......the yellings and livelyness of the town was heard from a distance and showed that these gangs feared no body......the nervous girls body shivered slightly as her eyes closed for a moment....her breathing hastened a slight bit before suddenly calming down after some time has past. The nervous girls eyes slowly opened and raised to watch the path ahead of her as she shooked her head rather slowly and continued along her path....towards the building that seemed rundown....towards the building that could be sold for scrap or demolized....she was going...to the client.* - Tue Nov  3 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) after some time, the nervous girl had finally arrived at her desired location. She looked around the area. The nervous girl was going to meet the client now and they were ready for her. A few men leaned against the wall while others were in the back rooms playing carts or singing a song....they were all basically just scattered doing their own things untill the duty of action had called them into play. It felt just heptic and what not as she continued walking slowly towards the location that was the stairs and later began to walk up them. After some time had pased, the nervous female had made it up the flight of stairs and rested the box directly infront of her beforee collapseing onto the ground. Her breathing was a bit heavy as she never carried something so heavy before....the nervous girl always thought that it was strange that her mentors kept giving her something that was extremely hard to carry...but then again....she saw it as something fruitful at te moment...it may even help her stanima a bit

"p-positive..."

she would say softly towards herself as she pushed herself up off the staircase and picked up her books. The nervous girl continued down the hall and later coming to a stop infront of the door. Giving a soft kick, it had opened revealing a man with blond hair giving the female a raised eyebrow as they looked her up and down untill they finally realized a the box. "this is the box, il be taking this" the man said lazily as they lowered themselfs taking the box before turning around and placing it on the desk inside the appartment. The male would then turn to face them...they had a bit of a lazy expression on their face....also as if they had seen everything this town had to offer and wanted to leave...but could nt....it was...akward. The both of them stared at each other for a while  before suddenly they motioned her to come inside the appartment and she herself walked forwards closing the door behind them.* - Tue Nov  3 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) looked around the room for a moment or two as a breath of air escaped her lips. The door creaked and slowly closed behind her and now she was really in a persons appartment. The walls looked old and had stains on them...probably from the previous owner since she saw his luggage or still packed suitcase in the living room floor.....it seemed he had just come back from a long traveling session and was resting untill she had rang his doorbell...oh dear. .The nervous girls head turned upon hearing the word, ' hey!' being called from the kitchen and she walked down the hall and made a right...she entered the rather large kitchen which looked a bit influential....it was clean for the most part..the walls were decorative and the single table in the middle which was used to cook or eat on had a cardboard box ontop of it...and opened...

"mmph.."

A soft sound had left her lips as her right hand raised to slowly cover her mouth. The stench was frightening...and crawlled about the room....a hand was slammed down onto the table as he turned away. The nervous girl covered her nose slightly and wallked closer to see what exactly it was before her eyes widened slightly as tears slowly ran down her eyes...the nervous girl began moving backwards slowly...her body shaking slightly as the man slowly looked up to stare at the female as they reached into their pocket and walked closer to them...fastening their face while she herself moved backwards before going into the wall. behind her. 'budup'........'tuppp'....Two loud sounds were heard....the nervous girl going against the wall and the males hand slamming against the wall and his breathing hastening as they spoke her....the nervous girls head turned to the side as they yelled these words...

"what...is this...crap.."

Her eyes narrowed away from them and stared at the door before speaking. "i-im....only...a m-messenger....i...u-umm..do n-not...k-know..." her eyes slowly lowered as tears rolled down her cheeks....fear remained in her heat...Their hands slowly drifted down the wall and remained dangeling at their sides as they began walking to the door...opening it, they pushed took their hand pulled her out the door...* - Thu Nov  5 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would hear the door slam shut behind her as she turned around and heard yelling in the house hold and crying....they seemed to not know what to do with themselves....however...she just wondered what her mentor had done for a living when they were not training her...maybe she was a messenger like herself..then again...it was this type of town..The nervous girl would raise up her right arm and wipe her tears as she began walking towards the exit for the building...or the elevator..but the building looked rather run down...so she took the stairs decideding not to take any chances...Once outside of the building...she walked and walked....down the hill..and across the park.....then a few blocks untill she had reached  the bar which Zen had worked at...

During her walk...she looked over towards her right as she heard yelling and what not...the people were playing some sort of game...children younger than herself...it felt like a...well...jumppy...like nothing was serious...or had a meaning...but they still smiled...laughed and cherished eachother...dispite in the type of neighborhood they lived in....her mind still trailed back to whatever was in that box.....what she had seen...Her eyes lowered slightly as she watched the boy down the hill...jump upwards into the air...extend both arms and caught the ball before landing on their feet.

A breath of air left her lips as  the nervous girl exhaled and began walking along the path...the people whom passed her by...looked at her and later went back on their way....was it because of what she was wearing....her gaze slowly looked down and she noticed slight dry blood..."mm..." her gaze looked back on the path ahead of her as she assumed it came from the box that was pressed against her form....her body slowly shivered....They felt that she should of left before they opened up the box...they were not staying...as she assumed when she saw the suitcases....they were about to leave...before doing something they had to do within this getto of a town...no...mafia of a town...Her body slightly shivered as she continued along her path.....her ears twitching as she heard the yell of the man within the building....from a few yards away....the children stoped playing and looked in that direction...however she kept along her path remaining silent....

What...type of life....is this...to live...* - Thu Nov  5 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would enter the door to the bar and open it before closing the doorbehind her and walking down the stairs. Continueing her walk, she made her way into the hallway and later into the bar room where zen was washing her glasses. Taking a seat, on the stool, she placed her head in a box formed by her arms and later closed her eyes before falling asleep....the nervous girl began to drift away from her meditative world and into the world of reality....Zen would sigh softly before she placed the glass down and looking over to the other customers and serving them while her student took a nap of some sort. 

__Mind Scape Vision End__

The nervous girls eyes opened slowly as she raised up and stared at the forest ahead of her. A soft yawn would of left her lips as the sound of the waterfall echoed though her ears...the tree leafs from the trees would scatter along the ground before coming to a stop. The nervous girl would then raise up rather slowly as she yawned softly....her right hand raised to slightly cover her mouth before lowering her hands to her side...when she had calmed down with her yawning.....she loved the tranquility of this mountain because mostly no one ever comes here at all...she always had this area to herself more or less...Turning westwards...she began to walk over towards the grassy area next to the river because there was much more space incase she had messed up. The nervous girl was hoping to create another technique...and she hoped to start from now...

"mm..." 

They stared off in the direction of the cliff...their knees bended slightly...she was prepareing herself to being doing such a thing.* - Thu Nov  5 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to bend her knees slightly before kicking off her right foot. She would go into a spinning motion as aiming to rotate at a faster speed than she was accustom too....she trained her walking speed strength in her mindscape to unlock the mental barriers that were in her mind....going though each trial that her mentors had set out for her and now they were hopeing to develop a technique to use against people she could not handel with kicks and punches alone....the nervous girl was looking towards the future...not the past....she was predicting...and wondering...how far she will go with her current range or number of attacks so far......she had to get innovative...and prepared for what was to come. Her breathing slowed as she came to an abrumpt stop. Her mind spun and spun...but remained spantainus....as a person whom has no skill in ninjutsu...or genjutsu....and clumbsy in any way possible...she is just trying to strive to become something better at the moment...

"mm..."

A soft breath of air escaped her lips as her eyes lowered slightly....she felt she wasnt moving fast enough just yet...maybe she was lacking in speed....or mabe it was positioning....it was something she would have to find out later on when she had tried again. A nervous smile would form on her lips as both hands raised into the air and began punching aimlessly towards the path ahead of them...it was time to continue her training...in silence...and bliss.....that is before her friends deside to message her through messenger bird.* - Thu Nov  5 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin her travels to the village of suna once again....she was going to see how her friends were since they only stayed in that village for a few weeks at a time. Her walking speed was a rather slow one since they were heading to kohonoa and renting a cavern....she disliked doing so since she loved to walk though the forests and what not...but for now...she was going to take the traveling method that the others around the world had been used too....which was the cavern.  The nervous girl would continue along her way rather slowly listening to the forest creatures...tweet their lovely music as well. The wind suddenly blew, blowing her robes a bit before she suddenly began running forwards the rest of the way...jumping up within the air, she soon began traveling from tree to tree towards her destination which was the kohonoa gates...the traveler was excited...because she only had done the famous ninja tree travel...a few short times. With each lunching into the air, she would turn upside down and twist her body...both legs extended outwards and a spinning kick was formed before landing on her hands. Her elbows bent slightly before she suddenly pushed off of them back into the air, her right leg retracted before being launched forwards against a tree trunk. Crouching sideways on a tree she kicked off of it moments later towards a lower part of the other tree before traveling downwards....Upon landing, she turned and stood infront of the gate she was so eager to arrive at.

"mm....u-umm..."

Her calm emerald eyes trailed a bit all over the gate untill she finally had found the cavern person. They were the person whom gave caverns...but following that...there were also the gate guards which were talking to other travelers besides her self. The nervous smile she had unknowingly had slowly faded as the village's livelness echoed out into the forest...she always wanted to know how such a loud and bustling village had remained so quiet all this time... Almost as if there was some sort of noise nullifying object. Shaking her head a few times trying to get rid of that thought...it wasn't possible...right?...mmm...She began walking forwards towards the cavern person and later went into the cavern that was heading to Sunagakure..it was time to see the  clan girl that was so interested in her teaching.* - Fri Nov  6 18:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would currently be holding her honey bun with both her hands. Her calm emerald gaze was on kurt as she lowered her snack slowly downwards from her mouth and stoped when it was infront of her chest. "u-umm...this village...became...r-really..q-quiet lately....since the l-last time i-i was h-here..." She said this hesitently and curiously in an attempt to start up a conversation...she did not know if it was the right words to say...but still said them as the villagers and travellers similar to herself walked in and out of the village after being checked.....just passing glances at the figure wondering whom they were as they talked to a shinobi of this village.

She wondered what extactly he had gone through within the time she had been ontop of her mountain. It was then her gaze slowly went back onto Nina....she said nothing because of the shock she felt due to the tone of their voice...For now...the nervous girl decided to focus on Nina since she was teaching them....the questions she has for them could wait untill later...

Jumping up and down rather slowly and repeatedly, her arms dangled at her sides following the movement at the same tempo before turning sideways...their calm emeralds lowered slightly relaxing as her arms dangled within the air but controlably following the movement...After a few moments, she landed on the ground before moving forwards in a launch off the ground....her body twisted and her right leg was brought forwards aiming to slam against their rib cage.

It was then she noticed their hand being sent towards the nervous girls chest area. Her right hand that was already in position would have moved forwards to take hold of their jabbed hand as her foot had touched the ground. Pulling her self forwards, her left arm coiled inwards and her elbow stuck out aiming to slam it into their own chest area...if they could think of a way to get out of this attack....and so their brawl will continue.

The elbow attack was an offensive as well as defensive technique that when used right can serve as something powerful in the end.

When their right hand pulled backwards, her own left hand tilted downwards slightly horrizonally like clock before being sent forwards towards their neck like a karate chop....the nervous girl was not letting up just yet...meep * - Sat Nov  7 07:01:58 2015

"mm....u-umm....you f-fended me off w-well....but you must l-learn to e-exploit l-loop h-holes in m-most a-attacks and d-develop a w-way to c-counter when their m-movements s-suddenly c-change...you have have it s-set up b-before hand and n-not a-after........i w-wish to give you o-one more t-test before i d-decide to t-train y-you..."

" hit my arms and my leg....with e-each r-rotations...they would come back a-around....but d-do not be hit......when i f-feel you are r-reacting fast e-enough...i will e-end it...."

They would wait for them to begin, when her arms were hit...the other would come in the opposit direction.....on occasion her arm would lower to the ground and their leg would try to hit them as well....The female would await for them to begin the strikes..* - Sat Nov  7 16:06:24 2015

All of a sudden, her right arm bended upwards and they would notice their punch going right through thin air as the nervous girl continued their rotation with their other extended arm aiming to slam into whatever body part was avalable unless stoped somehow....mixing it up was always a good thing...it prevented against many types problications....mostly after a few more strikes from the log training exercise or test...they would call off this spar.* - Sat Nov  7 16:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: then...we w-will start with u-umm...d-dynamic e-entry - Sun Nov  8 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a nervous smile before speaking once more.

"t-take a few s-steps back and then r-run forwards and j-jump into the air....once your w-within the air, extend your leg and send it f-forth against my right h-hand....g-go on...try it out...." Her right hand would slowly raise up infront of her face with their palm facing them. A nod would then be give with as she motioned them with their other hand to take a few steps....get ready and then run towards her and do what she asked of them. The nervous girls hand would then lower to her side....their eyes lowered slightly.....her mind was on something else while they were training their new student...

"umm...g-good luck..."

she would say just before they had done so...it was time for her student to begin trying the new technique.* - Sun Nov  8 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would have taken the cavern once more all the way back to suna. The nervous girl seemed to have alot of dirt on her hands on their clothes. They wanted to see fujitora on tips on gardening since he said he was always a farmer...so they probably knew best in teaching the girl such a complicated art. So far she only was able to grow flowers...but did not grow fruit since she would not always be there to maintain it. The nervous girl continued inside as the guards allowed her to pass into the village...it seemed that she as an individual would always be let into the village it seems."mmm...." As the female walked through the village, they would look down at her attire wondering if it was ok to go traveling to this village in such casual attire rather than her usual....after all her house had just finished getting build and they were trying to decorate it in an attempt to make it look good for if she ever had visitors. 

Her calm emerald gaze drifted from left to right as they watched the villagers pass her by, each one stareing at them and wondering if they had seen them before....but most likey have not since she was not anything special...and still is not now....she was just a clumby unforgiving girl whom was just going to kill off her flowers just because they forgot to water them one day....As soon as the thought pass though her head, the nervous girl shook her head a few times getting rid of the thought before raising her eyes to get a good view of the square she was about to go into.,,,it was time to see if Fujitora was awake.* - Sun Nov  8 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) arrives in the sunagakure square, her clothes are covered in dirt as well as her face. They seemed to be doing alot of work somewhere. "u-umm...is f-fujitora a-awake"* - Sun Nov  8 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) upon seeing zenaki, a nervous smile would appare on her face. Their right hand raise to wave rather slowly towards them. Zenaki would notice the nervous girl had dirt covered all over their form staining their white kimono that she wore over her jump suit....it was her home clothes...a jumpsuit that hugged a little tight to her figure and a loose white kimono that she wore over them. They were complimented by her whitish black shoes.* - Sun Nov  8 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Damn, hocus pocus XD - Sun Nov  8 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) her nervous smile slowly faded away as she ran forwards slowly and  stoped when she was infront of them. They had thought it was all just a sarcasic joke when she heard zenaki saying that, but it seems her thoughts were wrong..their belly was big and growing...their skin pale...and they seemed very tired. She remeber her mother telling her about how they felt when they had her...it was one of those stories where they were tell her about how much pain their had...and the jokes about how her father acted like a idot...scared of what they should do.


"mmm....a-are...you o-ok?"

She asked as her hand extended to feel their belly. "s-so its t-true?"* - Sun Nov  8 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: u-umm...does it d-disturb you when you t-try? - Sun Nov  8 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Disturb me when I try?  - Sun Nov  8 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: so umm s-sleep - Sun Nov  8 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: to' - Sun Nov  8 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh yea... Kinda. I can't really lay down on my belly like I want to. Plus it's.. Just in the way.. Plus some other events around like surgery's I have to do and such. Makes me exhausted. - Sun Nov  8 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: t-they make y-you do s-surgery? - Sun Nov  8 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: isnt there a-any else...c-capable of s-such a thing? - Sun Nov  8 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: There is nobody else for as far as I know.  - Sun Nov  8 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: w-what about b-bryson? - Sun Nov  8 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I don't know if he is skilled enough yet. Perhaps he is. But then he didn't tell me yet. - Sun Nov  8 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would allow a soft breath of air to escape her lips as both hands were raised into a cross under her chest area. The nervous girl's eyes lowered slightly in disbelif that a priest would allow their pregenant sister whom know they is extreamly tied, do the surgery on their own. They have been studying in the medical field, she they should of been had some skill i the art.  "mm..." A soft sound left her lips as her calm emerald eyes lowered to stare at the body.

"c-can i help...m-maybe if you h-had someone m-massage your s-shoulders...you w-will have l-less s-stress..."

her gaze looked up towards the taller pregnant women and gave them a small smile. She wanted to help out her friend in any way she could.* - Sun Nov  8 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hello Yan. - Sun Nov  8 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How are ya, Lera? It's good to see you back... - Sun Nov  8 16:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, I'm doing good. I am a little hung over from a night of drinking but I enjoyed myself. - Sun Nov  8 16:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh there you are Yan. - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hey Chikyu. - Sun Nov  8 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You and me both. - Sun Nov  8 16:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't see why not. Everyone watches spars. - Sun Nov  8 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would hear them say master once more.  She was about to speak soon afterwards about it."a-..." She was about to speak towards them about the word she felt being miss-used....they were unsure if this was the way they wanted things to be..ever since the first time they used the word master around her and refering to fujitora...they felt off in most to every way possible. Zenaki just did not seem like to person to love someone that much in that way to her....then again...she has not seen them in a long time and only on occasion so they never really decided to think...much less say anything about it. Shaking her head a little getting rid of the thoughts she had, they spoke once more.

"u-umm have you s-seen f-fujitora...i wanted t-tips on g-gardening...and you s-should rest m-more.."

She asked a bit curiously before finishing her sentence in a worried tone. Even if their master had taken care of them, there were also times when they were not there....she just hopes that they will be alright when that time happens..* - Sun Nov  8 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I won't be showing anything particularly secret...not that I really have anything. heh. - Sun Nov  8 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: o-oh...thats right - Sun Nov  8 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would sit down in a meditative position before giving them a nervous smile.* - Sun Nov  8 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) whispers: u-umm - Sun Nov  8 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) whispers: i have a m-mansion to the e-east of k-kohonoa....  - Sun Nov  8 17:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: Well I guess I'm just a shadow to them now. - Sun Nov  8 17:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Kinda. - Sun Nov  8 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: A-Are they ignoring her because of me? - Sun Nov  8 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would raise up her right hand to slightly cover her mouth as a soft laughter left her lips. 

"k-kinda..mm?"

They would say as her hand lower to her lap and they continued their words in a whisper.* - Sun Nov  8 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) whispers: ...w-well...my h-house is r-right next...to t-that to the l-left - Sun Nov  8 17:21:55 2015
