She was heading back to the village when she had looked over towards her right to see an amry passing besides her. The nervous girl remained quiet as she looked up towards the men whom walked past her towards their destination that was sunagakure. It seemed that they were going to war with sunagakure for whatever reason that she was unsure of and so her movements suddenly stoped. "mm..." She would blink once mroe continueing her walk westwards along side the army but at a distance if there was one since she did not want to be lumped up together with them. Her walk was a slow one as she began to train, they began runing forwards before begining to send multiple punches followed by kicked with each foot that was placed on the ground, the nervous girl was propelled forwards in a slight blur continueing her onslot of attacks.

The army of soilders would watch her train and form a small smile at her efforts. It was something to pass the time for them since they had nothing to do other than stare at the endless desert. When she had reached the gates of sunagakure, the nervous girl would of came to a stop before later walking inside with a nervous smile on her face. She was breathing inwards and outwards rather heavily before a hand raised to be placed on her chest afterwards. SHe had calmed down herself a bit before lowering her hands to her sides and entering the village past the gaurds whom let her through. It seemed that she was going to spend a little bit more time within sunagakure and probably even stay long enough to see zenaki again before her next leave.

She was about to head back to her previous location but was stopped and a purple messenger bird flew in and rested on her head. When she had read the note, it was from one of her close friends katsune. A nervous smile had formed on her face at that time as she read the note feeling a bit happy that she had still remebered them. And so they turned around and began to head back to this location which was sunagakure and here she was now.

She felt that the durability was going to get to them one day, but did not think it would have been so soon. Eyes must have been on them and that must have been true since they always went around parading their strength.  She remained silent as her right hand raised slowly and under her hat and was later placed as a cover her hair. She had left kumogakure because she wanted the silence, but she had probably stayed away for too long as they got attacked soon afterwards. A soft breath of air escaped the nervous girls lips. The kumogakure kage instigated a war, or was it something else....all this seemed too unreal..she lost her first student just because she wasent there at that moment and time.
"mm..."Her hand went back to her side and a small smile formed. "o-oh...i see..." she went on her defencive reflex that kept her from feeling sad in public...a defect in which was prepare when she was under zetsumo's rule."h-hes...dead.." A single tear began to roll down her right eye and later down her cheek. "i...understand..." She said not really knowing if she was crying or not, her mind lost to wonder if she had done the right thing or not as she continued speaking unconciously. "i-im...glad y-you survived..." She said as her consealed gaze looked over towards kuro. 

"il...be g-going n-now.."

She would say as she began walking southwards, she wanted to do something to loosen the thoughts she had in her head and rearange them. They  did not want to feel the anger and anguish but most of all the dissapointment they had in themselfs for not being at her students side when they had needed her the most.

Her body shook greatly as a large whirlwind began to surround the nervous girls form expanding ourwards causing a cool breeze to be blown around the area. This was all to unreal, almost like a joke. The purple bird that was on her head would hop down and rest on her lap before looking up towards them before resing in her lap. A soft breath escaped her lips as she closed her eyes,  She began to drift off into her meditative world while her ears began to blur out the world around her. They wanted to forget and she usually had done so by training and so shebegan to make her way to lady zen.

___Mind Scape___

The nervous girl would awaken in her bed. Upon raising up , her right hand raised to cover her mouth as they yawned softly. Getting out of bed, she walked to the bathroom, brushed her teeth slowly as she couldn't believe that maloth of all people had died just like that. It was the type of thing to really get a person killed when lied about and killing wasnt a new thing to her. She had done the deed to many soilders in a war by just hitting them with her tajutsu, hwoever, she hopefully wished she could continue with her training in hopes of getting stronger. Spitting out the tooth paste into the sink, the nervous girl washed her mouth and changed into bartender clothes that was hung up in the closet. Upon exiting the room, she began walking slowly towards the bar before taking a seat infront of Zen whom was washing a glass.

"morning, you seem wide awake...even after sleeping for the past few days...something up?" 

Her mentor asked curiously. The nervous girl only nodded her calm emerald eyes lowered slightly. It seems that she was not feeling well today. "u-umm..have you e-ever lost a s-student b-before." Their movements suddenly stoped as their hands placed the glass carefully onto the counter.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would slide the scroll into her sleve before giveing them a small smile. She was glad they were still thinking of them even when she was away elsewhere in her own silence and solitude within the forests or desert.  A soft breathe of air would escape her lip as she spoke once more, " u-umm...il be g-going now....i was a-also doing s-something." The nervous girl would say before turning westwards and walking off.  

She seemed to be thinking about something important to them, more important that this scroll if anything. She was not one to care about techniques in a way at the moment, but would accept in learning something if her friends or mentors intervined. * - Thu Oct 29 04:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would arrive at the pile or rocks as she undid her scroll and began reading it though. The words slowly began to change into a lack luster of different tesnsions and non the less all let to the same thing. It was just targetting the body with kicks, but very quickly at numerous locations to give the enemy less time to react. The nervous girl would nod rather slowly to herself as she began kicking the rock in different locations at a blurred splled with both arms raised up half way to keep her balance. With each rotation of maybe five to six kickes, she would switch legs with the twist of her body and try once more. The nervous girl was used to kicking so this would not be much of a problem, but it actually had been....this trained to be strainous as she only did one kick and two kicks and her spinning usually gave her their speed...a nervous smile would oon appear on the womens lips as she continued her onslot on attacks in hope of mastering this technique.

"mm..."

Her mind soon began to drift away towards her inner most thoughts as her kicks were sent towards the boulder. She remebered the other day when she had asked  Zen if she had lost a student before too and she had replyed yes...that they had messed up on their training and just died just like that, but it was under Roses rule so they had not mett them yet....They would not know the feeling now would they...but she felt like they did since they were within the town that was this bad and having this bar as a stress releaver was a good thing.  The strange thing about bars is that it always soothed your mind no matter how troubled you were and were going to be. A true blessing on its own part, but then there are people whom abuse that fact and over do it. My mother called those drunkards and what not when she saw them on the street and i was curious enough to ask.  

* - Thu Oct 29 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was now surely lost in her thoughts of her mother and father. During summer, it was fun as she had watermelon...there was always this small spoon they gave me to eat it with which made it a very enjoyable experience.  Yes, maybe she was feeling a bit home sick at the moment which was why she had felt this way, maybe greatly felt this way.  Tell tell the truth, she felt like they wanted her to stay within the village...katsune that is....this scroll made it take longer for her to leave the village than it usually would have. It was an uncommon feeling that the nervous girl was not used to...since she always left after a while when maloth invited her to kumogakure. The speeding kicks she had been making slowly to a stop as her hand raised and was plater placed on her chest. The thought of her student making her heart ache when thought of. The male had died when in kumo and she could not do anything to get them back...just like zetsumo...she could of been there to save her friend from dieing...or even captured long ago if she had been with them...or left with them when they were either captured or taken away.

Their teeth clenched slightly and her fists tightened pulling back her right, she would punch the rock once more releaving the feelings she felt within herself causing pieces of it to sprinkle onto the ground. The wind blew slowly surrounding her form as her calm eyes began to change from an emerald green color to a pure yellow one.Their hair however changed from a black color to a pure white one. Activating level two of her gates,  her hair began to slowly float within the air like she was with in water. Their right hand changed into a fist as it was extended backwards before being sent forwards towards the rock stature infront of them which hit against the rock stature breaking some of it before foring a twist in her body and leaning backwards. Her right foot raised upwards before being sent towards the rock in a blured motion five or six times before changing feet.* - Thu Oct 29 14:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) breathing was slow..calm and regulated. Her heart felt heavy and lost....their mind a bit frezzy as her world began spinning. and spinning and growing dark. Her kicks continueing unconcously and each rotation even faster than the last. Their calm pure yellow eyes slowly growing dull as they went into their mindscape as her head ached.

The next place the nervous girl ended up was back within zens bar, she saw rose and kyo sitting besides her...the exact spot she fell asleep at which was at the bar counter. This must have happened after zen went out to eat...oh dear...she must of caused them trouble if they had come back in time or quickly enough. They seemed to be staring at her before a single hand from each of them was placed on her shoulder before pulled her outside. " still a weakling i see..." said rose in her usual annoyed tone before kyo intervined speaking" hey now...dont say that to my little flower bud...she will blossom soon~" They left me in wonder as they both suddenly stopped when zen appeared infront of them in the middle of the street with a few shopping bags within their hands. 

All three teachers looked at each other before zen broke the silence by sighing softly. "what do ya want?" shootings were heard around the area as she spoke. "just need...to see her level of strength...need to make sure this pervert did his job right..." rose stated pointing at kyo before kyo himself gave an innocent expression.  Zen just touched her temples before motioning them back inside towards her sparing arena...there was no use in sparing in a place like this where you can just get shot from behind. They all walked inside and later down stares towards their sparing area.  Kyo and Rose stood a bit away from Paine in a way of keeping their distance from her. Zen remained a bit away sitting in a chair next to a table...her legs crossed as they seemed to be interested in what was going to happen next.

"alright....clean fight and what not....begin.." 

The tall young women clapped her hands. Kyo and Rose VS Paine had commenced. All three people charged at eachother. When they were all at striking distance, The area began shaking as speedy puches were thrown towards each opponent with swift speed and calculation. Each punch followed by kicks....each move more strainous than the last. It seemed as if it was getting serious now.  Wind began to exhale around the area as she began training in her mindscapes with her two previous teachers.

__Mind Scape Vision End__

The nervous girl would be kicking to rock practicing the move that katsune had given her the scroll for, she seemed to be rather trying to master it rather than learn it. It proved strainous to the legs for beginners, however if the person trained long enough in the art, they sould master it soon...hehehe

_mind scape vision__

The phone in the room suddenly rang and a hand raised to pause the spar. Wind that blew outwards from the two kicks to the nervous girls side were blocked by her arms. The nervous girl seemed to be breathing heavily as she watched a hand that was next to her stomach and the other at the back of her neck. The nervous girl closed her eyes in releaf as she was greatfull that someone had called her in the real world before she had taken a few hits, painful hits. She was currently sweating slightly as she walked over towards Zen and took the phone. Placing it at her ears, she heard the word ' Greetings ' echo thoughout the room. It was a voice she had not heard before and in turn placed the phone on the hook before making her way towards the exit after waying a goodbye towards her mentors. 

Entering her bedroom, she lossened the neck of her female version of a tuxsudo and allowed a soft breath of air to escape her lips. The nervous girl fell downwards and landed on her bed. Closing her eyes, she began to drift off and out of her mind scape and into reality.

__Mind Scape Vision End__

The nervous girls kicks came to a stop as she looked towards Orthor. It was them whom called her out..wasent it. Paine currently had pure yellow eyes and pure white hair that levatated  slightly like she was under water. A nervous smile would of been given to them as a greeting as she walked forwards besides the rock. She did not apply enough strenght to breat it, but it it was cracked quite a bit.* - Thu Oct 29 16:17:04 2015
