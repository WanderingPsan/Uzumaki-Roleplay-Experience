The girl stared in silence in her boxing stance....her right hand infront of her left...her left foot infront her her right...knees bent slightly to give way to an effective evade. A soft breath left her lips as she began moving from side to side slowly at first....gradually getting faster and faster while sending punch after punch towards the ocean infront of her. Each punch swiftly being retracted before being send outwards continueing the motion. Her memories remained intact...but her feelings remained the same after that spar...it was just what zetsumo had said...what he had preeched all along...she needed to become faster...Her emerald eyes began to grow dull as they began to sink into their thoughts...going into their mind zone as her physical body kept on doing its movements now moving in blurs...

The consealed figure was focused...

--Mind Scape Vision-

Paine woke up in the shrine...the pure white bunny with yellow eyes was infront of her as her pet...Kyo walked in yawning softly with a book in their hand..his gaze slowly went onto paine noticing them suddenly giving the rabbit they picked up along the road a small smile. "eh...you sure you wanna keep that thing?" She spoke akwardly raising an eyebrow....Paine would suddenly look back towards them giving them with a nervious smile as her eyes seemingly closed. THe rabbit would be trying to climb up and would later rest on the nervious girls head.

"mmm...?"


"a-ah...never mind" they said scratching their head and walking towards a different room in a shrine. The old man always did have a odd way of saying things at times...but why wernt they training yet...was something happening at the moment.....and so curiousy grew in the girls mind. Standing up from her sitting position...she continued towards the location of her teacher.

Paine walked slowly along the halls of the shine before steping outside. Her calm eyes suddenly widened as her faced showed a slightly shocked expression...there...were so much people coming to pray to the shrine...many people...different shapes and sizes...walking up to pray to a statue of a god to whom they worshiped....no it was not a statue...but to the god above in which us of that time knew. Paines face returned to a neutral expression of a small smile towards the children whom looked in her direction...however...they senced a gloomy sensation about her and just smiled nerviously towards the emerald eyed women that stood before them with a cat ontop of their head.

"u-umm...hi.."

A hand would then raise to wave to them and they waved back before running off to play with their friends...Her gaze then shifted slowly over towards kyo whom was point towards the room infront of them before entering probably signaling her to follow along and that she did. After a few minutes...she was met with rather large sparing mat that just remained in the middle of the room...

were...they going to spar...?

Kyo would stare down at paine with a slight lazish smile. " yep im sopost to be teachin ya...so were gonna spar...alright?" Paine would nod and kyo would begin his walk along the matt. When they were at a distance, they spun around and was in no stance. A hand raised motioning them to come at them with all they got and yes...paine complied greatly. She ran forwards and sent only punches towards kyo whom blocked and returned his own following the flow with ease. Rose had shown signs of struggle after a while...but maybe kyo was different...the bunny on her head had remained in place watching what was happening and was in the hoody that she wore nowadays...

It was rather cold ontop of a mountain, so she had worn a sweater-jacket that had a hoodie as well. She aimed to quicken her punches like she was doing in reality and felt herself in the real world beinging to feel tired as she was doing this in this world that she had free access to when they decided to train...

"mmphha!"

Paine painfully took a jab to the stomach being sent back skidding before coming to a stop on droping on one knee. Kyo sighed before going into a crouching position. " hey....stay focused....im trying to teach you about focus...you think to much during a fight meaning you elt your mind wonder a bit too much...clear that membrain of yours and come at me again..." Paine blinked a few times before nodding..she had to stay focused...she could do this.....

The onslot of punches went on and their bodies began moving as slight blurs. When she was with rose..she had been a bit slower...but now she was able to do this with kyo....have she really come that far....* - Thu Sep 17 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

kyo suddently pivoted backwards escaping the range of her punch and landed raising up both hands in deffence. "hey hey...were done...and you did rather horribly..." Paine suddenly rose up straight blinking a few times....they were joking right...yes...they had to be joking....she had just began sparing them and now he wanted to take a break..Paines head tilted slightly to the right while her bunny crawled up and looked over her shoulder..she was confused.."b-but" Kyo would walk forwards as she was about to speak her own opinion on why they ended the spar early before placing a finger infront of her lips...."listen...theres an old saying....you may love a snacks thats good for you....but to much of it could make you sick..now go rest" 

They said this lazily with their voice going gradually slightly higer before going back down one or two times between love  and sick. Paine would nod before laying down on the mat and closing her eyes going back into the worlds of reality. Kyo would look down at the child with a blank stare.."not...here you..baka..." A smail formed from his lips as picked up the sleeping girl and went to place her in her bed. 

__Mind Scape Vision End__

Paine suddenly stoped moving and stood in a straight position. Her eyes returned from its pale color. She happened to be breathing inwards and outwards slowly with slight difficulty. This was what it was going to be like untill she mastered sending her punches forward with percision. Shaking her hands, she began to make her way to the others....it was time for them to rest a bit like kyo had asked herself..."mmm..."* - Thu Sep 17 00:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would appear in her usual spot. Both arms raised into fist being held infront of her form. Her legs spaced out a bit while her knees bended slightly. Her calm emerald eyes showed her determination while her face remained expressionless. It was time to train once more and so she did as they began jumping up slightly above the ground before landing Her hair flew upwards slowly before flowing downwards following her body movements.....a soft breath of air escaped her lips as well as inhaling back that air as she jumped back up into the air. Her hands seemed to be slightly loose following the rythme as well. She was about to start training with her punches as she wanted those to be as fast as her kicks were.

Her right fist was sent forwards in a blured motion before retracting swiftly and her other fist was then sent forwards before retracting as well with percision. Each motion she made had been when she was on the ground as that was when she had decided was the best time to make the punches since they were more stablized at that time...the young girl was training her body so she would not unconciously sent a punch while in the air and more so on the ground untill later in her training.

The sound of air being cut though by an object would be heard coming from the concealed figures direction....the training she wanted to continue...had begun.......* - Fri Sep 18 12:12:22 2015

Her body twisted and twisted...from left to right before suddeny slight pivoted backwards and swifting her feet so the other could be infront instead of the last.

had ventrued towards the depths of their mind and woke up resting in a bed. She sat up to kyo passing by her room and heading towards his own. It was almost like he had already eatten and was going to do his own thing. You see...kyo was rather a laid back type of person...always going about things slowly...reading books and rather was replled to doing physic-.....well...she couldent really say that part yet since she had only been here a day and that was all she could gather for now. Raising up into a standing position, she began walking towards the door while wiping her eyes with her right hand slowly. Stoping by the door, she saw kids running down the hallway back and forth playing some sort of game...was it tag...no...it was something else but she was a bit to tired to make wind of it...umm hide and seek she guessed since there was counting to be heard in the distance.

"mmm?"

Boh hands rested in her black hoodie's pockes as she began walking along the hallway of the eastern section of the shrine. Her white sunday dress that she wore while in her mindscape along with a hoodie would flow back and forth as she continued along the path....the sound of counting that started from eight...why was the number that they started from eight....wasent it usually ten. Hearing the counting reach the number three, a hand was placed on the edge of the door as she saw a small girl with black hair and red eyes when they had turned around when they finished counting.

"o-oh..."

They would both stare at eachother for a moment.* - Fri Sep 18 14:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Any one intrested in some tea? - Fri Sep 18 14:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: I'll drink sake.  - Fri Sep 18 14:41:42 2015

The both of them stared at each other for a moment. The little girl seemed to be stareing at something else and not directly at paine herself which was something she did not noticed just yet untill they felt movements ontop of their head. looking up with her eyes, there was a white rabbit ontop of her head. This white rabit seemed to have made her head their home. Her calm emerald gaze then rested back on the girl as they picked up the rabbit and went into a crouching position. A nervious smile was then given to the small girl.

"u-umm.."

Her face then grew expressionless for a moment as she looked down towards the bunny before looking back up towards them and pushing the bunny slightly forward. Did they want to play with it?....paine did not know...but when the girl ran up and picked up the bunny before hugging it. Paine would blink a few times and her face remained expressionless...if she had seen the bunny the day before when she had fallen asleep...would she of taken it as well...mmm...Kyo would be walking back along the halls and would notice a crouched down paine and a little girl hugging a bunny. They held the rolled up news paper hit it softly against his own shoulder, his free hand took paine by her hoodie and began dragging them off into a direction. 

"come on paine...we got work to do~"

He said this lazily as they dragged her and paine blinking a few times watch the little girl whom seemed to be curious before looking down at the bunny she had just obtained and began playing with it. Paine would then look up to Kyo

"u-umm.."* - Fri Sep 18 14:57:04 2015

She would end up being dragged slowly away towards the front of the shrine. The gate as well as the stairs leading up to this place was infront of them while the building itself was behind them. Feeling kyo let go of her hood, she stood up and looked down to dust the dust off her clothing. Kyo sent his arm that held the roll of newspaper at the gate before speaking up. "you see that...no...to the left..no a bit t- yes..right there. Pick that up then follow me inside" Paine would look up stareing at the pack of books that was infront of the gate, she would look up at kyo curiously and they would show her a slightky akward smile. Couldent he of gotten this himself...but felt that there was a reason for it as her teachers always had a certain way of teaching her. For rose it was sparing twenty four seven when she had come home from work and for kyo..it was....

"u-umm sure"

She would begin to walk towards the pile of books rather easily but something was wrong. It felt very heavy, she rather could not pick it up without struggle. Once she had a stable grip on the book, she began to walk slowly with a few stummbles over towards the older man whom walked infront of her proudly with his arms swaying from side to side like a marching man. 

"and one and two and three and one!!!!!...whos gonna walk we are!!!"

It was then the children and the shine madains began to follow behind them walking while paine lagged behind listening to kyo's wrords. Kyo looked behind to paine whom had anime comedic white circles as eyes. They spoke in a joyful tone with a hudge comedic smile and seemingly closed eyes.

"come on paine dont lag behind!!!"

They said in a joyfull tone.* - Fri Sep 18 15:24:22 2015
