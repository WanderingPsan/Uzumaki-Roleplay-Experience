Now they were walking down the path that led to the village gate to see if they were by the clothing shop....that was...also a populated area at times. Suddenly stoping as she saw Erebus, she held a face of no expression for a moment before giving them a nervious smile before speaking once more.

"u-umm...i-i got your s-scoll...b-but w-what did they d-do?"

she said reaching into her pocket and taking out the scroll she had recieved. The figure would stare at it for a moment before holding it out for them to take...she was rather curious.* - Mon Sep 28 22:18:27 2015

"b-but yo-"

she was about to say before suddenly stoping at the sound of his voice. Her hands would suddenly lower to her sides before giving them a small smile...they should have known better...she would always hear their words since he had listened to hers.

"u-umm..i would l-love to hear...i-im usually given...t-the short r-reason at t--times....."* - Mon Sep 28 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nods before seemingly closing her eyes. She breathe inwards and later exhaled the air she had deep within. The leafs of the trees would slowly fall surrounding her form as she began shaking her arms slowly before coming to a stop.

"mmm....i-i think...i-i think i am having a n-nice day.....my m-meditation was p-peacefull.."

she would say wather nervously with a hint of joy in her voice.* - Mon Sep 28 23:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) , after she had said this, the nervous girl ran forwards and stopped on her right foot. The upper part of her body would of been seen twisting  as her left foot raised into the air, her leg came around circleing in a rotation aiming to strike their right rib cage.

If she was successfull or not, they would pivote backwards and land where she was before they moved. 

"u-um...f-first s-show me you can d-do this. first..."* - Tue Sep 29 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would look downwards blinking for a moment as she watched them topple over and was now on the ground. A nervious smile appared on her lips as she nodded rather slowly to herself before speaking. "t-that is a r-round house kick....o-once your b-body g-gets used to this...o-or you c-can naturally b-balance your body weight w-while doing the k-kick....w-we can m-move onto part t-two...."

A had would motion them to raise up from their laid down position. "u-umm...p-practice makes p-perfect...s-so dont g-give up...j-just because it is d-difficult" she said nerviously...the girl had trouble and would trip on her left or right foot before falling onto the ground...but now she was proficent in using the skill. She was sure maloth would have more success than she would at using this skill. Dispite the way they spoke or thought...she believed that they had a brighter future in taijutsu than she herself.....the people whom were around just...umm dident see it yet..* - Tue Sep 29 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) 
The figure would stand still with her expressionless face. Both her arms raised and went into a cross over her cross under her chest area before begining to rub her arms. She was focused on her students development as a soft breath of air left her lips and like that...an hour had past with her expression unchanging...her movements paused as they finally made the kick properly. She nodded rather slowly.

"y-yess...t-the wind f-felt right  as y-your foot p-passed......now o-on to s-step two.....f-follow the movement o-of the spin...s-so t-there is no p-pause in t-transition...l-like this..."

Wiggling her body as her hand rested at her sides, her body remained motionless for a moment as her knees bended slightly. Pushing off her right foot, they were brought into a spinning motion and their right leg raised.....extended outwards sending a round house kick towards the air infront of her. This was when things may have seemed strange to maloth....her right leg landed on the ground where the spin should have ended...but no...it continued on for an extra rotation. 

The nervous girls body lowered quickly into a crouching position as her right leg slid along the ground  in a circular motion towards the ankles of her invisable oponent. Coming to a stop...ending the second step to her combo, she looked up to them with a nervous smile as they stood or raised up.

"t-this is called a l-leg sweep....t-try doing t-the...same  as....i-ive..just done.....after the k-kick you just l-learned...."* - Tue Sep 29 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they moved back and went into their stance. Yes it was a stance once again...she had seen so many people use them...but she never did understand the uses of which they provided. When they came towards her with a leg sweep, everything seemed as if it was in slow motion to her. His leg came in and she jumped upwards and over his leg before coming down to the ground....yes...the nervious girl was not going to let him have his way....she was a stern teacher....and a serious one too.....yes...this would happen.....

But...

When she took an extra step to jump, she ended up stepping on her robe causing her to fall forwards before her ankles was met with her students foot. She would then fall over towards the side on the ground face first. Her body seemed to be motionless...oh dear....* - Tue Sep 29 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hahah. Think need practice move. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: What do now? - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be helped up to her feet by maloth and an anime styled comedic eyes was seen as her hat tilted backwards a bit. A nervious smile was given and her body would be wobbling from back to forth slowly before shaking her head regaining her sences when she heard the question 'what do now?'.  

"mmm..."

she raised up a hand as she wabbled a bit before going into a slight crouched position. Pushing forward off her feet, her body twisted in a spin and her right leg extended outwards as a leg sweep was sent towards the air infront of her before lowering into a crouching position during the second rotation before suddenly stoping with her right leg completely behind her body.....on the balls of her toes.

"u-umm...a-after the l-leg s-sweep...your p-push off your feet a-and launch y-yourself into t-the air....a-and do a s-spin k-kick..l-like so..." 

Pushing off into the air, her body twisted in the air and her right leg was extended outwards as a blur before landing on her feet.  

"c-can you d-do this....i-it is the l-last step for t-this technique.."* - Tue Sep 29 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod giving them a small smile before speaking.

"y-yes...you did did well...l-lets s-stop for today...w-when you come back...i-i wish for you to d-do each step f-faster.....the s-speed you move a-at now will give y-your o-opponent t-time to rest......i-its best to give t-them no time t-to breathe..."

Both arms would raise to hold her shoulder as she rubbed them slowly. "mmm..t-thats all for t-today....s-shall we c-continue t-tomorrow?"* - Tue Sep 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Hey Maloth. - Tue Sep 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would suddenly be hugged, she would begin to be shaken around before suddenly resting back on her feet. Blinking a few times  with her gaze still on them, she would nerviously smile. "y-yes...you will become...m-much...m-much stronger as t-time goes o-on....t-trust me.." she would nod rather slowly agreeing with her own words...she just hoped that she herself would be able to live long enough to see them grow into such a character...or such a beast.

"a-also....n-no problem..i dont m-mind..n-not one bit.."

Her hands would lower to her sides remaining motionless with her nervious smile reappareing as she finished her second set of words.* - Tue Sep 29 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) standing up from her seat, she began to walk towards the exit.* - Thu Oct  1 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would enter the path towards  training area slowly at her own pace. The pathway of trees had stood besides her on each side and slowly allowed their leaves to fall around her form guilded by the soft breeze of wind.  Her calm emerald eyes closed as she breathe inwards rather slowly before exhaling taking in the clean breeze that had been given to paine by the gods above. Her  body shook slightly as her eyes opened slightly...head tilted down a little...she seemed...sad and depressed....thinking...about what exactly katsune or kilm had done to betray their trust...there...must of been a reason..yes....or...were they just on edge....so on edge that they could not trust the shinobi whom appointed them head of the village....then again...as usual...she only had half the story...so she could not make any assumptions.....but only able to watch silently....and egarly awaiting an answer.

"mmm..."

Her thoughts paused for a moment before shaking her head and sighing softly. ...she did not want to get involved anymore....but felt her curiosity was pulling her back in. As her walk finished upon entery of the training area...she spoted Maloth doing his training only before giving off a nervious smile and continueing her walk towards them and later next to them. He had begun work on his physical aspect of his body's training....and from the sweat he was working up...it seemed like they were doing this for a rather long whole before she got here. Giving a nervous smile as they stopped on their own accord, she would begin to speak. " u-umm...spar..?"she would ask curiously....its what she usually had thought they ment when they said the words train and fight in the same sentence....but she would proably wait untill they had finished resting up before doing any actually hand ot hand combat with them.....as for the odar...she was usually sparing with the soldiers when zetsumo was alive...getting them into shape because they were normal like her...not using jutsu...but her own hands to help herself get stronger....to push herself though all the struggle and pain she felt at the the time...and even now.....a new form of pain was forming...

Paine would sit in a meditative position before turning her head to face maloth. Her nervious smile suddenly slowly faded away into a face of no expression as they spoke once more. "y-you....should r-reast first.." she would say with a few pauses before looking back and facing the path infront of her......breathing soft and slow...hair shifting slightly with each movement maloth made since they were loud.....she felt focused at the moment in her own world....

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would hear her students cry for more techniques to be learned as she watched them approch her. Her expression changed in to a sudden nervious smile. She had been watching them train before raising up from her seat rather slowly as they watched them return to doing their push ups. " u-umm....show me y-your kicks...b-but do not do them on myself....but towards the a-air infront of you."  When her words came to a stop, she took a few steps back before coming to a stop and her face suddenly held no expression once more....her mind on something completely different...but body motioning them to use the skill whenever they deemed they were ready for its usage seeing they had no need of resting just yet....their will seemingly able to push them towards their limits...and possibly byond.


"mm...o-or...your t-to tired...to do the k-kick....i-im sorry for a-asking of s-something so d-difficult.."

She would say giving a weakish nervious smile. Her hands raised slightly as she began wiggling them...they felt a bit stiff..but she felt fine in terms of teaching.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would lean the upper part of her body backwards slightly allowing the foot to pass by infront of her face before raising up her right foot and sending it forwards towards his rotated leg. A soft Gust of wind would be seen expelling around them before coming to a slow and steady stop. Her nervous smile stayed on her face as she spoke once more. " n-not...on me....t-turn southwards......do your k-kicks again..."  Her right hand would suddenly point towards the fence south of them meaning that was the direction they had to face before lowering her hands to her side and speaking once more. "g-go on... s-stay in that same p-place...and do s-steps o-one through t-three...again...."

The nervious girl wasent looking for a fight at the moment...she was a bit tired. They wanted them to listen more carefully to what she says...dispite the mentality they have proven to show whenever people had seen them. Her smile suddenly slowly faded away leaving a face of no expression as her left hand raised to cover her mouth, a soft breath of air left her lips as they yawned before lowering her hand back to her sides. 

It was getting to be that time again...

"r-remeber...do not move...f-from that spot..."* - Thu Oct  1 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowy before raising up both her hands and clapping them together each time they had dont each skill. She however was not letting up and she would of noticed the kicks were more proficent and steady, but not as fast as she wanted it to be meaning that there was something wrong. It was probably his muscular body...but the will he is showing at the moment......because of this...she saw no excuse on them being slightly slowed...but only the technique almost not being used properly. She wanted to see these set of kicks mastered before attempting to help them make their reaction time and the speed of their attacks better....that was the only way they would beable to use her next technique...or it would be just useless when using it in a fight...


"f-faster..."

She clapped once more as she did for the past hour or two. Once they had done this rotation, her hands would slowly lower to her sides giving a nervious smile." y-you have done w-well...b-but the speed of your k-kicks...needs to be faster....y-you have d-done greatly s-so far......but the wind...does n-not sound right....you have done a-alight....but the b-breeze your k-kicks gave off...was not strong a-and c-confident...i hope...to see i-improvement...as ive seen today...the next t-time we t-train"

A nervious smile was given as she nodded in approval of his progress so far.* - Thu Oct  1 07:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would enter the training area before sitting down in a meditative position and closing her eye. The sounds around her would begin to become a blur, the winds that had blown though out the area would slightly not be felt as it did not bother her much at all...The nervious girl remained silent not wanting to disturb the person whom was across from them....her eyes slowly closing as  the nervious girl's breathing began to grow slower and slower....softer and softer......She was slowly drifting away back into her mind scape to continue her training...that she had done with kyo...her second teacher.

____Mind Scape Vision____

The childs eyes slowly opened  to see the ceiling before closing her eyes and opening them again. She felt heavy and couldent move her body much, her head turned slightly to see a small girl with black hair and red eyes sleeping next to them in her bed. The nervious girl held no expression for a few moments before suddenly nerviously smiling towards the girl that hugged clingingly to her form in their sleeping state.Her right hand slowly raised to rest upon her the girls head and softly ran her fingers through her hair.....this was indeed...something she did occasionally whenever she entered her mindscape...they would strangely find this girl sleeping next to her...after a while, she had gotten to know their name...it was Chi...or that was what the people around the area had called them..however...paine never pressed them to reveal their true name...since they were not that type of person. 

"mm..."

A soft voice left her lips as her right hand was soon removed  from the little girls hair. Slowly and carefully slipping out of chi's grasp, she recovered them in her covers and began to walk towards her rooms exit with her pure white bunny following behind her. The door closed behind her and she looked down the shine's slightly long hallway before deciding to walk down the path towards the training area. The laughter of children was heard on the outside and in most places of the shrine while others were quiet...each step she took, there was a slight creeking noise on the wooden floor boards.......the atmosphere of her training area felt...rather alive...

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hello - Sat Oct  3 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be meditating as usual before being tackled by maloth in a playfull manner. Truthfully, she had been on the ledge of the mountain when she saw something red forming over the horrizon and stood up..beginning to climb farther upwards to see what exactly was over the horrizon. When the ball of chakra came and hit against the kage mansion, she began to move backwards and into the forest when the explosion had happened.

Everyone who had survived had moved to a different village probably, however she remainedsilentand unknown....not wanting to be seen...deciding to let her name fade away like a legend that is slowly forgotten over time.......Looking up towards Maloth from her downed position, a nervious smile was given towards the brute....it seems that there are somethings....that really cant be forgotten...and this was one them...

"h-hey.....how did y-you find...m-me.."* - Tue Oct  6 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink for a moment as she was now seated upon his shoulder. "u-umm....kumo....i was p-planning to s-stay here...." A nervious smile would form on her lips, she rather hated being around others in a village, she never really talked to them at all and they would go silent making it feel that when she was gone, they would converse as they would normally....they...did not want to distrub there way of life...by being there...so she was better off here...and alone...

"mm...i-im sorry..."

Her head slowly lifted upwards and over towards the left as she stared at the waterfall. She was proud of his development, but was a bit saddened that they wanted to be in kumo....she would still teach them when they came to visit, but was unsure of wheither they could do so as they seemed to require others...other than herself to speak with....or maybe she was wrong...mm...
* - Tue Oct  6 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) a few days to a week would of passed after maloth had went back to kumo. He seemed to decide to visit every once and a while to learn a technique while she herself remained here in peace listening to the sounds of the waterfall and the trees. SHe was meditating at the moment. The cloak she had been wearing was folded and placed besides her on the bridge. This was....the quiet and serenity she wanted for a while without all the fighting and what not and this made her rather happy. She felt free and the place was calm and aluring just how the forest should be....the sounds of the forest also made a nice tune in her ears...from the large rocks that the water crashed into...to the trees and the birds that made sounds in a rhyemic fashion. A small smile formed on the young girls face ...but slowly faded away as she remebered that she took a rather long break from her training since what had happened a few days ago.

"mm..."

She slowly nodded to herself before remaining completely silent and unmoveming which had ment no squrming and what not. Her breathing began to slow and slow before becoming almost non-existant while the sounds that happened around her became blurs or murmers. She was currently trainnig in her mind scape and would not hear maloth at the moment.* - Thu Oct  8 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be splashed with water and would fall backwards before turning to the side....both hands clutching her chest as she breathe inwards and outwards rather slowly untill she was breathing completely well. Her head shook from left to right rather quickly shaking off the water before coughing a few times  in the opposite direction of maloth. Her right hand was placed on bridge as she slowly pushed herself up into a standing position and turned to face maloth with a weakish nervious smile.

She only had herself to blame this time for going deep into her meditative state to start training again. She chose to rest for a while like her teacher had told her and was now about to start training again."u-umm..im a-awake" she said as they looked down at their clothes feeling a bit sad that i was wet now. Looking back up she would stare at maloth before shaking her self off and standing up straight.

"u-umm hi.."

An akwardish nervious smile would appare on her face.* - Thu Oct  8 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would blink for a moment as she thought about what to say. He was still covered with water and they never seemed to stop training. "u-umm....i train out h-here...where im n-not usually d-disturbed...."  As he spoke soon after stating why they were here, she would just nerviously smile before nod remaining completely silent as her emerald eyes lowered slightly as they went into a crouch and had done a leg sweep towards the bottom.  When they had taken a seat after they finished, she blinked at their gesture before walking over towards her student and sitting down next to them......maloth did not want to train but talk....mmm....who was this man and what has he done with her student.

"mm.....i-i dont...l-like being surrounded by l-large groups o-of people..."

Her feet would dange off the ledge kicking back and forth slowly. The sounds of the water fall ringing in her ears...she just wanted to forget about everything that happened. The feelings she felt when surrounded by the group of people around her...the feelings she felt when talking to people that judged her in more ways than one...the nice words they said...she did not feel it...the abyss that was in her heart always continued to grow ten fold but alass dimmed down when she was alone striving to get better in the only area she knew how to use...which was her taijutsu...however..that could only please so many....

"u-umm...do you...r-really need me a-at kumo.."

She said looking up towards them as the water that was on their form drowned down into the river below, a small smile was given.* - Thu Oct  8 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) smile would vanish slowly leaving an expressionless face. A nervious smile would then form as she nodded rather slowly before speaking. "t-then il...c-come....w-with you...w-when you leave....b-but a-after a few d-days i w-will return t-to this place" Looking away and over to her left, she reached for her cloak and began to put it on before reaching for her hat and putting that on as well. Her friend....she had heard katsune used that term....but it felt fake...or had some other meaning behind it. They never really talked before in an intimate way and did not know eachother like that...but the term friend was lossly thrown. 

Using both hands to straighten her hat, she sighed softly before lowering both hands down to her side. The figure then looked back up towards maloth and gave them a small smile. "d-dont w-worry....e-even if you carry m-me....im not s-sure your body//can take t-to many of m-my hits.." * - Thu Oct  8 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink  a few times before nodding with a small smile still apparent. Her right hand was then pulled backwards rather slowly before being extended forwards hitting maloth square in the chest. She wondered why people loved to show case their strength, but did not mind it since it was probably a guy type of thing.

"u-umm..."

Her calm emerald eyes just looked on to see if the punch actually brused them or not. She was unsure.* - Thu Oct  8 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) was picked up and would smile nerviously. She however did have to return here, her favorite white robe was here.

"l-lets go.."* - Thu Oct  8 16:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would walk up towards the group of people before coming to a complete stop. A nervious smile was given to them.* - Thu Oct  8 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bremusa(Ej247) says: We amazons are raised up on to be warroirs, how to hunt, how to well previde for our selfs. Though we all care very much for one another and when there is trouble we all fight to deffend and protet our home. - Thu Oct  8 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would currently have a faded smile as she watched maloth combat the gargole. It seemed maloth still suffered a bit in the damage area, but she could see them getting better and better as time went on...it was just something the both of them would have to work on probably...Reaching into her cloak, she pulled out a hot bowl of ramen almost as if she had prepared it for them to take. Her nervious smile slowly formed and later became slightly akward....she had indeed seen the entire thing happened and just stayed silent and keeping the bowl held up for them to take....she shall not lower the last bit of pride the manly barbaran had.

"mm..."

If the had taken it, she would then look over towards the gargole. Her left hand raised and slowly and visabily punched it aiming to hopefully break it....Her gaze then look back towards maloth wonding why they couldnt do it.

"u-umm...how is it.."

she said assuming they had taken the bowl and later began eating it. Hopely distracting them from her attempt of breaking it.* - Fri Oct  9 00:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would think for a moment. She could probably teach them something that would be helpful. The barbarian did not need to showcase a faster set of speed to use this but...instead needed to be able to send them upwards into the air. Running forwards, her dark cloak was aiding in the help as she suddenly vanished in a blur...but in all actuality, she  went into a crouching position. By the time they traced the blur, her left leg would be sent outwards and upwards into their stomach aiming to launch them into the air.

"mmm..."

This would of happened but she instantly stoped just before the foot connected with his stomach. They would feel a gust of wind blowing on their form as a pulled back and stood up straight before moving backwards in her step. Suddenly stoping, she gave them a nervious smile before speaking. "u-umm...w-working on r-running forwards l-like i did....t-then i-instantly go into a crouching p-osition....and s-send your right...or l-left leg into t-the air..."* - Fri Oct  9 01:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to follow behind maloth running and keeping pace. He seemed to be carrying Ambrocio...maybe they were friends...she loved seeing her student make friends....however deep down inside...the nervious girl wondered how it all worked. Hoever she continued running eastwards towards the leaf vilalge to escape the wrath that they all held and with the way the ninja whom were around had spoken...it seemed that everything was in a live or die situation since something had made the man seriously mad...almost as if they were urked. 

"mm..."

She shook her head and continued running as her speed quickened unconciously. They were off to the next village and hopefully able to teach her student seeing that they were atleast still alive to tell the tale....This must be the second time...she was invited somewhere and almost died in the process....this time...quicker than the last as it took a month for the last time to happen...non the less...she hopes that her future would be brighter...oh dear...

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nerviously smile as she took motioned the amazon to follow her. Assuming they accepted, she would begin to walk away to her secluded area.* - Fri Oct  9 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) looks over towards kumogakure seeing the sky turning red  as a large explosion had happened. An anime styled sweat drop would appear as a nervious smile was given.* - Fri Oct  9 02:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Bremusa(Ej247) says: Finally some water. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: y-you dont get w-water? - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would think for a moment.

it was true that those places did not have much water probably...but there should have been hot spings atleast. She heard that hotsprings usually had great attributes...and that the mountains had great narutal springs when she first entered the land of the elemental nations all those years ago... However...things can change greatly...if you give it to the time to..."y-you like s-swiming..." Swiming was not her type of thing but it was needed to survive probably. 

A nervious smile was given after a few moments. She just remebered the large explosion. They were probably rebuilding the hotspings and then that was when everything had gotten destroyed.....oh dear...* - Fri Oct  9 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin breathing inwards before exhaling softly outwards. Her hair would begin to turn white visably while her emerald green eyes turned green. It had been a while since Bremusa had slept or left after she dosed off for a bit....she hoped they did not fall down stream and later into the lake below since the river looked a bit rough...as well as the fall that went with it. She had activated the transformation that she had not used in battle unless against zetsumo...paine probably decided to use it only against someone whom was strong against zetsumo....and to excel at her own training....she felt she would soon need a version of gates that would surpass her students durability...greatly...but at the moment...she was able to damage them. The nervious girl just hoped they would be carefull around certain people...or they may regret some things..

"mmm...."

She humed for a moment before a small smile formed from her lips as she shaked her head rather slowly and lowered her form slightly....both legs had spaced out....breathing became regulated and slowed slightly as it grew into a rythme.....She pushed up into the air before landing...the movement repeated going to a normal speed which showed her jumping up and down with a small pause inbetween. Her pure yellow calm eyes was on the path infront of her as she rembered kyo and roses words....from the scolding of kyo...to the taunting words of rose....from the kindness of kyo....to the hate/love relationship she had with rose.....

*swoosh*

Her hands clenched as she sent a punch forwards and retracted it quickly. Both hands were infront of her face...one infront of the other....the one infront at a farther distance the one behind.* - Fri Oct  9 04:46:43 2015
