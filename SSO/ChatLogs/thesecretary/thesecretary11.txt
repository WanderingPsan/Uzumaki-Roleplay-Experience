<br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would continue her slow jumping upwards and later downwards before extending another blurred punch and later retracting her hands. The nervious girl felt herself starting to become more fluent in this form...and her second treacher was telling her or had been telling her to rest instead of training repeatedly. Was this what kyo had ment....to not over exert herself and to conserve her energy....it was no use in burning herself out. A nervious smile formed on her lips as she continued jumping upwards and downwards rather slowly repeadtly getting back the rhythme in which she loved and excelled at...going in rythm with her  breathing....her arms frailing up and downwards slowly  with great control.

"n-now.."

She said to herself before jumping forward into the air. Her body twisted and her left leg was pulled outwards with all her might. *swoosh* Her leg passed through before her right leg was pulled outwards. Landing, she breathe outwards and inwards rather slowly before raising up into a standing motion, her hands shaking slightly in a slight rush of adrenaline... Upon hearing someone walk over towards them, her pure yellow calm eyes would look over to see Maloth. 

A nervious smile would be given to them as she spoke. "h-hi maloth" * - Fri Oct  9 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly as her hair returned to its black color while her eyes went from pure yellow to emerald green when she blinked once. "u-umm....y-yes it was...a-are you alright...i h-heard the explosion a-all the way from  k-kohonoha...."  she said before  looking back down at her arms and shaking them slowly getting rid of the feeling.  Breathing inwards, she exhaled before coming to a stop with the shakign of her hands. Lowering them to her side, her gaze went back upon maloth and a nervous smile was given.

"u-umm...where are you g-going to be n-now?"

She thought that they were going to kirigakure maybe because water was fun...but then again...everyone was different in terms of where they wanted be living...Maybe the barbarian was going to go back to kumo......rocks were strong....and barbarians were strong....then again....suna has rocks to....mmm....maybe...* - Fri Oct  9 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly giving them a nervious smile. She did not mind returning to kumo...but she would probably have to put a raincheck on visiting zenaki for a while untill a later date.....she wanted to go save them before when katsune was head of kohonoha....she did not mind infultrateing kirigakure to get zenaki or zetsumo's child whoms name she kept on forgeting because of how long and uncommon it was...but when she saw him...she rembered almost instantaiously....just...dont ask her how to spell it...oh dear.....umm...uhh...moving on.....since she was with beth and shin....she felt they could handel it...but ended up being called back because of the kages insecurity.....should she have not shown them the letter...

"mm...s-sure....u-umm...do a-again...what i had done the day b-before" 

A nervious smile was given...she wanted to see the demonstrate the skill once more...she wanted his speed to become faster....Raising up both hands, the nervious girl would later clap them together and motioned them to do over what they had done before."b-begin..."* - Fri Oct  9 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink a few times before lowering her body into a crouching position. Her right hand extended slowly to reach out to maloth and grabing a hold of his hand. The nervious girl then pulling them back onto the bridge. After a few moments, a nervious smile was given feeling successfull on the task she was currently faced with before pushing them over onto their back and jumping slightly into the air. 

The tilted to a horrizontal position as she held out her eldbo and held her arm in place with her right hand. She aimed to strike their stomach area with their elbow aiming to help push out the water from their body..If she was sucessfull they would then turn them over on their back and sit on them before taking hold of both their legs....she would then pull backwards aiming to pump the water out the old fashion way...

"mm!!!" 

With each pull she hoped to hair the water finally begin spilling out... She currently held anime comedic circles as eyes...she did not know what to do for a person whom had almost drowned so she tried her best..

"l-live!!"* - Fri Oct  9 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would hear  them speak before letting go and standing up. 

Taking a few steps back, she would give a nervious smile before closing her eyes and tilting her head downwards a bit. "i-im sorry..u-umm..how about we start heading over to t-that village of y-yours....i would r-rather not have you t-training around w-water..." She did not want to cause them any more pain from being thrown in water...she wont always be there to save them if they drowned....but she wished she was....

"mm..a-are you sure y-your ok?"

Her head tilted slightly to the right allowing strands of hair to cover her eyes. A small smile was given before she spoke once more. "i-i can..u-umm..make you c-cough up s-some more w-water if you w-wish"* - Fri Oct  9 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be picked up and placed in a bridal position in his arms.

She was now being carried all the way to kumogakure so she would of complained....but she saw it as his way of saying thankyou for something...or maybe just his nature of doing things when a women was involved...either or...she was greatefull. As they traveled, her head was tilted downwards covering her eyes and only leaveing the lower half of her face to be seen at the moment. An expressionless expression was currently in place as she seemed to be thinking deeply about something important to her.

After a few moments had passed, she had heard maloths words....he asked her if she cared about someone before...it was... of course true that cared about someone....but she locked the feeling of sadness in a cage...their hands bang against the steel itching to get out...but she would not let it....allowing the prisioner to well up in its own cage...before exploding in when the cage was at its fullest. "i-i....do.....a-and...i h-have.....cared about s-someone....b-but....i would r-rather be alone...f-for the time b-being......" She never ever told anyone the real reason she left her home land to come to the elemental nations....

Maybe if enough time has passed...she would tell maloth.* - Fri Oct  9 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nods rather slowly as she motioned them to do once more what they had done before. They should show some improvement by the time of later....they should become faster by night fall if they trained diligently....if they were successfull, she would of then told them to do the three kicks she had thought them before...which was the round house kick...jump kick...and then the leg sweep....once they had mastered those three....at an even faster pace...

As they had done been motioned to do, she would say," u-umm...o-over s-seas.....u-umm...can we s-stop talking about i-it....p-please.." she would say as she over saw their training. She did have to go visit them soon...but for now...she wanted to stay in the elemental nations for a bit...she was interested in what the people were doing......how they would deal with the gezo...or if they enjoyed being controled by such....and are lazily being commanded to do such things...for their own ammusement.

"c-continue..."

Both hand would raise up to clap after they had done their first try at the attack....once they had done ten...she would tell them to start practing leaf hurricane.* - Fri Oct  9 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nod rather slowly as she took a step back.

She watched as they had done what she had asked once more . Thinking for a moment, she guessed she could help them with what they were trying to do...and so spoke once more. "u-umm...sure.." A nervious smile was given. Both hands lowered to her side as she took a few steps backwards before dashing forwards before suddenly vanishing from all eyes in a blured motion. 

By the time their eyes had traced where she had ended up, she would be in a crouching position as her right foot would be launched this time towards their stomach area launching them upwards and into the air...

"i-is this good..."

She said as this happened and this time actually kicked them in the stomach. Taking a few steps backwards, she would watch as they came back down to earth and his teacher would give them a nervious smile. When they had recovered, she would speak once more.

"d-do it again...a-and on me..."* - Fri Oct  9 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) thinks: These two seem b usy... got to find someone else. - Fri Oct  9 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would watch as they charge forwards towards her.

The nervious girl had demonstrated and they had now watched as her student began to try to do the same as well. Her right hand was sent towards his foot to cushion the attack a bit before she was lunched up up into the air. She would then fall downwards head first before tilting in mid air..."y-you....are doing w-well....j-just...n-needs more speed..." A nervious smile was given towards the brute  as she tilted and landed on her feet in a croutching position. 

"mm..."

She would raise up and a nervious smile would fade away slowly seeing that that had gotten the hang of the deed. "n-now do the three k-kicks from the f-first technique.....i-it should be much faster....o-or did you f-forget.." Her head would tilt slightly to the right allowing a few strands of hair to cover her calm emerald eyes. She was curious.* - Fri Oct  9 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would hold an expressionless face.

She watched her student talk to the person whom was infront of them before looking back towards maloth. Did they have a fight and now were enemys....mm...she could not really remeber since they had not really known what had happened....just Maloth fighting a gargoyle that he could not break...even with his hammar."mm..?" She hummed curiously...this seemed like something strange was happening.

Her calm emerald gaze then went back on maloth as they began to do the combo once more and she clapped as well. She saw his speed improving that she was happy that she was seeing this...the other technique seemed to really help mold his form and seems to be helping them become something greater as time passes or goes on....The fruits of maloths labour would never seemed to stop in one place...but just kept on growing...

Her student was growing up to be a fine diligent barbarian of a man yep yep.* - Fri Oct  9 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nerviously smile as they began moving faster before suddenly stoping to direct his attention to haru.

"mm...."

She was silent as her nervious smile slowly faded leaving an expressionless face. That was not a girl...she had thought that it had been a girl and she was rather curious about the fact that it actually had been after seeing maloth get all suspicious and what not. After a few moments had passed, she looked up towards maloth and spoke in a curious sounding tone."t-thats...n-not a girl?"

Her gaze then went back onto the male or female...she could not tell since they were that type of anime character.

A nervious smile was given, she did not have anything against homosexual people and she had been right so far to an extent. They did not want to say anything else about to subject since it had nothing to do with them...unless her student wanted to see what it was like...but ya...the decision was up to them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) now she was finally alone and was able to proceed with her training. Ther nervious girl would begin to sit down in a meditative position before closing her eyes. Her breathing began to grow slower and slower but remained in a rhytmeic tempo. The sound around her would begin to go into a blur as she began to enter her meditative world once more to indulge in training with her teacher kyo.

-----Mind Scape----

Paine slowly awakened once more and found her self against the  wall in the hall way that was there. Placing both hands within her hoddie pockets, she slowly rose into a standing position and began walking down the halls of the shrine while yawning softly....walking closer to the oo's and ah's of the children that were around them. Entering the room, they saw everyone playing and together  and a few sparring on the logs that were placed.....others walking from side to side wanting to see what other kids were doing. It seemed like it was going to be fun.

"Hey....Paine...over here!"

Her eyes slowly shifted and looked over towards the direction of the voice and saw kyo. A nervious smile appared as began walking over towards them at a rather slow place. The chill of the shine made she shiver slightly but it also made sleeping in the covered even more comfortable....Squirming in them has always been the best feeling while your body moved uncontrolably trying to get warm....twisting from side to side and later coming to a stop with a small smile on your face...she loved that feeling. Snapping out of her thoughts when she reached Kyo and three other children, her nervious smile slowly faded as she wondered what they had needed her for.* - Sat Oct 10 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

He was just stareing at her and seemed to be stuck in his own trans. This caused paine to nerviously smile after and hum softly. "u-umm.." This caused them to bring a hand up to their mouth and cough fakely to her own knowledge before speaking. "h-hey paine....how about a spar...i am your sensei after all" Paine blinked a few times as she heard these words...kyo wanted to spar....she always had asked them but it felt weird hearing from the other end from them. She slowly looked around the room once more at a rather slow and carefull pace this time.....she saw the children playing with the ball a few times...before seeing some sparing or training to a group just sitting on the ground talking. "r-rose..." She saw grey hair  and a annoyed smile....non of the children here had that type of look with kyo around to keep them in high spirits. A nervous akward smile was kept on her face before she suddenly felt a hand on her shoulder.

"u-umm....sure..."

She looked up towards kyo before akwardly and nervously smileing at the same time. The nervious girl turned to face them before taking a few steps backwards and remaining in no stance as she had done before.  Kyo had done the same since a stance was not needed for taijutsu...or was it just the style in the way in which they both fought. After a few moment, they both charged at eachother....it was time to begin her training....* - Sat Oct 10 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to leave the lands of kumo to visit zenaki. She rather wanted to see how they were doing very badly that they would visit the village they had abandoned because of the feeling she had in her heart....and zetsumo had explained it more clearly to her....understood what she was feeling at the time..and had greatly spoken to her about the subject of joining them in their crusade up untill their death which she was not able to see. The other members of the team had said they had actually died...but was it all a roose...zetsumo...die....that was impossible...then again...it was kenshin whom had done it themselfs so she could not complaine about what had happened to them....but still felt that need because they promised to help me get stronger and with each of their spars...she grew alot and after they had gotten high enough...she was finally able to break....

She began to continue her rather slow walk across the desert once she had passed the forest. IT was a long one..but proved to be enjoyable for the most part....However her thought process suddenly stoped when they began thinking about what was written on the page of paper that was sent back to her....the way they spoke seemed hesitant....the way they spoke seemed strange from how it usually was....which was demanding....she felt that there was nothing to say to them since they had everything under control...but now...she felt that it was all a lie...and a roose as an excuse for not speaking to them.....Shaking her head rather slowly she saw a rock and began walking towards it figureing that an object like this would be a good thing to train on...to lose the thoughts that was currently in her head...and to forget...the hurtfull and painfull memories of the past...to move on to a brighter future...probably...

When they reached the rock, her right hand raised and extended slowly to rest her hand upon it. Jumping up into the air, her body twisted into a blurred spin before her right leg was extended outwards  and her foot clashed againt the rock causing it to crack before landing. The hurricane like wind that was around her from slowly disbursed before she kicked off her feet and sent a dynamic entry styled kick towards the rock before her cracking it even more before pulling back her feet and sending a few blured punches towards the tree. Her eyes began to turn bright yellow while her hair began to turn into a pure white collor. A soft breath of air left her lips and she landed onto the ground and began continueing her slow walk towards the village...

She just remebered she could not keep them waiting her pace quicked at the thought...they also forgot to go out of gate mode as they continued their travels towards the village she saw from the distance. It was time to greet thefriends she had over the long three years.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) smiles nerviously following behind zenaki as they walked about what had happened in this hospital.  The brute she began woundering if it had been maloth...but then again..they would not step foot in suna...they liked staying in kumo...where most of his family was. Her calm eyes lowered slightly as she looked in the room and waited at the door....leaning on it thinking about what her own parent was doing at the moment. How exactly they fended off againt what ever came their way...and the big family outtings they had with relatives whom would come over and hang out in the yard. She loved all of that....but came to the elemental nations instead...

"mm..."

A soft humming voice left her lips as both hands went behind her back. Her mind going off to the into something distant as she awaited for zenaki to help Setsuko with the injury they had....if she had touched them...then probably something worse would happen...The nervious girl allowed them to speak alone in private because doctors and pacients usuall requre that...need of privacy for disclosed information and what not....oh dear..* - Sat Oct 10 19:19:15 2015

A nervious smile was giving as she nodded and began to pull them backwards slowly backwards as thhey began to ready themselfs for the surgery. She always wanted to see one preformed. Turning them in a direction in the hallway, she awaited for them to walk out of the room and lead them to the surgical room.

"mm...u-umm..w-what are surgerys l-like?"

She asked curiously...they had never had one before and was curious to how one was actually preformed....not that she actually was going to do it in the future. The nervious girl had remebered when her father was sent to the hospital because they had heart pains and had to go though surgery...it was a rather painfull experence..but said they did not really remeber the surgery actually even happening...

They probably did something to help them forget the memories they had once had....mm..* - Sat Oct 10 19:55:56 2015

"o-oh...no...i-ive just came to v-visit z-zenaki...and i was t-told to s-stay next to them...u-untill we f-find hassan....i-i enjoy z-zenaki's company a-alot......they h-healed umm..."

A nervious smile was given.

Upon hearing the words, 'wish granted' coming straight out of fujitora's mouth...she stared in shock that they were also able to grant such a thing...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would look over towards zenaki as she paused for a moment before looking over towards Fujitora....she did not like asking and was too nervious too of hearing them not wanting to spar them....mostly the people she asked to spar with.....she had to hold back alot....so she stoped asking..

"u-umm...".

A small akward smile would form on her lips as she awaited their response.* - Sun Oct 11 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would just watch as the golems were formed out of rocks. and diamonds. A nervous smile would of been given to them as she breathe outwards slowly and calmly. They were using diamons and other things to create these things and that they were very durable...Closing her eyes for a moment...the nervous gril breathe inwards and later exhaled outwards rather slowly as her hair changed from a black color to a pure white......Opening her eyes...they now had pure yellow eyes instead of an emerald green. It was now time to test out her strength against the durability of these golems....it was time...the fight..the stone people!!!

Her nervous smile slowly faded away into an expressionless expression as she began jumping upwards and downwards rather slowly and repeatedly before reaching a moderate speed...her breathing was regulated as she stared at the giant golem that was before her....their arms dangling slowly from her sides but controlably following the movement of her body....her hair giggling upwards and downwards leaving white strands to slightly cover her eyes. As she landed and pushed off her feet once more...her body began to move in a slight blur...not as good as katsune...but it was getting there.. 

Her body twisting body as it was in the air, they began spin anti-clockwize in a blurred motion as a violent hurricane surrounded her form. Her right leg extended outwards as she aimed to attack the golems chest area with the heel of her right leg. She would begin to take note of its regeneration....as they said...but she hoped her efforts during the battle...will prove...as improvement..from how she usually was in battle.* - Sun Oct 11 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would begin to fall with her gaze still on the golem as they stumbled backwards. When it had finally regained its footing, they had commanded it to strike and that was what the beast had done. 

The mightly four limbs of the golem was raised before being sent towards her. Twisting the upper part of her body still in mid air, she began to move in a blur as a series of blurred kickes was sent towards the golems. Each kick would cause the golems fists to crack slightly. The ground below them began to start shaking as dust began to form around the giant golem and her self....The area began to shake due to the golems speedy movements. A nervious smile formed  from her lips as she began to enjoy what was happening at the moment.

A hurricane like wind would begin to surround her form as her series of kicks continued. A blackish red blur continued to twist back and forth combatting each of the punches.  

"mmph...!!!"

she hummed loudly...she was putting in her entire effort at the moment...this was going to prove fruitfull.* - Sun Oct 11 01:04:51 2015

She hummed loudly...she was putting in her entire effort at the moment...this was going to prove fruitfull...

However all was lost when she suddenly hit her side before her rotation was fully complete. They were sent backwards hitting the ground before suddenly being sent back into the air due to recoil.... The golem hit the side of her leg at a bad angle which caused this to happened.  Upside down heading towards the mountainy surface, she placed her hands on ground before bending her elbows and pushing herself up into the air like a spring and place her feet against mountain causing it to cave in slightly. She reseved some damage as her thigh had been brused a bit from the punch...but it was cushioned a bit by the strength she had behind her attack....they just hoped it had went better.  

Kicking off the mountain towards the left, she began to run along the mountain side while stareing at the golem looking for an opening.* - Sun Oct 11 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would continue her run across the mountain wall in a slight blur. Her emerald eyes just watched as the golem stayed on one knee. This would of proved as a nother challenge to her....if she was able to break zetsumo's armor...she hoped to beable to break this golems body soon...but for now..she could do so much. Maybe next time she fought against them....they may be better...A soft breathe of air escaped her lips as she saw the golem go on with their next command.  and later began to send forth punches towards paine once more.

Pushing off her feet,  her body twisted in a spinning motion....but in antai clockwize direction. A violent hurricane  wind began to surround her from and later pushed outwards as the fists hit the mountain side. Dust and rocks began to fall off the mountain...while they combatted her strong gust of wind...her leg being stuck outwards as they sun untracked. A cloud of dust forming where the punches were sent.   The nervious girl used this skill to block the debrees as well some some of the punches that were on target with the attack.

Coming out of the smoke, she would be closer to the ground as the golems punches made a downward ark of dust clouding the area. The nervious girl nervous girl went onto the ground still spinning before landing in a roll as the golem punched the wall behind her. They felt some debree roll off onto her hitting her side as she clenched her teeth and breathing became a bit farce...however..she kept herself calm by remebering roses words...they went into a slide backwards

Her gaze still on the gollem...she awaited for them to strike her once more....she had a plan...mmm...after being given time to think of one.* - Sun Oct 11 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) pushing off her feet...hands kept to the ground, she was now in an upsidedown position. Bending her elbows slightly and pushed herself up into the air like a spring as the punch had hit the rocky surface of the wall.  Upon landing on the fist with some of the debree on her from the punch as it was pulled back. The nervous girl began running forwards upwards along the fist aiming for the head since fighting the fists it self would of proved to be useless....maybe she could attack the head instead and with that her speed increased into slight blurs as she aimed to reach the location on record time...unless she was stopped...somehow...

When she had reached close enough, she would push off her feet and twist the upper part of her body. The nervous girls body would begin to move in blurs as they spun in an anti clockwize direction aiming for their head  as they aimed to slap them to the side.....umm..the golems head....not fujitora's head.....if the strike was successfull, they would land on its shoulder while it had stumbled...however she would continue to annoy the golem by strikeing its head since heads do not attack back in painfull retaliation...meep..soon it would begin cracking due to the rate she was attacking.......

This would happen if she was able to reach in time...woosh!!!..

"mm...m-maybe..."
