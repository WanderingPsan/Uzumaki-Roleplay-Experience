<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) nervous smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless face. Her gaze would just be upon mizora as she watched them charge forwards  Her stance looked similar to mirais...she never knew mizora could do the same thing...or she just wasnt paying attention...mmm...but mizora never had started off with this right away...something felt a bit off..mm. Her left hand went inwards before swaying upwards hitting mizora's wrist area directly forcing it upwards and towards the left. The female then followed the movements of her left hand movements and swayed in that direction by a kick off of her right foot allowing their hand to pass by their body. 

The nervous girl's body twisted in a blured like state as her body lowered to the ground. Their right leg extended outwards aiming to leg sweep them. The female wanted to see what they would do in this situation....she was curious.* - Sun Nov 22 21:37:04 2015

Her right hand would raise to fix her hats position before giving mizora a nervous smile as she awaited for them to come towards her again. She loved helping people become better at what they do...and in this case it was taijutsu. Her left hand raised to dust off her clothes for a moment before looking back towards mizora's new position which was more south from where she was. 

"mm..."

Inhaling softly as she watched mizora get a dizzy spell, she just stood in place wondering if they still wanted to continue this spar...but in the end, they felt that their tiredness was just something that would give them more of a drive to fight her. The nervous female's right hand began to drift off to her side just before running to the white and black haired female. They were not going to allow them to give up just yet...she wanted to see all of what they had to offer.* - Sun Nov 22 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give off a nervous smile as she just watched as mizora's wrappings began unraveling revealing gloves...and they were matching. This foe was not only strong but they were stylish two. Waching as they said they would be alot quickly, a nervous smile would form on her lips as she continued running towards them as they launched forwards towards herself as well.  Paine, when in strikeing zone, kept her gaze on mizora as she sent forward their right hand was sent forwards.

Paine's left hand turned into a fist and was sent forwards smashing into their own fist. A few bones in their hand crached inwards like she was cracking her kunckles before they were sent backwards before their other hand was launched forwards. However...paine did not stop their...if she was successfull, the female stop in a slide before vanishing a blur....her right foot would have been sent towards their stomach area as she would reapare infront of them in a blurred state when their eyes finally tracked her down. They aimed to send them up into the air before continuing her combo.

Pushing off the her hands and into the air like a sping, she began to send multiple kicks to their stomach area in a blurred like state towards their stmoach area aiming to send them up higher and higher into the air....

If she was successfull.

 As the final kick was made towards their stomach area, the female vanished in a blur and landed on the ground as it cracked below feet before she vanished once again, her body spun in a blured like stated as she appared behind them. One hand remained in a fist while the other was in an palmed position. Both slamed into each other as one was used for a cushion for the fist while the other was used as support. When they turned horrizontal in the air, her elbow aimed to be sent towards the middle of their spine sending them back downwards onto the ground.

She finally found someone who can see her as she does attacks...the nervous girl was getting excited...was this going to be a real spar...however she knew better..and her eyes lowered slightly as she decided from the air almost as if she was gliding downwards  at a distance away from them..* - Sun Nov 22 22:56:25 2015

Their leg would of almost touched slightly grazing  them....since they were not able to make their body spin fast enough and in time seeing as they had some difficually actually doing the skill. 

However, elbow to their stomach or rib cage would of stopped their small built up momentum completely before being send downwards to the ground as stated before...if they are still able to eat the pill...while going down....then who was she to stop her.

The nervous female would land on the ground a bit of a distance away from them.* - Sun Nov 22 23:41:39 2015

"u-umm...do you w-wish to call it o-off here?..." Her sparring partner was coughing up blood...they were injured....and was barely able to stand as they were also half way exhausted from the sparing match.

"g-good fight"

She would say, however her hands slightly shook in place. Probably noticable by their byakugan showing that they still wanted to fight even more, but couldnt against this person. Seemingly closing her eyes, she took a deep breath before exhaling and opening them soon after. "i-if you...e-ever wish to t-test your self a-again.....let m-me know...il b-be..happy..to h-help you.."

The nervous female would notice that he pulled back a hand and only striked with the other. They needed to strike with both of them to actually get the technique down...not pull back with one hand...and only use the other in fear of pain. She; however, saw that their fingers were bending less now and withheld alot of power within them.

She would give them a small smile before speaking. "t-try again once m-more....and t-this time u-use b-both hands....m-make sure their t-together...and d-do not p-pull back a h-hand in f-fear...or you h-hands will b-become even m-more h-hurt. " Her sentence ended and she demonstrated once more to her already adept student. Both her own hands raised before forming a tiger seal. Pointing them directly towards the rock, she would then send it forwards and a small cloud of smoke was made before going away a few seconds later.

"g-good job...now t-tack a b-break and p-practice this l-later.....f-for now...can you g-go into the s-same stance as r-rias?"

Her eyes was currenlty still on rias after stating the second half. The nervous female would then move forward before extending her right hand taking hold of her rist and stoping their movement. The female would then raise their hands a few inches higher before letting go. 

"i-if it l-lowers again...w-we will c-continue this t-training untill you d-drop....is t-that understood.." 

She said, the nervous female was awefully serious when it came to training.

The nervous girls gaze however was kept on rias while she was training hideo since she needed the most help. 

"u-untill your hands...g-gain its p-prespective spacing a-automatically...when you p-punch.."

Her left hand then slowly raised before taping rias hands making a bit of spacing each time they punched.

"s-same with y-you rias....e-each p-punch needs its r-respective s-space.......and e-each p-punch needs...its r-respective w-wind...that is g-given in i-its...s-space.."* - Tue Nov 24 08:46:30 2015

"y-your punches are...b-begining to s-sway........do f-fifty more...then s-stop rias."
