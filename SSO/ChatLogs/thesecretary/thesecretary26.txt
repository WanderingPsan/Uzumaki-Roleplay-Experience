<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) when reaching the top of the stand, she suddenly turned around and watched as hassan made his way off the stage. A nervous smile suddenly formed on her lips as her greeting towards the people below before her right hand slowly raised to touch her chest. Their calm slightly dulled emerald eyes slowly closed as she inhaled deeply and later exhaled trying to grab to small...but large ammount of words she wanted to say...the words she wanted to tell them...she had gotten to know them better. After a few moments had passed, her eyes slowly opened and words that was played in her head...like a short symphony was driven out of her lips.

"w-when....i first...c-came...to this v-village...all those y-years ago....i was a-always in the o-office...along side k-kronos..k-katsuya..and j-jiki." She paused for a moment before continueing her words. "i...stood...b-behind the desk...as i w-watched them converse with...a-all the talkative s-shinobi...while i was to n-nervous to t-talk to them my self..." She said as her gaze drifted slowly over towards the coffen that was besides her. "my n-nervousness..p-prevented me...f-from speaking...to t-this boy...n-no...this m-man....my n-nervousness..prevented me....f-from seeing them...a-at their h-happiest....t-their s-saddist...w-when their most d-depressed...and w-when their m-most joyfull....the w-ways...i can say these w-words over...and o-over....while the r-regret s-stay within my h-heart burning...for f-freedom..." She would say before placing a hand on the coffin as tears began rolling down her eyes. "i...w-was..happy...when...they j-joked around w-with me...t-that day....i was h-happy..he a-acknowledged...someone like m-me as a friend....someone..he had  i-ignored in the p-past....i was t-truely..h-happy...that y-you made time...f-for me...even if it w-was short lived....b-but if i knew...it was the l-last time i was g-going to see you....." Her right hand suddenly turned into a fist and banged downwards onto the coffen causing it to crack slightly. Her teeth clenched as her tears began dripping down onto the coffin...

The nervous girl fell to her knees as her head dropped down and arms rested on the coffin.....she broke down..."i w-would...of t-tried...h-harder...to get to k-know you b-better....my...l-lost friend....." her gaze would then slowly look back towards the people whom were seated south of them as she said these final words. "m-make sure...to s-spend time...with the p-people...whom c-care about you....or...you would end...u-up...being r-regretfull...l-like myself..." She would say as she slowly got up to her feet...stumbling slightly before walking back to her chair. Taking a seat, her right arm suddenly raised to wipe her tears that kept on coming.* - Fri Nov 20 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) small smile suddenly faded away as her left hand was swipped away, however when their other hand trusted forwards towards her noise, her left hand that was at chest level suddenly shot upwards blocking her punch and pushing it away from their face. Her head tilted slightly downwards and the right as she launched forwards under their arm while her left arm retracted as well as knees slightly bending before aiming to be send their elbow into their stomach area. She was testing their reflexes so she wanted to see how they would fare and they were doing well. She is just below mana...and Momura...so she would have to focus on them a little more than the other two....oh dear...this was going to be alot of work...mm...

If the attack was successfull or not, her head would tilt upwards slightly to stare at the girls facial expression as a nervous smile was given. She wanted to see the amount of focus they held in a taijutsu fight.* - Fri Nov 20 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give them a small smile as she watched them train on the rock. They were showing progress and this made her the teacher a little proud of her student. As mirai was training, a soft breath of air would leave her lips as both arms raised to cross under her chest area. She was wondering if they really liked learning things from her...she had strange ways of teaching people...and she may even come off as impolsive towards them. "a-again..." she would say stareing that the crack they had made. The nervous girl had four students total...and all of them have yet to even grasp this move.....When she decided to walk around, the only person they had really saw was marai and momura...maybe...the others disliked the way she thought....

"mm..."

Her head shook slightly as she walked over to the rock to the left of Mirai. Both hands raised, her right hand turned into a fist and was sent into her left hand. they began to go into a horizonal position above her chest area as she turned sidewards. Their knees bended slightly as their elbow was launched into the rock causing a small chunk of it to break off. Her gaze slowly went onto Mirai. "d-did you see what...i-i...did?....k-keep you a-arm s-straight....k-keep...your m-muscles t-tenced...or you w-will hurt y-yourself....n-never do t-this...with h-half p-power....." She would then pause for a moment before giving them a small smile and speaking. "b-but...your f-form...is a-alright..." She would say before raising up straight and allowing her arms to dangle at her side. Her calm slightly dulled emerald eyes would look upon them as she awaited for them to continue their training.* - Fri Nov 20 08:32:00 2015

She would say before dusting off her clothes, they felt like they should have dodged.....maybe the next time...mm..

The nervous girl kicked each ball and sent them aroudn the area once more 'tick....thu...th' it was the sounds of rubber balls being send all over the area...one passed by her face in a blur before the nervous female took a step backwards as four balls were about to close in on her. The nervous female would give a her students a small smile as she awaited for them to come at her while dodging or getting hit by the balls. Opening her mouth, she would say the words.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would nervous girl would take a step backwards as she watched the balls pass directly besides her face and off towards the walls around the area. She threw them hard enough to bounced around alot for a good amount of time...but lessened the spin so it could do less damage. She remained silent and just watched as her students began to converse with each other. The nervous female remained silent as her nervous smile slowly faded away leaving and expressionless face. Her mind remebering what their own teacher had done to her....the training session. But ofcourse...she was going nervous...she was wondering if they were able to do this type of training yet...and was curious to what it will show on their overall performance.

"mmm..."

Her calm emerald slightly duleld eyes lowered slightly as a soft breathe of air left her lips. She was aiming to remeber what her mentor had told her all those times ago...to remeber her breathing exercises that she had learned from rose when she fist started doing taijutsu...They had to remain calm...and hoped her students succeed on making it past the balls and attacking her head on...or being hit every time they got up and trying to attack her at the same time...it was there decision...and she hopped they made the right one..
