"i-i...should...i..s-should...w-wait...?"

she asked curiously with slight pauses within each word. "the ...r-right m-moment..." Tears began to form from her cheeks before suddenly pausing for a moment as she forcfully tried to stop them. "t-the right m-moment.....the r-right...m-moment....t-the..r-right m-moment....the r-right...m-moment..the..r-" Both hands slowly raised to grab her head as she went onto her knees and later stared at the ground. Both hands dropped to later be placed on the ground as well.

"i...d-dont...want my f-family...to d-die..."

she muttered under her breath softly.* - Thu Nov 12 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) // As they placed the turtle with her pocket,she nodded slowly as she pushed him away slowly and  stood up, but stumbled slightly before regaining her balance by placing her hand on the door frame....the female was having trouble breathing as they coughed slighly. Their teeth gritted together as she pushed off the edge of the door before continueing her way outside of the room...and fell face fist onto the sandy desert outside grabbing their head in pain and spawling on the ground for a moment. "mm...." Placing her hand on the ground, she pushed herself slowly off of it and began stumbling to the gate with each step took...one hand placed on her head to calm her dizziness while the other hand remained dangling at her side.

They were headed to the gate.* - Thu Nov 12 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be walking though the guards infont of the gate.. During her walk here, she tossed the turtle that was within her pocket onto the ground in respect of her family member that she needed to find soon...or which she believed was family because they all were that close...or was sopost to be that close. The Guards looked directly at pain akwardly as they seemed to be stumbling with each step she had taken, their right hand was raised to cover the side of her head and her calm emerald seemed slightly dulled out as they seemed lost in their thoughts. Their vision seemed disorientated  as she stopped upon seeing a blury vision of Ortho's form.

"mm...h-h-.." Her hand went to her mouth as she coughed softly before looking back towards Ortho. Tears seemed to be coming from her eyes, they learned of koji's death that she did not know of untill recently. "h-have...you s-seen....or....k-know anyone...who h-has seen...k-katsune?" They wanted to ask them...directly..why they killed kilm...a family member...someone close to them or had belonged to their group of survivers....a long or old time friend...whatever they wanted to call it....the fact was...they alll shared a bond...and she wanted to know...why they wanted to break it. 

"i...w-wish to f-find them..."

She seemed to be swaying slightly from side to side as their mind ached and her hand quickly raising to hold her head to ease up the dizzy spell that was currently on her.* - Thu Nov 12 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would allow a soft breath of air to escape her lips as she fell to her knees and both hands were placed on the ground. The females gaze stared at the ground below her her. "k-kilm..d-died...e-everyone...is d-dieing...and i ...i....i cant p-protect them...or i-im never t-there...to d-do so.....b-but...when..its y-your own f-family m-member....a s-sister....who p-pulls the t-trigger...on t-their own...how...d-does that make your f-feel...how would..it m-make you feel....they ran...without an e-explination...." 

Her mind was growing hazy as questions ran though her head of what she was going to ask her...but knew..when the time came, there were no words that would come out of her mouth...to explain how exactly she felt or would have felt..when that time came.

"i...c-came...to a-ask you q-qestions o-ortho...as you are the m-most k-knowledgeable p-person i know.....but i-instead...im..c-crying at you f-feet...i..a-apoloze...for b-being...u-useless..at times...and l-leting you see...t-this side..of me..."* - Thu Nov 12 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would suddenly be hugged by Ortho.She felt the warmth of his hug for a few moments as her arms slowly raised to hug them back but froze for a moment. Her heart stopped for a moment letting her nervousness get to her as her eyes lowered slowly and her arms later dropped to hersides. Upon hearing the words they spoke, she grew curious. They were talking about the situation not being her burden...about it being katsunes....wanting...or suggesting that she as the middle person should just watch from the sidelines....as this was not a dispute between her...but between them. 

".i wish...it w-were that e-easy......to p-pour out e-emotions...m-my own..seem to b-build up.....and im a-afraid...my m-mind...will f-finally break...the the t-trigger...p-pulled...i hope that day...d-doesn't happen...a-any time soon...as i w-walk down...m-my path......" 

She would say as a nervous smile had formed on her lips. Both her hands raised and was later placed on ortho's shoulder before pushing them back slowly, holding them in place. Her body slowly shook slighly and her breathing was inconsistant. Her right hand was removed and raised to wipe her eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would blink a few times before looking southwards and later looking back to Akira. "o-oh...t-thankyou." A small smile would be given before being to walk over to them before stoping when she was infront of them. "t-thankyou...for y-your..c-consolance.....last n-night....but i p-passed out...b-before i had a c-chance to r-respond.....im s-sorry"

Both hands would be brought to her center as a nervous smile was given.* - Fri Nov 13 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as her hand was taken. Her heart paused for a moment as she was later pulled southwards outside of the settlement. Her face currently had a slight supised expression as she heard their words before a small smile slowly formed on her lips and their gaze lowered slightly.

"o-oh..."* - Fri Nov 13 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would be led to a river. They would watch as they took a seat infront of it curously as they asked that question. She....of course trusted them...there was no reason she shouldnt.

The nervous girl would think for a moment before turning around and siting down on his lap. Leaning back slowly, her eyes would lower slightly as she thought for about what she wanted to say...and how exactly she should express herself to them. Opening her mouth, the nervous girl decided to just let her mind do the speaking and not thinking about what she said. 

"u-umm......im...g-greaving..n-not only about his d-death....but im a-also...d-dissapointed about m-myself....w-what i have b-been doing...instead of b-being by his s-side....maybe..if i w-was able to t-talk more....l-like they had been....i would h-have...been t-there when it was a-about to happen..."* - Fri Nov 13 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would feel her leg behing rubbed as a nervous blush began to form on her cheeks as she listened to his long line of words, but it was a bit hard. Her hand lowly extended and placed it upon his own as her head slowly shook meaning no...they were feeling a little uncomfortable. Her head then looked back eastwards as her head lowered slightly...her calm emerald gaze watching the river as it flowed freely long its desired path.

"t-then i s-shouldnt greif......a man...b-by the name named z-zetsumo...was an o-old friend o-of mine...when i g-grew older...he c-changed alot...even y-yelled at me...w-when we m-met after so long......w-when i j-joined him....he said he would h-help me...get more p-powerfull...so i b-began following along t-their path...their l-life....t-their way...d-doing what they w-wanted.....in hopes of h-helping them when....t-they had n-needed it....I w-wanted power......b-but a-after he died....or b-before he died....i q-questioned w-why i was g-growing more p-powerful.....w-why was i t-training....p-power was s-something that....."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) was kicked up and set on her feet. She would then look up towards them. "u-umm...i know...but...o-only if it was t-that easy" she would say giving them a small smile. It was something that was not changed easily...she just hoped they they would live long enough for her to become that way around them. The nervous girl would then say the words. " and p-please stay s-safe...."* - Fri Nov 13 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they walked off northwards and towards the settlement. She wanted so say one more thing towards them, but these words were harder or kept on growing harder to say each times she saw them....they had the perfect chance to say them now...but....she did not want to hear the answer they would give....and feared that answer greatly. Turning around facing the westwards direction, she exhaled softly allowing air to leave her lips. 

"i-i...w-will..."

She would mutter the words under her breath before begining her walk towards sunagakure...it was time to find this mana person..* - Fri Nov 13 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) seemed to be walking westwards. Her calm emerald eyes seemed to be slightly dulled out. Her gaze slowly looked over towards the traveler, a nervous smile would be given to them before she continued her walk towards the village. They did not know whom they were, she was going elsewhere and towards the village where she had to teach as usual. They went back and forth and had just jumped off the trees and into the sandy desert from her last location. With each step the had taken, the wind around them visably clingged to her form as the femaled seemed slightly out of it. She seemed to be walking unconcously towards their location as they were thinking about something within their mind....they seemed lost....she had listened to the words of someone whom had consoled her after asking for something completely different....The nervous girl suddenly vanished in a meer blur. 

-thiku- -thiku-

There were shockwaves heard within the area at a long distance from where yan was. The nervous girl had begin their training further within the desert. She was sending kicks and punches towards the air and different rock objects during her run. Each combo moving faster and faster than the last as she used the heat to wear her out. They wanted to get the thoughts out of her head, and wanted to get the feeling out of her system...the feeling of regret...and feeling of distress. The sun beat down on her form....the wind slowly cooling her down before suddenly stopping all her movements that she was currently making as the sand village came into view. The nervous girls eyes lowered slightly. "i-i....need....to f-forget..." Her hand slowly raised to hold the side of her head softly as she looked up towards the sky above her. Their other hand clenched as they took a deep breath and exhaled softly. She feels something pulling her out of her body...a personality...another soul....making its way into her body....but it felt familer...it felt...like her masters....but did not know for sure...it was imposible...wasent it?* - Fri Nov 13 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would finally arrive at the gates after her long time of travel. The nervous girl walked slowly though the gazes that were upon her by the guards. They saw the looks in paines eyes which seemed to be a mix of calmness...and lost. The guards stayed away but had worried looks on their faces. The female was nice, but seemed to be in a time of pain. She was growing to become that type of person, or was going to become tht type of person soon. ...but not just yet...the bullet is moving closer to the revolver...and the nervous girl...was about to lose herself within her own....and that was what she did not know....what shewas becoming....

Walking though the village, the people gave her hellos and paine would give them a nervous smile. They were very fond of the girl and seemed to be happy, but on occasion, they would look to her with awe when they saw the look in her eyes which was different from the past. The turtle that was with her would crawl up her shoulder as she had picked it up just outside of the village from where she had left it. "mm..." Soon the square beganto enter her vision, as she soon saw figures of people shew had known. A nervous smile would of slowly formed on her lips as she began to search for the mana person othro had talked about as well as Mirai. She was still responsible for teaching them.

Inhaling, she exhaled softly as her hair began to turn into a white color while her eyes turned from emerald green to a pure yellow color. Her hair then began to slowly leviate like she was within water...it was just floating. The nervous girl leaned backwards slowly before throwing the rock in the eastwards or north east direction. After this was done, they returned to their regualer state and out of her transed mode. A nervous smile was given to them soon afterwards.

"g-good...l-luck."
