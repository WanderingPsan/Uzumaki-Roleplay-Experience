Pulling them backwards, she would turn them around into a hug during mid fall as zetsumos first jutsu had released. Falling to the ground, her clothes would be burned a bit due to the flames and the ball heading in a upwards direction towards the the ink figures.

The both of them would then be blown backwards into the stall behind them in a roll. Raising up into a sitting position after hitting her back against the stall table of the merchant, she released Amai and would give them a small smile if they stared at them for a moment. 

Her gaze then shifted over towards zetsumo giving them a nervious smile as well. They really had to work on this girl temper...they needed all the men they had if they were going to storm kiri....oh dear....* - Sat Sep 12 22:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to walk along the forest path towards the destination that zetsumo wanted her to go to. They wanted her to do this mission alone...a clumsy person like her when they could have put them in a group. However that was just the ammount of trust that zetsumo had in her to complete a mission by herself and return safely...she hoped atleast. Shaking her head,  her calm eyes lowered slightly soon after in dought of wheither she can pull this off at all.....it was then she decided to train in her mindscape for the rest of the journy to the location...maybe they could distract herselfs from the thoughts they had in their mind at the moment...

Paines eyes began to grow pale as her calm gaze looked to the right and stared at the trees watching the leafs slowly drift towards the ground...it felt peacefull and free more or less...something...that zetsumo had strived for....something everyone wanted...but what if some of those people wanted the war to continue just to fill their sick gain of a death worthy of what holds their name. The sounds of a merchant's wagaon seemed to come into view as she looked over towards the large horses that pulled it. 

---Mind Scape Vision---

Paine would awaken looking around her surroundings as her eyes opened slowly. Using both hands to push her self up into a sitting position, she leaned onto her left hand and raised up her right to slightly cover her mouth as they yawned softly. Her vision was slightly blury as their right hand soon raised from her mouth and towards their eyes wiping them rather slowly. Rose and Kyo stood up from the dining table seeing that paine had awaked from her nap once more.  

They seemed awefully serious this time and looked like they had something to say...oh dear..

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) leaves the group.* - Mon Sep 14 19:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would breath inwards and outwards rather slowly as she stood out in the open field. Her calm emerald gaze was on the ocean watching the ocean churn and churn. It was time to begin her training to become stronger after seeing what had happened during her time flying at the war zone. The sonic booms she heard in the air just made everything seem like zetsumo was trying to prevent something from coming to them and she did not know what it was. The nervious girl thought it was explosions from the soldiers fighting down on the battle field....it felt all to surreal.

"mm..."

The hands of the concealed figure clenched into a fist as their calm gaze on the ocean lowered slightly and later rested on her feet.  Her head shook getting rid of the thoughts they felt before their knees bend slightly and legs spaced out. Her eyes calm eyes raised  stared out to the distance as both hands raised up.....one infront of the other...it was time to get training done...she wanted her punches to be faster than the regular ammount....she wanted her punches to be feared as much as her kicks were sopost to be....they wanted to get stronger in any way she could...and decided to go back to the basics of what rose had told her...it was time to start training..* - Mon Sep 14 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

What was it Rose said...the first punch is swift...but used as a fake. Her right fist was sent forwards at a blured speed before being pulled back. A soft breath of air left her lips as the fist was pulled back. Her body tensed and slowly untensed as they breath inwards and outwards calmly and slowly...."rose..." she said under her breathe as her calm eyes lowered slightly..she had faith that she would master this art of punching...but felt that all these arts were useless...but they believed that it was there to help people to improve...help us normal people to get better...humans that were not gifted with the powers or prows of the noblity or geneticly made creatures that walk among us...A soft breath of air escaped her lips as she shook her head trying to regain focus...

"no.."

A soft voice left her lips..she loved everyone that she was around with now..even if they had an edge because of what they were born with..what made it easy for them to live in this world of ours...but difficult in the eyes of others whom possess the knowledge or need to prove them selfs...no to work harder than others in what they had..to beable to strike themselfs as interesting...as powerfull in the future because of the skills they possessed now...and what it will grow into in the future. The concealed figures right hand extended forwards once more and retracted quickly with a slight delay. The sound of wind being cut as her hand was trusted remained a constant sound in the ears of the conealed figure...but they were not satisfied with what was given to them...they wernt satisfied with they had achieved so far...

Was this zetsumos doing...* - Mon Sep 14 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

There she went again..her mind trailed off to zetsumo..but why him all of a sudden...had he been that much of an influence on her...he caused kronos to d...no..it was kitora and she had paid the price for that deed during the attack on kohonoa. To seek pleasure from taking ones life is not normal and was not forgiven by the heavens as they had not shown pity on their soul.  The consealed figures eyes lowered slightly as her right hand was sent forward swiftly and retracted quickly before her left hand was sent forwards...the sounds of crushed leaves as it fell down slowly around her form....the sunlight shining down on the figure as they tired to figure out what drove them to follow zetsumo...what drove them to live..

"faster..."

She spoke breathing outwards once more as the two fists were sent outwards once more. Light shun down on them through the leaves as her eyes raised exhaling and inhealing slowly as each fist was retracted and extended. Her body getting acustomed to the movements of each hand..but slowly. She wanted to get better...at doing this skill. She wanted not to waist time for the present...but work on it so she could become better in the future...and maybe a better wife..if she was ever alloud to leave this drowned world thats in sorrow over the petty wars of others....

peace..maker?* - Mon Sep 14 22:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) //

Both hands retracted and was sent forwards once again, but during the left hands retraction, her body ducked and twisted to the right quickly and delived a swift uppercut that was slightly off its mark and pulled back. She breath outwards slowly and breath inwards...she remaiend calm but was slightly tired on the inside but can keep going on for as long as she wanted. The routine continued over and over again. From the two punches..to the twisted of her torso and the slight extended bending of her keese that lunched her upwards into a uppercutting motion. Her body pulled backwards as both hands quickly went back into position as fists infront of her face, one after the other.  Her head rung and rung as the sound of the ocean entered her ears..

"mmm..."

She shook her head and continued doing the rotation of punches. Her feet leaving the ground occasionly as she spun in the air and landed on ehr feet. Her goal to be more proficent in doing this action....but should she miss or even hit...doing that would be at random and would not be a regular thing...the reason begin that you could attack someone easily in the air...however it would be random on her doing...more like a special spin if her attack did succeed or stop if the foe  besies her is just as dangious as the predecessor.

Her head shook as she landed back on her feet and went back into her random make shift stance..* - Mon Sep 14 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be staring at the leaves that fell slowly towards the ground. Swaying from left to right slowly enjoying the breeze they had been given...enjoying the pleasentrys that came with the life that had been given to them. Zetsumo wanted to get rid of the people overseaing the three nations...feudal lords they called them...wanting to destroy them so the world would end its stupidity and see the light in everything they dont want to notice...The Consealed figure began jumping up and down rather slowly with each jump inhaling a soft breath of air and later exhaling slowly.

"one more..."

AS she landed on her feet, she took a half step forwards not breaking from her stance. A fist was sent towards the imaginay foe infront of them. Her hand breaking through the wind at rapid speed before being retracted and anther being sent forwards at an accurate length before being pulled back. Her torso twisted during the motion as her right hand was send forwards in an upper cut motion... She called zetsumo a piece maker....but all he wanted was domination and made sense of what he anted to do with the power he had obtained...

Her motions suddenly stoped as she stood straight staring out at the path ahead of them..her thoughts all stoping to ask the question...should she follow this man any longer....the one whom promised her power...one that she is soon to achieve..,,Her head shook slighty as she began thinking about cats trying to get her mind off the subject and it slightly worked...but only up to an extent..

Would she be ready for another head to head fight with kirigakure.....she would have to be ready for when she was able to help fight..,mm...she had to try..* - Mon Sep 14 23:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would sit down in a mediative position before closing her eyes. Her breathing slowed as she began to block out all the outside noise that she had heard. A hurricane like wind began to surround her form as they entered her mind scape. They rather saw this as a good time to train with rose and just went with the flow...she also left a few things unfinished..

--Mind Scape Vision-

They had left Roses house and slept on the road towards the mountain. Pushing herself up off the ground, a free hand raised to wipe her eyes when a bunny white as snow came to meet her. Going into a sitting position, both hands extended to pick up the white bunny. She rose up slowly holding it in her arms as she made her way towards the mountain that held a red gate that you would see infront of japanese mountain shrines. The trees showed leafs faling slowly to the ground allowing the wind to do whatever they wanted with it at will. Her summer dress she was wearing caused she to have a few chills...but the bunny had kept her warm...and the black stockings she wore helped as well.

The sounds of the forest echoed though her ears as she walked though out the mountain...each movement and watery fall mixed in with the timing of the crickets that made due with their sounds...just..what was this world they were sent to...she doughted this was her mind any longer because of how giant it was...the bounderys that kept it afloat...why was she allowed to be here...was..kenshin one of those whom accepted roses training and had succeeded...she knew rose was fast...but mabe the others were even faster than herself...

Paines eyes lowered slightly down at the bunny as a small smile appared on her face..she had to remeber to stop thinking down on herself..rose believed in her and kyo did too...but the journy to the gate would have to be made on her own and she was nearly there...

she began coming up upon the  place she needed to be as she began coming up a set of stairs. Each step was used to walk up those stairs. She continued making her way up them wanting to know what was up there. Reaching the top of the stairs, she stared at the gate and that she was sopost to walk thought. Looking over to her right, she stared at kyo who had probably gotten to the gate during her nap in the forest. " come on paine...though the gate you go...we dont have all day now do we?" Paine would give them a nervious smile as she heard them speak. Her gaze fell back upon the gate as she breathe inwards and later outhwards rather slowly and began to walk forwards past the gate and felth the pebbles on the ground began to raise . Her gaze rested on the shrine that was before her.

The mitature rocks that floated around her in the air would remain in still position as she pulled the pure white rabbit that was dear to her close to her form. Kyo walked up to paine and placed his hand on her head with a small smile. The old man seemed to show some joy in seeing another student finally making it though roses training and now it was up to them to teach her what to do next."alright...that old hag probably thought you about reaction time.....seeing and avoiding and output....." They said lazily as their hand raised and went into the sleves of their robe. Turning around, the oldish man looked back to paines confused face." follow me...we are gonna head to the back" 

Paine blinked a few times before following behind them slowly. She had made it though the first gate...but what were the other teachers like?...oh dear..But what was rose so worried about...they seemed rather nice..

Kyo had led her around the shrine and towards the back. Paine was playing with the bunny she had found giving it a small smile as her calm eyes lowered slightly during their walk. The oldish man looked back slightly to stare at the young girl wondering if she had been like this towards the end of her training with Rose. A hand would raise to cover his mouth as they faked coughed before speaking. " hey...kid..you seem a bit down..whats botherin ya" His hand lowered back into his cloak awaiting his answer. When paine had heard this, her calm eyes looked up towards them with a slight stunned expression...was he really interest in the problems she faced in the world of reality....whis was not present in the world she currently lived in which was reality....

"i..i..."

Her eyes lowered to stare at the bunny as her expression turned neutral with a small smile. What was her problem...what was she sad about..The problem was that she did not know as it was something that was etched deep within her heart and soon afterwards became a problem unknown to them untill it was brought out when she needed it most."im...s..still..." She tried to say before suddenly bumping into the back of kyo and stumbling backwards a bit. Regaining her footing, she looked upwards towards what seemed to see kyo turn around to face her. They had reached their destination...but the answer he wanted to recieve from paine seemed to be something that was more apperent.

"i...just h..have a-alot going o-on...i-im..s-sorry..."

Kyo raised a hand to scratch the back of his head thinking for a moment before running into the shine and into the kitchen. Paine followed slowly after them and stoped after entering the dineing area. Her gaze looked around slowly...the place was clean as well showing they took care of the place daily or hired someone to do so...but she douted that..It was then kyo came back with a vanila icecream cone in their hand and slowly wards over towards them and held it up for her to eat. Extending her own hand, she had taken it and bit down. A nervious blush appared as her eyes closed and the bunny in her arm began to sleep.  "i-its...t-tastes.." she would try to say but kyo had finished her sentence before she could say the first letter of the words.

"good huh...well i did make it myself...." 

They placed both hand on their hips before looking back down at paine with a big grin on his face. Paine gave them a small smile before her gaze lowered slighty upon taking another bite...the sweetness made her feel a bit better...and some bttterness still resided in her heart...from her own doing. Kyo's smile droped and a hand lowered slowly onto the young girls shoulder. "Hey there...listen...if you ever feel sad just tell me and il give you somethin sweet...does not have to be icecream you know..." Paine blinked a few times before giving them a small smile and later yawning softly. "ya..rest up...we dont have to start today...just rest up.."

Paine nodded before walking over towards the table and taking a seat. Kyo would take the ice cream and began eating it himself. Placing the sleeping bunny on the table, paine placed her arms in a box form and closed her eyes going back to the world of reality.

__Mind Scape Vision End___

Paine slowly opened her eyes as her breating began going back to its normal state slowly. the sounds of the towns people began to seem more apperant as she stood up and began walking southwards to see what the people here were doing and later the squad of ninja that were in this group of theirs. ...it was time....to see what the others were doing at the moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would blink a few times as zetsumo called her forwards and so she would take a step forward. They were talking about the kai technique again which caused the nervious smile she had to slowly grow into one of no expression  Her consealed emerald eyes lowered slightly as her head tilted downwards a bit...her hand raising shakingly...slightly shakingly to stare at her hand. She had stayed away from the ninjutsu ways for a long time now...three years to be exact after starting her taijutsu training. She had no skill in the area being from overseas and just decided to go straight taijutsu. Her hand raised and tried for form a seal but it felt wrong and her hand kept on renewing...reoccuring...remaking...each try just a failer after the other...no..after the next. Her calm eye slowly closed trying to remeber what exactly she had done in the past...three years ago before she met up with zetsumo..the way she used the divine wnd that she had forgotten long about after straying away. The tiger..boar...and...what other handseals were there...snake...oh dear..what were the other handseals that they spoke of so proudly...what were the handseals that zetsumo used every time when he was in battle with a person of strong power...a person who was able to push him to the limit like the war they had not to long ago that they returned to konoha from....

"maybe..."

Her hand began turning into a shape getting closer to its destination of a random seal as her memory began to fiddle and fiddle...pieces getting intertwined and together as the minutes went by. Her body floating in the many memories that she had since birth..what made her what she was today. HEr head looking slowly to the left and later slowly to the right...memories of her mother and herself eating pumpkin pie and a smile on both of their faces...memories of her mother holding her and reading her a story before falling asleep...."oh fox...oh fox...where have you gone...so fluffly you are...please dont eat me up..." She said in her mind, softly under her breath. What exactly was she in search for..and why has her memories let her to this moment when looking for the handseals that zetsumo and the others around her had used so proudly and proficently...things that she had to learn to counter as time went on...things she had to deal with and keep away from damageing her form as she proceeded to the future. Her gaze lowered slightly as she looked ahead of her and saw a giant screen and caused her to pause her movements. It was the first time she met rose...she sought her mind as a place to escape...a garden she wanted to protect...a home that she had called her own since three years ago..a person..she did not want to lose.

The memory soon slid away as she continued her flying forwards, her gaze slowly shifted over to the right as she noticed what they had been in search for..the spar she had with zetsumo three years ago prior to her achieveing this cloak and hat. The large tonado that spin and suddenly slowed down so she could read what exactly it was that was being put infront of her. Paines right hand rose and the memorie rewinded slowly so she could see the handseal that was being used as she did this. "tiger..." The seal in reality began to form in her single hand and her form. Her eyes opened slowly to see the green grass and her fingers perfectly forming the seal that took her so long to achieve...no..create...as her memoies of using jutsu ever was slowly fading away like a painfull memorie that you just want to forget. "u-umm...pause..all movement..."she repeated to herself under the mutter of her breath. Her breathing began to slow...as she calmed herself down to her best ability. She took a bit of her chakra and had let it build up and later pushed it outwards aound her body. A soft breeze of wind came from her general direction causing her hair to fly upwards slightly before falling downwards ..Blinking a few times, she looked over towards zetsumo woundering if she had gotten the jutsu she took longer than the others to successfully use...Her hand slowly went down to her side as her breathing went back to its normal rate...

Was...her use of the technique perfect and met his calabor...was it able to reach is specifications...was it able to meet his needs as the supreme leader of this group...that was something that was left unknown to her untill she heard his words that commanded them to the fullest. The words that put them to work..and the words that put them to rest....the words that makes us strive to become stronger...and the words that makes us hult in our tracks....was this the true power of zetsumo...the person who sees what the future would hold...a person whom seems to modivate people whom have potential that they dont see in themselfs...her child hood friend whom has yet to give up on her just yet..Her head slowly looked towards everyone else whom seemed to have a easier time at using the skill that they had learned to use on the first go rather than herself...no...they were struggling at first..but mastered the skill at the end of the day or progressed at it to an extent rather than herself.......Looking back to the path ahead of her assuming zetumo had given ....she went into a stance...her right foot was placed infront of her left foot...a space given inbetween them... Both hands raised into a fist form and was placed infront of her face....she decided this was a perfect time as any to progress in her taijutsu training since she was trying to master what kyo had been telling her...to make her punches faster...and swifter....to fully respect the reaction time and avoid teaching that rose had given her...

"mm.."

She began jumping up slowly into the air...slightly above the ground. Her had slid backwards showing her face. Her hair bouncing upwards and later downwards. Her calm eyes showed slight seriousness while her face remained expressionless. She jumped upwards and later landed on the ground once more...her movements becoming a routine...training her memory not to forget...to prevent a mistake that she may make in the future after mastery of this skill. She wanted to raise her stanima and so she tried to keep her breathing steady..wanting to succed in not losing stanima unnecessary...she was striving..to become better....as a villager....as a regular person like those soldiers...who cant even protect themselfs from the wrath of the ninjas whom control them with fear...she wanted to be a beakon of hope that even they can see as someone whom will prevent them from dieing...allowing them to see their children when the war was over...when the bloodshed had subsided...but even she knew...that war will never end and was a reoccuring thing... A soft breath of air escaped her lips as her right hand was thrusted forwards in a quick motion before being pulled back in swiftly with slightly off timing....her left hand extended outwards as her right foot touched the ground...before retracting swiftly. She breathe inwards and outwards as she remained unmoving...focusing on the very air she breathe in trying to calm herself down from the thoughts what was going though her head...

She remained still..unmoving still in the stance that was deemed important to the people whom trained her in her mindscape....will she achieve...what she is looking for...soon....that is a question...that will remain unanswered...untill the right time comes....* - Tue Sep 15 18:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) lowered her hands to her sides as the white cloak slid off her form and fell onto the ground. Her hands then raised slowly and was held up infront of her form...back in the position it was in previously. She began jumping upwards slowly and later landing on her feet in a slow motion...her breathing regulated like rose had thought her in order to use her strength to its fullest potential. Her mind went a drift as punches was sent forwards into the air as they began shadow boxing with the imaginay figure infront of her. Her hair flew upwards slightly as she shifted her body swiftly from left to right..her breating slighty going harsh before going back into its regular routine. Her body had to learn how to cope with the fast movements just like the way she mastered sending kicks into the air blindly trying to make herself faster in this one area rather than in the other...not really blindly but rather..well corrdinated kicks....She thought herself as a bekon of hope...for the people whom dont have the power to do things as she had done...as in use jutsu that they deem to be something of use in every day life...

"no.."

She muttered these words under her breath softly as she shifted to the left and lowered her left arm to block the punch from ehr shadow dummy before raising up that hand to back into position go block a punch that sent her back a small step. Her body ducked slightly shifting her body to the right before before sending a swift jab to the rib of the imaginary figure that was infront of them. Imaginary sparing always raised the power level of people in dragonball z...so this may be proving usefull to her in their area of combat...She breathe outwards slowly and  rocks began to raise from her location...punches were sent forwards at a blured speed as they became supersayian one....Her hair began to turn into a white color shifting between black and white and her eyes changing slowly from emerald green to saffire  yellow.....Her body began moving in a faster pace than before due to kyo and roses training combined together..."f-faster..." Her body began to move in blurs as she moved her body backwards before going into a duck and sending a punch towards the shadow figures stomach area before pulling back and getting punched in the stomach causing her to loose  a breath of air. Paines teeth clenched softly as she pushed the imaginary figure off of them and went back into her stance. She was breathing inwards and outwards rather slowly as they now had whiteish silver hair and yellow eyes....Her breathing going back into a calm...

"mm.."

In a boxer stance, the white haired girl began jumping upwards and later landed on her feet slowly...each time going slightly above the ground before pivoting forwards towards the imaginary figure sending swift jab and punches towards the foe. She was busy sending shadow punches towards the imagary person she was shadow sparing....they were focused on training at the moment..so she would not notice anyone walking up..* - Tue Sep 15 19:23:44 2015
