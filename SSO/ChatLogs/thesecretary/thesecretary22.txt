<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) wold give them a nervous smile. The nervous girl remained in no stance as she paused for a moment not deciding to attack just yet. The nervous girls slightly dulled emerald eyes lowered as she walked forwards towards her sparing partner. "g-good l-luck" The females mind seemed to be elsewhere, but all her senses were focused on her student. Her smile slowly faded away leaving an expressionless expression as she continued her walk like she had done years ago, not running into a fight, but walking instead....However after a few moments, the nervous girl began running forwards. With each step she took, the dust that surrounded the lower half of her body began to kick up into the air...the semi unconcous nervous girl suddenly stoped going into a slide before kicked off her feet and into the air. The  nervous  upper body twisted and the rest of her body folowed suit as they began their combo. A hurricane like figure began to surround their form as her left leg was extended aiming to slam into Mirai's left side.

"mm..."

A small smile was given as she awaited her student retaliation.* - Fri Nov 13 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) the nervous girl would leg bashed against their suddenly made rotation. The nervous girl held her foot against it the rotation. THey would noticed that their rotation was caving in. The nervous girl seemed to be in paused in motion as she awaited to see how long they could keep up the rotation before finally being launched backwards into the air spinning in an anti clockwize direction before landing on her feet. The nervous female would go into a slide before coming to a stop. They were fast...she just wished that there were more people with their type of speed...but that was growing rarer in the world of shinobi they currently lived in.

Kicked off her feet, she launched back towards her sparing partner before suddenly vanishing in a blur. If they had good eyesight, they would notice a blur trail downwards and would notice paine in a couching position, her right leg extending to kick the female drectly in the stomach area. She did not want to give the female any time to rest, the small smile she had slowly faded away as she remebered a stronger rotation in the past that she was not even able to stand up to....but hers showed that it needed to be worked on greatly and was not powerfull enough to stand up against foes....however their overall speed and skill in taijutsu showed greatly and she was proud of that fact...

If her attack was successfull, Miari would of been launched within the air and she would follow suit.* - Fri Nov 13 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as the person infront of them had avoided their attack. A soft breat of air was left on her lips as she watched her sparing partner begin pivote backwards within theair in a backflip. This was something she had planned for in all actuality, As they were suspended within mid air, she suddenly pushed off the ground  using both her hands like a spring aiming to launch forwards towards her opponent. Her combo was not something that ended so easily, her right leg was then sent forwards aiming to slam into their back. If she was succesfull, a number of blurred kicks would be send as they flew west wards within the air. Upon the last kick, her opponent would of been launched further westwards as she herself landed in a short slide in a couching position before coming to a stop. The nervous girl would then raise up slowly waiting for them to raise up and come back at her with the determination they withheld in the begining.

"mm..."

A nervous smile would slowly form on her lips, her clothes slowly ruffled as the desert wind slowly began to surround her form. A soft breath would of escaped her lips as she remained in no stance, her nervous eyes would lower slightly. She loved the reflexes they had withheld within the spar and hoped to see more of it if they were able to continue. The nervous girl would watch on with hope.* - Sat Nov 14 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they began couching down as the nervous girls smile slowly faded away as they watched them dash forwards. The female would began swaying to the right as the first attack was sent her way before swaying to the left left when the second one was sent. Her right hand moved forwards to deflect their their hand aiming to move it out of the way before swaying her hand downwards at her side and swaying to the left cicling around them as they continued to send their palm strikes.  Each strike nearly hitting the female as she suddenly had grown serious since she had seen someone years ago using that stance on her years ago. 

Mirari would notice that they could not hit her at all at the moment as she decided to not hold back at this very moment. When they had sent their final palm, the female ducked downwards in a subtile spin using the dodge from their last attack and their hand would sway just above her head. Her right leg extended outwards aiming to leg sweep them  in hopes of stoping their relentless attacks. Her combo had started up again.* - Sat Nov 14 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would continue her slow walk north eastwards towards her house. The nervous girl was making her way to the house in order to water the garden she left untaken care of for a few days. She had watered them and othro said she would come by her house to help take care of them while she was away and they were happy for that, but sometimes, there are somethings that must be taken care of by your own hands. When she had gotten on the cavern to kohonoha, she seemed to have seemed lost and within her thoughs. The nervous girl sat down in her seat surroundered by other travelers.

They people around looked at the female whom closedher yeys to rest and soon after began hear chatter of alll shapes and sizes. She was listening to everyone talk and talk untill they started to become blurs as she drifted away into a light sleep. Her head leaned against the wooden walls of the cavern that slightly ruffled and buffled with each rotation of its wheels. A nervous smile would slowly form on her lips as she smelt the freesh trees from outside the window feling slightly regret that they could have been jumping from tree to tree to get to her location and would probably do it next time when she wanted to go back to suna. Three hopping was good for many times like practicing taijutsu while suspended withint the air. It helps balance and what not...it give rather good practice more or less. Opening her eyes slowly as the cavern came to a stop, she would of gotten off half way yawning softly before heading north eastwards towards her home next to the serene mountain she always loved.  She loved living by a waterfall...it was like a dream come true. When she had reached her home, she had entered her home and sighed softly. they took off her shoes at the enterence and began to make her way further within the house . She made a left at the first door and later went within the last room before falling onto her bed. 

Closing her eyes, the nervous girl fell fast asleep feeling happy that she could rest next to her favorite place in the world. The waterfall.

"b-but i w-wasnt p-planing to.....a-actually...doing...t-the...s-spar...unless...you would rather p-prefer that i s-spar you.....instead of s-someone e-else.."* - Sat Nov 14 19:03:28 2015

"t-take this...a-as your f-first l-lesson....t-this will h-help...in c-close q-quarter c-combat....if you e-ever n-need to d-do this in y-your l-life..."

"swoosh"

A soft breath of air left her lips.She wanted to see if they could....dodge it...or block it in time. They needed to stay within raidus of the mat after all.* - Sat Nov 14 19:30:46 2015

Her small smile stayed on her face as she watched Momura send a kick  upwards towards her face and paine instead slowly ducked while twisting her body in a spin allowing the kick to flow just above her head. The nervous girls right leg aimed to leg sweep them.

If they were successfull, the spin would continue before pushing off her feet aiming to send their left elbow into their stomach area.....not powerfull enough to send them flying off the matt....but just to send them rolling off of it. She was now seeing what they would do in a leg sweep situation. So far, the nervous girl was happy they they were keeping up. * - Sat Nov 14 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as they had clingged on the edges of the mat stopping their roll and nearly touching the sand. The nervous gril loved their determination and she herself raised up into a standing position as they had as well. When they dashed towards her as she was raising up and later jumped within the air. The females hand slowly raised up allowing their hand to smash into it. However As they were about to kick off of the hand, the female pushed forwards aiming to send them off the matt...or cause them to stumble off of it as they landed and tried to regain their balance due to the force she put into it.

"y-your doing w-well....k-keep it u-up..." 

The nervous female took a step forwards and her right hand raised before extending aiming to hit their chest area with their open palmed hand.* - Sat Nov 14 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would blink a few times as she watched them make a few handseals within the air. The nervous girl then saw as wires began to shoot out of their sleves and it was then the female pushed off her right foot leaving their left foot planted on the ground. They began to spin in a slight blurred like state as a hurricane like wind surrounded her form blasting away the wires that was sent to her. Upon coming to a stop, the female held up her right hand motioning that the spar was over.

"u-umm..l-lets end it h-here....y-you h-held up w-well so f-far without the u-use of ninjutsu....in c-close range c-combat....y-you...will...b-become stronger...d-dont worry..."

Their nervous smile slowly faded away leaving an expresionless face as she nodded rather slowly before flipping them onto the floor below them. After a few moments, the nervous gril would take a few steps backwards as they waited for them to raise back up. Paine was holding back still more or less,  allowing a soft breath of air to leave her lips the nervous girl would of suddenly vaished in a blur after their opponent had gotten almost to their feet. 


By the time they realized where exactly, they would feel a foot directly within their stomach sending them upwards within the air. If they had good eyesight, they would see a blur trail downwards and gaze would fall upon a crouched down paine ready to kick them within the stomach area.* - Sat Nov 14 20:43:18 2015

"mm..."

She was glad momura was not holding back, she would get to see them fight to their full potential. She had fought them in a smaller area, and now she got to fight them in a larger area....they just hopped that they did not dissappoint her.* - Sat Nov 14 20:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would give zenaki a nervous smile, as she walked forward determined to help her big sister out in cleaning up the place. The nervous gril would begin to walk forwards as she placed both hands on the dars and pushed it back into place. Picking up the three draws that were onthe ground, the nervous girl would begin to push them back into its place before putting the items in them.

"mm...d-did b-beth d-deserve it?"

She would ask curious as she got to work.* - Sat Nov 14 23:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) After she was finished over by the draws, they would move over to the fridge, pick it up with slight struggle before pushing it over to the wall making it stand up by itself. Soon after she would reach for a brook from the area by the trash can and began sweeping up the mess around the room.

"hmmm....z-zenaki....do y-you have a s-scoop?..."* - Sat Nov 14 23:57:00 2015
