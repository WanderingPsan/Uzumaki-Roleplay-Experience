After a few moments, they had finally come to a stop infront of his room which had a table and a few book. The children moved a bit away from paine as she placed the heavy stack of books next to his working desk. Both hands were placed on her knees as she bended slightly feeling exhaused. She felt her hands being grabbed before she was pulled away from her mentor, kyo. He looked back towards the girl and gave a wave...."play.....nicely now..." he yelled lazily with a sly smile. Paine's eyes were looking towards them with slight tears as she was pulled off by the children to play with them and paine was exhausted....just when was the training going to begin....

Looking back at the children, she would give them a nervious smile before noticeing the little girl she had met before. They seemed to be sleeping against a tree with the white bunny in her grasp protecting her from danger so it seemed...such a dedicated bunny it was. Paine would stand up before motioning the child to let go before waving them a goodbye. Once the other kids had left, her hands lowered and walked over towards the child whom was sleeping against the tree and later went into a crouching position. 

"a-are...you awake..."

Paine seemed to be moving in blurs, punches being sent into the air and soft beathe of air escapeing her lips with each rotation. The sound of wind being cut would be heard from her area. Her hidden emerald eyes were dulled...they seemed to be very focused on the training they were doing...building up their stanima for a better day....a brighter future....and a darker past...* - Fri Sep 18 17:59:40 2015

The sleeping girl had not responded. The other childen were marching with the old man...but she had not really seem them at all. Taking a seat next to the child whom had a bunny on her lap, paines eyes closed as she fell asleep as well feeling fatagued for some reason....was kyo's lazyness rubing off on her...but he seemed to want to send a message to her that she was not understanding.....maybe she was just dense. The nervious girl was slipping out of her meditative world and into the world of reality.

Her body movements began to slow before finally coming to a halt. Her hands unclenshed as she soot up straight as she began shake her hands from side to side trying to get back the feeling in them. It was then...she saw a farrirt being launched into the air and later turn into a poof of smoke.

"w-wahh..."

The Concealed figure was curious,  but went back into her stand and began jumping up and down slowly and her hands remaining loose letting it travel upwards and later downwards but keeping just infront of her chest area.....she was tired....but was not finished just yet....however she wanted to see what was going on in reality now...* - Fri Sep 18 18:32:57 2015

She would suddenly stop all her movements when amai was suddenly target and choked and later ummm pushed into the ground. She just stared since it was zetsumo who had done the deed.

"u-umm..."

It was then the girl was splashed with mud, Amai happened to be trying not to eat it. Her gaze was on zetsumo  and a squeel was heard from amai's form..she blinked a few times before suddenly reaching out for the girl when her gaze shifted back towards Amai....maybe...she should go back to her training....This was when she slowly went back into a fully standing position and heard a lash at Amai's waist....she was finally in pain when they had been lashed on their waist after she had pulled back....

Oh dear...And so paine began to go back to focusing on her taijutsu training as she had always doone when people around her were conversing....the nevious girl did not want to see this in her sights anymore and began to slowly walk away with her hands dangling at her sides motionless...There was always a reason she trained alone and out of sight of everyone....the distractions were everywhere....and this distraction really...made her feel off....She then heard the yelp of pain and murmers of Amai. She later turned around to stare at amai for a moment.........She was wondering if she could pick them up and go somewhere else untill zetsumo had calmed down maybe. lowering her form, she would attempt to do that action, but stopped....yes she stoped and pulled back when she saw them raise up with a grin on their face...Paine's calm eyes lowered slightly...they liked..the feeling of being wipe...the feeling...of pleasure...from torcher..was amai going to be like them to...

She began walking backwards...no...moving backwards slowly...her mind feeling heavy...the minds or others...cracked into the pleasueless ways of those whom govern above them....There....were people who had done the deed....people...whom did the deed...people whom want the deed...and people whom have dropped from the deed....which was he and which one was her....was she sopost to be heartless like them...was she sopost to have a similar blood lust to those whom torcher around her...was that what it ment to have gained power and she guessed everything happened from a normal conversation between two people and amai getting beat up...then again...amai always had a way or saying things...that made people act this way...without heart or feeling in what they do or did....it seemed...she would have to finish her training.

The Concealed Figure then turned around and began walking southwards slowly...no...very slowly...she wanted to leave to her training area to clear her head. They...did not want to think...no..they wanted to forget about what she saw...so she could keep on working along zetsumo as they had proven to uphold their promise...but...she would rather not watch them torcher anymore...or the world will soon....really know the world...of Paine...* - Fri Sep 18 19:49:45 2015

She was at the training grounds that no one came to all to often, she was alone dispite for Shin who had come here occasionly to think about things that bothered him greatly...just the perfect spot to clear his head more or less. Both hands raised to her center and both legs had spreaded out slightly before bending a bit. Taking a deep breath, she decided to begin training her punches once more out of the sight of people . Her hair began to grow to a white color before while their eyes grew to a pure yellow one. Her now calm pure yellow eyes lowered slightly as she took a deep breathe and launched her right hand forwards while letting a soft breath of air escape her lips. That hand was then retracted while paine was taking in a some air before sending forth her other hand and retracting it as well.

"sewoo"

The soft breath of air escaped her lips once more. She seemed focused right now, wanting to forget all the torcherings of kitora that ran through her mind whenever she was alone...but had they secretly enjoyed it...was torcher a pleasureable experence for them...does..the pain sooth their troubles. Pausing her punching for a moment, she shook her head fearcelly as she closed her eyes and began punching faster...trying to tire herself out so she could forget at a faster pace...but as usual...it never worked...* - Sat Sep 19 10:36:22 2015

She suddenly pushed off her feet and ran forwards before going into a slide. Her right fist was sent forward first, the sound of the wind trying to stop it would be heard, but it was not working. Her clothes ruffled as the wind bashed on it,  the water kicked up slowly making two minature water walls besides her which only went up to her ankles.  Her forcefully slid her left foot up and pulled back her right to act as support this time....the upper body twisted in order to pull back her right hand and used all her strength to send forth her left hand was sent forwards as a fist at high speeds as a side jab towards the invisable foe infront of her. However this combo did not stop here, her body was pulled into a circular spin as their left leg soon raisd inorder to do a round house kick towards the rib cage of the invisable foe in a quick motion.

As her foot touched the ground behind her, she pushed off those feet and jumped forwards, Her right hand extended backwards and was sent forwards towards their chest area and she kept running forwards sending multiple punches towards the foe whom stood before her. She was trying....she was...attempting...to defeat the individual whom stood before her. She felt liek she was succeeding...but also felt failiure in what she was doing or what she did or dident do....

"hahahahahahhaa"

She said softly as she had done the strikes....she felt her fists were getting stronger and stronger as time went on.* - Sat Sep 19 10:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) , after sending a couple punches forwards while running across the watery plain, she jumped up into the air sending two spin kicked into the air before landing in a leg sweep which ended with her left sweeped foot behind the stationed one. Pushing off the ground almost immediatly, the girl pulled back her fist and later sent it forwards aiming to punch the person in the chest area when they had landed. Paine was trying to develop new combos other than the sones she occasionly used.  She wanted to put the punches she was doing to good use and maybe even succeed in the task at hand rather than being stoped by peoples genjutsu twenty four seven.....yes...the being stoped by genjutsu or ninjutsu life was a hard one...and she had to learn how to negate that effect if she wanted to succeed in whatever she wanted to learn or do....and that was taijutsu....since she was more proficent in that...than any other art. The punch was sent before she went into a slide and pulled back the upper part of her body so she could come to a sliding stop.

The  white haired girl breath outwards slowly as she stared at her hands when it was brought up to her face. The water showed a white haired girl with pure yellow eyes. She blinked a few times feeling stunned...was...this what rose was trying to teach her....and all this she just noticed after leaving roses house. Paine breath outwards slowly as her eyes lowered...."rose..." was this the power that broke zetsumo's armor...was this the power...that she had been seeking...or what zetsumo had told her she had been wanting...Her hands clenched not wanting to think about it right now as she breath outwards slowly...calming down her heart. The white hair went back to normal and her eyes changed back from pure yellow...to emerald green. Turning around, she walked back to the tree before pulling back her hand and punching the tree that stood before her swiftly.

The whole tree shook, but it did not break or crack at all. She just wanted to test her strength that she was punching it. Paine was sure if it was her kicks, then it would of broken. Sighing softly, she pulled back her fists and began punching the tree.....Punching trees always did help for the most part..in the past* - Sat Sep 19 11:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) pulling back, she came to a stop, she turned around and sat down for a moment. She was just sending punch and after punch towards the tree, but she knew the tree couldent handel anymore of her punches and knew that it was going to just break if she had continued with her onslot.  With that she would of just been stuck going from tree to tree and killing them for no reason...yes...she did not want to kill the trees...but was able to punch to living daylight out of real people...knocking them out more or less while the other instead had killed....the blood she had on her hands was from the slashes that had went on her face from the other people who's blood had splashed on her or spued. Blood splashing on her face through er consealed blinds...blood being etched into her white cloak..similar to the time she helped infultrate kumogakure's medical center and stole all their records....

"mmm..."

Her head lowered slightly and her eyes closed for a moment, her ears listend to the winds of the forest that surrounded her. They remained still woundering...not what had exactly she been thinking about...and wanting a place to escape from it all. A hand raised and was placed on her own cheek, her breathing became slightly heavy...she was...sopost to be training right now...without care of the environment around her...but she did care about it..she could not become like zetsumo and the others. They whom were built as killing machines from birth, but she was from overseas and came here out of interest and wanted to explore and learn of this land even when her parents were against it.....Now she could see why....states warring with each other...the people...to blind to see the corruption that was made by the people whom overule them....

Do...they just see this war...as a joke as well...* - Sat Sep 19 11:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) had returned to her training area after escaping and stood infront of the tree. She began jumping up and down slowly and repeatedly...her arms followed the rythme. Her emerald eyes lowered slightly as a nervious blush appared on her face. Their right hand extend forwards to hit the tree which shook a bit under her sheer strength, but kept it under control so she would not accidentally break the tree which she used to train on since coming to this place. The others seemed to be talking about brest sizes and...just why...why were they talking about breast size measurements...they were...they were to lewd for their own good.....it was like a truth or dare match that went too far....Paine began shaking her head regaining her focus before jumping into the air and sending two kicks towards the tree in a spin. When the last rotation happened, her foot was placed on the tree and her knee bended slighly before kicking off of it and landed on the sand that was used as a gateway between the river and the lush green grass behind her.

When landing, she pulled back into her stance and began sending punches aimlessly into the air like she had done in the morning. She was shadowboxing and training by herself, her body moving in blurs not noticing Shin walk up or come by an hour or two later. The game they were probably playing was over...the nervious girl was taking no breaks in her training what so ever.

When reached, she would stop and her face would show a sign of curiousity to why they were here while the others were elsewhere. The other ninjutsu users usually played around together and trained together while she herself trained alone day and night trying to get better in the skill that she has yet to acheve.

"u-umm..." 

She tried to say, but was amazed at what they were doing with their fingers. They seemed to be doing...well..something important....she had forgotten all the handsigns so asking her about things in that area rather was a bad thing to do...howevr her curiosity still showed on her face...wondering why they were here training alone.* - Sat Sep 19 15:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would give shin a nervious smile, he was training on something probably exciting as she saw his hands grow.It was then she remebered that she had her own trainng to get back too....the girl trained when everyone else went to the bar...she trained when the others including zetsumo had gone to sleep...the nervious girl also trained when they conversed at the town square or even had hourly training sessions after they had enough of conversion. Looking back towards the river infront of them..she went back into her stance. Both hands were placed infront of her face while her legs were spaced out a bit. She then began jumping up and down slowly with her arms following the rhythme that she jumped at. "mmm..." After a few moments of waiting with slow breaths of inwards breathing and slow breaths of outwards breathing, her hands were sent forwards in blurs or three attacks with the right..left then right hand in that exact order. After those attacks were done, she stoped completely and awaited the 5 second cool down before sending the same punches again.

Paine was busy developing new combos, she was training her body to do them and training her body to retreat from them..Paine was really busy in trying to do better in the area's which she had failed. They were...well..determined. She wanted to show the same entusiasum as shin and began moving her body in blurs.
