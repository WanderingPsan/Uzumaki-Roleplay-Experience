As the bomb had exploded and smoke began to flow upwards surrounding her form. The nervous girl last thing paine would see was momora besides her while they were attempting to run around them and she herself would suddenly vanished in a blured state.

She would of appared in a crouched position besides them while her right leg aimed to smash into their rib cage...or if they turned around to see her....their stomach area.

If they did waited for the smoke to cover up her whole form and the area around them....the nervous girl would kick off her right foot and go into a blurred spin before lowering herself in a leg sweep fashion aiming to clear out the smoke from the smoke bomb....A hurricane like wind would have surrounded her form expanding outwards. Momora may have been tripped...If she was Successfull, once she felt the feeling of hitting something, her spin would have stopped before she pivoted backwards out of the smoke....She had tried using smoke against zetsumo from her front lotus technique effect....she came from them behind as well...it was a mistake she never wanted to repeat again...momura now reminded her a little of about herself..

However, she sent forwards her right foot to clash against their own, but did not put enough strength into it and would end it tripping.  While they were falling, her the upper part of their body twisted and the rest of their body followed suit following the spin in a blured state. Her right leg extended outwards aiming to kick momura's shoulder sending them southwards in her rotation and soon afterwards be send downwards onto mana's ribs area sending them northwards.

The nervous girl remained silent during her second to last rotation as she watched momura throw a kuni towards her. Their right hand suddenly  touched the ground before her right foot came downwards sliding across the ground before her....dust kicked up into the air as her conjured up wind blew back the kuni. Ending her hurricane like spin, with one foot behind the other..watching as both student were in the middle of dynamic entrying her....The teacher suddenly kicked up into the air  continueing their combo and her body twisted allowing the lower part of her body to follow behind them. 

Her right foot suddenly extended outwards aiming to slam into mana's own foot before moving over to momura.They would have forcely spun in a circular motion forwards before clashing into eachother within mid air before crashing onto the ground. The nervous girl would then turn around and blink as she waited for them to raise back up....

She had to teach them how to use dynamic entry when with a partner later.* - Tue Nov 17 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would begin to walk northwards.* - Tue Nov 17 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) would be reading the messenger bird  message she had gotten from othro. She had no idea that he was actually going to war with....them in the slightest. Raising up rather slowly from her seating, she would close the scroll before begining her walk eastwards out of the house and towards the gate...she wa going to visit their friend once more.....ithis was something she wanted to talk with them about or ask personally.* - Tue Nov 17 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) had seemed to have left sunagakure in a hurry with a scroll in her hands. The guards waved hello but the nervous women did not seem to noticed...her mind was lost in worry for a person she cared about. Even those these were his worlds and this was his will...as well as resolve...her heart felt out of place a little and it made her feel uneasy. The walk though the desert was a long one and slow one....her hat blocking out the sun from hurting her soft skin. They thought of many ways that he could have died....why he wanted to leave her in a world like this of all things...and even his sister. Their right hand slowly raised and was slowly placed over her heart  as she inhaled and later exhaled softly a breath of air as she made her way into the forested area where the settlement was located.  Her mind felt like some sort of limbo....all dark with different memories from before to now. Their mind seemed trapped to repeat the same senerio over and over and over again...her body..feeling the breeze of thoughts slowly passing her by...a million thoughts continueing and continueing with no end...her clothes ruffling as she stayed in suspended floating.  She saw her real self in a distance surrounded by three people that looked like the three teachers she had met so far. However when she had floated closer or allowed herself to drift closer to them...the nervous girl was suddenly stoped by a slowly raised up hand....it was a place she could not go yet....and wondered why...it was...her mind...wasnt it.Her gaze slowly looked over towards her  memories that let upp up to the place or area she was currently at.

Her body straighting up into a standing position as she suddenly felt some sort of surface under her feet and began walking in the said direction. She was searching for something within her past experiences that she could of would have said when she had mett them again. In realitly, her dulled out eyes seemed to be apparent as she began to push of her feet and into a tree. They were about to start traveling by trees and their pace was a fast one as she traveled to her destination. Her speed quickened and quickened as she continued to her place of destination. What exactly....no...why exactly was she on her way to this location...this camp sight...her home which they said she was welcomed to be at and come back to any time....just like yan and the others said with suna....similar to what maloth had said about kumo....She now had another whom was close to them becomeing a villan and she of course overheard their name being used in some sort of bounty....no...game to the people of suna....whomever kills this person first wins....whom ever find that person...wins?....they treated someones life like a game....this hurt her greatly...they see a bounty...and they all charge forwards to it like it was some sort of joke.....She wanted to find them....before it was too late and felt that there was only one place they could have gone....however first...they decided to stop by the settlement just to see how it was holding up...her home...or better yet...second home.

Upon landing infront of the gates, she turned and faced the guards and began walking though. They would have allowed her in without hesitation given the leaders last words.....but where could he have been...or where could he have gone.....where was this person. Her movements stopped  as she gentally punched the tree causing leafes to slowly fall downwards and surround her form. A soft breath of air would have escaped her lips as she muttered the words from under her breath.

"p-please...be...a-alive.."* - Tue Nov 17 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) stood infront of the lake. Both arms raised as a soft breath of air escaped her lips as an attempt to calm down her heart. The nervous girl soon after began jumping up into the air before landing on her feet.  This would have gone on repeatedly and slowly with her arms following her movements. Suddenly blurs were seen as her arms were....no...as her fists were sent forwards towards the lake in percision before being retracted. With each punch she did, a soft wind blew the water....caused small ripples more or less. This was what hat happened when a taijutsu master had trained next to the lake...the wind she had emitted from each of her strikes had remained something that was constant and was visable. The nervous girl was training to become the best fighter she could be...they decided to stop her training for a while when zenaki had gotten pregnant...she wanted to see the birth of their child...but now she had students...and she had to teach them....They rather regretted staying in that village for so long...she even had thoughts of joining more or less.

They were going to do physical training before going within their mindscape and seeking out her teacher zen. * - Tue Nov 17 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) as her last punch was sent, her body followed the rotation and she began to spin in a circular motion as her body lowered swiftly, her leg slid arcross the ground causing dirt to kick upwards and conjurgered up wind to expand outwards towards the lake causing slightly larger ripples. When her leg was on the other side of her body, they quickly pushed her self up using her bend leg. The leg that was extended would close in before being extended oulwards for a round house kick. The wind that was carried from her feet would blow upwards diagonally into the air before her spin finally came to a stop and she was facing the river infront of her standing sideways. Her movements was paused as she thought of different ways to continue her combo....she did not always want to rely on her taijutsu techniques....somethings that were hidden were almost about to seep out...so she was begining to seem worried. A soft breath of air would escape her lips as she remebered that she left without mana.

Shaking her head a few times, she began sending blured punches with each of her hands southwards. She had to begin training again.* - Tue Nov 17 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) with each punch sent, her movements began become faster and faster before suddenly coming to a stop. They seemed to be breathing outwards slightly heavily as she began jumping upwards and later flowing downwards onto the ground. Each of her movements was a slow one before she came to a stop and stood up straight infront of the late. Her hands were shaking as her mind seemed to be lost...they were wondering where their limit was...what their limit was....her heart making her uneasy and what not. It was then she sat down infront of the lake. They had seated themselves into a meditative position as her eyes slowly closed. The sound of the birds...trees....the movement of the rivers....lakes and trees...began to become a blur as the whole world began to suddenly fade away out of her grasp...it was becoming uncolored as her spirit left this world and went into another....she was leaving this reality and going into her meditative plane.

A soft breathe of air escaped her lips as her heart rate began to slow down and a breathing began to seem non exsitant...the calmness in her heart begin to take hold and wrap its torns and vines all over body. New sounds soon after was heard...alot of talking...alot of laughter...as the area she was sleeping in sitting up made her hadns feel cold and sent a chill down her spine. Opening her eyes slowly she saw a jar of coffe beans...salt...different bottles of wines tops. It was her mindscape. THe nervous girl slowly rose up as her right hand raised to cover her mouth slightly as she yawned softly alerting zen whom was working behind the counter.* - Tue Nov 17 17:18:56 2015
