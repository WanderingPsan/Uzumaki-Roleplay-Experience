<br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

The four ink cats that were around her form, but at a distance as one of her punches may cause her to send them flying and she did not want to do that to the cute ink cats. Each of her swift punches left a gust of air to be sent forwards away from her for but not at a far distance before being retracted. The girl only hoped to become faster than she already was...to maybe max the skill that the others had at dodging attacks that were below her speed of kicking or punching....The routine kept going and time and time passed...the people whom surrounded the area just left after a certain time and she was by herself trying to become better in what she did....wanting to work hard...no harder in progressing in her skill while the others had it easy....A white strand of hair as she  suddenly became motionless...her breathing was slightly harsh but was kept maintained as she wanted to train to her fullest....Falling backwards...one of the ink cats would sit up from their position and she would fall back against their side and later her head rested on their back.

The pure yellow calm eyes of the girl lowered slightly as a small smile formed...She was tired and had just started in her training...but a small break did not hurt as rose always told her to stop when they  thought she had had enough....she trained herself to exhaustion in the real world..as well as in the mental world...was this what she wanted to drive herself to becoming powerfull..or more powerfull in the future....zetsumo always did say to train her techniques untill mastery so she would not be made a laughing stock in the battle field... 

Her right hand raised to her center and paine had stared at it for a moment sighing softly allowing a breath of air to escape her lips....* - Tue Sep 15 19:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Who is this....? I don't recognize them at all. - Tue Sep 15 20:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) pushing herself up from off the ground, her arms felt slightly weak as well as her legs. She stummbled slightly before regaining her footing...both hands raised in a fist form infront of her face...she had trained punching enough and decided to focus on her movement from left to right and later below. Her body shifted to the right before going to the left in a quickened pace. She then went blow slowly before coming back up towards the right. The rotation kept getting faster and faster as her white hair went from left to right jiggling and flowing with the wind. Her pure yellow calm eyes showed determination as she used this skill...wanting to get faster and faster with each new cycle....the will of the others...etched into her...the feeling of wanting to catch up to those whom far surpassed her....

"mmm..."

A soft voice escaped her lips as she began moving slowing as the tiredness began to get to her...her will slowly pushing herself to get stronger in her movements..light sweat began to slowly go off to the right of her from and towards the left. The nervious girl seemed to be focused her training at the moment not noticing anyone really walking up.

She Currently had white hair and pure calm yellow eyes in a boxer stance moving from left to right in a blured motion.* - Tue Sep 15 20:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would become slower and slower before finally coming to a stop. Both hands rested at her sides as she fell back into a sitting position on one of the ink cats. A small smile was on her lips as she picked up her hat and placed it upon her head. Her hair returned to its black color and her eyes changed back from pure yellow to emerald green. She breath inwards and outwards slowly as she she raised her legs off the ground and the ink cat began carrying her back towards the square...it was time for her to see what the others were up too since she had been gone for a while and it was apperently night time at the moment...just another thing to look forward too when your in a group of people right...

She would sigh softly as she put on her cloak and closed her eyes...her breathing becomin regularted once more...it was time to rest..* - Tue Sep 15 20:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would nod as she opened her rose up both hands and began unzipping her cloak before allowing it to fall to the ground. A hand would then raise to pull back her hand so it would rest at the back of her head. The nervious girl wanted absolute mobility at the moment as she wanted her kickes to be much faster and a bit more accurate than before.  Both hands rested at her side as she closed her eyes and began breathing inwards and outwards rather slowly. The ground below her cracked slighty as her hair began changing from black to a white color while her eyes changed from  an emerald green to pure yellow color. Small pebbles of rocks began to raise up from the ground and surround her form as this happened....She had acheved super sayain one....woosh!!!

"u-umm....il try.."

A nervious smile was given to them.

The White haired girl had done this after she had listened to his speech. She rushed forwards at a faster speed than before and her right arm retracted backwards when she had reached a good striking position. Her right foot touched the ground and the right hand was sent forwards towards their chest area at a blured speed aiming to damage them. Her right knee bended slightly in preperation to activate her combo if they avoided or blocked in some way......her yellow calm eyes showed essence of her determination while her face showed no expression showing that they were focused at the moment....

It was time to!!! battle!!!* - Tue Sep 15 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

They moved backwards as paine was after them, she herself just following them as they made their motion to preserve whatever placing they her. Her plan however was something unheard of....or rather she did not have a plan at all...they were just going to attack and go with the flow. The pure yellow calm eyes women kept her gaze on zetsumo as she continued her run towards them. She began to activate her combo as she steped on her right foot bending her knee slightly before pushing off into the air at the spot they zetsumo had moved back from. Slightly above the ground and in the air, her body twisted in a very fast spind delivering a round house kick towards the first mud ball making a dent causing it to go off path and go besides her as she continued her way towards them.  A dozen were fired and she continued her charge towards him. Each side kick getting faster...cracking sounds heard from the mud balls that met her foot echoed slightly before she jumped into the air avoiding the second to last mud ball before suddenly spinning in a downwards spiral towards the mud bullet that was fired towards her.

As her foot landed on the mud ball, a dent was made and she pushed herself forwards quickly before jumping forwards in a digaonal downwards direction directly towards zetsumo. She spun in a cirular motion  as a violent hurricane like wind surrounded  her form aiming to strike them on the shoulder.....unless they moved of course...

Paine breathe inwards and outwards slowly as this attack was done remembering roses training...she aimed to try her best during the spars she had with zetsumo once ever three months....oh dear...

"m-mm..."* - Tue Sep 15 23:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Wed Sep 16 00:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) her left foot came downwards in a blur as her right foot slid downwards off his arm as they moved back towards her left aiming to get some distance. As she came downwards, her left foot's heel hit the ground causing it to crack under her strength and the wind to be blown outwards. The treads would of slaped against the back of her left hand....She quickly raised up and dashed forwards after them not ready to give up just yet as they began to form more hands seals...The stinging senseation she felt in her left hand had served as a reminder of what she was to expect in the future of this spar...

She jumped into the air quickly mid run going to an air attack once more before turning sideways in a spinning motion. A violent hurricane like wind surrounded the white haired girl with pure yellow eyes as she spin in a downwards spiral as the strong large gust of wind was sent in her direction.  Her right foot was extended forwards aiming to strike as the force that came behind the attack kept her pushing against the strong gust of wind that was trying to push her backwards.

"mmhaa!!!"

she yelled as they began to remain frozen as her foot was slowly going against the gust of wind trying to push through it but was to no advail. She was sent backwards from her susspended position after a few moments and landed on her feet in a slide. She rose slowly before running towards them once more keeping an eye out for whatever techniques they may use...prepareing herself for the combo that she was about to activate..or use...

she needed a plan...oh dear...* - Wed Sep 16 00:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

Continued her run forwards towards zetsumo whom was infront of her.  She pushed forwards off her feet into a dive allowing the threats that came towards her legs to slightly touched against the sides of her shoes. She went into roll in the mud and later a crouching position sliding closer to them. This was when she saw a wave of mud coming towards them...it was like zetsumo had a plan for everything...and so she had to approch this from a different angle...

She pushed off her feet and waited untill she was directly above him and the wave before coming directly downwards and slightly diagonal towards them with a dynamic entry strike towards their face...she was going to hit them with a d rank skill...she was a true warrior at best...Her calm yellow eyes lowered slightly...Paine seemed strangly calm at the moment as the words of her sparing partner began to become a blur to her...

Her focus was on his body at the moment.

"mm.."* - Wed Sep 16 00:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

Zetsumo had hit against her foot had hit against his hardened face or upper chest since they tackled her. A cracking sound might of been heard on his body...maybe....Her knee bended slightly as they went backwards in mid air. She kicked off of them in a counter-clockwize sideways very fast spin as she aimed to send them upwards higher into the air....the extend left foot heading towards their stomach area knowing she herself had the power to do this...A soft  breath escaped then nervious girls lips as she pulled forwards with all her strength aiming to crack the doton armor

If her attack was successfull a whirlwind like firgure would begin to surround her form as they sent multiple kicks towards their stomach area aiming to send them even higher into the air....

It was time to use her hidden technique.....To those now entering the area...Paine currently had White hair and Pure yellow eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) //

Her attacks had hit and she began to use the rough version of the technique she had been training to use when she had needed it. As she was sending multiple kicks towards their stomach area keeping them in the air sending them up higher, she felt the two threst strucks her wrists and later begun coiling around it during her spin...She decided her time was short and had to act quuickly.....

As her last kick was made shifting her body towards the left a bit, she suddenly retracted her foot  and zetsumo fell downwards besides her. A hand extend to hold his arm quickly as was pulled downwards towards the ground. They bodys began spinning and spinning  before a violent hurricane like shape took both of their forms hole....the technique how ever was imcomplete given she was still learning...

If she was successfull in catching their arm during her spin...

When they were about to hit the ground, she let go placed her hands on the ground bending her elbows before pushing off in a very fast motion. A loud exposion would of been heard following a cloud of dusted smoke....But zetsumo would maybe be alright...because...

Doton Armor is Life!!!!

Landing on her feet, she rose up breathing slightly heavily...A calm pure yellow eyes just stared at the smoke wonder while her face showed a bit of worry.

"z-zetsumo?"* - Wed Sep 16 01:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would blink  for a moment as she saw the threads comeing towards her. She begun her movement towards and around the cloud of smoke that zetsumo had hid himself in...he was taking note of what she had achieved during her training sessions along and out of the eyes of the people around her. She kept her speedy run around the cloud of smoke as it began to slowly subside...She herself was begining to feel tired however...but still she suddenly stoped in a slide before running directly towards them and jumping up into the air. 

She had ran around the cloud to avoid the threads that shot out towards the location she was at.

Her body twisted in a very fast motion causing the a violent hurricane like wind to surround her form.  She was going towards them once again not giving up just yet. Zetsumo would notice the cloud of smoke suddenly vanishing from behind them as a leg aimed to hit their rib cage with the fullness of her strength.

However...for a person like them...they may expect an attack from behind...but still she did not let up even once....mmm...* - Wed Sep 16 02:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would spin in a circular motion as the threads went around her waist grabing her. they spin and spin untill she sat on the ground with her arms binded. Strands of her white hair slowly went to slightly cover her face as her pure yellow calm eyes blinked a few times...

She was now trapped...once more..

A nervious smile was then given figuring she was finally done with the spar....and the bout was over.....An ink cat that was made for her would walk over and sit on her lap...today seemed to be a productive day.* - Wed Sep 16 02:54:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would raise up her right to put on her hat asusuming zetsumo had put away his threads. Her smile turned into one of no expression before suddenly giving zetsumo a small smile. She really did need to get faster...Her concealed eyes would begin to turn back to an emerald green color while her hair changed back to a black color.

A hand reached for one of the loose threads as she began spinning it like a lasso and later tossed it in the direction of her cloak. Once it had cought on it...she pulled it back to her and later it rested in her arms.

The cloak was then put on...her legs moved into a meditative position soon after wards and her eyes were closed. She was now going to rest.* - Wed Sep 16 03:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Katsune is awake isn't she. - Wed Sep 16 04:28:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: They butchered an entire people based on a trait. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Only because they were genetically superior. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: There are lots more people with other genetic traits that aren't doujutsu. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why did the doujutsu users specifically got targetted when the others with other types of elements weren't? - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Ignorance. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wait. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Because. Genetics aren't as easily stolen. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even so . . . A good enough medic who knows what he's doing can steal genetics as well . . . Just give it time. - Wed Sep 16 05:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Humans are so quick to try and obtain what is not theirs. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I thought Tethys would know that I also have my own good genetic traits . . . Yet he still insisted on inviting me while his village was killing off doujutsu users who were also just as genetically superior. - Wed Sep 16 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: In hindsight my actions were.... Untimely... Oh, well... - Wed Sep 16 05:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You seemed troubled when he used a genjutsu on Beth. I assume you've remembered what happened recently. - Wed Sep 16 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not troubled. - Wed Sep 16 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just curious. - Wed Sep 16 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Goes to show that his genjutsu is strong if he could incapacitate Beth. - Wed Sep 16 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Bored though. - Wed Sep 16 05:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You really need to learn how to conserve your energy more so things like sleeping would be more rare. - Wed Sep 16 07:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you suggesting I don't just lie around all day every day? - Wed Sep 16 07:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Cause I'm pretty sure I just lie around all day every day. - Wed Sep 16 07:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wasn't suggesting that . . . Though I was thinking there could be better ways than that. It could be just me though. If I sleep, I sleep for hours though I don't take naps mid day. - Wed Sep 16 07:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't really have any ideas. - Wed Sep 16 08:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd suggest going out for some tea . . . But . . . You know. - Wed Sep 16 08:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way, I'm going to need to buy some new books. - Wed Sep 16 08:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't see much point in tea. - Wed Sep 16 08:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Would've been easy to go through all of that with no harm done. Get what we went there for...and leave. - Wed Sep 16 08:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And never betray Zetsumo in the process. - Wed Sep 16 08:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not everything goes exactly to plan. - Wed Sep 16 08:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a fan of the strongest leading every mission every time. - Wed Sep 16 08:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need a hierarchy like other villages. Chuunin when you prove you're intelligent enough, and strong enough. Not just the latter. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd prefer if the most calculating lead the missions. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good at planning, and responsible. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The examins let people see how good your plans really are. In public. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not some pretentious idiot that thinks they're good at math. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because they score high on some meaningless test that doesn't help in a real mission. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'd be better if the chuunin exams tested your ability to lead people. - Wed Sep 16 08:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. - Wed Sep 16 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're shinobi. If you're put on a mission you follow the leader no matter what. - Wed Sep 16 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The leader doesn't need to be charismatic. It's -your- responsibility to follow. Not theirs to make you. - Wed Sep 16 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I -ever- have to deal with someone pulling that crap...even if I'm not the mission leader. - Wed Sep 16 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The squad'll have my vote for cutting them down without a second thought. - Wed Sep 16 08:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No matter who it is. - Wed Sep 16 08:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I meant that how good their plans are and not if they're charismatic. If they make up plans that get people killed then they shouldn't ever be picked as squad leaders. - Wed Sep 16 08:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Unless it's a suicide mission with or without plans. - Wed Sep 16 08:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If the plan gets the job done during those kind of missions then it's not that bad. - Wed Sep 16 08:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right then. - Wed Sep 16 08:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that, The Gezo hold power in the world though. - Wed Sep 16 08:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As much as I hate to say that. - Wed Sep 16 08:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Someone will put them down. - Wed Sep 16 08:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was told to say nothing. - Wed Sep 16 08:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I learned no such thing. - Wed Sep 16 08:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Never mind. Forget you heard that. - Wed Sep 16 08:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You ever planning to become one? Perhaps even a sergeant? - Wed Sep 16 08:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was a plan at one point. . . - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orakuru's. Not mine. - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The plan was.... - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Work our way up in the Gezo. And then, Zetsumo would be proud of us. Maybe more trusting. - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then maybe we could change how things work in Kenryoku. - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We were never gonna betray. - Wed Sep 16 08:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I talked him out of that. - Wed Sep 16 08:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This war is for nothing. - Wed Sep 16 08:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Pointless wars happen . . . No matter what time is it. - Wed Sep 16 08:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Someone will always come up with a reason to fight. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not the -point-. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I only made a comment. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is the reason for Zetsumo's paranoia. It's why our quality of life is gone. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He won't believe me no matter what I say though until these seals are gone. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't fret, We'll get everything back. - Wed Sep 16 08:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...still. - Wed Sep 16 08:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Never mind. - Wed Sep 16 08:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Done talking about that. - Wed Sep 16 08:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Change of topic is best. I've probably said enough as well. - Wed Sep 16 08:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 16 08:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What matters right now . . . Is getting stronger individually to be even stronger as a group. - Wed Sep 16 08:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only thing I care about right now... - Wed Sep 16 08:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You probably wouldn't wanna spar if I'm holding back, would you? - Wed Sep 16 10:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why do you want to hold back against me? - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd only be using techniques I'm inexperienced with. - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Attacking Zetsumo for daring to retrieve his missing nin, after he gave Sunagakure a fair warning? - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know for a fact . . . If it comes down to it . . . Ushinawa will enjoy fighting against Kumogakure the most. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If we have to fight Niza . . . Give me a second to ask him a question before you go off and try to kill him. - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: This is much like a game of chess if you think about it... You move too early and you will find yourself countered, you reveal your hand, and you lose the advantage. You move too late, you won't be able to move at all. - Wed Sep 16 12:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Save Zetsumo. - Wed Sep 16 12:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way, He said he only wants to kill Zetsumo and no one else from the Kenryoku. - Wed Sep 16 12:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Zetsumo is us - Wed Sep 16 12:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And for the record I tell Zetsumo all of the time that I'm not his tool. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Very well - Wed Sep 16 12:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It was all taken the moment Fujitora abandoned us - Wed Sep 16 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One day either Zetsumo will be dead, or it won't matter whether he's alive or not...because he'll have conquered everything. I'm just waiting for whichever comes first. - Wed Sep 16 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You'll get nowhere if you will forever consider yourself fodder . . . That's for certain. - Wed Sep 16 12:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I certainly am not - Wed Sep 16 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It seems the legacy of Kastya was indeed nothing in the end. - Wed Sep 16 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'm not worth much, I am a tool to be used and that is all - Wed Sep 16 12:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: If my master no longer has use for me or leves me - Wed Sep 16 12:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps, but your whole existence stipulates on someone who sees your worth as nothing more than a Kunai, its okay to serve your master. - Wed Sep 16 12:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But when you grovel at his feet like an insect. - Wed Sep 16 12:15:47 2015
