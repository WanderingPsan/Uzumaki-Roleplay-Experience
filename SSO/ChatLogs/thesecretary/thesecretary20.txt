"mm.."

A soft breath of air would of escaped her lips before following them up into the air if her attack had hit if she was successfull.

"swbushhooshhh!!!!!"

The ground below the both of them began to cave in causing a minature crator to form below the both of them. Before her next leg was sent forwards towards their elbow which they used for defence. Her kicks were slowly levitating them above the ground with each one they had done. The nervous girl aimed to send them high into the air, they had planned to do this...and there were more ways than one....

If she was Successfull,

Upon her  third kick to last kick deciding to end it there and early....they would have twisted their body in a blur in a anti clockwize direction creating a violent hurricane like wind to keep them suspended within mid air.

Makoto would of notice that they were being suspened within the air due to her violent hurricane like wind.* - Wed Nov 11 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) would watch as her second kick missed and they landed on the ground as they jumped backwards to think to them for a moment. Her opponent seemed to be thinking to themselves...as they grinned and yelled out words of some sort of gate....strange women...oh dear. When they charged towards pane, she dashed forwards as well, her body twisted in a blur as they sent blurred punched towards her. With shift of the females made, a new roation of kicks was made causing wind to blow about around the area. THis was going to be a serious spar and her users strength was higher on the first blow causing her to stagger backwards in a spinn before placing her hands on the ground and and sending four blurred kicks towards their opponent. 

Pushing off the ground with their hand, their right foot had touched the ground quickly while their left foot was sent forwards aiming to give the female a standing point to combat them. However towards her sixed kick, the were send spinning backwards before placing their foot in on the ground. Both feet acked as they stared at their opponent with a nervous smile. 

"mmm....d-do...you w-wish to keep g-going..."

They seemed to be not tired but wanted to know if they could keep going or not. IF they could, she would activate her mode. Her hair would turn to a white color while her eyes turned from emerald green to a pure yellow hue before suddenly levitating slightly as if she was within water.

""now..k-kilm...whom was k-killed..by a c-comrad...for r-reason...u-unknown..."

She slowly began to walk towards the exit before suddenly stoping. Her gaze looked back towards Mirai. "we...were all...s-so post to...live...we..w-were all sopost...to b-be able to trust..o-one another....not k-kill eachother off...our f-family...is s-slowly b-breaking as...time..p-passes on...and it s-started all...with z-zetsumo....."Her voice slowly began craking more towards the end of her words as tears began to form from the nervous girls eyes. She two people, whoms deaths she knew nothing about...she thought they were all going to be ok...that they were all going to be safe if they just stuck together...but instead...her own family began to kill eachother...because the trust was not there...it was because to trust...never existed....and was never to be placed in such a choatic group with broken personalites. Even when they were resting at a base camp in the wilderness, she would watch the others group up from behind her a fence being too nervous to actually walk up to them...and talk to them...join in on their truth of dear, or just go drinking with them. The nervous girl would always walk away from them...to begin her training....she would walk away from her family...her friends to do her training...trying to get better in the area she could do greatly and the best in....but was it worth it....was it worth not being able to spend enough time with the people she loved...they had finally seen zetsumo after a long ammount of time only to have him die off without the both of them having much time to converse....katsune would drag her to chat with the group...but as time went on after the torcher session they had....the womens mind broke....and they had become more distance from the nervous girl...the both of them no longer could form sentences non the less words with eachother...then what was the point of even knowing them...in the first place...but she was glad she did. 

She was losing everyone because she would rather train in silence..alone in some forest...rather than spend time with her loved ones..what was it she wanted to do....what was it should she do now.It was then she heard koji's words. "mm...." Raising up her left arm as her right hand lowered to her side, the nervous girl began wiping her eyes as she continued her walk to the exit. They were going to search for katsune personally, she wanted to know why they would do such a thing to their family memeber...the thought and the whole situation did not sit right with her at all. Her heart was pounding with regret...and her mind filled with lies she told herself about it not being true...when she knew it was since a police force member would not lie about such things...and definately not sanoke..she hoped. Her hands clenched as her body shifted in a blur as a gust of wind blew greatly towards the door knocking it open fearsly leaving a craking sound to be heard thought the room. 

'crackle!!'

The nervous girl wanted answered...and was heading towards the gate unless stopped.* - Thu Nov 12 05:28:32 2015
