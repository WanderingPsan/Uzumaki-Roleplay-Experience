<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently observed the scene. The boy had revealed a sharpened black gem; she had to wonder how he managed to smuggle such a thing into the prison to begin with. Did a shinobi not search him before throwing him in? What if he had some kind of bomb and planned on blowing up as soon the time was right and a crowd had formed?

The girl took a hesitant step backwards following that thought. Inside she felt conflicted; however, as she wished to watch closely as his life came to an end. She wanted to see every last pain plagued moment of his life...to be witness to the coming of the end. To live through the pain with him. An instant death would not grant her such; however, so she chose to do her best to disuade him from commiting the act he seemed to be content with carrying out.

"Don't take your own life. That'll only offer you nothing in death, you'll be the lowest of the low. If you're misunderstood then allow your slayer to live out that sentence if they're ultimately wrong. There is no reason to remove the benefit of the doubt for yourself. Killing yourself now only makes the fact of you being guitly seem much more obvious."

The girl's tone was shakey due to her anticipation. Deep down she was extremely joyed to be present for this. Adrenaline began to pump and she was beginning the long climb to what would ultimately be a climax in reaction to the pain,

"Don't damn yourself now..."

the final words spoken behind jet black eyes that seemed to manifest their own endless abyss within. * - Fri Oct 23 20:33:04 2015

They lived in a village that was more or less made of sand, and now she was being asked to sweep the sand from the steps? She honetly couldn't see what such an action would accomplish as sand would simply be blown to cover what was swept almost instantly. 

She knew better than to insubordinate, or question the kage; however, and assumed it was more of a mission to simply keep her busy. She'd probably have to do quite a few of these before she'd be trusted with a more impactful mission. 

After a swift bow the girl turned away from the kage and began to make her way toward the kage mansion. She'd never really paid much attention to it, and as a result didn't even know if it actually had steps. If the steps were there she'd find them.

She'd been given a broom, but had decided to use another method to sweep the steps while also getting a chance to practice one of the techniques she'd previously been taught by Marissa. After a drawn-out sigh the girl got to business. She made her way to the top of the stairs then turned to face them. With her focus on the bottom the girl had just the technique in mind.

Wihthout any more hesitation she clasped her hands together and began to focus her chakra before chanting in her head,

"Fuuton: Gale Palm."

A gust of wind was expelled forth from the girl's body that carried enough power to rid the steps of any sand that may of previously occupied them. Due to her lack of mastery the jutsu wouldn't be threatening to anything else which meant the girl didn't have to really worry about being scolded for firing off a jutsu in the village...at least she hoped she wasn't.

Happy with herself she made her way back to the kage at a brisk pace. When she was once again within a suitable distance she'd state in an up-beat tone,

"The deed is done sir."* - Sat Oct 24 20:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl's response came in a -very- detailed manner about her spec. She didn't hold anything back since she was in the presense of two allies and it'd give them the highest chance of success if her leader knew exactly what he was working with.

First she started out by explaining which jutsu she was capable of using; http://puu.sh/kWcAx/4af85833d0.png .

Next she explained her physical ability, or lack thereof, along with other minor details about her capablities: http://puu.sh/kWcHG/693972b12d.png http://puu.sh/kWcJK/812940f4d6.png .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl remained silent as the elder shinobi explained the situation to her in detail. She nodded here and then as an indictaiton that she understood her task and what she needed to do. It was quite simple, really. She needed to barrage the unsuspecting shinobi with a wind technique that'd double as a sort of cover for her squad mate utilizing the sandy enviroment that their village was placed in. How hard could that be? 

As soon as her leader had finished the debrief the squad moved out. Within a few moments the target location was in clear vision for them. Upon first glance it didn't seem like much, but she knew better than to ever understimate anyone. That's how people ended up dying in dumb situations. Every muscle in her body was tense, and she was honestly nervous. A pit had most certainly opened in her stomache. This was her first mission and she was being put on the spot as the first acting shinobi in the assault. She felt like her team relied on her to not fuck up even if Koji could probably jump in and obliterate the entire place without much effort on his part.

After taking a deep breath in a futile attempt to calm her nerves; the girl did her best to focus on the task at hand. In a shroud of silence the female began to form a string of handseals: Tiger, Ox, Dog, Rabbit, Snake. After she was finished the girl focused on pooling a large amount of chakra in her chest. Next she inhaled deeply,

"Fuuton: Daitoppa!"

she chanted in her head, before expelling a large amount of forceful wind directly infront of her. As the wind cascaded forward it kicked up a huge amount of sand. The shinobi directly in it's path crossed their arms as a means to block it and thus were rendered unable to perofrm any action during it's effect. This made it the perfect technique to synergize with the plan,

"Step one complete. Now I gotta do my best to render what aid I can on the inside."

the girl thought to herself as she motioned toward the village at a brisk pace, aiming to keep a fairly large distance between herself and any enemy shinobi.

* - Sat Oct 24 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl moved foward, remaining mindful of the words spoken by her leader. The Byakugan sure was useful; she knew exactly where the enemies where before she even saw them, or they saw her. It was quite amazing, really. She listened as she was instructed to end the life of the shinobi with her air bullets, but she something flashier in mind.

One hand dipped into her backpouch while she continued forward. Once within a more suitable distance the girl withdrew her hand with the pouch that now contained two shuriken for the bandits that remamained. Without much of a visual effect the girl infused her fuuton-based chakra into the items before throwing them toward the four bandits.

While in the air it became clear that four shuriken had actually been thrown. The two managed to evade vision due to a technique that was in use. The girl immediately began to form another set of handseals, causing the shuriken to increase the rate at which they rotated. 

Forming another set of seals the girl activated the final part of her plan,

"Wind Style: Gale Palm!"

she yelled out while clapping her hands together, causing a large amount of wind to be expelled forward from her body. This increased the speed of the already chakra infused and rotating shuriken while also whipping up more sand to make them harder to see for their targets. The sound of four slashes resonated through the area.

When the sand cleared it was obvious that each shuriken had found it's mark when all that remained of the four bandits were four low life corpses. With them down she made her way to where Koji had gone. She did nothing to stop him from killing the man, and even enjoyed watching it. She fed off of the pain of others.

Assuming everything went to plan she'd pack up with her squad and head back to the village successful.* - Sun Oct 25 00:02:33 2015
