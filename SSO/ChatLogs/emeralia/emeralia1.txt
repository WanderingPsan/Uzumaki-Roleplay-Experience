<br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently roamed the inner part of her village in her usual, dull demeanor. Her hands remained at rest in her pockets while her eyes were directed toward the stone ahead of her. After several moments of dauntless travel the faint figure of two feet motionining in the opposite direction became visible to her upon the horizon.

She wished to make some sort of small talk with the figure, but that was by fer her biggest crutch and was the main reason she wasn't well aquainted with most of the people that resided in the village. She had passed through the academy with only really being noticed when she answered the occasional question, or during her final test where she managed to pass with flying colours just as anyone with basically no social life would. 

A single hand was drawn from a pocket and waved toward the person as they passed, she slowed the moment they were directly next to each other, but did not go out of her way in an attempt to stop the person. If he stopped on his own that was all good for her, but if he kept going she'd simply look back at him before continuing.* - Mon Oct 19 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl turned to face the boy she'd passed when she noticed that his foot steps had completely halted. Dark, inifite eyes met those of her opposite number for a few moments, but she still refused to offer any sort of vocalization to the younger child. 

Upon turning a headband became apparent on the girl's leg to match, but her overall physique and grace that she moved with was most likely more than enough to give away that she was not an ordinary civilian...even if she wasn't much by shinobi standars at that given point in time.

If the boy never spoke she'd simply turn and put the entire encounter behind her. If he spoke toward her then different action was sure to be taken in the near future.* - Mon Oct 19 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl continued on down the path in silence. The encounter now having effectively met it's end between both the younger boy and herself. She'd honestly rather see people in pain than socialize, so she wasn't the least bit bothered by the conversation; or, rather the lack thereof between the two. 

It was a normal thing to her at this point, and she never expected any more or less. 

"I wonder if i'll ever find a friend...probably not." she thought to herself.* - Mon Oct 19 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl had silently made her way through the village, not quite sure of what exactly she wanted to do with her life. She'd recently graduated the academy, but never really associated herself with any of her peers or the higher ups. She was by nature a silent person, and her social skills were most certainly her biggest crutch in life. This drove her to have absolutely no friends, and nobody she even spoke to on a daily basis since the passing of her parents save for bare neccesities such as the chef at the ramen shop, or your common shop keeper.

Her hands remained at rest within the confines of her pockets as she made her way up to what could only be described as a big ass crater. A singular figure became apparent upon the horizon for the girl. As the distance between the two lessened she was better able to make out the more fine details of the figure she approached,

Distinctively black and seemingly infinitely blank eyes that possessed no discernable pupil met with those of her opposite number taking in dark skin, grey hair, and what seemed to be a sword in the possession of the female before her. She carried a look of seniority which led the girl to the assumption that she was an elder shinobi of the village, or perhaps even a higher up. She asked in a coarse tone,

"What happened here...? Construction project?"* - Mon Oct 19 21:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Which mansion is "the mansion"? Like for meetings, or the kage's house, or what? - Mon Oct 19 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Kage's. - Mon Oct 19 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Nyoko. - Mon Oct 19 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm Baylea. - Mon Oct 19 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Nice to meet you. - Mon Oct 19 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Hello. - Mon Oct 19 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl's head turned to face the man who had so rudely interrupted the conversation she had engaged in with the female directly north of her. After taking a few moments to examine the man who'd made his arrival the girl simply nodded in response to his introduction before she turned back to face the one whom she'd originally been speaking to. 

The girl had already forced herself out of her bubble considerably before a third person made their entrance, and now wished only to remove herself from the situation before things went even more down hill. If she wasn't held from simply walking away by the greater urge to not be disrespectful, she would have. 

With that in mind she did her best to assume a place in the back of the conversation. A place where she wouldn't have to speak...where she could simply listen to the two and pick up a few details from the dialogue they were sure to exchange. * - Mon Oct 19 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) thinks: Puuussss----yyyy - Mon Oct 19 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: That pervert should learn not to speak to women. - Mon Oct 19 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Ugly scum. - Mon Oct 19 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || Not much small talk was to be made by the two; it seemed almost as if the female she'd previously been conversing with disliked the company of the man that had approached. The girl herself could honestly see why if first impressiosn were to mean anything...which they usually were.

She was broken from her state of observation upon hearing her name escape the lips of the female. She had been asked to approach her, and did such at a modest pace. Her hands remained at rest within the confines of her pockets while her eyes remained locked with those of the opposite female.

"Yes...?" 

she'd finally ask in a whisper when the distance between the two was ultimately closed.* - Mon Oct 19 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: Who do your worship? - Mon Oct 19 22:22:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: Well? - Mon Oct 19 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl was caught quite off guard to the considerable amount of pressure placed upon her skull...to her at least. She was asked a question that she had no familiarity with, or one that she had ever really actually given any prior thought to. Who does she worship? Hmm...

After a few moments of thought she voiced the most simple answer that could be given, but also in a tone that came across as more of a question than anything.

"Probably the hokage, right?"* - Mon Oct 19 22:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl took a step backwards in response. An angered expression quickly replacing the previous one of genuine curiosity. She drew a single hand from her pocket and began to rub the spot where she'd been -attacked- softly. 

Her response came sharp from her tongue with a certain undertone of pure spite, 

"Just not familiar with what you're asking me. Sorry I don't spend as much time around the same areas you do, or possess a certain interest for whatever the hell religion is. It isn't important to me or i'd obviously know what it is. That has -nothing- to do with representation of my intelligence."* - Mon Oct 19 22:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently observed the group of individuals before her. Immediately catching her attention were the two who seemed to intend on sparing each other in the near future. She'd learned from the day before of a certain joy she could only feel. A joy ultimately rooted within pain itself. A joy that she wished to feel at all times; a joy that left her feeling empty in it's absense. When she felt nothing it led to depression as if she were coming down from a drug. She had literal withdrawal from the lack of it.

One hand dipped into her pocket only to draw out a single kunai later. Engraved within the handle of the Kunai were the small letters, "fulfillment." After playfully spinning the kunai on her finger she firmly gripped it with her right arm and turned away from the group as a means to hide the action she felt was more than neccesary to fulfill her -needs-."

She turned her left arm to reveal the soft, creamy, milky underskin of her wrist. The more she thought of what was to come the harder it was to hesitate. Her breath drew shorter. Adrenaline began to pump through her body and every part of her began to tingle in anticipation. 

It was time and she could finally wait no longer. In one swift, clean motion she drove the edge of the kunai across the smooth milky skin. As the blade made it's way across her wrist a fine trail of crimson was left in it's wake along with sharp, sharp pain. 

Due to her mental state; however, the pain was replaced with pure euphoria. Small drops of crimson made their end at the girl's feet where they'd seemingly infinitely disperse and flood the area around their impact in crimson. The kunai, now covered in blood, remained at rest in the girl's right hand. Without any sign of hesitation she moved it back toward her face, stuck her tongue out, and licked the blood from the kunai.

"It feels so good..."

she noted under her breath.* - Wed Oct 21 00:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently closed in on the group of shinobi whom seemed to be engaged in some sort of combat. She instantly noted that a heavy amount of pain was being inflicted upon one of the participants. This excited her quite a lot even if it was an ally being subjected to such action.

"Keep going..."

the girl thought to herself as dark eyes found themselves locked upon the group. She longed to do nothing more than to draw a kunai and inflict even greater pain herself, but was thankfully able to keep herself from following through with such an action at this point. * - Wed Oct 21 20:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl continued to observe. She found her self oddly interested in the technique of whom seemed to be the aggressor. She had to wonder if he actually feasted on the blood of other shinobi...and if he did how he was allowed to exist within a shinobi village. It just seemed like a morally wrong thing to do and like something that would cause the person to be a complete outcast.

As she made her way a little closer to the scene she observed the green suited, bowl cut goofball of a shinobi break free from the aggressor's grasp. For someone who seemed to be completely unable of even dressing himself in a decent manner he seemed to be oddly capable in combat.

"Interesting..."

the girl thought to herself. He now seemed ot be in the process of having a visual overhaul completed by another shinobi from within the village, 

"Thank god. Please give him a hair cut."

she thought to herself.* - Wed Oct 21 20:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl let out a mildly audible sigh as soon as she was certain that the combat had came to it's end. Without much more waiting around she made her way over to the bench directly behind the red headed girl. Once the distance between herself and the bench was closed she took a seat at the bench.

After sitting down she'd listen in on the conversations around her for a moment in an attempt to establish a basic understanding of the general personalities of the people around her. She was particularly entertained by the fact that the red haired female was basically giving the over-grown manchild a complete make over. Even more shocking was the fact that the physique and facial features once hidden behind the goofy ass hair cut and jump suit weren't as bad as one may expect such to be from such a goofy weirdo.

Not much later she observed the "vampire" who'd been assaulted. It seemed that the kick from the boy carried enough force to break bones. That within itself was pretty astronishing in her eyes...it may of even been borderline unrealistic due to her lack of exposure to more amazing things within the world.

"So...i'm Nyoko."

she spoke in a soft tone. It wasn't directed toward anyone, and thus simply fell upon the entire population. Her social skills were severely lacking and anyone whom looked at her would recieve awkward eye contact(?) in response until they looked away.* - Wed Oct 21 20:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl seemingly came to life upon finally having someone pay attention to her. Most of the previous awkwardness was abolished by her newfound sense of happiness in being acknowledged. She listened intently to the man as he spoke, dark eyes never leaving those of her opposite number. She nodded to acknowledge each statement that was made before she voiced her own reponse in a soft tone,

"Not sure about the tour, but i'd love to shadow a mission. Traveling is pretty interesting."

She spoke, but her true interest was in the very fact that missions usually led to combat. Combat led to pain, and pain led to her greatest joy. Maybe she'd even be able to help inflict pain herself if she managed to train enough to reach such a level.* - Wed Oct 21 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently awoke from her nap and took a moment to observe the area as per usual. The woman she'd been beside for quite some time was now clearly a clone upon being granted to enlightenment of having the actual real being infront of her. Immediately discernable was a large fan that rested upon the females back. 

It was interested how the woman seemed to have little to no trouble dealing with the weight of the large fan. This led her to believe that she was at the least proficient in handling the fan. Not taking much time to rise to her feat the girl proceeded to make her way over to the female who had caught her attention.

Once the distance was closed dark eyes scanned the figure before her one last time before a bow was offered. When the formalities were finished the girl continued to voice her request in the most respectfull tone she could muster, 

"Would you be willing to aid me in the advancement in my proficiency of the fuuton element?"

after finishing her question the girl'd simply stare into the eyes of the female in anticipation for her answer.* - Wed Oct 21 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl's emotions remained unchanged for the most part as the positive female spoke. Inside she was more than happy with the simple fact that she'd at least have a chance to advance her mastery of her element. Deep down she felt a faint bit of sorrow at the fact she wouldn't neccesarily have a hands on teacher; however, she gracefully accepted the scroll as it was offered.

A nod was offered as physical acknowledgement of the woman whom spoke to her. After her short speech and instruction the girl retorted,

"Alright; i'll do my best. Thank you for the opportunity to train and better my craft."

When she finished speaking the girl finally showed physical emotion in the form of a bright smile that showcased her nearly perfect white teeth. She'd then proceed to open the scroll and skin through the contents of it while still in the presence of the clone in case there was anything she didn't understand right away. * - Wed Oct 21 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently read through the scroll she'd been given. She was instructed to learn the technique which was explained within it as a part of her task under the instruction of her near teacher, Marissa. It was a fairly simple jutsu, but the girl knew better than to expect it to be a simple walk in the park to complete. She was well aware of the fact that someone had taken months...if not years to complete what she now sought to learn.

The basic layout of the jutsu seemed simple enough. She'd use her fuuton chakra to create several small tornados which could then be used for a multitude of things. Things that included, but were not limited to offense, defense, and even cover in the geography of Suna.

If she was in a pinch and needed to escape she could very well use the tornados to whip up a smoke screen made of sand, or even make a small sand storm if she possessed the ability to create it on a large enough scale. This within itself was enough to draw her to focus all of her energy on learning the technique.* - Thu Oct 22 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl continued to study the scroll. She had the handseals neccesary to complete the jutsu dowin from the get-go. It was -very- simply the ram seal and nothing else. The real kicker it seemed would be the shape manipulation part of the jutsu. Actually getting her chakra to turn into a tornado was far easier imagined, or even said than done.

Luckily for her she'd been given instructions by someone who had seemingly mastered the technique. This meant she had the innate advantage of being able to bypass some of the more frustrating parts of learning a jutsu without a teacher--doing things wrong...well for the most part. She was limited by the fact that she was unable to ask questions, and some of the illustrations caught her off guard for sure.

Nonetheless she continued to study until she felt she was prepared to attempt the jutsu itself,

"How hard can it be?"

she questioned in an almost sarcastic tone. She knew she was set up to fail and had made peace with that very fact. If she somehow completed it on the first try then she was either very lucky, or even a level above a prodegy...neither of which she had much chance at.* - Thu Oct 22 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl was now ready to make her first attempt at using her new technique. She formed the ram seal and focused on the center of her body; namely into her lungs. Here is where the chakra was drawn in and mixed with normal air from the enviroment around her. 

Once she felt she was ready she expelled the wind from her mouth with as much force as she could muster. The girl was met with jutst what she had expected on the first try. The wind came out with noticeable force, but there were no tornados to be found in the wake of it.

The technique the girl had previously learned perhaps worked against her due to the fact that it required drawing in air only to expell it with force to create several air bullets. The similarities would make it hard for the girl to differentiate and form the actual tornados rather than using brute force alone in the technique.* - Thu Oct 22 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl continued to repeat the jutsu as it was written. The process was long and challenging. She spent every moment memorizing...practicing. Trying to get all of the small details that were preventing her from having her success. Every moment that passed was a moment toward completion in her mind. Determination...that was one thing the girl possessed that either set her apart from everyone else, or made her blend in. She wasn't quite sure herself, but she damn sure had it.

With every attempt it became more and more apparent that she was starting to get a feel for what she was doing. The air bullets began to almost rotate, but were not forming into full fledged tornados. 

After several attempts the girl wasn't exactly tired. Where most shinobi at her current level may stop and call it a day she pressed forward. This was sure to show off her above-average chakra and how it directly benefitted her abiltiy to press on in the face of the storm.* - Thu Oct 22 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl continued to practice without taking a break. She was getting close now. The wind being expelled was rotating and damn near a full fledged tornado. The only thing keeping her from deciding that it was complete was the simple fact that the tornados were unable to substain themselves for more than a few seconds.

"Almost there..."

she thought to herself. Her body was now completely covered in sweat. Her hair being weightened down by her sweat caused her bangs to fall and impede her direct vision. Sweat from her bangs got into her eyes and caused them to burn, but she knew she was too close to quit.

Once again she formed the ram seal for what seemed like the thousandth time in her session and drew chakra into her lungs, 

"This is the one!"

she told herself. With all of her might she expelled the chakra forward. Once out side of her body the gust of wind created by this action began to rotate and ultimately formed into several small tornados that swept across the desert before her kicking up several particles of sand.

The girl fell to the floor after the last move. Even her chakra was pretty much depleted after so many attempts, but she could rest well knowing of her achievement.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl wandered throughout the village aiming to find a sutiable spot to train. Once such a spot was found she'd withdraw two scrolls from her pockets. Both had unique inscriptions placed on them, one reading, "Shadow Shuriken" while the other read, "Rotating Shuriken." Despite sharing close names the two techniques were completely different.

One focused on utilizing wind to increase the rotation of a simple shuriken when thrown. It was a simple technique, but proved it's efficiency as this increased the cutting potential of the shuriken exponentially. 

The other was simple. It included throwing two windmill shuriken, one being stacked atop the other, and was primary meant to utilize the enemie's need to react to the second shuriken at the last moment. It'd either score a hit, or knock them off balance to allow a hit from something else if things went as planned.

"Interesting..."

the girl thought to herself.* - Thu Oct 22 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl silently made her way into the square. Her hair along with her clothes were noticeably damp; a tell that she had recently finished training. Her eyes were able to immediately make out the figure that she sought.

A smile was apparent upon her face as she made her way to the female shinobi whom possessed the large fan. Once within a comfortable speaking distance the girl'd clear her throat in speak in her normal, soft tone,

"I was wondering if you could give me some pointers...I think i've got one of the techniques down and am working on the others, but it'd be greatly helpful to have some hands-on teaching."

she explained before eagerly awaiting the response that'd be given to her by the elder shinobi.* - Thu Oct 22 20:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl simply nodded in response to the female's statement. She more than agreed with everything that was said and offered a simple thank you before proceeding to tag along behind her. She didn't know where the training grounds were, but she'd do her best to keep up and figure out. It was quite an interesting experience for her.* - Thu Oct 22 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Good luck. - Thu Oct 22 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyoko(Emeralia) || The girl closely observed the elder female as she instructed her upon how to perform the technique she sought to learn. Right off the bat she noted that it only required three handseals to complete. Those were the ram, the tiger, and the snake seal,

"Simple enough..."

the girl thought to herself. The next step was something she'd found to be a common part of pretty much every wind jutsu she'd practiced so far other than rotating shuriken. She needed to stockpile chakra within her chest. Once the chakra was focused she also noted that a twist on this jutsu was the action of placing her palms together. She assumed this was to direct the wind in a more complete manner rather than just firing out air bullets, or creating tornados. 

The girl closely observed as the elder shinobi cupped her hands together once she was finished drawing her chakra into focus. It was a rather peciliar action, but the younger shinobi didn't question it. She knew that the elder possessed much more knowledge upon the subject than her, and that her methods were far better even if they seemed a little...odd at first sight. The result of her technique was quite amazing to the girl. A large amount of wind was shot forth that contained a considerable amount of brute force behind it. It blazed a trail in the sand, wipping up several particles of dust to join it's rampage before it crushed into the wall opposite the two which in turn caused it to subside.

"I can see why she wanted to go to a training area for this. Using, or even practicing such a technique in a large crowd could most certainly be a bad thing." the girl thought to herslf.

Now that the elder had completed the jutsu it was her turn to attempt it. With the procedure still sharp on her mind she performed the three seals and began to pool chakra in the center of her chest. It took a considerably longer time for the girl to pool her chakra than the elder due to her lack of control, but once she was confortable with the level of chakra gathered she clasped her two hands together. In this action she made a mistake and allowed the chakra she had gathered to exit at that moment, creating a small gust of wind around her.

"Oops..."

the girl said in an embarassed tone. Once again she performed the handseals that had been demonstrated and began to pool chakra. This time it was a little quicker due to her having the smallest shred of familiarity with the action accompanied by her larger than normal charka pool. When she felt confident she clasped her hands together and began to focus on the wall in front of her. The problem this time was the fact that she had failed to clasp her hands correctly which allowed the wind to escape before being focused.

"Take your time...let the chakra flow as it is nature. Do not rush yourself...you can do this." 

These all were self motivational phrases that the girl continued to repeat in her head. She knew she was more than capable of performing the jutsu if she simply focused. This time she tried something different than before; however, this time she decided to shut -everything- out via closing her eyes and freeing her mind of thoughts not crucial to the success of the technique. Within her mind she envisioned her own chakra system. Once again she performed the handseals and began to pool her chakra. In her mind she felt as though she was watching the chakra itself pool within her body to give her a visual representation of when she should carry out the next step.

Once she felt prepared she clasped her two hands together, using them as her main focus. Slowly the chakra made it's way to her hands where it'd prepare to be fired off. She'd made it further than before, but didn't allow her momentary success to cloud her focus. It was the moment of truth. In a single moment she threw both of her hands forward while expelling the chakra at the climax of the movement. In response to her motion a large gust of wind was released from her body. The size of it was nothing compared to that of Marissa's, but it was clearly the same technique. It'd soon make impact with the wall before dissappearing.

The now slightly fatigued girl wiped a few beads of sweat from her forehead before turning to face the elder. She was clearly interested in how she would react, and wanted to see if she had any critique that'd allow her to better herself in producing the jutsu.* - Thu Oct 22 21:15:18 2015
