"Honor is no more associated with fools then snow with summer or rain with harvest. Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse wil not land its victim. Guide a horse with a whip, a donkey wtih a bridle, and a fool with a rod to his back! Don't answer the follish arguments of fools or you will become aas foolish as they are."He spoke, his voice travels out as he speaks with truth and a strong voice.* - Sun Oct 25 18:13:58 2015

"So much to be done but little time is that it?"He asked, looking to the sky. * - Sun Oct 25 18:25:04 2015

With that he claps his hands together, as his hands touch one another. A birght light flshes around them then vades. Then above his head the light grows birght as three spears or formed from pure light of the priest. He opens his eyes and looks up at them and would shake his head ever so slowly side to side. The spears of light vade away quickly and his hands rest ontop of his book.

"I have lots to learn."He whispers.* - Sun Oct 25 18:31:53 2015
