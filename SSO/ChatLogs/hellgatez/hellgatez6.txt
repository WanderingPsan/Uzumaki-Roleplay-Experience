<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) proceeds to move to four different points of Amegakure, simply allowing himself to bring out various scroll sets and placing them in these points. Generally, the plan was to set a trap, and leave himself ready for the return of the so-called 'Ambassador' of the village.* - Wed Oct 14 21:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) proceeds to carry his own weight, added by the weight of the dead into the training ground. A smirk riding upon his face as he did so. It seemed that Nigen was correct, and his eyes found Ketsuki there training. Ambling forth, he cast his vision onto her, and let it rest completely on her. Once he figured he was close enough, he initiated speech. "Heyyyyyy~! Sado-Kun said you needed help!"* - Thu Oct 15 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh...Kenjutsu? Nice...Nice... - Thu Oct 15 22:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well. - Thu Oct 15 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Got anything you can think of to help out? And.. need a hand with that body? - Thu Oct 15 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah, I'm just holdin' this body. But...I've got some creations you could test your skill against... - Thu Oct 15 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Not too sure how effective it'd be... - Thu Oct 15 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ahh. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm working on me Kenjutsu and Taijutsu, so that might help- a fight where I can't falll back onto Genjutsu. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Alright...Coo' Coo'...Just uh...Be careful, these things cost me a lot. - Thu Oct 15 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... - Thu Oct 15 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Using explosive tags is a no? - Thu Oct 15 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: ...I think they could handle one heh. - Thu Oct 15 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Just -one- though. - Thu Oct 15 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) shifts his shoulder, along with the body that was being hefted upon it. As he did so, his other hand reached to his backside, underneath the fur cape he wore. With that, he produced a single scroll, allowing it to unravel now before his chakra was applied. The result brought forth a puppet, one with an obvious affinity to blades.

With its production, Gojiro extended his reach, letting strands of chakra reach out to connect to his creation. The puppet remaining suspended, a green cloak covering most of its form and only having several sets of blades extending from its side, meanwhile two already equipped within its hands for combat. It seemed to creak a bit though as Gojiro forced it to make movements towards the center, turning to look at Ketsuki.

"I'm no close quarter master, but this is the best I've got. Really."* - Thu Oct 15 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) nodded as he looked towards her, he simpled shifted his fingers a bit, letting the puppet glide a bit closer now. Gojiro seemed to have a drop of sweat glide down from the crown of his forehead, his eyes focusing on the middle-ground between the two while he stayed steady. A simple word came from him questioningly, "Ready?"

Should she be prepared of course, the puppet would shift forward, drawing out the blade in its right hand and letting it move in a horizontal motion, aiming to strike at the girl. Gojiro could only hope that she was more experienced than she claimed.* - Thu Oct 15 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) tugged back on his chakra strings, observing Ketsuki's response. The attack had successfully been countered and a kunai lodged into it now. Gojiro simply gave a smirk that seemed to be a bit off, showing that he wasn't too confident in his actions. Yet, he gave a simple response. "Yeah, heheh."

Afterwards, he guided the strings to force one blade to come down and remove the kunai from its center, and then proceeded to send it back in once more. As it closed in however, the opposing katana now raised, came down to form a vertical slash now, targettign the shoulder region. Gojiro had of course, expected a good counter.* - Thu Oct 15 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) || For the most part, the puppet seemed to follow through, pushing onwards but holding its blade of to the side now, considering it was redirected. However, Gojiro didn't expect the girl to take a dodging motion, but it made no difference to him now as he chose to push the puppet forward, of course, this actually meant he turned it to face Ketsuki's new position, bringing its arms back now as it seemed to charge forward. It seemed it was using a scare tactic to try and get her to open up.* - Thu Oct 15 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) felt a sense of recoil on his strings, actually pausing the motions of his puppet as he observed, waiting for the smoke to clear from the short explosion. Gojiro knew the devastating power of explosive tags of course, considering they were in his main form of combat, but as he observed, it seemed his puppet had recieved scorch marks across its body, the cloak it wore sparking somewhat.

A face of suprise took place for Gojiro and he simply tugged on his strings, pulling the puppet over to his side and tossing the body he carried on his shoulders to the side now. With that, he reached outwards, simply patting away the flames that were hanging on.

"Oh shit....Nice...nice. You're pretty good."* - Thu Oct 15 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh...Yeah...I suppose. - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Thanks by the way. - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I actually got to test it out against someone alive! - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Oct 15 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So this is your first time actually using that puppet? - Thu Oct 15 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah...Just the first time against someone capable of defending. - Thu Oct 15 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Ah..? Well.. I'm really just a rather average Genin, so... - Thu Oct 15 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, I'm sure if that thing had actually been trying to kill me, I'd be in a bad way. - Thu Oct 15 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah...You did good. I'm sure you'd be fine. - Thu Oct 15 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... I like to think of myself as fighting smarter, not harder, most of the time- y'know? - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh, yeah. I agree. - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: It's why I made this guy...and a few others. - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seeyah round. - Thu Oct 15 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) shrugged, hefting up the body now, proceeding to make his way back to Sado-kun.* - Thu Oct 15 23:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) gained a smirk of sort as it crossed his face. He shifted his shoulder a bit, keeping the body of the female on top. It was obviously becoming uncformtable, but Gojiro figured he could work with it for now. A nod after the instruction and he simply turned, pausing only to make one statement. 

"Money better be good when I come back, heh." With that, he'd then leave.* - Fri Oct 16 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) found himself now moving throughout the forest surrounding the village of Amegakure. Gojiro understood the reports, understanding that the creature was seen during the night of course but he figured that he could probably find the home of the creature and take advantage of that. Therefore, Gojiro let himself use his various senses to observe for obvious signs, ones that both a gorilla and a lion could exhibit, especially as a hybrid. 

As Gojiro searched amongst the woods, he was having no luck, but proceeded to make a pause in his progress, turning back towards the village now to search for clues. His response took him to a place within Amegakure that seemed to be a victim of the Gorrilla-Lion cross. A few words were shared between Gojiro and the seemingly poor villager. Yet, it was more of Gojiro snooping around and the villager yelling for him to leave. Easily enough however, Gojiro found some sort of a trail, a mix of feces and tracks of course.

Following it now, he proceeded to break off into the forest, heading outside of Amegakure's boundaries and onwards. It seemed to him however, such a trail was just to easy to follow, leaving him to believe there was reason that the creature hadn't been dealt with. Yet, Gojiro stayed determined, keeping a cocky grin drawn upon his face.

His demeanor had never faltered as he ran throughout Amegakure's trees, and eventually came to the end of the trail. Soon, his eyes shifted from the ground to the area in front of him and began to focus in on the surroundings. This involved a rock formation, leaving Gojiro to proceed forward and easily make contact with the base. Now as he stood there, he unleashed a scroll from underneath his cloak and proceeded to release it to the open and cast his chakra into it, touching the focus point of the scroll.

Within moments, Gojiro had support in his search, including aerial support as well now that one of his puppets gravitated above ground level and three others ambled by his side. Moving along the base however, he seemed to listen or search for a possible opening in the rock. His intentions to find a cave, believing such a hybrid of a beast would live within such a thing.

Now as Gojiro seemed to find an opening, he paused, letting himself fall as silent as possible as he focused his hearing ability upon the innards of the cave, only hearing a faint snoring sound, confirming Gojiro's suspicions, or so he believed. With that, he proceeded to lower his aerial support, bringing the puppet dubbed Bomber to ground level and allowing it to proceed to open up a simple chamber, dropping its jaw to reveal it.

A clunk, and now a nozzle was extended a bit from the mouth, aimed directly into the cave. Accessing his chakra strings, Gojiro forced the oil contained in his puppet to drive forth, spewing in a straight stream onwards. As a result, Gojiro only heard a grunt of sorts, realizing he'd made contact with the beast. The oil hitting a target he wasn't truly aiming for, but none-the-less, was attempting to affect.

With the sound of footsteps approaching, he made quick work of his puppet, tugging it back so it wasn't so close to the opening. The jawline moved once more and it clunked shut. The next action simply resulted in the exact same puppet producing its wrist-launchers, the hands disconnecting for a moment. Eventually, a stream of fire motoned forward from both, pushing past the tubes and extending to the Gorillion that was on approach. Over the roaring flames, nothing could be heard for a moment until Bomber had eventually ended its stream. 

A motion was made and Gojiro pulled back on his puppets, moving himself out of the opening before the cave just in case. While he observed, it remained silent and he could see the glow of the flames pouring from within. Then he heard a roar, the beast pushing free from the cave and expelling the flames that had engorged its body. It seemed that this creature was definetly a freak of nature, and durable agaisnt the elements of course. Explaining why it'd proven difficult to be rid of. 

Bomber moved and set higher into the air and Gojiro moved again, setting himself in a point where he could view the Gorillion's left, right, and front side of course. In the front, he simply set Samurai. To the left remained Karasu, and to the right settled Gakido. A shift of Gojiro's body and he seemed to drop the deceased he held with him to the ground, leaving them in a space he felt comftorable with. However, it seemed the Gorillion was set on reaching this body now as it charged forth.

To meet with its strength and hold it back, a shift in the strings and each of Gojiro's puppets on the ground moved forward, producing their sets of blades and eventually detatching their limbs to shoot forth their weapons. Distillng them in the air, they all eventually jabbed into the beast's body. Yet, it seemed his tough exterior was like the durability of steel, working against these blades. But Gojiro observed, finding that with enough applied pressure he could penetrate the skin of the creature. 

Moving his hands once more, he pulled away each of his puppets before finding their weapons connecting again. Another charge forward and Gojiro hopped back, bringing Gakido upwards to propell two eyes forward. With that, he easily let the eyes collide with the Gorillion and explode, producing a poison for the creature to inhale. And it seemed to enter the system of the beast, spreading slowly now as Gojiro gave a light nod, confirming the time it would take for the beast to pass without some sort of medical help. However, even then, the cloud of poison formed seemed to help him, removing both the senes of sight and smell from the large animal. In this moment, Samurai and Karasu moved in again, producing a great attack against the beast now. Each of the blades from the two connecting with the creature at different points, seemingly making a more intense wound, breaking skin now. However, they didn't go deep as expected.

Another action was made and Gojiro proceeded to let his puppets hack away at the Gorillion while it was incapbale of reacting for the tiem being, then pulling them out now as it seemed Bomber rejoined the fray. More movemetns and it unleashed its tubes, hiding away the explosive kunai within it. As a result, they connected with the great beast, finding themselves to remain lodged as a sinister smirk came over Gojrio. A scoff and his actions created a rather large explosion, of course consuming the Gorillion.

Afterwards, another tug and each puppet rejoined Gojiro and the dead body, ambling around its position now as he observed for the clearance. The large beast was now stumbling, and it seemed it was on its last breath. However, of course, it seemed to regain a bit of its vigor now as it raised up, puffing its chest out and simply expelling a rather loud rar amongst the population. Gojiro listened, and his face turned to a scowl. He proceeded to watch the beast turn, bending itself over and begin to secrete a dark brown liquid, firing it towards himself. A dive motion was made, and Gojiro simply yelled out, "The fuck!?" Meanwhile, he shifted his eyes to peer at the beast and manipulated his strings, causing his puppets to draw in for the finishing blow now. They each penetrated the beast, shooting blades through its form now.

Gojiro stayed a moment, only watching the beast stumble around and moan in pain, obviously recieving a slow death. The crazed-figure hadn't bothered with trying to deliver a swift end and simply worked to seal away his creations.Once done, he heard the collapse of the beast, a slight wimpering coming from it now as it proceeded to bleed amongst the ground. A silence fell over Gojiro, and he lifted the boady of the deceased woman he came with, returning to Amegakure now with some speed behind him.* - Sat Oct 17 00:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) seemed to look at Asteroth with an expression that seemed a bit aggrovated. "I'm no boy. I'm a grown man. And you can call me Gojiro." With that, he proceeded to drag the mutant body onwards to the morgue of course.* - Sat Oct 17 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) moved along the sandy pathways of Amegakure now. Gojiro seemed to try and drag the body of the large Gorillion mutant behind him, yet he found it difficult with the added weight of the female he had on his shoulders. Therefore, he stopped dragging for only a moment to produce a single scroll from his pocket now, bringing it out to meet his face as he let it unravel before his eyes.

As he prodcued the contents, Gojiro allowed himself to access his chakra, summoning forth each of his puppets now to distill themselves within the area for a moment, letting his chakra threads connect and hold them available for himself to use. Once they were all set within place, he guided his aerial-defined puppet closer to himself and let it take the body of the girl into its arms, meanwhile guiding the other three to lift the large animal.

Now that he'd had his small automaton army assisting him, he allowed them to follow the path behind him, letting the three he had on the ground guide the form of the Gorillion to the Morgue. Although he was quite sure it'd take some work getting it -inside- of the morgue of course.

Upon arrival at the Morgue, Gojiro entered first, letting his puppets twist and turn the body to the point that they were able to carry it through the doorway with minimal problems. Of course they had a few rough spots, but they eventually got it in, and Gojiro simply proceeded to let himself follow after one of the assistans, finding the 'bed' he was to lay down the body upon. And of course, he allowed his puppets to safely and carefully guide the body down.

Once completed, Gojiro simply let his scroll work once more, allowing himself to capture each of his puppets with ease before eventually collecting the body of the female. This of course, he did not leave in the morgue, as it was important to him. Once he had her in his hands, he moved on from his position and returned to the square of Amegakure, looking at the woman whom claimed leadership and the council member alike.* - Sat Oct 17 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) stood there alone now amongst the sands of Sunagakure, looking out across the broad horizon. Taking a moment to focus on the practice of his jutsu, Gojiro simply allowed himself to take up a single handseal, letting himself control his chakra pathways to the point where it stopped the flow entirely. An exhale later and it returned, a stronger force indeed now as he stood there.* - Sat Oct 17 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) another practice was made, the effects of Gojiro's chakra being ended calmly. His eyes seemed to shut now and he eventually ejected a chakra force that seemed more powerful.* - Sat Oct 17 14:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) still remained focused on the same task, letting himself retain the same basic focus on his chakra pathways and the single handseal he held. A flow of chakra came to stop in Gojiro's person. Another exhale and soon a flow restarted, returning with strength behind it.* - Sat Oct 17 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) accessed the same technique, holding his hands together in the same handseal formation as he allowed himself to cut off access to his chakra pathway. Within a few seconds, Gojiro seemed relaxed. Within a few seconds taking place afterwards, a reverse force came into play, another wave of chakra pushing throughout his body now as it seemed to 'flex' and come at a stronger power.* - Sat Oct 17 16:14:30 2015

A sinister smirk crossed Gojiro's face, but he still remained as still as ever, doing nothing to cause any aggrovated assault or imply hostility. A simple hand raised and waved before dropping and he spoke a short few words.
