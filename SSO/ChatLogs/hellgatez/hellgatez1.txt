<br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) slinks around the village of Amegakure, finding the rather small village, at least in comparison to the rest, to be disheartening. But it wasn't as though the rainfall that tapped against the soil and grass before him didn't already set such a dark and sad tone to the village. Shuffling throughout the pathways, he found himself in a simple location. Standing alone amongst the grass, set between the trees and the buildings, the line that seperated the two points.

Within mere moments, Gojiro found himself revealing a quad set of scrolls. Within a short moment he was unleashing the contents of the scrolls, opening two at a time. Soon, four puppets were easily summoned, falling towards the ground before him. Yet, his reaction came into play and his chakra was easily applied, catching each puppet with ease and applying itself in the form of thin threads, more than likely too thin for the eyes to see.

Yet, as Gojiro remained placed within that simple spot, he found it rather easy to take control of the situation, utilizing only four digits, two on each hand, one for each puppet. Casting out a simple motion, he allowed each to make an approach into the area ahead. However, only one broke into an arc that angled itself upwards, applying itself to the skies now as it flew overhead. This single puppet seemed to fly low, remaining just a few feet above the tree line.

On the otherhand, the rest seemed to pass around the trees, making loops through and fro. Gojiro braced himself, angling his body a bit and pushing his right leg past an imaginary line as though he was beginning to break past a boundary. Within the scenario, as he twitched each finger he could feel three of the individual strings grinding against something, as if they were beginning to tighten on the edge of an object. With this realization, he allowed himself to retract, moving his fingers a bit to guide each puppet away from the treeside.* - Sat Oct 10 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) had extended his reach, now, his puppets remaining entirely outside of his own view. For the simple fear that each could be quite easily disabled and removed from his grasp, he pulled back, tugging the strings with each individual digit. Soon, he allowed found the one he'd sent skyward touching down against the ground, joining him alongside each of the other three puppets he held control of. 

While remaining still, he let each puppet return to its scroll, allowing himself to access the seals placed on them. Once each puppet was concealed, he turned, facing the village, back to the trees now as he seemed to hear an uproar from the inhabitants of the village.

Cascading his eyes towards the center, he proceeded to make a few amble steps towards its direction. As he guided himself to the square, he now had the intention of discovering what'd been happening.* - Sat Oct 10 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) only heard word of a man giving funds to Amegakure, finding that it didn't necessarily affect him greatly. It wasn't as though the funds went to him personally, nor was he recieving anything for his actions. As a result, Gojiro simply shifted, turning back to face against the tree line, making a rather quick approach. 

There wasn't much trouble with being pulled away and then returning to his practices, but it did annoy him a bit. However, as Gojiro stood in place amongst the grass, letting the rain cascade against his body and his cloak, he found it relaxing as he found his cool once more.

Standing amongst the grassy scenerey he cast his vision over the treeline once more, producing each of his four puppets in front of himself. Each was simply strapped to the tip of his finger, controlled by the tip of his thread. Rather than wasting the time to apply multiple digits from both hands, he allowed a single finger to linger in the air. Observing the four, he found his finger making a single twitch.

Within mere moments he found his puppets guiding themselves forth, making a push amongst the trees while a single one carried itself overhead. A simple sigh came from Gojiro, and the puppet dubbed Samurai brought forth two blades, connecting with a single tree dedicated to the path in front of it. It had the intentions of withering it down to create an opening for Gojiro to keep sight of his puppets. 

Gliding through the air, the one known as bomber simply dedicated itself to bombing the forest, of course, not within the range of the original trio. This puppet was simply withering away what trees were left, and giving each of them a bad reputation as sturdy giants. 

The last of the two puppets, both having really no potential to remove the trees on their own began to act together, simply applying their strength to individaul trees. Within a few seconds they were lifting and pulling. Tugging and stripping. With ease, that simple tree was ripped from the ground, bringing soil and dirt with it as it broke from the Earth's crust. Gojiro's eyes stayed steady and settled easily on the new path, finding his puppets to be rather entertaining. Possibly a result of his own vanity.

* - Sat Oct 10 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) had finally finished clearing the pathway for himself. As he locked eyes upon each figure, he simply twitched his finger once more, beginning to guide his high-flyer back to the ground. Within moments, the speed of this creation was increasing, nearly appearing as a dive bomber before spanning out and breaking into a curve to bring itself over the heads of his three other puppets.

After such, this puppet dubbed Bomber moved to rejoin itself with the trio of puppets. A simple moment of exhaling and Gojiro closed his eyes, giving a simple nod now as he tugged back with the single finger. Guiding his creations away from the initial point. 

Each of his spawn sped onwards, returning to Gojiro now while his lifeless vision looked onwards past the rainfall. In mere moments, they seemed to close in on him and he produced the scrolls just as before, easily unlocking them to let them roll out before himself. Then, his single digit returned to a simple clutch and he found the quad being sealed away once again.

Afterwards, Gojiro shifted his position, turning back to return to Amegakure's boundaries. Yet, as he approached, he found a few standing within his vision, and simply came to a stop now. His scroll simply slipped back into his cloak, still remaining wary as he'd never seen these faces before.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) proceeded to make an exit from the area. "Take care."* - Sat Oct 10 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) settled now at the edge of Amegaure's boundaries. While there were events taking place within the village and new festivities were most likely being set in place, Gojiro's needs were elsewhere. As a result, he had to utilize the information passed on to him by Takumi and achieve his goal, even if temporary for now. With that on the mind, Gojiro carried himself from the boundaries, moving on towards Konohagakure.* - Sat Oct 10 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) continued to follow the path set between Amegakure and Konohagakure. As he traveled amongst the light soil, his eyes trailed upwards and found placement amongst the great gates of the village hidden amongst the leaves. As he approached, he could let himself wonder, 'How is such a village hidden...It has walls greater than any tree here.'

However, he trudged onwards, finding the gates to be open and took advantage of such, passing through its open doors.* - Sat Oct 10 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) simply guided himself between the two walls placed ahead of the original location of the Hokage's Mansion now. Soon Gojiro found placement ahead of the group that seemed to be stationed in front of it and allowed himself to cast his vision amongst each and every single one of them. As Gojiro stood there, he seemed to be rather, weak, however of course appearances could be decieving.

Even then, Gojiro seemed to only speak a few words upon settling. "Hello there! Haha. Didn't expect to find anyone here."* - Sun Oct 11 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I suppose you all are here to restore this village? - Sun Oct 11 00:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) found himself leaving the boundaries of Konohagakure, proceeding to make a right turn now as he began to face the direction of Kumogakure. Within a few moments he was traveling in that direction to Kumogakure, planning to come to his next stop for bodies.* - Sun Oct 11 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) made his approach to what seemed to be the centerpoint of Kumogakure. As he came to a settling point within the sand, Gojiro allowed himself to take note of the people present, noticing the difference in ratio between Konohagakure and Kumogakure. As he stood there, he simply presented himself via voice to the general public.

"Hello there, everyone."* - Sun Oct 11 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) turned now, planning to make an exit from the village and be on his way to his next destination. He could only hope that this final destination would produce some results for him in the process.* - Sun Oct 11 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) proceeded to travel from the endpoint of Kumogakure onwards, making his way across the soil now as he planned to reach the forested lands of Konohagakure once more and pass its initial starting point. He of course had intentions to move past the border of Amegakure and search the rubble of Kirigakure.* - Sun Oct 11 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) found himself outside the ruined gates of Kirigakure, figuring that the destroyed village within would hold many bodies ripe for the taking. As Gojiro cascaed his vision of the two points that would've represented each door, he stepped through, simply allowing himself to access the remains.* - Sun Oct 11 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Setsuko - Sun Oct 11 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) entered the courtyard of Kirigakure now, presenting himself with a rather nonchalant, friendly smirk. Upon arrival, his eyes scanned across the four females that seemed to be stationed in the immediate front. A couple of steps forward and he allowed a cough to escape from under his breath, his fist revealing itself from within his cloak to guard it from passing on into the air.

But it was futile, his germs probably passed the fist anyways. He simply thought to himself, 'Shame...' before returning all attention to the quad of women.

"Hello there!"* - Sun Oct 11 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) nodded in response, accepting the twenty thou. He didn't care if it was coming from a kid or an adult. Regardless, he made his approach onwards, standing before the destruction as his eyes passed between the two nearest to the Mansion's supposed location.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) observed the destruction of the Hokage Mansion, finding it to be in ruins, which was obvious before now. Even then though, he simply let his eyes cast over it before proceeding to lower his hands to a set of scrolls strapped to his hip. With ease, Gojiro summoned forth a simple group of his own creations, which had actually cost him quite a bit.

The creations that spawned forth from within the scroll however, seemed to puppets rather, forth in all as they rattled their way down to ground floor. Yet, Gojiro extended his opposite hand with great speed, easily accessing his ninjutsu skill to initiate his own chakra threads and apply them to the four figures. Within moments, they were standing at full attention, or rather, floating at full attention.

Casting his eyes to the base of the rubble, he applied all four of the threads to a single digit, twitching it slightly to cast each and every single one of the puppets towards the building. Their first task however, was to simply cover the battlefield and apply their strength to clear the scenery before him. With great ease, Gojiro was doing the work of an entire builder's crew by himself. A simple smirk drawing out across his face.* - Sun Oct 11 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) continued to apply his puppetry technique to carry out the task. of rebuilding the Hokage's Mansion. Within mere moments, he was applying his free hand to the situation, extending roughly five chakra threads to connect with wooden planks and so forth. Rather than disposing each and every single one of them, Gojiro let his threads and puppets work together to set what planks he could as the base of the Hokage Mansion in this instance.

As he stood there, he found the vanity of his skill getting the better of him once again. If anything, this was better practice than work. Yet, he even as he built up the old building, he figured he could do some home improvements and make the Hokage's Mansion even more durable, should he be able to get some more material for use.* - Sun Oct 11 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) continued to sort out the mess, performing the task without a single hint of a problem. As he continued to extend five chakra threads, one from each finger, on a single hand, the other only casted a single chakra thread and applied it to the four puppets he held control over. In this moment, he was definetly showing off his skill and prowess with each, having them detach limbs and re-attach where needed and applying what supplies he could actually use to the base.

It seemed that within a few hours, he should have at the least, the initial point of the Hokage Mansion completed by the end of the night. Regardless, the expression on his face shifted from one of smugness, to one of exhaustion, considering he seemed to be extending quite a bit of chakra from even accessing all of his puppets for so long, making it obvious that Gojiro wasn't really potent in his chakra reserves.* - Sun Oct 11 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) observed his puppets finishing the flooring now, allowing himself to pull back on his chakra strings, utilizing the single finger for his puppets, and simply detatching the others as he dropped that single arm back to his side and using it to prepare his scrolls for sealing. Beads of sweat seemed to roll down his forehead now as he applied each of his puppets back to their appropriate seals of course, letting them  be stored away for later usage.

Now as Gojiro looked at his temporary finished work, he seemed to take a deep breath before setting on the ground in a meditative form. He was of course, restoring his chakra. "Gonna take me a while..."* - Sun Oct 11 03:23:56 2015

As Gojiro allowed his eyes to look directly forward, he seated himself, applying his arms to the counter before him as he looked over the short menu. A simple smile, and then Gojiro allowed himself to speak outwards, making his order within moments. "One order of Miso Ramen and uh....Uh...Say...What're you gettin'?"* - Sun Oct 11 05:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) came across what seemed to be an abandoned homestead, allowing himself free entry with basic intentions. As Gojiro stood there now, he allowed himself to summon fourth the four puppets he had, bringing out the entire arsenal. Now as he looked across each of them, utilizing a single finger as normal to cast out his chakra threads, he simply captured them, distilling all of them in the air.

Bringing each one forth towards himself one by one, he casually overlooked them, letting his opposing hand pass throughout their forms and easily open their ammunition compartments and so forth, applying a simple check over the four and of course reloading them as needed.

Once completed, Gojiro would spend no time whatsoever making way from the building, searching now for an area to practices his unique craft.* - Sun Oct 11 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) C-Rank Puppet: 500,000
B-Rank Puppet: 1 Mill
A-Rank Puppet: 25 Mill

came to find himself standing amongst the sandy plain of one of Konohagakure's many training fields. As Gojiro stood there, he simply allowed himself to take a single puff, eventually producing a simple cigar and introducing it to the space that formed between his lips. After leaving it there for a moment, Gojiro proceeded to summon forth all of his masterworks, finding a great sense of vanity as he looked each and every one of them over.

Without even wasting a moment, Gojiro allowed himself to take control of each, tethering them to a single finger with the use of his chakra. As Gojiro looked towards the centerpoint of the field, he proceeded to find moving his puppets rather easy, leaving Bomber to amble at his side for the moment.

In the next few seconds he found the trio of Samurai, Gakido, and Karasu forming a triangle around the centerpoint. Meanwhile, as Bomber hanged back, its wrist seemed to clack, making a cracking sound of sorts as it opened up the compartments within its wrist to produce its portable flamethrower. Expending gas, it allowed a single stream to pass before Gojiro whom leaned in a bit, feeling his body begin to heat up from the feeling. 

Once he'd pulled back, the cig seemed to have been ignited, starting to  burn away as he felt the singe on his face. Regardless, as Gojiro remained still he cast Bomber forward, allowing him to take to the skies and join the starting trio. Within a few seconds they had a collective formation set, Bomber simply staying overhead while the other three proceeded to extend their blades, moving forward at each other.

Gojiro observed the clashing, listening to the sound of several metallic blades connect as each puppet remained still. For a moment, they were applying force. Of course, this was at the whim of Gojiro's will, but he allowed himself to come to a stop and bring back the single string he held.

The majority seemed to come back to Gojiro's side, yet Bomber remained in the skies, circling overhead like an oversized mechanical bird on the lookout. The thought of such giving Gojiro the idea to apply Karasu's recording device to Bomber as well or simply get a puppet with the intent for spying really.* - Sun Oct 11 14:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) allowed himself to tug on the chakra strings once more, pulling all of his puppets in to corral them to his position as he looked onwards. Rather than pressing onwards with his practice efforts, he allowed himself to reseal his masterworks and found himself pivoting, turning around to head onwards to the Hokage's Mansion, of course planning to converse with some people once again.* - Sun Oct 11 14:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Hellgatez) casually slinked his way into Kumogakure once more, allowing himself to pass amongst the soil now as he looked at the inhabitants in what seemed to be the center. Word spread quickly, and of course this individual had to investigate himself. A new player had entered the ranks and left him wondering who or what could possibly be in control. 

With both hands remaining pocketed, he found himself shifting the cigar between his lips from one side to the other, his eyes seemed to focus down upon it while his nose seemed to krinkle a bit. Soon, the tip touched nose and he gave up on his attempts, cringing a bit as the heat touched tip.

However, once he'd finished such, he recalled where he was, releasing the cigar from his mouth and allowed it to drop to the ground. Afterwards, a hand came from his pocket and easily covered the rest of his face with the mask before he simply spoke.

"Hey..So, who's the Raikage in these stre- soils...?"* - Sun Oct 11 15:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Hellgatez) turned his eyes to Amaya now, proceeding to make a path forward now to stand in front of her. As he looked on to her, he simply coughed a bit.

Then the counterproductive statements came in, and he stopped himself, looking aghast at the crew of three.

"Look...Someone better tell me who the real Raikage is right now...Before I tell my sister to beat yo' ass..."* - Sun Oct 11 15:25:52 2015
