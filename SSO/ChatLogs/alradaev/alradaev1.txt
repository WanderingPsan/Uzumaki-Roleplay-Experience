<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Alradaev) Was standing in the square beneath the mountain that was the Kage mansion. He was a shinobi, but his talent… His skill, was somewhat undetermined… Even by himself. His hands were deep in his pockets, both for warmth, to shelter them from the night, and both to keep his hands to himself. He had a dislike for some reason, for others to see them. 

"Aye?" he said towards the figure standing on top of a hill. His attention turned towards his eyes, noting that they were indeed strange. The request of the Kumekage was like a melody to his ears. "Aye… Sir… I will escort those… People out." He replied with a grin in his face. He could have a mission, and on top of that, he could share his pleasures a bit with another.

He started walking towards the Ramen shop, waving goodbye to the lord. His steps were light, filled with joy. In a couple of short minutes, he was already there, standing beside the ramen shop. He walked in, greeting everyone. The sight he saw was exactly as described by the Kage. 

The ramen shopkeeper couldn't refuse the shinobi. By looking at his face, it was clear as day that he feared them, whatever is it because of their powers, that, Hanzo did not know. He noted two drunk shinobis, wearing the same hand band as him, next to a table. One sitting, sipping sake, along with singing quiet vulgarly, with another, dancing to the sounds of the tunes his comrade allows to escape his mouth.  He noted a few foreigners, leaving the shop, along with a few walking in, seeing the same sight as him, and walking out.

"Now now…" he said, walking closer to the shinobi. "That isn't fair to other customers. Let's go away." He said, whistling a tune. The two shinobi, stared at him, one from below, one from above, and both shrugged at him, and ignored him afterwards. Hanzo shrugged as well, "Well then, nobody said I can't have a bit fun." He said quietly, and took a fork he saw on a table next to them, an empty table, probably because of them. 

Hanzo walked closer to the two drunk men, with a sadistic look on his face. Without a moment to think, nor without letting out a single word, he stuck the fork in the foot of the dancer, as much as his strength allowed him. Although not much of the pain was felt by the wasted shinobi, surely, he was annoyed by the motion. "Hey you!" he shouted at Hanzo. 

Hanzo quickly started making hand seals. "Now…" he said, before finishing, "I am at the top of my shape, alone, aye, but at the top. You two are drunk, and already one of you are injured. Do you honestly want to start a battle?" he asked them, the one sitting, who was letting out a bitter melody only a moment, took the fork out, stuck it in the table, and simply walked out.

"Do not make me come back." Hanzo replied, the shocked dancer started limping out of the shop too. Hanzo made his way to the Kage. Or at least where he was at the beginning of the mission.* - Fri Sep 18 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanzo(Alradaev) says: Lord Raikage. Could you train wih me a bit? - Fri Sep 18 15:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I'm on the look out for any Kirigakure shinobi, perhaps in a bit. - Fri Sep 18 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: For now I suggest you train with yourself until I find other likeminded shinobi within the village. - Fri Sep 18 15:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanzo(Alradaev) says: Alriht. - Fri Sep 18 15:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Alradaev) Sighed as the Raikage was unable to come train with him. He nodded at the request to train solo, and set path to the south, just at the southern part of the village, the most eastern corner, there was a small body of water. A perfect place to train suiton. He made a few hand seals, and started to channel his chakra, closing his eyes, he started to perform the jutsu.* - Fri Sep 18 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Alradaev) He kept on doing the jutsu further and further along. He wanted to master it as fast as possible. He wanted to fight new people, to learn new ways to inflict pain. He wanted to be acknowledged and sent to important missions. This gave him determination. This gave him will, this gave him power. He made the hand seals once more, smiling.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanzo(Alradaev) says: Meh... - Sat Sep 19 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanzo(Alradaev) says: Hello. - Sat Sep 19 07:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Alradaev) Smiled, as he could feel himself grow. He had a strange sensation, a feeling, that soon enough will come a moment that will allow him to shine. But in order for himself to shine, he must first become a diamond. And to become a diamond, he must pressure himself. He started preforming the hand seals once more, this time, allowing more chakra to be used, in order to summon a greater flow of water.* - Sat Sep 19 09:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanzo(Alradaev) Sat down, becoming a bit dizzy from using the jutsu a few times, he closed his eyes and begun to meditate. He rested there for a few short moments, recovering all of his strength. He gave out a deep sigh, and stood back up. "Meh. This is sure taking a while, and boring while at it… Wish I had someone here with me." He thought to himself, returning to the hand seals, and preforming the questioned jutsu.* - Sat Sep 19 09:27:15 2015
