<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) continued to look over at Reguel, swapping her sights between him and Sanoke.  The two seemed rather 'open', to her at least. Then again, she was the type to take advantage of just about any situation. Had the two been an enemy, she'd probably have a blade against their neck. However, they were allies, so such a situation would never arise. 

She'd divert her attention from one individual to another, keeping tabs on everyone around her. She was indeed the paranoid type, but it was for good reason. She was a shinobi, and danger was around at every corner.  The female continued to remain silent.* - Thu Oct 22 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Positive. If you fail you can punch me in the cheek. - Thu Oct 22 00:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was interested in what Reguel and Koji were doing. From what she observed, they were just practicing their handseals.  She continued to observe for a bit more, until she got bored.  The kunoichi turned around and began to walk off, deeming the area pretty boring.* - Thu Oct 22 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: 8 tri gram.... 361 palm - Thu Oct 22 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: omit - Thu Oct 22 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) found herself a secluded area, void of any interruptions.  She reached into her holster which was positioned on her thigh, just where the ruffles of her skirt cut off. The kunoichi flipped the tab of the holster open, and slid an index finger into one of the extending holes of the holstered kunai. She quickly pulled the kunai out, twirling it to adjust its blade to her liking.   The weapon found itself wrapped around the female's fingers, blade pointing outwards from the body, rather than inwards.  With her weapon of choice drawn, now began the training.
	
The kunoichi began to walk around in a circular pattern, slowly synchronizing her steps with her breathing. For a moment, her steps made noise, but suddenly there became a void of sound itself. With every step she took, no sound echoed. It was as if the eyes were playing tricks on themselves.  The shinobi continued to walk in a circular motion, slowing down her own breathing. All noise that she made became void as she focused all of her attention upon making the faintest of sounds.

As she continued to circle around, she tightened her grip on the kunai. She slowly began to close in, shortening the outline of the circle. Eventually, she reached her target and raised her blade, quickly wrapping her arms around it before slitting its "throat". Of course, there were no real targets, only fake training dummies. 

She released her grip and took a few steps away, eyeing the area for a new target.  Finally, her eyes laid upon a stray coyote. Somehow it gained passage into the village, but it didn't bother her. It was the perfect live target without any consequences. The kunoichi grinned at the opportunity.  Now, she became the hunter.

Her eyes followed the animal, as she herself remained stationary and silent. Her weapon was already drawn, and she was already in a combative mode. The animal scurried about, scrounging around for food and what not. It wasn't too far off, but it wasn't really close either.  The coyote had yet to notice Yoko, mostly due to the fact that she moved silently and did very little to expose herself.  Her plan was flawless, except for the fact that the coyote had excellent smelling capabilities.  Even if she moved silently, it would still notice her due to her scent. Thus, the kunoichi grabbed some dirt and began to smear it along her body in an effort to mask her scent.
The coyote on the other hand, continued to straggle along, minding its own business as it continued to search for food.  It looked rather hungry, and getting in its way would prove to be quite problematic. Yoko trailed behind the canine, moving systematically along with the beast. For every step the coyote made, Yoko would make the exact same time. Her concentration upon its figure was flawless. She became a mirror to the beast, mimicking everything it did to avoid its detection. 

She continued to trail behind it, observing it's every move in search for an opportunity to strike. She could have killed the animal anytime she wanted, but she was looking for the exact perfect moment. It had to be absolutely perfect for two reasons; experience, and shock value. As a shinobi who specialized in stealth, she loved the expression on individual's faces when they were killed before they knew they were a target.  It excited her to no ends. Perhaps it was due to her upbringing, or the fact that she was a closet sadist to begin with. 

Eventually, the kunoichi found the perfect moment to strike. As she continued to stalk her prey, she noticed the animal finding a source of food. The coyote ran towards a carcass that looked to be rather fresh.  In a fit of hunger, it began to devour the corpse. Its mind was on one thing, and one thing only, food. The world around it became meaningless in its quest for sustenance.  Yoko on the other hand knew this was the moment. She readied her kunai and inched closer to the coyote. Her presence was masked, and her scent was yet to be caught, as she'd been trailing behind the beast for what seemed to be hours and had yet to be caught.

The blade of the kunai shimmered from the rays of the sun as she lowered her body to an optimal position. The coyote was within her striking range, as she inched closer and closer. Before the animal even had the chance to notice, the female wrapped her arm up underneath the beast's maw, gripping it shut as she dived the kunai into its throat. She dug the blade deep inside of the animal's flesh; the base of the kunai embedded inside.  Quickly, she drew the blade out and stabbed the animal once more, cutting away its vocal cords to rob it of any means to call for help. 

Blood poured out from its wound as Yoko drew her kunai once more. At first the coyote began to resist, but soon it ceased. It was at death's door, and it knew it too. It looked up at the female with eyes of anguish and sorrow, but it did nothing to the natural killer. She simply looked straight back into the animal's eyes as she dug her kunai right into its chest once more.  With the final stab, she felt the coyote's life slip out from its physical form. It didn't bother her as this was natural to her, a killer from birth. 

Yoko pulled her kunai from out of the coyote's corpse and cleaned it with the beast's fur. She then holstered it and lowered the coyote's body onto the ground. She had no use for it, so there was no reason for her to become attached.  Yoko rose up from her crouched position, now covered in animal blood. She glared at the corpse as its crimson fluids of life continued to flow out from its body forming a halo of liquid.  The female stared in silence before turning her back to the corpse and walking off. She still had much to learn in the art of being a shinobi, but with the experience she gained today, it got her a step closer to where she needed to be.* - Thu Oct 22 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) strolled back into the town center covered in blood. She had an indifferent expression on her face as she walked passed various citizen and shinobi. She stopped her stride briefly to look at time, then continued.  She wouldn't stop again until she reached one of the town venders, where she'd purchase some food for her to eat. * - Thu Oct 22 02:16:06 2015

She'd stick her chop sticks into the broth, grasping some noodles up into her mouth. She'd open her maw to slurp the noodles. As she did so, she'd look at Izutora in silence for a brief moment. Once her mouth was clear of any food, she'd reply with a monotone tone. "Yes." The female then dipped her chopsticks into the ramen once more for another helping of the cusine.* - Thu Oct 22 02:21:13 2015

The kunoichi continued to eat her meal of ramen, now sitting down onto the ground.  She folded her legs as to not expose her undergarments since she was wearing a skirt.  She only nodded to Reguel's words, choosing to change when she was done eating.* - Thu Oct 22 02:35:44 2015
