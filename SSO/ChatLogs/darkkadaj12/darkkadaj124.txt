<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was walking about, glancing around for the perfect place to hone her skills. She was the type to seclude herself due to her own mindset. To her, she believed that an enemy could appear at any moment. Thus, she was always on alert, having her guard up 24/7.

As she walked around, she allowed her senses to take over, giving her an idea of what was in her surroundings. She turned her head over to the left, catching a glimpse of a red haired female. He glared at the woman shortly before masking her presence behind a rock.

"I'll observe," she thought to herself, find an interest in the woman.* - Wed Nov 25 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) simply observed the female. She kept an eye on her body's movements. Everything from the most obvious movement, to the minute. She abosrbed it all into her mind. "Too many holes," she thought as she remained stationary.

Then, a thought crossed her mind; a trick. A grin formed upon the usual emotionless face as the female raised her hands together. One by one, her hands came together, then parted, each time forming a different seal. She lacked the speed, but she knew the basics behind the technique. 

Suddenly, strange phantom like figures began to emerge from the immediate area. The first spawning from the cactus before the red head, then shortly after two more appeared from her side.  They moved rather slowly, almost akin to a zombie like creature.

Yoko just watched from the sidelines, interested in the female's reaction.* - Wed Nov 25 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) felt the need to tease the female a bit more, but she held back. As the red head attacked the phantoms, more phantoms would emerge in their stead.  When one was defeated, two would take it's place. Eventually, the initial three would turn into six. Instead of charging forwards, they all remained stationary, positioning themselves all infront of the female.

As Aoi focused her attention onto the phantoms, Yoko began to trail behind. She aligned her breathing with her steps and heart beat, allowing her to move around without making a single sound. Using this opportunity, she approached Aoi, reaching down into her own holster to pull out a kunai.  In a smooth, sleek motion, she drew the kunai and raised it next to the female's throat. 

"You should be more aware of your surroundings," she whispered into the female's ear, pressing her lips close. She'd then lower her weapon, sheathing it back.  As she did so, she snapped her fingers, releasing the genjutsu, causing all of the phantoms to vanish like the wind.* - Wed Nov 25 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) whispers: I've never did it with another woman, but I'm sure it'll be fun.~ -omit- - Wed Nov 25 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) had expected as much.  Her facial expression returned to her usual cold self as the woman's hand smacked into her cheek. Her cheek became red, masking all signs of pain. "No, I do not. It's a wake up call. Had I been an enemy, your head would have already been on the ground.  I'm helping you when you think about it," she responded.* - Wed Nov 25 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) found herself in a secluded area. She did a quick glance, allowing her senses to pick up on any careless movements or sounds just to confirm her suspicions. She was indeed correct about being alone. It was how she did things. She didn't like being around other people, especially the masses in Sunagakure, due to their careless nature and their lack of preparation for danger. To her, they were all sheep awaiting to be slaughtered.

She let out a sigh, observing her surroundings for what to train. She favored stealth and hit and run tactics, thus she decided to practice her aim.  She reached into her holster and pulled out a series of projectiles all ranging from kunai, shurikens down to even senbons.   The female fatale held three shuriken in between the ridges of her knuckles, curling her wrist as if she was preparing to throw a Frisbee. Her eyes locked upon a nearby cactus. It served no purpose except for her to practice on. A smirk formed along her lips as she launched the shuriken over at the unsuspecting cactus.  

The shuriken slice through the air, moving at incredible speeds towards their targets.  Some made their mark, others darted past desired target, embedding themselves into the ground behind it.  Her expression remained motionless at her failure. Instead, she reached down into her pouch and drew another set of projectiles.  

With the second batch in her hands, she launched the projectiles at her target. Out of the three, only one missed.  She nodded, then approached the cactus. She kept her eyes stuck to the plant, reaching her hands to pluck out her discarded weapons. After grabbing each projectile, she walked herself back to her initial starting point.

Yoko didn't see a problem with her skill, rather, she knew what she had to do. She had to train and prepare herself for the inevitable future.  She once again braced herself for her training, calming her mind and observing the cactus. It wasn't a moving target, rather it was stationary, and so there wasn't much difficulty in hitting it.

Like a cat watching a mouse, Yoko paid close attention to the cactus. For the most part, it remained stationary, but occasionally it was pushed by the wind.  When the time was right, she launched another barrage of shuriken at the cactus.  She was observant and took advantage of the blowing winds.  A single gust pushed the trajectory of the shuriken just slightly, enabling her to strike in the dead center of the cactus.   She nodded at her success, crossing her arm to further think of tactics.  "I can use the environment to my advantage. Hm..What about curving? ", she thought, drawing another set of shuriken.

Instead of just throwing straight at the cactus, she decided to test her limits and abilities.  The kunoichi closed her eyes and began to listen carefully with her ears. She could hear the brushing winds, blowing back and forth. They weren't strong gales, but they were a factor.  She remained stationary and silent for a moment, raising her left hand, which held the shurikens.  With a single flick of her wrist, she launched the shuriken out to the side.   Another gust of wind blows onto the shuriken, curving them inwards towards the desired target.  The shuriken all embed themselves into the cactus.  She nods, then tries the tactic once more.* - Fri Dec  4 23:04:57 2015
