<br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) emerged from the ground after leaving her prior location.  As her body rose back onto the surface, she dusted the dirt from her body that remained and glanced around the area.  "Hm, where should I begin," she thought to herself as she began to search for a target for her practice.  

After glancing around for a brief moment, she found another stray animal roaming around; a sick dog.  Her facial expression was rather blank as it displayed no signs of joy or disgust for the animal.  To her, it was a means to an end.  It purpose was to help her hone her skills as a shinobi, and that's what she was going to do. 

Unlike her previous adventure of stalking her pray and killing it, she decided to set up a trap of sorts.  Well, to call it a trap would be an understatement. The female quickly began to weave together a set of handseals one after another, all while building up chakra from her abdomen.  The chakra began to spread all throughout her body, energizing her cells up to the moment she completed the final seal. Upon finishing her seal, she muttered the words, "Doton: Moguragakure no Jutsu".  The instant she said those words, the ground beneath her feet turned into jelly. 

Her body began to sink into the dirt, as if it were a living thing; eating away at her figure. In due time, her entire body was submerged into the earth, masking her presence completely. As per the jutsu, she was granted a sense of awareness.  Using the magnetic pulses around her form, she was able to accurately detect who or what was around her via the ground. 

The female quickly tunneled her way towards her target, the dog, and slowly awaited for her chance to strike.  The dog on the other hand remained stationary and weary. It had spotted the female just moments ago, only to watch her disappear before its eyes. It was on full alert. To attack it now would deal a blow to the female's self-esteem, as she preferred to use stealth and strike when a target isn't weary. Thus, she waited in the ground.

As to not suffocate, she opened up a small hole into the dirt, leading into the surface to allow for oxygen to channel through. It wasn't a lot, but enough for her to not suffocate.  She continued to sit and wait in the ground, awaiting for the dog to loosen its guard up. Upon loosening it up, the female quickly positioned herself directly underneath the animal.  In an instant, she forced her hands out from the ground and grabbed ahold of two of the dog's legs. With a bit of force, she pulled the dog down into the ground, restricting its movements.

Upon dragging it down into the ground just partially, she drew her kunai and cut along the beast's tendons as to bind its movements.  Afterwards, she emerged from the ground just before the dog and glared at it from above.  Without making an expression, she lowered her body to the injured and captive dog and wrapped her arm around its neck. In just a simple motion, she dug the kunai into its throat and made a clean cut along its neck. 

Blood instantly began to squirt out in a high volume. It splattered all over the place like a broken faucet. The color of red blanketed the terracotta colored sand until all that was left was crimson. The dog yelped out in pain as blood continued to gush out, until nothing remained. Its eyes became lifeless and its body limp. It was now dead.  As a sign of respect, the female allowed the ground to swallow up the beast, giving it a proper burial.* - Thu Oct 29 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) as usual, was looking for a secluded place to train her skills. So far she was able to do that, except for this moment. Instead of finding herself a place to train on her own, she found herself before two individuals. One she somewhat recalled, but had no name to connect the face to. The other on the other hand was completely foreign to her mind. 

The female had a look of discomfort as she was ready to turn on her heels to leave. However, something compelled her to stay to see what was going on.  Instead of leaving, she walked over towards the rocks and leaned up against it, eyeing the two to see what she could learn.* - Thu Nov  5 00:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Just a spar. I'm not very skilled, but i'd like to try and hone my craft any chance I get. - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I don't know how I feel about hitting girls.. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Don't worry. I'm use to being hit after being in Kirigakure. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) had watched the two spar against each other, and had properly assessed the female.   From her own observations, the female seemed to pride herself in the use of suiton ninjutsu, while the blonde had a mix.  Out of the two, he seemed more dangerous.  

Now that their sparring session had ended, she was preparing to leave, however she turned her head upon hearing the female speak of continuing on with either herself or the new male who stood not too far from her.

Yoko turned her body towards the female and gave her a blank stare, only to open her mouth for a reply. "I suppose I can test my skill. I accept your challenge."* - Thu Nov  5 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) looked down at her holster, and bag to check the status of her equipment. She definately had enough for the sparring session.  After checking her current stock, she began to walk towards the female, then stopped just a few feet away. 

"I'm ready whenever you are," she spoke out as she gripped the handle her tanto which rested above the curve of her rear.* - Thu Nov  5 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yoo. - Thu Nov  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) treated spars like actual combat. Of course, killing wasn't permitted, but when she fought, she'd fight with her all.  It was the red-haired girl's mistake to not go onto the offensive the very first step. Yoko knew better from observation.  She herself didnt' have that many battles under her belt, but she did have the skill to observe. 

The pale skinned female released her grip from her tanto, and slowly lowered her hand down to her bag. With a flick of her thumb, she unfastened the bag which allowed her to slip her hand inside to grab aholf od the nessecary tools she'd need.

In just an instant, the female raised her hand up into the air, all while holding onto a single orbed object.  She took a deep breath right as she slammed the orb onto the ground. Upon it's impact, the orb broke open, releasing a thick plume of smoke.  Whether the smoke had any poison in it or not was a mystery.

As the plume continued to spawn from the orb, Yoko quickly weaved a chain of handseals as she gathered up chakra around her body.  Once she finished the last seal, she stomped her foot into the ground, causing a hole to form. The hole would then expand just enough to allow the female's entire body to seep into the ground.  Using the smoke as a cover, she descended down into the ground in preparation for her next move.* - Thu Nov  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) didn't realize that she left her entrance hole open. That was an error on her part, thus she quickly fixes said error by sealing the hole just as the water was being expelled.  Now that she was underground, she had the element of surprise. 

There were various methods she could use, but upon paying close attention to the magnetic forces above, she realize that her methods were lessening as the sparring continued.  

The shinobi pondered for a moment as she began to travel forwards towards Mana's location. It wasn't difficult, in fact it was fairly easy to locate her. As she remained underground, she could feel the terrain rumble and change just slightly.

"I'm going to have to rethink my strategy," she thought to herself as she traveled through the ground.* - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) continued to drive forward with her plan. She'd follow Mana's movements, all while rising up from the ground just enough to touch the crust.  All while remaining underground, she'd place a tag on the ceiling then descend further into the earth. 

She only had a limited amount of time before she had to come back to the surface for air, so she planned accordingly. After placing two tags onto the crust, she resumed her game of "tag".* - Thu Nov  5 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) decided that she was done with perparations. After she noticed Mana changing her direction, Yoko began to persue in an effort to cut her off.  However, instead of just appearing before the red-haired woman, Yoko executed a single seal.

Upon releasing the seal, the tags that she had set previously began to bubble with chakra. In an instant, they exploded, opening the ground below. This resulted in causing the water to seep into the crater and down into the pathway she made prior. 

Taking advantage of the explosion, Yoko slowly rose up from the ground making not the faintest of sounds. As she did so, she'd try her best to hide her presence, treating the scenario as live combat. 

The female once again reached into her bag and drew out a single kunai. She waved her hand over it, as if placing something over it before she properly held it in her grip.  

"Time to go on the offense," she thought to herself as she began to head over towards her foe. As she travele through the muddied sand, she posistioned her body and strength in such a way as to cause a void of sound from her every step. * - Thu Nov  5 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was rather shocked when she saw the female descend down into the ground.  "So she knows doton as well? This is going to be challenging," she thought to herself as she drew her tanto and stabbed it into the ground.  

The female would then once again reach into her bag, drawing wires to wrap around the handle of the bladed weapon. After she was done, she tethered a few more wires onto some of the projectile weapons she carried and tossed them as far as she possibly can, all while spreading them out.

This allowed her to travel without walking upon the grounds.  As the female jumped ontop of her embedded blade, she began to strategize once more. "If it's the same jutsu I just used, I'm going to have to be careful.  I'm unable to locate her using normal means..There's two options, follow, or wait. Hm..I'll force her out," she mummbled.

After a considerate amount of planning, she once again drew out a small ball from her bag. Unlike prior, the ball was now wrapped in explosion tags, about three or so.  A wicked smile formed upon Yoko's face as she chucked it over towards where she had last seen the female. * - Thu Nov  5 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: let's move - Thu Nov  5 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Not here. .  - Thu Nov  5 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right. - Thu Nov  5 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was vigilent in keeping on her toes. She'd use her senses to try to locate her opponent should she rise from the ground.  Just as she had previously thought, her senses were in her favor.

Upon her opponent rising from the ground, she smelled the faint scent of dirt and the female's own odor. Yoko smiled as she quickly jumped off of the tanto and performed a backflip to reach her foe. As she did so, she'd pull her arm back, yanking the tag covered ball she threw prior. It had a thin wire attatched to it, making it fairly simple for people to miss. 

As the ball followed her movements, she executed a seal to cause it to explode, allowing the gas to expand and over her form. Yoko held her breath once more as a thick plume of smoke quickly covered the area.  Using the smoke to advantage, she'd launch a kick towards the female's head just as she expelled the mud. 

"That should be the last," she thought to herself.* - Thu Nov  5 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) used her foot to jump around Mana after planting her initial kick. The female found herself positioned behind the red head. Using her last kunai, she brought it upon Mana's neck and whispered the words, "Check mate."  The words that flowed from her mouth harbored no emotion or pride, just the dread of fear.  It was as if she was actually taking the sparring to heart as a life or death battle. However, she held restraint as this was indeed a spar and nothing more than that.* - Thu Nov  5 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) lowered he blade as she sheathed it back into her holster. Seeing how it was her victory, she began to walk over towards her scattered weapons to retrieve them.  There were a lot of room for improvement in her approach.   In all honesty, she was rather happy that she took this opportunity as it allowed her to assess her own strengths and weaknesses. * - Thu Nov  5 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) leaves the area to finish her training.* - Thu Nov  5 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) could be heard walking into the village square.  Her tanto clanged against her holster with each step. The average height female stopped her progress in the center of the square, there for all to see. 

The female clad in all black stood still eyeing everyone in the area. She said no words, opting to remain distant and silent. * - Sun Nov  8 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Seems we got a new face here... they probuly been here for awhile though... The guards wouldnt let anyone in - Sun Nov  8 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) exhibited no aura off malice or tranquility. She was as gray as they came. The female crossed her arms as she continued to observe those around her. * - Sun Nov  8 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: How did it go? - Sun Nov  8 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: ..? - Sun Nov  8 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) continued to observe her surroundings. She'd suddenly catch a wiff of an unfamilar being approaching her. Quickly, she reached for a kunai which rested inside of her holster and drew it, twirling her body around to face the priest. In just an instant, she pointed the blade towardst he man's neck, glaring at him with a sense of blood lust. 

She didn't do it on purpose, rather it was an automatic defense.  She was rather the cautious type, and approaching her from behind was a rather dangerous thing.  When she noticed who it was, she lowered her weapon and sheathed the kunai.

"Don't sneak up on me," she commented with a monotone expression. * - Sun Nov  8 04:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) just looked at the man. She didn't know why he approached her, but for whatever reason he withdrew. In response to his questionn, she simply uttered "Yoko."* - Sun Nov  8 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I kinda feel out of place. I'm not much for small talk. - Sun Nov  8 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) had nothing to say to the priest, instead she turned around to face the others. * - Sun Nov  8 04:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) glanced over at Yan, almost as if she were being disturbed.  However, that didn't prevent the female from answering. "No, we have not."* - Sun Nov  8 05:03:47 2015

She didn't know what the male did, but she knew that he was considered a criminal. Even if he were to be cuffed directly infront of her, she took no chances as anything could happen at any moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) glanced over at Fujitora and Yan as the word "interrogation" hovered in the air."An interrogation technique? Sounds useful. I should get close to the two to obtain it. It'll make future tasks easier in the long run," she thought to herself.  She was the type to plan ahead, thus adding such a technique to her arsenal would truly benefitial. After all, she had pride in her skills as a shinobi. * - Sun Nov  8 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Whenever you are ready, then. - Sun Nov  8 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) watched the two walk off. She'd wait a bit until she herself began to trail them. She'd minimize her presence, using basic tactics to trail the two without alerting them. * - Sun Nov  8 05:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) continued to follow the two up until they reached a hut. The female hid behind a tree as she observed Fujitora and Yan's movement. "So they went into that house? I see..Then I'll leave for now," she thought to herself as she withdrew from the area. However, she halted herself upon noticing the familar face of Trilliam and Koji.

The two weren't familar to her per say, but she recognized their face due to the fact that she had just ran into them moments prior.  Instead of withdrawing back to the town center, she hid behind a building, climbing it to get a better view of what was going on. As she neared the top, she hugged her body against the structure, blending into the surroundings as best as she could.* - Sun Nov  8 05:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was rather bored, so she decided to walk around the village. After walking around for quite some time, she took notice to the large amount of people over at the training fields.

The female cautiously approached the group, remaining silent.* - Sun Nov  8 06:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) glanced over at Izanami. She paid the woman no mine, rather she was more attentative to the naked individual. It was odd.  No normal person would walk around in the nude, so she was on high alert. She took a step back, motioning her arms towards her tools, preparing herself for the worst.* - Sun Nov  8 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) continued to observe the two, more so Shira. To her, he was the one to be the most cautious around. After all, he walked around nude.* - Sun Nov  8 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Yo. - Sun Nov  8 06:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) remained silent, only responding to the male with a finger pointing at his exposed body.* - Sun Nov  8 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Eh? - Sun Nov  8 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) let out a sigh from the male's response.  It was as if he were baiting her, but she was surely not going to bite.  Instead, she took another step back, all while maintaining eye sight with the male.  Her left hand continued to reach behind for her blade which rested lateral of her hip.* - Sun Nov  8 06:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) would keep her eyes upon Yan. As a shinobi, one must be prepared at all times. Her eyes examined his form, making various mental notes about the male. She recalled watching the male sparring against Mana a few days prior. During that spar, she obtained some information on Yan's combat style.

Unlike Yan, she didn't have any particular combative stance. Instead of taking up an offensive stance, the female motioned her left hand to reach for her pouch. She'd grab a few items as she kept her guard up against Yan.

"Long range is probably out of the question. I'll just have to get close," she thought as she began to strategize.* - Sun Nov  8 06:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) found it strange how she didn't pick up the male's scent when she noticed the figure from the corner of her eyes.  When she turned her head, she noticed another had appeared before her eyes. Instead of going for an attack, she pulled out a small ball from her pouch and slammed it against the ground. 

Black smoke would rise from the orb, quickly blanketing her figure and obscuring herself from Yan and the "clones". Afterwards, she'd quickly form a chain of seals. As chakra coated her form, she pressed her foot against the dirt to open a hole large enough for her to sink in. 

Soon her body descended into the dirt, closing the hole behind her. When the smoke settled, she was deep in the ground. She'd cross her arms as she began to think of the situation. Had the clones followed her, she'd have an idea as to what the technique was. * - Sun Nov  8 07:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) sensed the changes in the earth via magnetic forces. It appears that Yan had also taken underground, along with another individual. What baffled her was the fact that she could feel that Yan had yet to move from his initial location. 

Upon recieving this information, she had to change her course of actions.  She understood two things instantly; staying underground would be disadvantageous for her, while appearing above ground would also prove to be difficult.  It was her own mistake for not taking the initiative in the beginning. She let out a sigh as she was slowing being pressed against the wall.  But that's where the fun began.

Yoko emerged from the ground with her hand once again in her pouch. She slowly removed her hand from the pouch, now wielding two kunai between her knuckles. The female smiled as she tossed the projectiles forwards at the stationary Yan.  After doing so, she'd clasp her hands together to draw chakra once more.

Beside her, two plumes of smoke emerged, giving birth to two carbon copies of the female.  The two copies imitated Yoko's movements just before the two copies tossed projectiles themselves. * - Sun Nov  8 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) was rather analytical of those around her. Unless stated otherwise, she viewed the world as a place where one could easily be attacked. Therefore she had little trust in others, and often relied on her own skills and merits.

The female continued to remain silent. She wasn't ignoring Tetsumi, rather she just didn't respond to his words. Instead of just standing in the field doing nothing, she decided it was time to leave to improve her skills. She'd casually walk past the group, releasing a cold "don't touch me" type of vibe.* - Mon Nov  9 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) kept an eye on Tetsumi as she neared the exit.  It was a shame that there was only one entrance/exit to the field.  She halted her stride upon seeing the male blocking her path. She'd glare at him with daggers as she took a few steps back.  

The woman slowly began to lower her arms, reaching towards her kunai holster. She had no idea what the male was capable of, let alone what went on in his mind. To her, the situation could end up progressing into two distinct routes; combat or other. 

Expecting the worst, she instinctivly put her guard up, preparing herself for what was to come.  As she glared Tetsumi, she began to plan various strategies to take him down should the need arise.* - Mon Nov  9 05:29:48 2015

She quickly pivoted to the right, then shifted to the left and ran off. As she did so, she'd remove her hand from her holster, bringing it up to her chest to meet with her other. With the two hands together, she quickly weaved a sequence of seals before expelling the chakra.

When the chakra expelled from her body, it wrapped around her form just as she stomped her foot into the ground.  Upon doing so, the dirt beneath her feet opened up to form a hole just large enough for the shinobi to sink in. Her body descended down into the earth, quickly leaving no remains of her presence in the dirt.  The hole closed up behind her as she continued her stride via underground. * - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
