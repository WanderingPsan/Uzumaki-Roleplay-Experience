<br><font color=yellow>*Kuno(Tavren) walks over to the tree which was right in front of him. Kuno was very exhausted from all the training he did. He decided to take a few minutes to rest, Kuno took a deep breath and released it feeling relaxed. He squats down by the tree slowly, very sore and takes a seat under the tree. He leans his back up against the tree with a huge sigh. He rests his eyes listening to the wind bush up against his face

He thinks to himself, "Gee.. this sure is nice." I small smile appears on his face as he crosses his arms.* - Sat Nov 21 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kuno(Tavren) yawns loudly followed by a stretch, He stands up quick and says, "That was a good rest." Kuno looks around thinking to himself, "I need to find a teacher... But who can..?" He looks at all the idividuals around him and soon just looks to the ground in wonder. He thinks, "Well No use in just looking around when the time is right one will come." He begins to walk to the exit. He has a huge smile on his face, full of confidence and no worry.* - Sat Nov 21 03:38:01 2015
