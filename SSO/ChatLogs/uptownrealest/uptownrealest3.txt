<br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's senses kicked in. The handseal from the unscathed guard signaled for the activation of a Genjutsu, something Tethys couldn't really prevent against through natural means. Instead, however, he jumps back a foot or so to gather some room and formed his own handseal in an attempt to reboot his chakra network. Of course by time he did such a thing his mind would make it seem like he was already falling victim of the caving ground.

If the rebooting of his chakra network was successful, Tethys would focus on the guard that casted the Genjutsu; time for him to have a broken jaw. At that moment, with an attempt to go full speed, Tethys would charge forward and attempt to clothesline the shit out of the guard.* - Thu Sep 10 23:28:12 2015

Just as he broke the shoulder of Genjutsu specialist, the security seal placed on Tethys activated. By time he was to come to his senses, with his pupils coming back into existence, Tethys saw everyone coming in for the kill. "Fuck," muttered the Hogo as he quickly formed two handseals before slamming his fists into the ground, a shield of wind protecting Seisuke. "Oi, enough. This shouldn't have escalated to such degree."* - Thu Sep 10 23:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You ready Tethys? - Fri Sep 11 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Mhm./ - Fri Sep 11 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Let's go. - Fri Sep 11 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) knew from the start that this was going to be a fight rather than a spar, but still precautions were identified. A smirk overcame Tethys at the sight of Hassan powering up, something that hasn't been done in over five years. As if synchronizing himself with Hassan, Tethys would center his mind and breathing, causing his instincts to go primal. The noticeable difference was in the slight skin tone difference in Tethys along with the more wool-like hair that sat on his head.

"Stage one against stage one.. Lets go."* - Fri Sep 11 16:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) grunts a bit, allowing his own concentration of chakra to develop. Within seconds, after gathering moisture from his body to reside in his right arm, the entire limb maximized. That being said, once successfully transforming, Tethys brings his right palm to the back of his left should, applying chakra to a seal located in that area. Upon doing so, form behind a cloud of smoke, came Tethys' newly modified blade. He gripped its hilt and simply waited for Hassan's next move.* - Fri Sep 11 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: Wonder what is going on here. - Fri Sep 11 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes widened a bit, having being the first time he got a good look at Hassan's eye. While attempting to keep his cool and relatively remain calm, Tethys simply smirks while cautiously approaching the matter at hand. "I see, I see. I suppose it's an honor to see what new tricks such a life-seasoned dog has learned.~"

With that being said, while forming a single handseal, Tethys needed chakra within his stomach. With a quick dash to the ride, in an attempt to angle himself, Tethys would open his jaws and send a quick torrent of water toward Hassan. He knew that this wouldn't affect the Sergeant, but it's just to get a proper feels of the stakes at hand.* - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: A spar? - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: Hmmm A suiton technique I have not leeched off of him. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's anticipation was that Hassan would stay within the line of attack, almost mocking the simply water propulsion. To his dismay, Tethys was forced to watch Hassan easily maneuver out of the path and finish the handseals he was setting up. As if everything was in sync with Hassan's movements, Tethys was met with the sudden weight gain of his body. Initiatively he didn't know it was Genjutsu. His ability to sense didn't track down any flow of chakra toward him, so it must've been a hidden trigger; which was obviously caught in his line of sight by Hassan.

"Damn it, what's going on," thought Tethys as he looked at Hassan in slight confusion. Even his ability to wield his sword was becoming a chore as he slowly deflated his engorged arm. "A hell of a technique," he continued to think as he formed another handseal to prepare himself.* - Fri Sep 11 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a grunt, watching Hassan close in the distance with his infamous finger combination. Experience in battle with Hassan told Tethys that the last thing he needed was for Hassan to land that jutsu, so he relied slowly on his reflex rather than his overall speed. That being said, Tethys use this opportunity to liquefy and seep into the water below their feet; of course Hassan's wind armor was pushing at the surface more than ever, but the idea was doable enough to just get away from Hassan.

From that point, Tethys would make an attempt to maneuver away from the old-head; space between them would be wonderful. One that Tethys had to face was the fact that even in his liquid stat he was slowed. Once a few feet away from Hassan, though, Tethys would solidify his body and look on with anticipation. "You never cease to amaze me, old man."* - Fri Sep 11 17:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Zetsumo would -have- to take it head on. When he has his masks disconnected from his body, he has -3.3 Genjutsu stat) - Fri Sep 11 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmmmm. - Fri Sep 11 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Depending on his nin defence i would cut straight through his body like butter) - Fri Sep 11 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Tethyss~ - Fri Sep 11 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: How about you teach me that water jutsu you just used. - Fri Sep 11 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Fam. his ninjutsu defense is fodder.) - Fri Sep 11 17:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: The water stream you sent from your mouth. - Fri Sep 11 17:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's body felt like the weight that suddenly came over him was lifted, like a bird flying for the first time. His eyes narrowed a bit, speculations reigning over him. He figured that it was related to the eye Hassan covered up; naturally Tethys didn't ask any questions. "You're as impressive as ever," he says as he tucked his hands in his pants pockets, releasing his primal state.* - Fri Sep 11 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: What do you have to trade me with, Kirie? - Fri Sep 11 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Umm... - Fri Sep 11 17:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: What all do you have pertaining to the water element? - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'll take the hidden mist technique in exchange for the jutsu you saw me use. - Fri Sep 11 17:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walked over to her, offering the scroll he had gripped to her.* - Fri Sep 11 17:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) smirked a bit, sealing away both his sword and the scroll. "Mhmm."* - Fri Sep 11 17:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Fri Sep 11 17:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What to do. - Fri Sep 11 17:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Depends on what you're talking about. - Fri Sep 11 17:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I could go teach a brat someting. - Fri Sep 11 17:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Or I could learn several new jutsus. - Fri Sep 11 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Up to you, really. - Fri Sep 11 17:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Im not feeling in a teahy mood though - Fri Sep 11 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) turns to face Hassan, grabbing the old man and hoisting him over his shoulder; the poor old man went off in a daze again. With that, Tethys would would begin walking southward, heading back to the main square. "Sharing your knowledge will help raise the Village forces."* - Fri Sep 11 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Good practice for  you, try and guess what it will do.  - Fri Sep 11 20:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see how disliking a man that can't mind is own business classifies as being spoiled. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright, then let's move out of the way a bit. - Fri Sep 11 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys stood before everyone, a sigh releasing from his visage. It was that time where he started his progressive training once again, yippee. To start off, whilst continuing his conversation with Jin, Tethys begins stretching his legs; he bends one leg at a time, extending it after a minute or so, and then repeats the process with the opposite leg.  Once he was done, he starts looking around for his check points.* - Fri Sep 11 23:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys had used the far left bench for a checkpoint last time, so it was only natural that he used something else this time around. He continues to move his head from left to right, surveying the area. After a few seconds of looking, Tethys decides to just pick the right post in front of the building as the first checkpoint. The second checkpoint would obviously be his current location.* - Fri Sep 11 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Just how much space do you plan on needing? - Fri Sep 11 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys formed the handseal necessary for his training, allowing his chakra to knead and swell within his body. Within mere seconds, after pushing his chakra outward, Tethys was replaced with a cloud of smoke.  Like usual, his new location was identified as the right post in front of the Academy's door. Once there, without any hesitation, Tethys allowed his chakra to burst forth once again; his new location being his former.* - Fri Sep 11 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Well. - Fri Sep 11 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys has yet to get over the side effects of shunshining in succession. It drained him both physically and mentally, having him exhausted and dizzy as hell. Still, though, he didn't let up on his training. He staggers back a bit, panting for air and attempting to catch his breath. Not wanting to give up, he straightens up the best he could while keeping the handseal woven.* - Fri Sep 11 23:15:50 2015

"D-Damn, why does this take so much," he asks his self out loud as he laid there on the ground.* - Fri Sep 11 23:16:41 2015
