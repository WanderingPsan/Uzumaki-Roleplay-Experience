<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Benefits are meant to attract a small group of people, as a whole the village will not help you to make a weapon, especially when so many hide behind the Gezo and see no need for weapons or even violence. - Sun Sep 13 04:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || A sigh was released from Tethys as he sensed the movement of Jiki's iron sand. Soon enough, with no protest, the manipulator was airborne. There was only one thing Tethys wished to say, "I've experienced before, Jiki; plenty of times. You're safe here, guy. No need to hide from it and us."* - Sun Sep 13 05:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) folds his arms across his chest, taking a step closer in the direction in which Jiki was located. An audible sigh came from the Jounin as Jiki spoke, a sigh of understanding. "The pain you feel on the inside isn't going to be dealt with alone. It only gets worse until you find that foundation of trust and friendship that could overpower said pain. Come with me, let us talk and battle alone. Everything will be fine. No fingers will be pointed and no judgments will be laid, it's just you and I."* - Sun Sep 13 06:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's ankles flicked at that instance, a quick sprint to follow Jiki. He didn't show any intention to patronize the teenager, but to simply talk his way through this. Of course, Tethys used his ability to sense to keep a tight bind on Jiki's location as he traveled on the sand suspension.* - Sun Sep 13 06:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 13 06:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) managed to keep up with Jiki for the most part, a feat that he didn't think he'd even be able to pull off. By time the teen was to land and disperse the gathered sand, Tethys was standing off in the distance. Both his hands were safely tucked in his pockets, no sign of ill-intent emanating from the Jounin of Kirigakure. The words of Jiki trailed to Tethys' ears, it was faint but understandable; similar to that of a whisper in the wind. A deep sigh came from Tethys when he saw Jiki become startled at his own reflection, something that Tethys once faced his self a few years ago.

"There's a point in life where this all becomes easier," said Tethys in a mellow tone for Jiki to hear. "All this pain- this lack of surety of who you could trust and can't trust; it gets easier. It's up to you though, Jiki. It's a matter of allowing someone to hear, and listen, to your story. Once you do that, and find that the person you released all that too is genuine, everything else just falls in to place."* - Sun Sep 13 06:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took a careful step forward, making sure that every inch of the way was able to be viewed and interpreted; still no ill-intent in his posture. The question didn't exactly catch Tethys off guard, but was a question that Tethys hasn't answered since he came to mends with his own demons. He gave Jiki a temperate smile, it was warm and fulfilling.

"A few weeks ago, the day Zetsumo came for Orakuru in Sunagakure, and you learned of Kronos' death; I was there. I did the best I could do to hold off Zetsumo as he closed in on Chiyari, but I was too late when it came to noticing Kronos in the tight situation he was in. Loyalty to Sunagakure, the original Sunagakure, is strong when it comes to me. I've done countless things to assure Sunagakure, and Kirigakure alike, safety. Fact of the matter, Jiki, I was just too late," spoke Tethys as he took another careful step forward.

"You and I may not be in the same boat, Jiki, but we are on the same wave. I know the pain of lose, I know the pain of betrayal and I know the pain of confusion. All that, I know like the back of my hand; it's not easy. There's a reason I nicknamed you Hound all those years ago. Before I even witnessed what's harboring inside you, I felt something from you; nothing involving that thing inside you, but a sensation that only a loyal Hound within a pack gives. How much am I willing to open myself to? As much as you are at this moment, Jiki."* - Sun Sep 13 06:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The words of Jiki entered Tethys' ears and registered within his mind, signing a contract of permanency and was stocked away deep in his head. Not once did Tethys facial expression change, it was the constant glare of understanding that he introduced Jiki to at the start of this conversation. Still, though, the pain in Jiki's words dawned on Tethys and dusked on him in the very same way; there was still no break of emotion from the Jounin.

By time Jiki mention Kastya the first time in his reclamation of his past, Tethys would've closed the distance between the two of them to merely a few feet. Once the teenager was done speaking, Tethys raised his right arm and poised his fist toward Jiki.

"Throughout all that, I've heard one thing and one thing only. I heard a man tell me his experience to be just that; a man. Pain has been reining over us Shinobi for too long, it's time we step up and fight back against it. Jiki, I understand. There's nothing more I can say to comfort you and let you know that I'm here for you other than simply stating.. I understand. That pain you feel, my friend, it's soon over. Whatever is manifesting within you will soon be your past for I have plans to bring this world to a place where peace is no long a fairy tale, but a reality."

Tethys stretches his arm out even more, now asking for Jiki to bump it with his. "I follow the code of Ride or Die. Simply put, either you Ride with me to the upmost goal of peace, or you're categorized as a follower of pain." It was clear, by those words, that Tethys was suggesting that Jiki too consider following by the Ride or Die code.* - Sun Sep 13 08:15:34 2015

The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Are you willing to begin the basics of learning how to sense, or do you want to wait until I'm able to train you one on one. - Sun Sep 13 18:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uh... - Sun Sep 13 18:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a sigh, clapping his hands together like a teacher that was about to give a long lecture. "I suppose I can teach you both at the same time," the Hogo spoke as he looked from Setsuna to Seisuke. "To start off, training with me is unorthodox. I don't follow the same rules other people do, I teach you the hard way out that way the easy way comes natural to you. That being said, the lesson for sensing ability," he pauses to look specifically at Setsuna, "is something that requires an open mind." After saying those last six words, his eyes narrowed once they fell upon the frame of Seisuke. "The training for your wind elemental training, if I'm not mistaken, will be relatively easier that Setsuna's training; only because her training is more time consuming."

From that point, Tethys' training started. He began with forming a string of handseals, slowly weaving them for Seisuke to see. "This technique is known as Godly Wind from the Mountains. It is the ideal example on how you must mold your chakra and exert the necessary amount to where once it leaves your body; it provides a gust of wind. The trick to this technique, which I love for training purposes, is that it is a vortex-like thing. That means you have to tweak it to spin like said vortex." Tethys' arms raised in front of him as he pushed out the required amount of chakra, allowing a vortex of wind to spawn in Seisuke's general location. "I'm not going to disclose how to create the vortex, that's for you to learn."

Tethys' focus switched back to Setsuna, giving her his undivided attention. "Sensing chakra is the same as advancing on one of your natural senses; tasting, feeling, hearing, seeing and smell. In this case, you're adding a sixth sense to all that. Seeing as though there are many forms of sensing for different people and their natural ability, I can't really determine which of your natural senses will be the best for you when it comes to sensing chakra. That being said, I want you to meditate and determine which of your natural five senses you're more comfortable with. Yes, this does involve the tasting sense."* - Sun Sep 13 19:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) stood before his shinobi, hands tucked in his pockets and a stern look on his face. His eyes trailed from one to the other, starting at the far right and trailing to the far left.

"I stand before you, not as the Mizukage, not as a Jounin, not even has a Hogo. I stand before you as an ally, one that seeks your aide in an upcoming battle," spoke Tethys. His voice was subtle and emotionless, showing that whatever he had planned to explain to everyone was as serious as an heart attack. "I stand before you a shinobi of this forsaken world, a shinobi that wants a world where my child can explore without fear of being killed at a whim. I stand before you a man that wants nothing more than peace and nothing less. We have a tyrant that has been running amuck for too long now. As an allied force, Sunagakure, Kirigakure and Kumogakure, can take this tyrant down."

Tethys continues to survey the shinobi before him, making sure to meet eye contact with each person his pupils pass over.

"There was talk of hatred when Sunagakure refugees came here. Hatred and pain that can only be understood by those who experience life to the upmost fullest," Tethys points to his self, "If there is truly hatred between our villages, Kirigakure and Sungakure, allow me to harbor that hatred. Allow me to harbor that pain that riddle our hearts and I'll take it to Hell where I dine with the devil himself. Allow me to carry that weight and I assure you, for all that is good, peace and serenity will prevail." Tethys takes a step forward, staring at everyone in a general basis.

"I'm asking you to lend me your strengths. Be it little or plentiful, lend it to me so I can carve out a section of peace through this world of pain and hatred. Allow me to be your lead and I assure you, Shinobi of Kirigakure and Sungakure, there will be a brighter life.."* - Sun Sep 13 20:14:56 2015
