<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took grasp of the scroll, hand trembling from the emotions running through him. It was known that Tethys was able to summon monkeys, but the fact of the matter is that his soul was intent on the sharks. Was this his chance? With no mental delay, Tethys brought his opposing hand to his mouth and bit down on the tip of his index finger.

With the trickle of blood apparent, Tethys would open the scroll and sign his name on it. Whether or not his contract with the Monkey's broke, he didn't care. The sharks were... chomping away.. at his soul.* - Sun Aug 30 19:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) continued to glare at the scroll until it was hitched at the small of Ikaro's back, he broke away soon after. A sigh escaped him as he looked at Ikaro and gave a smirk.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: (Gucci!) - Sun Aug 30 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Tethys, with his eyes fixated on Ikaro, gave a smirk. It's been a while since he and his younger brother had trained together; much less have a decent conversation that didn't pertain to strict business. With a sigh of concentration, while his chakra took grasp of the moisture in his body, Tethys spoke; "When it comes to this technique there's two things you need to understand: you're not liquefying your entire body and you need to concentrate the moisture from the rest of your body into a single arm."

As the last word rolled off his tongue, Tethys released a grunt. Following the grunt, the visible moisture from his body surged to his right arm and bulges its frame. "Now. With the moisture being transferred to your right arm you have to be sure that the inside of your arm isn't completely solid and prepared to expand with your skin. If not, you'll blow your own arm off; no worries though.~" With the moisture now taking form in his right arm, Tethys expanded it out even more; each vein and blood vessel become more defined and the overall muscle maximizing past full capacity. "In the end you'll get this."* - Sun Aug 30 19:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The smirk plastered on his face slowly leaked away, it was about that time things got more serious. "When it comes to this arm, though, your movement speed is lowered.. but you're attacking speed is actually raised. When it comes to full on dashes, don't depend too much on this arm; but when it comes to actually swinging this thing around, give it your heart and soul and it'll grant you victory in exchange."

No words were said afterwards, just action. The second Ikaro came back around to face Tethys, the Hogo Leader was met with a swift swing to his nose at maximum speed. However, despite the speed, Tehys purposely stopped his arm just before it was to connect with Ikaro.* - Sun Aug 30 20:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's arm metaphorically deflates, the moisture returning back to the remainder of his body. With a smirk now creeping back on his face, Tethys took a few steps back and just examined the form of Ikaro; he did plan on throwing in advice on Ikaro's posture. Tethys also had his sensing eyes on Ikaro's chakra flow.* - Sun Aug 30 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed, the chakra examination he was making on Ikaro's body was apparent. "You're getting the hang of it, but allow your muscles in your arm to flux. Don't tense them as you're adding moisture to them."* - Sun Aug 30 20:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was able to sense the girl so eventually his eyes ventured to her location before he walked over to ther and knocking on the tall statue frame to get her attention. "Hello there."* - Sun Aug 30 21:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave Suzuna a nonchalant glare, yet another shy person that he had to bully into confidence. It took him a few seconds to examine exactly what the female was doing and what she was hiding behind so in the end it was just a matter of bringing the topic up. "So you're a armor blacksmith, huh..?"* - Sun Aug 30 21:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's gaze was momentarily grasped by the jockstrap, he's only seen one in his life time and it was by himself in haste. A sigh, disappointment was clear in his demeanor, came from Tethys as he slowly shook his to deny the strap. "No thank you, I was looking for something more on the line of battle armor."* - Sun Aug 30 21:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released another sigh and gave a shrug. "Right, right. Very well then. When you have the material let me know, I have the money ready."* - Sun Aug 30 21:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) D:< face.* - Mon Aug 31 02:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: Kenshin is fast at everything but snatching girls.. - Mon Aug 31 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) smirked.* - Mon Aug 31 02:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's smirks transitions into a smile of amusment.* - Mon Aug 31 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked his palms in his pants pocket and walked south.* - Mon Aug 31 02:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) stood there and watched as Koeki closed in, hair now tucked back in a ponytail and fists clenched in wait for the perfect opportunity. With no words said, Tethys took the initiative to react to the distance closing blue head; he aided her in her efforts. With the two now dashing toward each other, and Tethys' hands still tucked in his pockets, he learned his chin in. Just as Koeki went to strike, he purposely moved his head to just enough for her fist to barely graze his cheek.

Wanting to use that deliberate sacrifice to his advantage, the renowned Private of Kirigakure steps forward one more time while bringing his right knee up in an attempt to connect with Koeki's stomach.
* - Mon Aug 31 02:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || His knee was easily caught by Koeki's open palm, negating the blunt force of the strike all together. Yet another smirk, which seemed to be apparent more and more, crept back on his face as he would use his opposing leg to shift the moment a bit. With his spine now twisting clockwise and her foot firm on the ground whilst poised counter clockwise, Tethys attempted to rotate around Koeki altogether.

That being said, with little to no time to waste, Tethys quickly untucked his right and stretched it; his intent was to ram his entire forearm in the side of her head. Of course, however, this was a simple spar so his maximum strength and speed were nowhere to be found.* - Mon Aug 31 02:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed at the sight of Koeki ducking under his strike. Come time for the sweep of his legs, it was successful and fulfilled with no errors or rebuttal. On his way down, however, Tethys kept the same arm out stretched and opened the palm. Using that momentum to catch himself, Tethys would follow up with swinging his left foot forward in a Spartan motion to Sweet Chin Music Koeki.* - Mon Aug 31 03:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a smile as he stood to his feet and, with both hands now untucked, dusted himself off. Soon after, with nothing said, he weaved a set of hand seals together and summoned a vast pool of chakra to his stomach. Quickly, with no time to waste, Tethys would pucker his lips and dash forward. Once close enough, that was identified as only a yard away, Tethys launched a power stream of water out.* - Mon Aug 31 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a nod, placing his hands back in his pockets and walking toward one of the benches. "I quit anyways, you win."* - Mon Aug 31 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks around to make sure Noriko was by them. He leans over to Ikaro and spoke, "Pussy.. best thing in the world."* - Mon Aug 31 09:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) brung is right palm over to the back of his left shoulder and applied chakra to the seal located there. Behind a puff of smoke came his infamous black blade.* - Mon Aug 31 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) casually looked on.* - Mon Aug 31 11:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) seals back his blade. "Nope, no one is good with swords here."* - Mon Aug 31 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks at him, giving a nod and extending his fist. "Yo'."* - Mon Aug 31 18:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Wyn coded himself to have 3x the exp boost from everyone else) - Mon Aug 31 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was relatively nothing like Ikaro as far as fighting style come to play. Tethys would rather take the full force of a punch to the jaw than liquefy for the sake of saving his own ass, that often got him in to some deep shit. This, however, was a matter of testing out his opponent though so by time Baen managed to begin the process of closing in the distance between them Tethys aided him.

That being said, with his hands now untucked from his pockets, the renowned Black Blade poised his clenched fist up to chest level and decided to make an attempt to match the swinging speed and strength of Baen; enough to maybe negate their kinetic forces and result in an audibly thud between them.* - Mon Aug 31 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's wasn't to profoundly win the spar thus yet, but to slowly build up into the good stuff. Once Baen took flight and aimed to pummel his head in, the experienced Jounin did the only thing he could do --- back up. Of course, however, with him barely escaping the range of the kick Tethys was left with little time to react with an actual counter attack; he made it work the best he can though. With Baen having nowhere else to go, Tethys took advantage of that by lifting his left leg high the air while slouching his spine to the side and bending at the hip; this is known as a simple Super Kick or even Sweet Chin Music. The sole of his foot was aimed right for Baen's chin.* - Mon Aug 31 19:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed and a sigh released from him. He knew of this ability all too well and it's time Tethys picked up the pace. Without anything being said, the Jounin brings his right palm over to the back of his left shoulder and applies chakra to a fuuinjutsu seal there. Behind a puff of smoke came the renowned Black Balde, grasped by an iron fist. "Let's pick things up a bit.~"

On that, with full speed guiding him, Tethys launched forward with the dull edge of the blade poised to hack at Baen. Obviously, by the way he was swinging, Tethys wasn't adding full strength to it.* - Mon Aug 31 20:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nodded to his self, watching the chakra swell in one generic area of Baen to allow the density of his bone to increase. Not wanting to hint that he knew of Baen's ability, Tethys winged it the best way he can. As the arm came up to take the blunt force of the Blade, Tethys retaliated with shifting his stance mid stride by gripping the hilt of his blade with both hands.

Upon doing so, with nearly no time to waste, the Jounin twisted in counter clockwise formation and went to strike the opposite side of Baen; where the arm wasn't raised.* - Mon Aug 31 20:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was actually caught off guard by that attack. Of course he met someone before with the ability to manipulate their bones, but not actually 'dance' whilst using it. With Baen charging forward and Tethys refusing to liquefy, he did his best of evading the strikes. Due to him being caught off guard, though, he was slashed across the chest. Normally someone would receive a good gash, but Tethys did train his body to actually 'take' attacks instead of evading them all together. He suffered blood drawing scratches, but no serious gashes.

"F-Fuck.."* - Mon Aug 31 20:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Stop fooling around, Tethys. You're sparring one of those bone manipulators, not some academy student. Sharpen up."

No more games, no more testing, no more "getting the feel of things"; it was time Baen saw a glimpse of what Tethys was truly about. With the spears of bone continuing to slash after him, Tethys makes one giant leap backwards. Upon doing so, while calming his mind for a split second, he exhaled a breath of relief and looked back at Baen. From there a noticeable change in Tethys' demeanor was apparent. For those who fought Tethys, or even saw him fight before, knew that he just activated his primal transformation.

Knowing that Baen would naturally keep up the charge, and not wanting to give Baen enough time to stop and rethink, Tethys dashed forward again. His speed heightened, his reflexes heightened and his strength heightened. The Black Blade was still gripped with his right palm so with Baen, hopefully, still charging forward, Tethys went to whack him with the wide wingspan.* - Mon Aug 31 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a sigh, letting go of his primal instincts and returning to normal. Knowing that the Bone Manipulator could handle himself in battle, Tethys didn't bother to let that be an option. He brings his blade back over the seal on his shoulder and allowed it to vanish behind a puff of smoke. From there, he placed his left palm over the inside of his right fist and applied chakra to the seal that was there also.

With that said, behind an even more massive puff of smoke, was Hogetsu's blade.* - Mon Aug 31 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) reseals the blade and extends his palm for Baen to grasp and use as leverage to get up. "Mhm. Names' Tethys. And you're.. uhh.. Baen.."* - Mon Aug 31 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nonchalantly shrugs.* - Mon Aug 31 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walked over to Ikaro, rummaging through his pockets.* - Mon Aug 31 21:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walked over to Ikaro, rummaging through his pockets.* - Mon Aug 31 21:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) grabs Ikaro by the hair and nonchalantly drags him over to Koeki. "Heal him."* - Mon Aug 31 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) takes out a wad of cash and gave her a hundred grand. "Sevently for what he owes, the rest for healing him."* - Mon Aug 31 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was a married man so he didn't see where she put the money. He did, however, walked off..* - Mon Aug 31 21:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) weaved together his own hand seals, allowing his chakra to form a clone out of the body of water near him. The clone materialized and walks to the side of Tethys, looking at Makasa as well. "I'm waiting."* - Mon Aug 31 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed a single hand seal and kneaded chakra within his stomach. As the fireball neared him, as if only to negate the efforts, Tethys unleashed a wave of water forward to match and overcome the intensity of the fire. Seeing as though the clone did have certain properties from the original Tethys, it kept sensible tabs of the Makasa clone; allowing the position of both enemies to be known and kept tabs of. That being said, with haste  on his mind, the clone formed his own hand seals and spewed out a thick wave of chakra to the ground, wanting to cover the immediate area from the original Tethys to Makasa.* - Mon Aug 31 21:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || It seemed as though foolishness was strong with this clone. It decided to charge toward Tethys after the clone had launched a syrup trap so naturally it would've been caught in its grasp, rendering it incapable. With a smirk, and both their attentions fixated on the airborne Makasa, Tethys the original strung his own hand seals together while the clone strung a different set of hand seals. By time Makasa launched the hand seals forward, the clone launched a wave of water toward the phoenix flowers.

Afterwards, as if in sync, Tethys would spew out a rush of mud to ally itself with the water and increase its power tenfold. The objective was to negate the flames and overpower it to crash into Makasa.* - Mon Aug 31 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Both the original and clone Tethys released sighs as their senses told them the clone was charging chakra and spewing it out in a burst of flames. Not wanting to exactly get hit by it, the original positioned himself so the clone took the fireball head on and dispersed it due to its natural water splash affinity once being destroyed. Meanwhile, Tethys strung another series of hand seals together and allowed yet another clone to spawn from the body of water to the south of them.

As the clone materialized, like the last one, it wasted no time on forming a single hand seal and spitting out a rush of water toward the clone Makasa.* - Mon Aug 31 22:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) ' attention transitioned back over to the original Makasa, having her exactly where he wanted. His clone made sure to keep an eye on Makasa's clone while the original Tethys dug in to his back pouch and took out a red scroll. Upon doing so, he unravels it and applies chakra to the seal that was identified on the page. Afterwards, as if a trap being sprung, several kunai's launched toward Makasa.

Around the hilts of the kunais were perfectly wrapped explosive tags, all designed to take the effect as basic wrapping for better gripping to the kunai. Meanwhile, as they surged toward Makasa and depending on her retaliation, he formed a single hand seal and prepared to set off each tag.
* - Mon Aug 31 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Unless Makasa viewed this as more than spar, things were easy going. Tethys, of course, saw no reason why this should escalate pass that so as Makasa made an attempt to disintegrate the kunais, Tethys allowed it. That being said, with the clone putting out the fireball with yet another burst of water after a forming of an hand seal, Tethys would release the chakra he had in the syrup. "I quit, you win."* - Mon Aug 31 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucks his hands in his pockets and walks northward. "Spar over."* - Mon Aug 31 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a nod, walking off.* - Mon Aug 31 22:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) smirks and walks off.* - Mon Aug 31 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a nod and continues to walk off.* - Mon Aug 31 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [im talkin bout the Hiding in Surface tech] - Mon Aug 31 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) scratches the back of head, walking over to his wife and sat down next to her. He didn't say anything or tried to interrupt her.* - Tue Sep 01 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) sighed, leaning closer to her and nudging her with his elbow.* - Tue Sep 01 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) eyed her up and down, a look of concern was clear but he didn't want to push the situation.* - Tue Sep 01 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Noriko(GraciousCallalily) whispers: If you hear about a bombing in Amegakure... act as if you don't know how did it, even seem interested and inquire about who did it. - Tue Sep 01 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: Haha, alright.. - Tue Sep 01 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Noriko(GraciousCallalily) whispers: I have framed Zetsumo's group. - Tue Sep 01 00:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: Wow.. - Tue Sep 01 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: Alright, cool. - Tue Sep 01 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) yawns.* - Tue Sep 01 17:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) got smacked.* - Tue Sep 01 17:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) wide grin.* - Tue Sep 01 17:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) pushed off the bench, stretching his arm muscles while walking off away from everyone.* - Tue Sep 01 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) rolls his head around a bit, loosening his neck muscles. "Come at me when you're ready."* - Tue Sep 01 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) ' eyes narrowed while his eyebrows rose; was this not the same form of concentrated chakra Koeki used to enhance her strength? No, it was.. different.. it was more tipped at the end than usual. Nevertheless, Tethys would react the same as if it truly was the same technique Koeki used against him; he didn't allow himself to be hit so easily. However, the quick examination of the technique resulted in Koeki catching Tethys off guard so by time the Jounin came to he was left with the option of either taking the hit full force or attempting to evade it and narrowly escaping destruction.

With haste, and determination of not getting smacked across the country, seeing as though he did think Koeki was using the enhanced strength technique, Tethys would open his right palm while side stepping to the right. With his opened palm Tethys made an attempt to use Koeki's momentum against her by slapping her wrist.* - Tue Sep 01 18:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a grunt; Koeki was getting too used to fighting him. He counterattack was pretty much A1 for the most part, leaving Tethys to be in a tight spot once more. Seeing as though the Hogo born was defiant of spam using his liquefying ability, he yolo'd the situation by swiftly meeting the side of Koeki's wrist with his own clenched fist. Instead of just attempting to slap away her wrist, he made an effort to punch it and render it incapable; just enough so it hurt like a bitch to use.* - Tue Sep 01 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The look on Tethys' face told a story of both curiosity and annoyance. Annoyance for the fact that he didn't know what the difference in the concentrated chakra was about and curiosity to let his self to get hit just to see what happens. "So, you're going to explain?"* - Tue Sep 01 18:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) yawns.* - Tue Sep 01 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looked at Orakuru. "Oi, you and I haven't gone at it yet."* - Tue Sep 01 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) wasted no time in thrusting his right arm forward, grabbing Suzaku by the face and lifting him up in the air. "I know she is.. That's why I gave her two kids." With that, Tethys made an attempt to slam Suzaku head first in to the ground.* - Tue Sep 01 20:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's right arm fluxed, the moisture in his body circulating and manifesting in the arm that had Suzaku gripped. With nothing but anger pivoting from Tethys' actions, the Jounin lifted the boy up once more before slamming his head first into the road again. The life of Suzaku? Tethys cared not for it; if anything, Tethys was half heartedly trying to end it prematurely.* - Tue Sep 01 20:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) regripped Suzaku by grasping his collar, flinging his lifeless body away. The attention of Tethys switched back over to Orakuru as if nothing happened, returning to their conversation. "It seems as though you don't understand, Orakuru. Whatever you discuss with her, I'm going to know. Might as well make mends with me now before I do the same thing to you as I did this idiot," he said in a nonchalant voice.* - Tue Sep 01 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took the necessary steps forward to close the distance between him and Orakuru, extending his arm in a nonthreatening manner and holding out his fist. "Nice.~"* - Tue Sep 01 20:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nonchalantly placed his hands in his pants pockets and returned Violet's nod with one of his own. The only difference, however, was Tethys allied the nod with actual speech. "Hello, how're you?"* - Wed Sep 02 02:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) wasn't always a assholes so as Violet spoke and showed the true intensity of her shy nature he was left with no choice but to grant her a smile of friendship. On him, though, it seemed like a struggle between a smirk and a mean mug; it also displayed an actual -attempt- though. Nevertheless Tethys kept up the conversation to the best of his ability.

"That's good. Names' Tethys by the way; what's yours?"* - Wed Sep 02 02:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes widened a bit, the unforeseen label granted to him by Violet was still virgin to his ears. The only other person to call him 'lord' was Mizumi and even then the kid was slowly letting that fade from his vocabulary. With another nod, and a consistent smile, Tethys spoke. "Easy, easy; no need to add the lord part to it, haha. I see you have a blade or two, do specialize in Kenjutsu only?"* - Wed Sep 02 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) actually showed the girl some respect.* - Wed Sep 02 03:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a goofy smile.* - Wed Sep 02 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's attention was momentarily altered from Violet to Rahm. There was no sin in joining the conversation taking place so Tethys greeted Rahm with a nod for an answer before gesturing him to stand next to him so he can effectively participate in the discussion.* - Wed Sep 02 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) wasn't necessarily fazed by the rather uncanny change of Rahm's demeanor, but it did spark some skepticism. Nevertheless, though, Tethys kept a generic smile on his face. "Fine," said Tethys as he pulled up his left sleeve to reveal a bandaged wrist. He placed his right palm on the inner wrist and applied chakra, which acted as a trigger for the seal placed there. From behind a puff of smoke spawned a tanto. "Here." Tethys hands the tanto over to Rahm before rolling down his sleeve and looking back at Violet.

"The Gezo are an interesting bunch of people, really. I've had many missions where I came in to contact with them, but not to the extent where I was able to actually hold a conversation with them pertaining to anything other than business. Also, it's an honor, as a Jounin of Kirigakure, to have someone of your abilities to represent us."* - Wed Sep 02 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's left eyebrow raised as the strange amount of enthusiasm emitted from Rahm. He was a man that loved swords of all shapes and sizes, but this form of excitement was hitting near psychotic. Still, though, he let his thoughts reside in his head.* - Wed Sep 02 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave Violet a more sincere smile, on that told he was actually being genuine. With a nod of his head for acknowledgment toward her grateful reply to his compliment, Tethys spoke. "Remember that rest is just as important as training. There's no point in over exceeding your capabilities. Just like underachievers don't make it anywhere; overachievers are in the same lane. Look within yourself and know your limit, push past that little by little and eventually you'll be looked up at and titled 'lord' right off the bat.~"* - Wed Sep 02 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave Violet a nod; respect for her only grew stronger as she spoke. The generosity she showed while talking only furthered the understanding that Tethys had of Violet so by time she was done speaking he gave her his reply.

"I'm not much a role model, ya'know? I have two kids, a daughter and son, and they look up at me for everything. My son, Atsushi, wants to do everything like me; eat, sleep, breathe and even think like me. Still, though, I know I've lost my way long before I became a father and long before I got married. I had goals and I had ambitions, but nothing is harder than keeping the will to represent those two things and understand, within yourself, that the most important thing is that you defend you beliefs and stay on the path you have before you.

I want you to promise me each of those goals will be met and accomplished, no matter what."* - Wed Sep 02 04:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) folds his arms across his chest; a common stance for him other than having his hands tucked in his pockets. The look on his face told a story of both honest and sincere imagery for Violet. He, by far, wasn't the type to take people in to his main circle but the young girl managed to get into Tethys' eye sight and set a good image.

"You are right, Lady Violet. Dreams do evolve into bigger and better reveries. At this point I went from wanting to be the strongest so I can hack away at anyone who disrespects me, to wanting to be the strongest so my village and family are safe. You could say I've done an helluva job thus far, and I'm willing to continue this dream until I take my last breath."* - Wed Sep 02 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) unfolds his arms and stretches them out a bit, offering a hug.

"Consider yourself part of my family.. my personal family."* - Wed Sep 02 04:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's arms wraps around Violet's upper body, squeezing her gently but tightly. He did his best to give off the feeling of security and reassurance, wanting Violet to understand that despite his title and past he was a genuine guy towards loved ones. After a few seconds, however, he released Violet and gave her a smile. "I'm here for you; remember that."* - Wed Sep 02 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) snaps his fingers, spawning two ANBU Agents from behind puffs of white smoke. "I'm heading out and taking a thousand of our troops to Sunagakure. You two stay here and wait for Hassan to show up, when he does let him know where I'm going and that it's to complete the second mission granted to us. Close off the bridge after the troops and I leave. Notify Koeki that she's in charge while I'm away. If she doesn't show up send a messenger bird."

With that being said, as if having no time to waste, Tethys headed toward the exit of the village. With each step he could, like a true leader, he was followed by more and more of Kirigakure's army. By time he made it to the bridge he takes a look back at the troops. "Today, my friends, we dine in hell. Today, my family, we battle with gods! We fight with pride and honor, no shame in bloodshed for the enemy! You walk with me and I'll lead us to victory!" No more words were said, Tethys continues his pace toward Sunagakure.* - Wed Sep 02 21:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , and the troops of one-thousand, began their travels with anxious hearts and fixated minds. The era of peace was good and all, but, knowing the Hidden Mist, war was just in their range of a 'fun time'. With Tethys at the head of the massive army, he assure that the safety and wellbeing of the troops were assure; keeping a close eye on anyone that was slowing down or even looked tired. Plenty of food and water was granted to the troops of a thousand, sickness was not an option this early in the mission.

Nevertheless though, Tethys kept himself in shape also. He hydrated frequently, ate food when it was necessary and insured his self with a fool-proof life policy. In the back of his mind, however, Tethys wished that Hassan was here to aid him in this mission. It wasn't time for him to back out so he continued on with his troops.* - Wed Sep 02 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) managed to lead his troops to the outskirts of the land of waves, through the land of fire and now to the outskirts of the land of wind. One could say that the morals of Tethys were good, but was he rushing things? Were his troops not prepared for something like this? The men of a thousand walked behind Tethys' lead with pride, putting their entire faith and trust in him. That.. that look of respect they had on their faces, made Tethys determined to see to it that at all costs this mission was successful.

Entering the outskirts of the land of wind was relatively easily, but troops that were able to sense kept a close eye on any traps that could be lying around to prevent any rare attacks on Zetsumo and his troops. Unless stopped by such a thing, the Black Blade continued on.* - Wed Sep 02 21:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || This is usually where any man, that stood in the massive group of shinobi, could raise their hands to signal that they don't have the stomach to go through with this mission. This is where a man can either live to see another assured day, or progress further whilst knowing that there might not be a welcome home sign greeting them. Still, though, Tethys looked at each shinobi the same. He didn't judge them if they wanted to back out nor did he feel malice toward them.

He was asking a lot from his Shinobi and they followed him this distance thus far and he held high respect for them. The look Tethys gave them was easily readable, yet not one shinobi raised their hand to submit to the pressure that was on them. The only thing Tethys could do was grant them a nod and progress further.* - Wed Sep 02 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The plan at hand was to catch the forces of Zetsumo off guard so of course Tethys didn't allow his troops to make their stand right behind them. Instead, Tethys led his troops from the side, giving them the ability to have a better effect on things due to strategy depicting that the frontal and rare of any massive troop attack to be covered. Tethys smirks to himself as he led his troops of a thousand to the left wing of Zetsumo's troop.* - Wed Sep 02 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) takes his troops and goes home.* - Wed Sep 02 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) omit.* - Wed Sep 02 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || There was something about fate that turned Tethys on. He didn't know what it was exactly, but it gave him the sensational arousal where once she made herself felt and known amongst the masses it was an impact nonetheless. A smirk sat on Tethys' face, a smirk that told a story of both thrill of battle and slight anxiousness of war; there was clearly a difference. At this moment, however, seeing as though Tethys was standing off with his troops and spectating until he found a proper, and necessary, time to attack.

From his understanding, if he's not mistaken, Zetsumo and an ally of his pivoted after Chiyari. Meanwhile, at that sight, Tethys reached over his shoulder and gripped the hilt of his infamous black blade. Upon doing so, with no time to waste and an attempt to catch Zetsumo off guard while he ranted on about the male needing to stop running and fighting, Tethys blasted off at full speed. Before that, though, his being transitioned into a more primal instinctive one; resulting in a majority of his physical attributes to heighten.

By time, if he was lucky enough, Tethys reached Zetsumo he's unsheathe his blade and swing it forward in four sequential strikes. The first aiming to hack off Zetsumo's head all together, the second to tear through any limb possible and the final to possibly whack the hell out of the chick located on Zetsumo's shoulder.

Side Note: I am aware of the chick.* - Thu Sep 03 00:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Im actually about to pull out in a bit - Thu Sep 03 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) didn't expect that his surprise attack would inevitably be a game ender for Zetsumo. When the threads came slashing forward Tethys had no choice but to go as far as repeating the actions he did all those years ago when him and Zetsumo first engaged in battle; cut through them.

With haste Tethys would allow himself to alter the grip of his black blade, swinging it's extremely sharp edge forward to take out the threads. However, during that process, Tethys was knocked back by the impact from the mud; distance was unfortunately created between him and Zetsumo. A grunt of annoyance came over Tethys as he made it back to his feet and surveyed the situation at hand.

"Damn it, Zetsumo. Why can't you just die like a good boy? Have to put on a front like even you are scared of death. Just put your neck against my blade and let fate do the rest."

Nothing more was said from this point forward. The only thing Tethys could do was sheathe his sword and string a consecutive alignment of hand seals together, knead chakra within his stomach and wait.* - Thu Sep 03 01:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The troops of Kirigakure looked on in a non-impressed manner. Tethys, however, simply kept his arms folded across his chest and an emotionless look on his face. The transformation of Tetsumi was something that he's never seen before in terms of 'that' beast, but a beast nonetheless. A sigh escaped Tethys though, showing he was slightly annoyed. He walks closer to the body of Kronos, keeping his distance just in case, and just spectated.* - Thu Sep 03 02:24:00 2015

With a sigh, though, anyone around knew that Tethys had a lot on his mind; he did recently come back from a premature war after all. His eyes were now fixed on Rahm's frame, sizing him up and listening to his words. "Yeah, I left on a short notice; sorry. As for training, I'm more of a large sword wielder rather than small sword," he spoke while using an inverted nod to gesture to his Black Blade toward the end of his statement. "Nevertheless, though, I can show you a few things and later transition you have to someone else capable wielding a small, single handed, sword."* - Thu Sep 03 03:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Day 1:

Tethys had just been granted a mission scroll and read its content; he couldn't lie, this mission should be considered a C-Rank instead of D-Rank. Oh well, he wasn't going to give Noriko back the scroll, nor was he going to leave an academy student hanging in the time of need --- Tethys knew how the student felt. Without another thought, Tethys made his way over to the school and leaned against the outside wall leading into the playground for the students. As he stood there and watched the students play he couldn't help but notice that there was one student who just wandered around kicking a toy kunai while the others were grouped up and having gun.

The child was obviously the kid Tethys was sent to train; just by the looks of the student Tethys could tell that it wasn't his abilities that was holding him back, but the lack of assurance in himself. Tethys wanted to see what the student would do for the remainder of the recess so he stayed back a bit and just watched. After a few minutes, however, the student was starting to be picked on by the more advanced kids in the class. They went as far as grabbing the student by the shirt front and lifting him off the air just to intimidate him. The student went to kick the bully that lifted him up in the head, but it was apparent the taijutsu of the bully was better than the students. Before things got too far, Tethys would push off of the wall and walk over behind the bully.

"Why not pick on someone that could actually fight back," asked Tethys as he placed a firm hand on the bullies shoulder and squeeze a bit. "I, uh, you are.. that hur-," stammered the bully as the grip of Tethys got tighter and tighter. "How about you put him down and leave him alone? Yeah, that sounds like a great idea," said Tethys as he waited for the bully to put the student down to release the grip; thankfully, for the bully, that was near immediately after Tethys suggested the idea. The grip was indeed loosened and let go of as the bully and his gang ran off, leaving Tethys and the student alone to talk.

"So, I'm going to cut to the chase. My name is Tethys and I was sent by the Mizukage to train you. I understand that you're not recognized as.. the best.. student in the academy," spoke Tethys as he helped the student off the ground; the drop from where the bully raised him and the group was pretty high. "This.. is none of your business.. I don't know why that old man sent you," said the student as he finished dusting himself off.

"You don't have to do that. I know the feeling, kid. I was in your shoes while I was in the academy; only difference is: you actually have someone that wants to help you instead of being forced to," continued Tethys as he gave a genuine smile of understanding and friendliness. "T..Thanks. My name is Argon, by the way," mumbled Argon. It was clear that he struggled to acknowledge an helping hand; that was something Tethys was going to break out of him. "Alright, now that he got acquainted I suppose our training should start as soon as possible. However, as soon as possible isn't until tomorrow. You are an Academy Student and I am aware of the curfew every Student have in the village. I already put in a pass to your instructor for you to take tomorrow off and train with me so I want you to meet me here the same time school starts. Do not be late." With that said, and no chance to give Argon time to reply, Tethys would turn his back to the Argon and walk away.






Day 2:

 It was the day after Tethys and Argon met and it seemed that already Tethys felt a bond with the kid. There was something about Argon that made Tethys determined to advance in his own abilities and pass them on to Argon on a mentor and protg basis; nevertheless, that was exactly what Tethys's going to do. Tethys was relatively early the morning of their second meeting; the academy opening at seven in the morning and Tethys being there at six-thirty. Just before the bell rang for each student to be in their respective class, Argon managed to show up with his shirt slightly ripped and his head held down. At first sight Tethys knew something was wrong so he simply sighed and held back his anger. Argon didn't need to explain anything so Tethys simply kneeled down on one knee and fixed up Argons clothing; one thing that made Tethys even more mad was the fact that Argon was harboring a black eye, that was enough to make sure that Argon was properly trained and surpass the other students.

Tethys and Argon walked over to the playground and it was clear that some of the regular obstacles were cleared out and it was a rather large circle in their place. "How comfortable are you with taijutsu," asked Tethys as he stepped into the circle and faced Argon. "I find it easier than ninjutsu and genjutsu," replied Argon. "Hmm, are you implying that you cannot perform ninjutsu or genjutsu; or are you just fonder of taijutsu," question Tethys with interest plastered on his face. "I mean.. you can say that I'm more fond of taijutsu, but I am able to perform the basic ninjutsu and taijutsu," stated Argon. "Alright then, we'll start with your taijutsu seeing as though you take after that more than the other two. I want you to step into the circle and give me your best shot," said Argon as he readied himself for Argons attacks.

It was as if Argon was a natural born taijutsu user. From the second he stepped into the circle and was given the okay to attack, the academy student wasted no time in giving Tethys his all. To start off the spar, Argon charged forward with a straight kick to the chest; but when Tethys went to block the kick with his left arm, Argon managed to switch the momentum up and take Tethys by the right shoulder and use his right leg to kick Tethys in the waist. Tethys was sent back a bit from slight pain and shock. A smirk came over Tethys as he decided up the antes.

Without anything being said Tethys charged toward Argon and sends a straight jag to his nose. From sheer instincts Tethys would attempt to side step the punch, but it wasn't until Tethys met the side step with a left hook that connected to Argons jaw. The student was sent staggering back a bit, but came back immediately with retaliation. Argon sent a knee high straight kick to throw Argon off and allowed himself to flip back and charge forward again to send two quick jabs toward Tethys's jaw and follow that up with a upper cut. Tethys managed to block the jabs, but by time he opened himself to counter the upper cut, he was already caught with it. Tethys's smirk became more apparent at this point. "You're a natural born," said Tethys as he continued to spar.

The two of them went at for five hours straight; stopping to only catch their breath and for Argon to receive advice on what to hone in on when it comes to launching attacks. One thing about Argon that Tethys had to admire was the fact that once there was motivation and someone there to actually inspire Argon, the student was indeed a fast learner. In the end, however, Tethys was victor of the spar and it was about time for the academy to let out the rest of the students. Not wanting the bullies to catch Argon in a tired state, Tethys would personally escort him to his house.


Day 3:

When it came to the last day of his mission, Tethys was a bit uneasy. Seeing as though taijutsu was the main focus of the training lesson, there was still two other fighting styles that Argon was too at least master the basics off; Tethys couldn't allow him to be held back because of those two things. When Tethys and Argon met up again, it wasn't by the school but on the other side of the village where it was just destroyed housing and vacant shacks. "Alright, all I want you to do is practice your Bunshin, Kawarimi and Henge no Jutsu," said Tethys as he folded his arms across his chest and looked over at Argon.

Argon didn't bother to object to the task --- he knew it'd be coming up soon; that's why he spent all night getting some practice before hand. Without hesitation, and a rather considerable amount of mastery of the hand seals of henge, Argon would focus his chakra allow it to mask the outer layer of his skin. With that being said, Argon managed to make a splitting image of his academy instructor. "Haha, pretty impressive," chuckled Tethys as he clapped his hands a few times.

Not wanting to waste time and seem to slack off, Argon returned back to normal and began to focus his chakra once more. He weaved together a series of hand seals and used that gathered up chakra to expand toward one of the rock blocks from the destroyed house. Argon would taunt Tethys a bit, causing the Genin to send a perfect jab to Argons face; but in the students place was that same rock block and the student was where the block had once been.

Tethys nodded his head in approval as he refolded his arms across his chest and looked on. The last remaining jutsu for Argon to perform was one that even Tethys had problems with back in the academy --- so to see whether or not Argon could handle the perfect chakra placement would be rather interesting. The student took in a slow, deep, breath and closed his eyes. Without saying a word, and apparent concentration on his face, Argon would gather his chakra and allow it to slowly seep to the right of him. As if a slight combustion, a puff of smoke would spawn the identical replica of Argon.

"So you've managed to hone into your favorite fighting style and you are able to successfully perform the basic genjutsu and ninjutsu of the academy. Not only have you caught up to the others, but you also surpassed them in ways you don't know. Today is only the third day and you've matured greatly. I see something in you, Argon.. it's just up to you to look within yourself and see that you're more than just a regular shinobi.. With that being said, the rest is up to you.." On that note, Tethys would give Argon a pat on the shoulder and ruffle his hair a bit before turning and walking away.* - Thu Sep 03 07:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys had just received a new mission from Noriko and it was one that he could greatly appreciate. Seeing as though Tethys had just found a determined training partner, by the name of Argon, which was in the academy, it was rather easy for him to complete this mission. When the academy bell rang to signal the end of the school day, Tethys was there to meet Argon with some food and drinks. The two strolled along to the main training grounds of Kirigakure and talked about the mission Tethys was given; Argon had no problem with helping Tethys.

Once the two had finished their food and digested it a bit, they rose to their feet, from the seated position they were in, and created distance between one another. At the point where they were about four yards away, Argon wasted no time in commencing the spar. The flamboyant academy student picked up on some skills since the last time him and Tethys sparred, so when Argon unsheathed a kunai and launched it forward to distract Tethys, it almost worked. The kunai was the distraction, yes, but what caught Tethys off guard was the fact that behind the kunai was a foot heading straight for his head.

Due to the fact that Tethys was indeed more skilled in Argon, it wasn't too hard for him to counter the attack; in the end it was still rather impressive did do some damage to Tethys. The genin managed to block the kick and follow it up with grabbing Argon by the shirt and launching him away. Argon retaliated with charging back with a pump fake jab but it was only to come with a upper cut using the hand --- this kid had smarts in taijutsu. Tethys attempted to evade the jab by ducking just to be caught smack dab in the forehead with the upper cut. The genin was sent flying back, but before he could fall bum first on the ground he'd perform a backflip and land on his feet.

Not wanting to be entirely showed up by the academy student, Tethys would respond to the upper cut with his own combination of attacks. Too start off, Tethys would send a high heel kick to the head of Argon, which was evaded, and used that momentum to lower his body a bit to leg sweep Argon. Argon wasn't exactly expecting the leg sweep so once it connected Tethys took advantage.  At that moment, Tethys would raise himself up again and grab Argon by the shirt again just to deliver a punch right to chin.

Argon was sent staggering back, but once he regained his composure he went right back into the paint and went toe to toe with Tethys. Argon and Tethys went at it for what seemed to be all day, but in reality it was only five hours; both suffering from battle scars and both becoming rather exhausted. "Y-You know, Argon.. I have to give you your props.. You've gotten a lot better since our last spar," acknowledge Tethys as they slowed the pace of the spar. "Hmph.. I've been training my ass off for this spar," responded Argon as he sent a fist for Tethys's stomach.

Without attempted to respond to what Argon said Tethys would take hold of Argon's flying fist at the last second and tug him in a bit. As Tethys did so, he'd send a powerful knee to Argon's stomach. The academy student would fold over and drop to his knee whilst sayin, "D-Damn." The pupils of Argon would fade in and out before finally vanishing, resulting him being knocked unconscious. Not being too worried, Tethys would pick Argon up and carry the student to his house. When Argon's mom saw the near lifeless body of her son Tethys assured her that nothing was wrong with him and that when he woke up tell him that he did a good job.* - Thu Sep 03 07:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) The sheer fact that traveling alone to a foreign land was considered a D-Rank mission baffled the mind of Tethys, but never the less it was something that had to be done. Tethys made his way over to the supply shop and spent his recently earned money on three large pouches. Along with that, he'd buy a few pieces of cloth and a new pair of shoes. When it was time for Tethys to head out he made sure to notify the guards that if he wasn't back in a few hours to send help.

By time Tethys made it to the boarder of the Land of Wind there was already complications. It seemed as though bandits were habiting the boarder and mugging people who tried to pass them. If it wasn't for the sweet talking abilities of Tethys it would be unclear if he'd manage to even leave the land of wind safely and with his stuff intact. Nevertheless, Tethys managed to do it.

Once Tethys made it to the forest in the Land of Fire, it wasn't hard for him to gather to pieces of wood. By using the three large pouches to hold the planks of wood, Tethys managed to gather a good three dozen. It was the trail back to the village that really made it a pain in the ass for Tethys. He don't know how he managed to evade the second group of bandits on the way to his destination, but on the way back he was caught and basically robbed.

Tethys attempted to fend off the bandits to the best of his ability, but the numbers game quickly caught up to him. They took his money, his weapons, and his brand new pair of shoes and just left him with two of three pouches of wood. Tethys didn't even bother to complain or didn't plan to notify Noriko on what happened; he just picked up the two remaining pouches and walked.

When Tethys made it to the village with the pouches he was met with a bunch of question; none of which he answered. All the Jounin did was head over to the supply store, dropped off the planks of wood and went home to freshen up. Once done, he left his house and went to the manor for another mission.* - Thu Sep 03 07:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) A sigh came from Tethys as he took grasp of the mission scroll and opened it to read it. "Better than nothing," said the Genin as he walked out of the manor and casually headed over to the ninja supply store; he wasn't in much of a rush despite him wanting to do a set amount of missions in certain time frames. Once Tethys made it to the supply store, he'd request for a rental shovel and paid for it with disdain; he was running low on money despite the amount of missions he got done.

On his way to the hole that he had to fill Tethys took it upon himself to talk to a few construction workers on why the large holes were there in the first place. Turns out the holes were created illegally and they had to leave it alone; so instead of filling it themselves they waited for someone else to do it. Good job, workers. When Tethys found the hole he was to fill a loud grunt came from him. Not only was the hole massive, but there was no pile of dirt for him to just scoop and place in the hole. He had to literally find a way to get excess dirt and fill it.

With slight annoyance plastered on his face, the genin would begin to dig a second hole while caving in the massive hole; he did this so as he made the second hole it would level out the ground. Tethys did this for about three hours before making a second hole that was more or less half the size of the first hole. It felt like it took longer than it actually did so Tethys resorted to stringing together a series of hand seals and created a doton clone of himself. He'd use the clone to go back to the supply store, rent another shovel and come back.

When the clone came back, Tethys had managed to fill in half the first hole whilst adding a two hump effect to the ground. He didn't know what else to do seeing as though if he was to fill the hole completely, there would be another hole the same size of the same hole. The best thing in this case would be to make a playground like effect to the two holes and leave it at that.* - Thu Sep 03 07:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) "A mission to show a visitor around the village.. That's good enough I suppose," said Tethys to himself as he steadily strolled toward the village main entrance and exit. Once there, however, Tethys was caught by surprise at the amount of people that showed up. As if tourists going to the beach in a foreign country, these group of people had luggage packed and the regular sunglasses that every tourist seemed to enjoy wearing. "This is.. crazy," thought Tethys as he made an attempt to organize everyone to start the tour.

After about an hour of everyone introducing themselves and finally deciding to listen to what Tethys had to say, they managed to take the first steps into the tour. The first place they went to was the neighborhoods of Kirigakure. "This is the main neighborhood of the village. Many of these houses were victims of the most recent terrorist attacks; nevertheless they managed to stand tall and strong to shelter as much people as possible," explained Tethys.

The tour didn't stop there; there was plenty more for the tourists to see. Tethys managed to take everyone to the main shopping area, or whatever was left of it, and the academy building. "And this is where we provide educational instructions to the newer generation," said Tethys as he pointed to the building. After taking a few pictures and asking a few questions the tourists decided to push things a bit faster.

Tethys didn't complain about that so he skipped the rest of the village and went straight for the hotspot; the Mizukage's manor. "And this is the mansion owned by the Mizukage. He is currently in, but rather busy to actually see anyone." With that being said, Tethys would rush everyone to the village gates and wave them farewell.* - Thu Sep 03 07:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys was just notified on the robbery that took place in the southern distract; so as his second mission of the day, he was instructed to apprehend the criminals and retrieve the stolen goods. One thing that helped Tethys in this situation is the fact that the criminals didn't know how to utilize their chakra. With that in mind, Tethys would stock up on a few kunais and make his way to the scene.

Once there, Tethys gathered some information from the owner of the store that got robbed and attempted to make a mental picture of how the thieves looked. Once he felt as though he got a good enough idea, the genin headed out to patrol the area. Tethys started off with going to well-known spots where thugs hanged out. After asking a few questions Tethys came to the realization that all thugs stuck to one code: no snitching.

Despite the lack of leads, other than the description of the robbers, Tethys was determined to catch the thieves. His best bet was to find them and their hide out so he could at least get his hands on the goods they stole. After camping out on the highest building in the ghetto, that gave him the ability to see every corner of the neighborhood, Tethys caught sight of someone that matched the description of one of the robbers. With haste, the goal stricken shinobi would trail the suspect and follow him to an abandoned house deep in the hood.

After waiting a few minutes before approaching the building, Tethys would stealthily look in the nearest window and watch as a group of people examine some items they poured out of a black bag. From the window Tethys was also able to hear their conversation. "Man, we hit the jackpot on this shit! We can wait a few days and sell this to the next sucker who doesn't ask questions if it's hot or not! Hell, if anything we'll leave the village and sell it to foreigners!"

After hearing that, Tethys would crash through the window whilst unsheathing three kunai's and launching them toward three of the five thieves. Each kunai hit managed to hit someone but not kill them; luck was their side. As for the remaining two thieves, they unsheathed two knives and charge toward Tethys. Not wanting to get hurt, Tethys would evade their attacks to the best of his abilities; he was also running of room to do that. With survival on his mind, Tethys would unsheathe a kunai and deflect the slashes sent his way.

The niceness in Tethys faded rather quickly so just when things started to get even more dangerous Tethys pulled out all the stops and ended up knocking the remaining two thieves out. After tying the thieves up, Tethys would call for back up and for the shop owner to come retrieve his stolen items.* - Thu Sep 03 07:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) Tethys recently accepted a mission to escort a scientist to the middle of the desert in search of some herbs. The jurisdiction of the desert, that the herb was located, was known for harboring bandits and rogue ninja; it was a good thing this missions was deemed C-Rank. When the scientist and Tethys first met up, they knew for a fact that this travel was going to feel long; they didn't get along for some reason. Tethys felt as though they should hurry up and get to the herb, but the scientist wanted to take his time and examine all herbs he find on the way to the spot.

"We don't have time to waste, damn it. Any second a bandit or rogue could catch us and attempt to mug us," said Tethys in an attempt to explain his reasoning for wanting to hasten their pace. The scientist decided to take it upon himself to step Tethys's face and say, "Just like you said; attempt. It's your job to protect me and that's exactly what you're going to do --- like it or not." Tethys was ready to quit his mission after hearing that, but his pride and wishes to not have any canceled missions urged him on to tolerate the ignorance of the scientist.

When the scientist and Tethys managed to make it half way to the spot where the herbs were, the same thing Tethys was trying to prevent happened. They were stopped by a group of bandits; they traveled in a pack of five. An audible sigh came from Tethys as he stepped in front of the scientist and said nothing at all to the bandits. The second Tethys positioned himself, the bandits charged forward with swords unsheathed and blades ready to cut Tethys's life away from him.

The scientist, being a non shinobi, curled up on the ground and protected his head while Tethys engaged in battle with the bandits. The genin managed to take out two of the five bandits, but it seemed as though for every bandit he took out the next was way harder to beat. By time Tethys was to finish off the third bandit, the remaining two decided to raise the stakes of the battle and pull out jutsu's. Not wanting to waste off too much stamina and chakra, Tethys would weave together a sequence of hand seals and spitting out a rock made clone.

Tethys and the clone would each take on a bandit; dodging and blocking attacks to the best of their ability. It wasn't until the clone got dispersed and replaced with a bundle of rocks when Tethys knew that this may be the end of him.

"Leave, scientist! Forget about me! I will hold them off to the best of my abilities! RUN BACK TO THE VILLAGE," instructed Tethys as the two bandits closed in the distance between them and the genin. Once close enough, they sent two slashes each toward Tethys's chest; two of the four managing to cut and gash Tethys's chest. At the sight of the blood, the scientist froze but quickly came to his senses when he saw Tethys fall on his back and struggle to sit up. At that point and time the scientist would take out two pills from his pouch and instruct Tethys to hold his breath. The second Tethys did, the scientist would crush the two pills and throw them toward the bandits; causing a puff a poisonous smoke to emit in the area.

The scientist helped Tethys up and aided him out of the zone of the poison smoke; apparently the scientist was immune to the poison. As for the bandits, within seconds they were knocked out and eventually deceased. Not wanting to get caught in the path of anymore bandits, the scientist just kept moving non stop while struggling to stop the bleeding from Tethys's chest. Eventually, however, he did and before he knew it they found the herb they came looking for.

The travels back home were rather quiet, but the scientist knew that the way he treated Tethys at the start was wrong and cruel; but still Tethys risked his life for the sake of the scientist. A new found respect of shinobis and especially Tethys was established; so when they made it back to the village safely the scientist paid for all medical bills and personally gave Tethys a few of his poison pills and the antidote for it.* - Thu Sep 03 07:34:36 2015

Still, though, the depressed aura emitting from him could be felt. A minute went by since he stepped out of the building and he heard the bits and pieces of commentary that the shinobi before him presented. Not wanting the village to go into some deep emotional chaos, he lifted his head and took the hat off.

Tears were running down his cheek but a rather forced uplifting smile was plastered on his face. "E-Everythings.. fine, guys. She just has the cold and don't want anyone to worry so she placed me as the temporary Kage."* - Fri Sep 04 16:06:11 2015

"Come on now, everyone; everything's fine, haha. Cheer up." As Tethys said that he wrapped his arms around Violet and Setsuna, comforting them both.* - Fri Sep 04 16:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) coughs to get everyones attention. "Ahem.."* - Fri Sep 04 16:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed a single hand seal, momentarily masking himself with a puff of white smoke. Once the screen subsided his robe was gone and replaced with his regular attire, even he had to admit that he didn't like the feeling of wearing the clothing. His eyes wandered from person to person before him as he spoke. "Ikaro and I are going on a mission. Whilst my absence Himura is in charge; I'm also appointed three Agents to guard the Mizukage's Mansion until I'm back. I have alerted the guards on my departure and they will act accordingly."* - Fri Sep 04 17:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walks up, hands tucked in his pockets and eyes fixated on Dravae. "Yo'."* - Fri Sep 04 17:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) uses his head to gesture they walk off to somewhere private. "Let me talk to you real quick."* - Fri Sep 04 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) casually kept his hands tucked in his pockets, a nonchalant feeling was emitting from him. No sign of emotion was displayed, nor was there anything other than a mellow tone guiding his words. "Explain something to me, Dravae.. The last time we met and held a conversation was a few years ago during Kirigakure's first festival.. Explain to me why you think it's okay, after all these years and after I brought a thousand of Kirigakure's forces here to help protect your village, to come to my village and be an ally to someone that threatened it."* - Fri Sep 04 17:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The mention of Smith's death sparked something in Tethys' stomach, but he kept it under control. He wasn't close to Dravae, not in the least bit, so the question of why he wasn't informed on Smiths' death only angered the hell out of Tethys. Dravae was no Noel in Tethys' mind so there should be no damn reason a person outside of Kirigakure should wonder about Smiths' passing.

"I have the right mind to kill you, Dravae," he said with a stern tone.  "But I won't do that. I just need to know who 'Bub' is."* - Fri Sep 04 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a sigh. "You and I have no beef, Dravae. When you're in a position like I am and you hear someone you thought was cool tagged along with someone who threatened your village you'd have the same mind set as me. As far as 'Bub', I'll check up on Sunagakure every now and then randomly. I don't want 'Bub' to be tipped off. As for 'Maya', I don't know who that is but I'll keep an open ear for that name again."* - Fri Sep 04 17:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nodded his head, listening to Dravae intently. A sigh overcame Tethys as he shrugged and spoke. "Yeah, I'll see what I can do about the Head Medic of Kirigakure. But for now," he cuts himself off and quickly clenched his right fist. Within a mere second the fist came flying from his pocket and aimed to rattle the jaw of Dravae. "Don't mention Smith around me, guy. You're not Noel, you're not Hogetsu, you're not Kakei.." With that, Tethys went to walk off; he expected Ikaro to follow.* - Fri Sep 04 18:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) would've normally pressed the issue that Dravae should have a broken jaw, but OOC feelings about Dravae being my nigga is preventing me from doing that. A sigh escaped Tethys once more as he continued to walk off.* - Fri Sep 04 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a shrug, completely ignoring Yan. "I'll let you know once we get a caravan."* - Fri Sep 04 18:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) continued to walk off, taking a wad of cash out of his pocket.* - Fri Sep 04 18:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) pays for a caravan to Kumogakure.* - Fri Sep 04 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) pulls up in a caravan, hops out and tucks his hands in his pockets. "Yo'."* - Fri Sep 04 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) noticed that he was ignored by Niklaus but didn't acknowledge it. He looks over at Amai and gave her a nod. "How things been here?"* - Fri Sep 04 18:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) pays for another caravan and zipzip zoom they gone.* - Fri Sep 04 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) casually walks up, hands tucked in his pockets.* - Fri Sep 04 19:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took his right hand out of his pocket and snapped his fingers, magically spawning a mission scroll and handing it over to Ikaro. He repeats the process for Kubo.* - Fri Sep 04 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed a single hand seal, spawning the Mizukage robe around him.* - Fri Sep 04 19:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked his hands in to his pockets and walks southward.* - Fri Sep 04 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) ' adventure out of the village was pretty much easy going. Aside from the occasional stops due to Academy Students wanting to ask him questions pertaining to possible future training or if he could show them how he was able to turn to water at will. Of course, seeing as though he was now a keener village man, he met stopped each and every time to suffice their needs and questions. Still, though, he assured them that he will be back from his mission and that he has no time to waste.

By time his stroll met the bridge connecting Kirigakure to the rest of the world, Tethys spoke with a few shinobi. He made sure to give them specific instructions on what to do when they come upon an outsider. "I expect security to be tight, ya'hear? I don't want any form of casualties while I'm gone or you all will suffer dire consequences." Of course, out of respect and slight fear of Tethys, the guards assured him that everything will run smooth. At that point, Tethys gave them a nod and continued on the path he set for himself.* - Fri Sep 04 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walks a bit southward, keeping his palms tucked in his pockets.* - Sat Sep 05 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave no visual sign of emotion, just a blank expression with fixated eyes on Violet. As the female grew closer, Tethys took it upon his self to aid her; when it comes to closing the distance that is. With that being side, now that the two of them were both dashing full speed toward one another, Tethys made it his mission to evade the initial strike sent his way by virtually side stepping it. As retaliation, however, he gave her a slight nudge in the forehead by his, now untucked, right hand.

"Rather than focusing on a straight forward attack, set me up for a combo. It's easier to fool people and force them to make a mistake than you charging right in and making a mistake yourself."* - Sat Sep 05 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed slightly, watching the reprisal of Violet. First Tethys thought of being lazy and liquefying to evade that attack, but he changed his mind. By time the sword came in to hit him, Tethys swiftly brings his right palm to his midsection and swats Violet's wrist. As a result, he aim would be thrown off and it'd give him the opportunity to side step around Violet once more. [Short RP. Got distracted irl.]* - Sat Sep 05 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a nod of approval. It was easy for him to dodge the two attacks, but the fact that she managed to set him up by combining her body movement and overall skill with her blades only proved to Tethys that she was getting a hang of the advice he provided her. With haste, however, he unsheathes his tanto from behind his back; of course using his now untucked left hand. As the two blade came forth, Tethys altered his grip on the tanto so the blade clashed with the two swords. Upon doing so, with haste, he was stick his right foot out and aim to shove Violet back a few feet.

"Rotational movements are unique, but you leave yourself open too. You're wielding two blades. Rather than focusing on a set point on my body, target multiple areas."* - Sat Sep 05 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) had numerous spots of evasion to pick from, but he purposely chose the most difficult one; not to only test his self, but to test Violet more as well. To start off, Violet's strike to his neck was smart; especially since it was followed by a strike to his midsection. This gave Tethys little room to effectively evade the two blades on any normal means, but fighting Tethys was never 'normal means'.

With thirst blade soaring forward, Tethys clashed it's upper most edge with his own tanto; the goal was to merely redirect it. Tethys knew, by the way he clashed the two blades, that he wasn't completely out of the hole yet. The follow up strike from Violet had to be taken care of, and since his blade was preoccupied, Tethys was left with no choice but to momentarily liquefy his midsection.

"Wonderful, wonderful; don't stop the combinations there."* - Sat Sep 05 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) came to the decision that Violet earned her way to a more advanced fight against him. Rather than fighting against a minuscule level of Tethys' capabilities, she was now going to face a slightly more difficult one. As her two blades came forth, contrasting each other in directory, Violet would notice that the look on Tethys' half covered face told he was indeed getting a bit more serious; but not enough where he could be considered actually trying.

With swiftness of his tanto, he'd sheathe the blade and take a precautious step back. As he did so, with little time to waste, Tethys brings his left palm over to his right wrist and applied chakra to the seal located there. Behind a quick mask of smoke came his infamous Black Blade. By time the smoke cleared Tethys is seen gripped the massive sword so the 'tip' of the blade was touching the ground and the large wingspan of was the 'armor' he used against the thrust of a kick and the daggering blades.* - Sat Sep 05 02:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes widened a bit. The concentration of chakra that engulfed the two blades only sent chills up and down Tethys' spine. A smirk formed on the Jounins face as he tightened the grip he on his Black Blade. With magnificent ease, as if wielding a tanto, Tethys maneuvered the massive blade around to clash with the jabs of the Violets' blades. Occasionally, to assure that he wasn't struck by the blades, he'd take advantage of the massive width of the blade by negating both swords at the same time.* - Sat Sep 05 03:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The spar between Violet and Tethys was getting intense. Tethys, having to hold back so it was more of an evenly matched, couldn't help but to commend Violet for last this long to begin with; all because he was holding back doesn't mean he wasn't trying at all. The two continued to clash for a few minutes, the sound of metal on metal clinking throughout the main square.

At the first sight of Violet's fatigue Tethys took full advantage. The second she went to start another combination attack Tethys manipulated his Black Blade to act as a guard rather than a regular blade; resulting in the combination being broken by time the slash to his neck was supposed to happen. To follow that up, Tethys would shift his footing around so he side stepped Violets' body completely; the hilt of his blade still grasped.

Upon doing so, with no time to waste, Tethys brings the dull edge of his blade to her neck and held it there. "That was great, but game over."* - Sat Sep 05 04:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) brought his blade over his shoulder, placing it within the seal located there. As Violet walked over to the bench he took the initiative to aide her by gently gripped her arms and relieving what pointless strain on her tired body.

"Easy now, easy now; don't want you passing out." He places her on the bench before moving to the side of her and sitting down. "You were really great, Violet. Keep up the good work and you'll be me in no time."* - Sat Sep 05 04:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) allowed it, she deserved some sort of comfort for her good efforts.* - Sat Sep 05 04:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) took a step forward.* - Sat Sep 05 20:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) || Let the fun begin. Haste was the key and destruction was the lock in this situation. By time Amai went to extract her scroll from whatever confinements it was in Tethys was more than likely in her face with two clenched fists. His intention was to send a quick right hook to her jaw, preventing her from leaving.* - Sat Sep 05 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) kept tabs of both Amai and Maloth, not giving them to the least bit of chance to catch him off guard. With Maloth now stepping forward as some savior, Tethys eased back on the strength he used in the jab; there was no beef between him and the behemoth. Nevertheless, though, Maloth would suffer a broken jaw.

As for Amai, on the other hand, payment is long overdue. With the ink surging toward him now, Tethys would grab Maloth and pull him in. The point of this was to make Maloth suffer the effects of the ink, and hopefully that was Amai's only supply. With Maloth now a human shield and probably taking the effects of the tink, Tethys charged toward Amai once more.

This time around, however, he placed his full attacking speed and strength behind another hook to the jaw, soul intention on breaking her shit too.* - Sat Sep 05 21:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) stopped his self, preventing his fist from connecting with Amai's jaw. "As I said. When I -do- get you back for that roomer, it's when I get permission from Niza. Take your friend and leave. Let Niza know I said he jumped into my business. I'll pay for his medical bill out of pocket."* - Sat Sep 05 21:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) turns his back and walks off a bit northward.* - Sat Sep 05 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks at Violet.* - Sat Sep 05 23:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) boastful chuckle.* - Sat Sep 05 23:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) it was obvious he is talking to Setsuna.* - Sat Sep 05 23:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) has a black blade that can fix that.* - Sat Sep 05 23:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's mood noticably changed as he heard his wifes' name. He was more.. depressed.. looking.* - Sun Sep 06 00:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) senses the chakra comming so he bites his tongue. He then sink Kirigakure like the Sea God did japan.* - Sun Sep 06 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (I managed to buy 300 troops from pocket money for the village. We @ 4.3k now) - Sun Sep 06 06:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes wander over to Himura and Ikaro. "Ahh, seems as though you two are around."* - Sun Sep 06 06:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nodded.* - Sun Sep 06 06:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: (Alister solo'd konoha and made Zetsumo lose a heart) - Sun Sep 06 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) whispers: (No. Fucking. WAY!) - Sun Sep 06 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks at Ikaro. "You're the squad leader."* - Sun Sep 06 06:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nods with a nod.* - Sun Sep 06 07:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks around in a paranoid manner. "Gezo is.. expensive.."* - Sun Sep 06 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) took in a slow, deep, breath. After a few seconds of thinking things through on a certain matter he exhales, virtually allowing stress to momentarily leave his body.* - Sun Sep 06 14:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's eyes ventured toward Orakuru. "Yes, we must. Lead the way."* - Sun Sep 06 15:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes widened a bit, taking the blade from Klaus. "Yeah, thanks. How much you want for it?"* - Sun Sep 06 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nods.* - Sun Sep 06 15:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) takes out a scroll and unravels it, revealing a large seal on its sheet. He places the Nuibari on the sheet and applies chakra, forming handseals in the process. Within a few seconds the blade was sealed within the scroll.* - Sun Sep 06 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) looks at Chiyari. "I hate when I send a message and I'm not granted an reply."* - Sun Sep 06 16:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) starts the process of taking off the Mizukage Robe and Hat, using Naruto-logic to make it puff behind a puff of smoke.* - Sun Sep 06 17:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) points to Chiyari, but eyes focused on Nigen.* - Sun Sep 06 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) folds his arms across his chest. "I offer a quarter of my troops.. I've been to this village a total of seven times in my life, six of the seven you all were attacked. I consider this place a second home, so in exchange for my troops to reside here and aide in your efforts of security.. I ask for you finest liquor."* - Sun Sep 06 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) watched the actions of female attired Kazekage, listening to his words all the while. It was rather annoying how he had to go out of his way to get in contact with Chiyari along with making the effort to come to this near-dead village, nevertheless a promise to Kastya is a promise that must be kept as breath still reside in his body. Still, however, annoyance was clear on his visage.

With a sigh Tethys reaches up to his face and pulls the black facemask down, revealing the rest of his facial frame. Anyone that knew Tethys knew that him having it on in the first place represented that he expected battle. This doesn't mean he wasn't on guard though.

"As I was saying, I'm offering rather virtue things in exchange for your minimum. I'm doing this because I am a man of my word, and my word was a promise to the late Kastya; along with Fuji-something. A quarter of my troops for your finest liquor, two-million yen in exchange for a renewal of the peace treaty Sunagakure and Kirigakure upheld many years ago."* - Sun Sep 06 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) nodded his head in reply to Chiyari. However, his attention was now fixated on the likes of the child that nearly ruined this moment just moments ago. "Come here."* - Sun Sep 06 17:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) continued to look over Chiyari's shoulder at the child.* - Sun Sep 06 17:57:07 2015
