<br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) raised an eyebrow.* - Sun Sep 06 17:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) summons the Samehada from the seal on his right wrist, offering it to the child.* - Sun Sep 06 18:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) summons a scroll from the seal on his left wrist, on it was the word 'trap'. "I have two kids of my own and they both have scrolls exactly like this. If you ever find yourself in trouble and need a quick way out, unravel this scroll and apply your chakra to it. It'll spring a trap of over a hundred kunai's with explosive tags attached to each weaponry. When using it be sure to aim the seal away from you at your opponent. It'll also spawn a smoke screen for you to get away."* - Sun Sep 06 18:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took  a single step closer to Ushinawa, breaking the focus he had on the child.* - Sun Sep 06 18:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's senses were truly fine-tuned. He made sure to keep grasp of the scroll that he was going to offer to Izanami, quickly unraveling it and applying chakra to its base seal. He aimed the contents toward Aiyana, causing a spring of a hundred kunai's with explosive tags attached to launch toward her --- he didn't allow the tags to discharge.

The Uchiha, on the other hand, was able to generate lightning throughout those blades --- knowledge provided to him by the documentation of each legendary blade of Kirigakure's past. With haste, having no time to waste, Tethys charged toward Ushinawana. Both his fists clenched tightly, brute strength resided in them both. As the distance between them closed, Tethys aimed to send three devastating jabs forward with an uppercut as the finale. The key was to get to the Uchiha before he had the chance to charge lightning in those blades.

24 Strength, 19 Attack Speed, 26 Taijutsu.* - Sun Sep 06 18:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) couldn't help but smirk. The efforts of Ushiwana were adorable, but nevertheless Tethys didn't spring into action without having a backup plan. With the lightning based attacks neared him, but with a single hand seal, seeing as though that handseal only required one hand, Tethys spawns a wall of wind before him. Wind was the natural enemy of Lightning there was nowhere for the lightning to go but to be negated by the wind.

Of course since Ushiwana acted so quickly, Tethys didn't have time to exactly spring the trap toward the female from before so his main focus was now on the wind based jutsu.* - Sun Sep 06 18:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was met with two different styles of attacks now, Genjutsu and Ninjutsu infused weaponist. Things seemed tricky for him at this point and time, but there are things that come in to play that grants Tethys that profound ability to succumb to the need of changing between fighting styles in a sense where he had to multitask. That being said, the Genjutsu was true. The Genjutsu's trigger was renowned, but so was the chakra sensing ability given to him through intense training. As the leaves trickled down from above his head and his eyes caught glimpse of it, Tethys recognized the chakra signature behind it. With haste, and the formation of a single handseal, Tethys reboots his chakra system.

Now it was a factor of how he'd handle the lightning infused kunai coming his way; tricky indeed. He, unlike most other people, knew that if he was in his liquid state that it'd be more than easy for the lightning affinity to set jelly to his frame, but that's not the case when he's solid. With that in mind, and haste continuing to be his motto in this battle, Tethys focuses on the existence of the female that sent the kunai soaring. He curves his body around the kunai's set path, allowing it to soar past him. Tethys follows that up with dashing full speed to the female, right palm open and left fist clenched. Firstly, he'd Ric Flair the shit out of her upper chest, avoiding her sacred bosoms. He follows that attack up with a quick uppercut to her stomach, strength being held back just enough to double her over and force her to kneel before him.  His attention returns to the Uchiha who was now even further away.* - Sun Sep 06 18:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's beef was not without one else other than Ushiwana, so when it came time for his legs to be restrained that didn't make a difference with his arms. Of course, though, his hits landed but only to send the female flying backwards with merely a broken rib or two. As for his legs, though, he was kneeling while looking around to sense out where the hell this bind was coming from. "Impressive."

With that single word, Tethys digs in to his back pouch, taking out a black object. With haste, he clenched his fist and crushed the item, sending a surge of black smoke high in to the sky; it was obvious this was a signal. At that moment, four thousands of Kirigakure's troops would make their way into the village; their destination was the location of the black smoke.* - Sun Sep 06 19:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) lowered his arms, submissive to the situation. Anyone that was able to sense would tell his chakra was growing rapidly.* - Sun Sep 06 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's head raised, looking at everyone with.. smile. He gave a shrug of his shoulders. "So be it." He turns toward Ushinawa's location. "You win, guy."* - Sun Sep 06 19:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's legs were deactivated at the time, not his arms and hands. As Ushinawa charged forward, clear intentions of continuing the pursuit even after Tethys admitted defeat, the Hogo could do nothing but respond accordingly. With haste, he strung a set of hand seals together and allowed a manifestation of wind affinity chakra to discharge from his arms. He aimed both his palms toward the Uchiha, aiming to send a gust of wind forward to negate the lightning and possibly push the Uchiha back.* - Sun Sep 06 19:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was now resorting to just negate the attacks of the Uchiha rather than attacking him. With the blast of fire coming his way, Tethys formed a single handseal and spat a torrent of water for; he was asked not to fight, so he wasn't going to do that- Jiki saved the day. If he didn't, though, Tethys would follow through with his blast of water.* - Sun Sep 06 19:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was still kneeling, protection from the iron sand of Jiki. "..Well then.."* - Sun Sep 06 19:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) made it to his feet, looking down at his legs in the process. His eyes narrowed in speculation, the curiosity of what caused this reigning in his head. Nevertheless, he had a new found level of pride that he managed to hold his own for half the battle on his knees; still, though, Jiki's hand of protection was forced. Tethys' eyes wandered off toward the male's frame, giving him a nod. "I thank you."* - Sun Sep 06 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gestures to the pitiful female behind him.* - Sun Sep 06 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looks at Chiyari. "We coo'?"* - Sun Sep 06 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walks over to the female, reaching down to grab her by the shirt collar and hoisting her over his shoulder. Gentleness was no where near his actions. Tethys walks her over to the group of Sunagakure Shinobi, roughly placing her before them. "There ya' go."* - Sun Sep 06 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) turned to look at the Uchiha. "You were the better man. I have no problem saying that." He walks over to Hiru and extended his fist, suggesting a fist bump.* - Sun Sep 06 20:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked his hands in his pants pocket, looking over at Orakuru. "When are we heading out?"* - Sun Sep 06 20:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) starts pumping himself up like Brock Lesnar does before beating someones' ass.* - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) so he was basically jumping in place.* - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's leading march came to an abrupt halt, an army blocking their path to Konohagakure. Tethys, being the head of his army, stood strong before the leader of the opposing team. The two of them could easily be compared to that of titans, their stature being the only thing able to put into basic words. With a smirk plastered on his face, Tethys reaches up to the facemask wrapped around his neck and raised it.

"So, you're going to let us pass or not?"* - Sun Sep 06 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's memory flashed. After a good look at the male before him, along with the hearing of the male's voice, Tethys recognized exactly who he was. The smirk plastered on his face slowly subsided, the memory of just how easy the man disposed of him causing slight anger to swell. Still, though, there was a mission to accomplish and there was no backing out at this point and time.

With the entire Kirigakure army residing behind him, Tethys assured himself that naturally they'd take the act of making an attempt to negate the lightning based attack. Of course there was an understanding within the military that if lightning managed to touch Tethys' frame that he is inevitably rendered incapable until proper medical treatment is provided. That being said, while haste was a main element, a band of shinobi from within the army took lead by attempting to spew out a gust of wind aimed to negate the electrical surge.

Of course, this being Tethys' first war battle on Illusions of Grandeur, the newfound Mizukage didn't know if that last attempt was successful, so even as the gust of wind reigned forward he would take it upon his self to gather chakra beneath him and temporarily retreat beneath the ground. Again, Tethys didn't know if he was able to control his army in that fashion so he wasn't then the most he could RP was that they scattered in their respective quadrants to avoid the powerful lightning strike.* - Sun Sep 06 21:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes momentarily close, concentration of his mind and energy succumbing to his grasp. Within a second, Tethys managed to enhance his primal instincts; his physical abilities enhancing a considerate amount. Seeing as though he was underground already, and he trusted that the his forces would react accordingly to the water addition of the lightning surge, Tethys tunnels beneath ground and aimed to travel toward ???'s location.

If successful, Tethys would dig into his back pouch to unsheathe a kunai while reaching up to take hold of ???'s ankle and pulling him beneath ground. With the other hand gripping the kunai, Tethys aimed to drive the tip into the body of ??? and rip his way through the man's intestines.* - Sun Sep 06 21:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's understanding, from being told by numerous people, that he jellifies when struck by lightning whilst being in his aquatic form; he didn't know how true that was but he was going with it. Still, though, the shock of the lightning was indefinite. With his body pulsating from the shock, and possible near unconsciousness, Kirigakure's army acted.

Shinobi after shinobi charged forward, sending off their best elemental ninjutsu forward to back the Amegakure army away from the hole that told where Tethys and the ??? had been. A few members of the military forces, seeing as though they were profound in Kenjutsu, began the process of hacking away the skull of ???. Meanwhile, the remaining forces would engage in intense battle with Amegakure's army, using that as a way to save their Mizukage and put an end to ???'s life.* - Sun Sep 06 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's life was on the line at this point more than ever at this point. Before, when ??? and Tethys just met, the man had it within his heart to let Tethys and his squad retreat; this is more than likely not going to happen again. Whilst weighing his options at hand, and understanding the proficiency at which his opponent wielded his lightning affinity, Tethys would use all the strength he could muster up in left fist. Making this a battle between attacking speed against attacking speed, Tethys launched that said fist forward in hopes of socking the man dead in his face.

Whether or not this worked, Tethys' main prerogative was to create as much distance between himself and ???. While tunneling, as much as he can up and away from ???, he aimed to get the aide of any of his forces.* - Sun Sep 06 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) pants, exhaustion and injury showing on the Mizukage. A smirk resided beneath Tethys' facemask, years ago he dreamed of paying back the debt of ???, now was his chance. Seeing as though lightning was still a key factor in this battle Tethys decided to play a more tactical role while still figuring out a way to end ???'s life span.

To start off, Tethys brought his right palm over to his left wrist, summoning a red scroll. As if in sync with his movements, three of shinobi of Kirigakure's military maneuvers around ???, forming their own handseals. At that moment, the shinobi residing to the far left, and right, of ??? launches two wind lances forward. 

The renowned Mizukage unravels the scroll and applies chakra to the seal located on its page, springing the trap and sending a barrage of kunai toward ???. Explosive tags were wrapped around the hilts of the kunai's, designed to give the illusion that they were just common gripping cloth. With the near two-dozen kunai's and explosive tags raining on ???, Tethys attempted use the wind lances to amplify the explosion of the tags.* - Sun Sep 06 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed as Amegakure's second line wove their handseals together. Instinctively Tethys knew what to do. He didn't know if it was poison or not, but if anyone's second line take the stand he knew it'd be because they were aiming to land a haymaker. That being said, while forming his own succession of chakra, he allowed his chakra to swell and manifest in his stomach.

The thick layer of poison dawned on Kirigakure's troops, but not before Tethys managed to order them to retreat out of its radius as fast as they can. With the fog closing in, Tethys unleashes a devastating rush of water; it could rival that of a tsunami. It's goal? Wipe out Amegakure's troops. Tethys, on the other hand, backed away as much as he can, not wanting to get caught in the fog if his attempt failed.* - Sun Sep 06 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Seems as though this may turn into a battle between water. Very well, so be it. Once again, with Amegakure's forces possibly reacting on sheer desperation, Tethys attempted to highlight on the opportunity. With the massive wave water bullet raging toward his troops, Tethys made a necessary sacrifice. His troops, however, didn't go out without a fight. They battle the water the best they can, forming their own hand seals and rivaling the water bullet with a torrent of water of their own.

Meanwhile, after Tethys liquefied to evade the blunt force of the water bullet, handseals were woven. Upon doing, he focuses his chakra within his deep pit of a stomach and puckered his lips. Seeing as though the front lines of Amegakure perished to the tsunami he created, Tethys figured he's use the reminence of water on the battle field to amplify his next technique.

Within seconds, while his army tried to battle off the water bullet the best they can, Tethys unless a thick slick of Mud forward; his intentions was to hack away at another line of Amegakure's forces.* - Sun Sep 06 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || It became a battle of wits at this point and time. The surge of lightning that claimed the lives of his shinobi only angered Tethys, giving him more than enough determination to end this battle quickly. With his own front lines destroyed, Tethys decided that this battle is better off being between him and ???; of course with his own troops backing him up.

Tethys jumps high into the air, forcing his self into the air. Many would think this was a fatal mistake for Tethys, but on his ascension he strung yet another set of handseals together. Within that moment, as his jump reached its max, he sent gush of suiton forward. The gush was thick with chakra, providing its liquid form to act as syrup to bind those caught in its mass to be immobile.* - Sun Sep 06 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) watched as the syrup and lightning clashed, negating one another with great eyes. Amidst the steam the protruded out from the battle of elements came ???. That very moment, with full knowledge of the lightning affinity affiliated with the Amegakure head soldier, Tethys unsheathed his Black Blade. The point at which the two were at only allowed there to be a battle between just them, it may have gotten to the point of do or die.

That being said, as ??? launched his sword forward, Tethys swung his. It was a battle of attacking speed against attacking speed once more, it was clear Tethys aimed to out due his opponent. Following the instant clash of the blades, Tethys wasted no time in bring his full swinging speed and strength forward in an attempt to slice ???'s head off.* - Sun Sep 06 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's body went limp, the electricity that surged through his body only proved to do what it was destined for. He body spazzed and pulsated, turning him mostly into jelly in the process. His troops, on the other hand, were more than likely taking on Amegakure's remaining forces while keeping tabs on their Mizukage.

Still, though, the main threat was dead.* - Sun Sep 06 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) limps into the courtyard, body 90% jellified. A smirk was on his face, visible due to his half shredded facemask. He was bloodied, battered and tired, but still victorious in his battle. Still, though, medical attention was what he required at the moment. He looks at Violet, scanning her frame and everyone elses. "M-Mission.. Com-Complete-," he falls face first into the ground.

Behind him was the remaining amount of Kirigakakure's troops; so no, he didn't wander back by himself.* - Sun Sep 06 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The healing process given to Tethys by Setsuna would've notably be futile. The only part that truly helped Tethys was when liquid was provided to him from the bottle of water. His body would thicken, as if becoming considerably more solid; compared to prior the water that is. As he was rolled on his back, he looks up at Setsuna and mouthed the word "more" to her, implying that all he needed was more water.

Be assured that they had to work with haste, if Tethys stayed in this state for too long he'll surely die.* - Mon Sep 07 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's body was merely acting off of instincts at this point. The absolute need for water gave the group of people an easier time with treating Tethys; granted, it was still hard figuring out exactly how much water he required. His consciousness began to slip in and out, only kicking back in when another bottle of water was supplied to him. By time the fourth bottle was granted to him, Tethys was looking into who exactly was here to help him.

Violet, a female that only recently graduated that swore her loyalty to both Tethys and the Village. She set a level in Tethys' mind and heart that made him believe that not all women, apart from Noriko, were sleazy and manipulative, but some can be sincere and genuine. Violet, just a kunoichi in the making, set a standard for the rest.

Jin, a male that has been around for a while that doesn't cease to impress Tethys. The urgency, despite Tethys knowing how much Jin despised working in haste contrasted to his own pace, was felt from Jin; this gave Tethys a new found respect for the upcoming shinobi. Jin was honestly thanked for his efforts.

Kubo, a graduate from the same class as Violet, proved to have true interest in Kirigakure's affairs. The enthusiasm from Kubo only proved to Tethys that hardwork didn't intimidate this child; a great feature nevertheless. Tethys' head turns slightly; he half glazed over pupils fixated on him. His eyes momentarily shut after a second or so.

Last, but surely not least, was Setsuna. A female that only showed her lazy side to Tethys stepped up to the plate, swung her medical bat as fast and as hard as she could; a homerun was granted to her. The healing process allowed the small damages of Tethys to heal fine, but it was truly her basic training of dehydration that truly saved Tethys' life. He quick thinking aided in the restoration of the fill-in Kage.

Within ten water bottles Tethys was rejuvenated, only suffering from 'jet-lag' and possible nausea. He sits up, placing a hand to the side of his head and grunts warily. "..Ughh, I thank you all.."* - Mon Sep 07 01:01:13 2015

Rahm, a kid that showed just as much spunk as Kubo, but was less modest about it. He remained calm for the most part, where it was important, and aided in everyone's efforts; this proved that he had no trouble whilst working under pressure. Grattitude to him was clear as day as Tethys gave him a slight smirk.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) sealed the swords back into the naruto-logic imaginary place. He gave another grunt of discomfort before speaking. "The first time the guy and I fought I escaped with my life out of sheer luck. I didn't even land a hit on him back then. He disposed of me before I even thought about attacking. This time, however, I managed to hack his head off; even if it's after he nearly caused me to evaporate. I'll soon find a way to cover my weakness to the lightning affinity, but until then I'll keep going about things the way I already am."* - Mon Sep 07 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) chuckles.* - Mon Sep 07 01:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) caught each of them, nodding toward Jin in gratitude.* - Mon Sep 07 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was hugged, hesitant at first but did eventually return it. He kept his arms around her upper back, showing no since of sexual references within the hug. "Alright now, alright now."* - Mon Sep 07 01:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) sneezes, causing a tsunami to kill everyone.* - Mon Sep 07 01:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) finally found time to go through the scroll that Jin provided him. First things first, though, Tethys had to find a quiet place so he could read through it thoroughly; it wasn't hard finding said place. After a short stroll, the Hogo head finds himself starting off into the ocean whilst standing on the beach of the Hogo's private island. With a sigh of relief, Tethys strips off his first layer of clothing and began reading.

"This is relatively easy," he says as he skims the page. After reading through the scroll a total of three times, all while following the instructions step by step, Tethys felt like he was ready to physically try it in one go. With the forming of a single handseal, and a quick burst of his chakra to his feet, Tethys dashes forward. The only thing that was represented as his previous location was his footprint in the sand and a puff of smoke.* - Mon Sep 07 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's nausea and dizziness subsides once again, providing him with the ability to make it to his felt. A sigh of exhaustion is released from the Hogo, the necessary handseal for Body Flicker being formed. Tethys readies his body, allowing his knees to lock and his ankles to loosen slightly; the Body Flicker was tougher to handle that he thought it'd be. Still, though, if he was able to take grasp of the basics with ease then mastering this technique should be easy.

At that moment, with a set location in mind, Tethys would give his chakra a sudden push. The chakra engulfs Tethys in a mere instant, allowing him to burst forward at what could be known as his top speed. While residing at his new location, after successfully using the Flicker technique, he couldn't help but lean against the tree he sat as his checkpoint. He pants and nearly doubles over, trying to regain his composure.* - Mon Sep 07 03:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) waited the side effects out once more, grunting in annoyance. He found that this technique could be extremely useful in battle at some point and time, but not with this troublesome effect. Tethys takes a jab at that the tree he used as leverage, frustration overcoming him slightly. Hell, if anything Tethys was more determined to quickly perfect this jutsu before his next life or death battle; knowing Zetsumo's group that'd be too close of a time lapse for comfort.

Once the effect wore off of Tethys he stands up straight and readied his self. This time, however, rather than locking his knees and loosening his ankles, he does the inverse. With his ankles now acting as a crutch in stiffness rather than actual ankles, Tethys hoped to possibly add more power to the Flicker technique; this was all in an attempt to find a method of the technique that best suited him in comfort ability.

Of course, though, that attempt only made Tethys apply more than the necessary amount of chakra behind the technique. Once he sent the burst of chakra out, his instincts over his network kicked in and forced him to expand more chakra than normal to compensate for the locked ankles. By time Tethys arrived at he previous location he was even more nauseated and dizzy. "D-Damn it, yo'," he manages to mutter as he sat his self down and held his head.* - Mon Sep 07 03:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The effects of Body Flicker was easily comparable to that of a bad hangover after a night in the town. Still, though, progress was being made; even if that progress was so minuscule that it could barely be identified. Compared to the very first time Tethys used the technique, this previous time was a major step forward. Nevertheless, the effects afterwards were still a bitch.

Tethys makes it back to his feet once more, letting go of his head and centering his mind. Rather than thinking about the technique as a quick power rush, maybe having the mindset that it was as much of an ally as his Black Blade and fellow shinobi. With a deep inhale, and concentration of chakra, Tethys formed the necessary handseal. Upon doing so, while placing an image of the tree he wants to dash toward, Tethys pushed his swelling chakra out.

After doing so, with both his knees and ankles slightly loosened, he found that the chakra used was lessened this time around. The effect, though, was a damn bitch. He doubles over, placing a hand on the side of his head and an arm around his stomach. If the tree wasn't where it was Tethys would've easily tipped over as he resorted to leaning shoulder first against the trunk. "I refuse to let such a skill claim me as its bitch, I'm going to master it and I'm going to add it to my fighting arsenal," thought Tethys as he waited things out.* - Mon Sep 07 03:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Alright; so it's clear that if I'm tense that this damn technique have heavier side effects. It's also clear that if I loosen myself too much that I'd out speed myself. My best option is to just relax and find that midpoint," thought Tethys. He takes in a slow, deep, breath and exhales it after a few minutes; that provided him the ability to center his mind and body.

His right hand formed the necessary handseal, acting as a trigger to help him circulate his chakra flow. Tethys closes his eyes and allowed that same chakra to slowly pick up pace, surging through his network at an alarming rate. With the image of his destination in mind, the Hogo pushed the chakra outward. The push of chakra was basically on an expert level at this point; progress Tethys, progress.

With the burst of chakra reigning out, Tethys allowed his body's tension to react accordingly; finding that midpoint where he didn't try to reduce, or enhance, his chakra to comply with his body. Instead, Tethys allowed his body to comply with the necessary chakra level. That being said, with his body now in tuned with his chakra, Tethys Flicker back to the bank of the beach. Normally, he'd double over from the effects of the technique, but this time around he merely staggers back a bit whilst slowly shaking his head to regain his piece of mind.* - Mon Sep 07 03:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave his self a mental pat on the back; he was pretty impressed with himself. It didn't take long for him to figure out the foundation of how his body worked with the technique, a feat that could have possibly taken someone much longer to do. Still, though, side effects were present. Tethys wasn't going to just shrug off the side effects, no matter how efficient he got with the technique, but still he did take it upon himself to pick up the pace a bit.

This time around Tethys didn't fully wait for the effects of the technique to subside, he figured that maybe the best way to get rid of the effects is just to get used to it all together. While keeping that in mind, Tethys forms the necessary handseal. Yet again his chakra circulation rate boosts up, giving him the necessary charge when the time comes. Since he was experimenting with the technique, he decided to hold the charge a tad bit longer.

Even though he was charging for a little bit longer, that didn't mean Tethys over exerted his chakra on the same note. With the image of the tree in mind, Tethys pushed his chakra outward and allowed his body to do its thing. As it synced with the flow of chakra, Tethys body vanishes from behind a puff a white smoke, appearing a few yards away by the tree trunk. Once there, however, Tethys couldn't help but stagger back from the effects; better than doubling over. "Alright, I think this is enough for the day."* - Mon Sep 07 04:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was actually caught off guard by Jin's presence.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed into a slight squint as Angetsu spoke. Something about this kid signaled something off in Tethys' head, but the Hogo head didn't know exactly what. Not wanting to exactly judge a book by its cover, Tethys listened intently on what the male had to say. Soon enough, though, he was met with a choice that needed to be made.

"Trust is something I can't promise that you'll have when it comes to the others of the village. Personally I don't mind taking you under my wing and seeing to it that you become the best that you can be. My main priority, though, is to eliminate Zetsumo once in for all before he manages to regain any form of forces from Amegakure. From this point on, Ketsueki, you are able to consider yourself allied with Kirigakure and the Black Blade."* - Mon Sep 07 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looked up at the sky, thinking about the question from Angetsu. A smirk formed on the Hogo's face after a few minutes though, as if he came to a realization at that moment.

"It depends on what battleground setting you're referring to. From my standpoint, I lost a little over half of four thousand troops. But on the other hand, I still managed to take out the majority of Amegakure's forces. Zetsumo knew that he'd be outnumbered so he called in for some reinforcements. Little did he know, Kirigakure was expecting that and I led my men to intercept the Amegakure troops.

On the main battlefield, though, we lost plenty of soldiers from both Kumogakure and Sunagakure. Still, though, those two forces managed to take out all of the remaining Amegakrue troops while killing off Zetsumo's main allies in his personal organization. In all, though, we lost some but gained more."* - Mon Sep 07 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes remained fixated on the sky, not breaking focus. However, Tethys' senses were fine-tuned, allowing him to keep tabs on the chakra network of Angetsu. It's not that the Hogo didn't trust the Fukushu, but it was just a way for Tethys to assure himself that everything the male said was sincere and true. Thus far, though, Tethys had nothing to worry about.

"I have only two fuuton techniques in my arsenal. I do plan to change that, though."* - Mon Sep 07 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) strung three handseals together, causing two puffs of smoke to emit from both his palms. In his grasp was two jutsu scrolls, one titled Wind Lancer and the other Wind Shield. Tethys hands the scrolls over to Angetsu and gave him a nod.

"Knock yourself out, guy."* - Mon Sep 07 18:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's posture remained nonchalant, not giving any hostile intent. The hat on his head continued to hide the hop half of his face, the facemask he traditionally wore covering the lower. The robe he wore wasn't exactly fitted on his body, but rather only clinging on to him by his shoulders; his arms were not trailed within the sleeves. It was clear that Tethys had both his hands tucked in his pockets, there was really no reason for anyone to feel threatened by him.

"I think I've proven my worth when it comes to a similar cause," the Mizukage mutters as his head shifted toward Ushinawa's general location. "I come here not to fight, but to talk."* - Mon Sep 07 21:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) knew from the second Ri set the order that Kirigakure officials must eliminate all the unique eye'd shinobi that he'd be the one to answer to all the questions. It didn't bother Tethys, but still it may have prevented a lot of people from allying themselves with the village he loved so dearly.

"You have to understand, each death wasn't a murder per say. The village council talked with each member of the village, from common citizens to shinobi alike, and everyone came to the understanding that to assure the safety of the next generations to come, this is a necessary evil. Each person that handed their eyes over was honored separately. They each had their own ceremony for a final resting place and each had a ceremony for gratitude. This was not something of tyrannical efforts, but to further enhance our village as a whole."* - Mon Sep 07 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) released a sigh of annoyance. "I rather not do so in this current location.."* - Mon Sep 07 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) points to the blades Ushinawa had in his grasp. "Those are native to my village. Created and designed within Kirigakure. They are also two blades that were long stolen from Kirigakure's vault and I've made it my life mission to retrieve them, along with the others. If I counted that blade, I'd have gathered five thus far."* - Mon Sep 07 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) looks over toward Zhen.* - Mon Sep 07 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) gave a slight shrug, giving Ushinawa his full visual attention.* - Mon Sep 07 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) gave a shrug, walking close to the mansion; his destination was to venture inside the building.* - Mon Sep 07 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) stopped walking, a sigh releasing itself from his frame. Everyone knew Tethys was a hot head and everyone knew that sooner or later, if you pushed the Hogo far enough, he snaps. This time around, though, Tethys forced himself to give no sign of his actions. As Ushinawa spoke of Kirigakure the anger within Tethys sparked. Without a moment notice, Tethys allowed his primal instincts to kick in.

In a single wisp of movement he attempted to close the distance between himself and Ushinawa. Both his fists were clenched and both were poised to send two powerful strikes forward. One aimed for Ushinawa's nose and the other aimed for under the Uchiha's jaw.* - Mon Sep 07 22:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's attention was transferred from Ushinawa to Zhen. His sensing ability aided him in identifying the sudden charge in chakra, providing him with the necessary memory spike of the many people he fought in his life time that were able to do this same fighting style. Seeing as though Zhen's speed of attacking was much better than Tethys' reflexes, the Mizukage did the next best thing by simply matching the attacking speed with his own.

By doing so, as Zhen's arm came rushing forward, Tethys swung his left arm forward. His own palm was open as hell, aiming to slap away Zhen's launch and possibly disrupt the combination following afterwards. If successful, Tethys allowed the moisture in his body to circulate and manifest within his entire arm. At that moment, with literally no time to waste, his arm maximized.

To follow up on the slap-away attempt, Tethys send a devastating jab toward Zhen's jaw.* - Mon Sep 07 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's body was pushed back inevitably, but not with out retaliation. As his body went flying the necessary amount before friction reigned with an iron fist, Tethys allowed the massive arm to metaphorically deflate. With Zhen now readying himself for another onslaught, Tethys strung a series of handseals together, allowing a noticeable amount of chakra to swell within his stomach. Tethys was full aware of Zhen's eye ability, and he was happy that Zhen could see all this; it was just Zhen viewing his death play out to the very end.

Tethys charged forward, puckering his lips slightly, and went to go toe to toe with the Hyuuga born shinobi.* - Mon Sep 07 23:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) || And it was at that point Tethys new he'd have to act quick. It seemed as though the Hyuuga completely ignored the charging of chakra within Tethys stomach, providing the Hozuki the potential ability to catch the guy of guard. With the Hyuuga coming in for the final assault, Tethys allowed the build up of chakra to thicken and spew out his puckered lips in a water-base form. That water would engulf the licks of the Hyuuga, rendering his movements incapable; rest assured that Tethys did use the necessary handseals for this technique before charging in once again.

With Zhen now trapped, Tethys brought his right arm over to the back of his left shoulder and applied chakra to the seal located there. From behind a momentary puff of smoke came the Hiramekarei in Tethys' grasp. Without any time to waste, Tethys went to hack off the Hyuuga's head.* - Tue Sep 08 00:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's attack seemed to have been diverted; a troublesome result to say the least. Zhen trailed around Tethys, now targeting the shoulder, which the seal on his shoulder was located. Once again, just like before, Tethys was aware of his own ability to evade the Hyuuga so he made it his priority to repeat the same actions that sparked all this off. With an open palm coming his way, Tethys skillfully maneuvered the blade within his grasp so its length and width benefitted him the most. In an attempt to make the broad, but still pointed, tip of the blade potentially halt Zhen's movement, Tethys allowed more moisture from his body to circulate to his right arm and beef it up to its great stature.

On a side note, as described within the Jutsu's description, Tethys was able to manipulate the syrup at will. While taking full advantage of that, Tethys would attempt to have his chakra creep more toward Zhen, giving him less room to work with when pertaining to successfully hitting the Hogo.* - Tue Sep 08 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) What is the shunshin distance based on and how long does the side effect last?* - Tue Sep 08 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) ^* - Tue Sep 08 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) was once again met with a dilemma, having both the Uchiha and Hyuuga teaming him. He knew of the attack coming from Ushinawa due to his primal sensing ability, it was just merely escaping before the AoE effects kicked in fully; or make an attempt that is. There was just a little window for Tethys to work with at this point and time, so he had to put his proficiency with large blades to full use rather than swinging it to hack heads off.

With the surging electricity coming his way, after forcing Zhen to momentarily halt his initiative attack, Tethys swiped the blade so its width took the blunt force of the air palm. Seeing as though Tethys' attempt to slyly maneuver the syrup he casted from before went unmentioned, he assumed that by this point, an RP Round later, that it must've been able to capture Zhen.

Still, though, Tethys had to worry about the AoE lightning surging his way. Of course it didn't take long for Tethys to alter the blade in his hand to the force of the attack. That moment, while improvising Tethys attempted to jump rather than evading to his sides and meeting the effects of the lightning.* - Tue Sep 08 01:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) sheds a tear. Kirigakure bout that Ride or Die shit.* - Tue Sep 08 01:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) lets whatever happens.* - Tue Sep 08 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's momentum landed him on the roof with the mansion. Once again, with the AoE lightning coming his way, Tethys had to improvise his ass off. There were many factors at hand. First off, Kirigakure's gank squad was coming to aide Tethys, so it was a matter of Tethys maximizing on the situation at hand. That being said, not wanting to seem as though he's some god, the best thing for Tethys to do was place those previously stated factors, wrapped them around his knuckles, clench and punched the shit out of the roof. He wanted to cave the shit in so he can fall with the rubble and 'possibly' evade.* - Tue Sep 08 02:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) didn't know whether or not his attempt to break the roof was assured, so he did what he thought was best. Seeing as though his hands were now free, Tethys formed the necessary handseals to Flicker back to the ground, staggering a bit. The spot where he landed was identified as where his Hiramekarei was placed after taking the Air Palm from Zhen. The Hogo gripped the blade with the best of his ability, hoping that possibly all these interferences put a halt to this now pointless battle.

"The day me and this guy fight, it must be one on one and we need an entire country as a battle field," thought Tethys as he attempted to recuperate from the Flicker effects. Of course, by now, he was binded by Tetsumi's iron sand.* - Tue Sep 08 03:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) was in the middle of battle so he couldn't reply to Nigen. Still, though, he knew at a flick of a wrist he could break the jaw of Nigen.* - Tue Sep 08 03:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) declared that he's staying his ass in Kirigakure from now on.* - Tue Sep 08 03:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) successfully burrows beneath the ground, masking his self from being sensed. He starts the process of tunneling toward Ushinawa.* - Tue Sep 08 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's primal instincts kicked back in, allowing him to move a bit faster. He continues to tunnel forward.* - Tue Sep 08 04:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) || Due to circumstantial situations, there was a roll to depict whether or not the Uchiha would be able to see past the layer of earth at Tethys' location. That being said, the Hogo continued to advance forward unnoticed. Once close enough, under Ushinawa to be exact, Tethys would swiftly reach and grab the Uchiha's ankles. From there, with all his strength, Tethys dragged the Sharingan wielder into the ground with the attempt at subduing him; more than likely preventing the boy from maneuvering. At this point and time Tethys was not out for the kill, there was no point in killing the Uchiha.

The main priority was to swiftly disarm the blades from Ushinawa and burrowing away.* - Tue Sep 08 04:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) was no god, but he was slightly tankful. Seeing as though he was an Hozuki, the lightning did nothing to aide him in this situation. Still, though, he resistance aided him as much as it could. From past ruling, the solid form of Tethys took on 24 damage points away from the 30 damage; leaving 7 to run ramped on Tethys. The medium damaged shocked Tethys, but still he was able to fight until he was completely jellified. At this point, however, he was nearly 25% of the way there.

With determination fueling Tethys now, he fought through that fact and goes to punch Ushinawa with his full might. The only thing left was for Tethys to just knock the Uchiha out and take back the blades.* - Tue Sep 08 04:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's natural ranking as a shinobi and etcetera gave him the ability to withstand the effects of Dravae's jutsu a bit longer than Ushinawa. Still, though, if he didn't act soon then he'd be down for the count. With just a small amount of chakra left Tethys disarms the Uchiha and pulls him out the ground alongside himself, freeing them both. Whilst using what bit of chakra he had left he formed a few handseals and they vanished within a seal on his body.

After crawling a few feet away from Ushinawa, though, Tethys collapsed.* - Tue Sep 08 04:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) was KOed too.* - Tue Sep 08 04:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) <font color="#FFFF00><i><center>Within the confinements of Konohagakure came a thunderous roar. A single burst of chakra signals a massive implosion of heat. Those around could see the source of power emitting from the Kirigakure medic known as Koeki.* - Tue Sep 08 06:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's struggles to sit up, head pounding from both the intense battle and his senses running rampet due to Koeki's current form. She wasn't infused with chakra just yet, but the amount emitting from her proved that it was something dangerous coming. Without a moment notice, which was still slow for him, Tethys formed the necessary handseals and crawled over to Koeki's body, placing his hand on her forehead.* - Tue Sep 08 06:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) s hand remained on Koeki's forehead, giving off what bit of chakra he could spare to her body. Within moments of doing so, both their bodies ignite in the sacred chakra of the Bijuu, emitting a powerful light. Still though, after a struggle of t4 fuuinjutsu versus a not yet unsealed bijuu, Tethys prevails. His chakra, if anyone was able to physically see his color, engulfs both of them; causing the sensation of chakra to subside and put them all at ease.* - Tue Sep 08 06:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) staggers to his feet once again, feeling the effects of his low chakra. Compared to before, though, this was a lot better; he was still weakened a great amount though. With Dravae and the three comes rushing toward Violet, Tethys would focus on the original.

"C-Call them off, damn it; the blades belong to us! This is mission even Smith and I were given before the guy even died! You talk of-of the evil needing to be eradicated, but the person that wielded this blade before the kid over there is the reason any of this is happening. He sparked off these nonstop wars! Damn it, Dra-Dravae! ENOUGH!"* - Tue Sep 08 07:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) struggle to raise his left arm, offering his fist to Dravae for some dap. "Yo-You got it, guy."* - Tue Sep 08 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) 's body twitches a bit before momentarily going limp. He begins panting, giving Dravae one last nod before attempting to turn with Violet helping him stay vertical. "I got you, Dravae.. Don't worry." With that, they made another attempt to leave.* - Tue Sep 08 07:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Uptown Realest) collapses to the ground, chuckling a bit. He slips off his robe and hat, revealing his slightly battered body.* - Tue Sep 08 07:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) whispers: Not. Fucking. Now. - Tue Sep 08 19:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) raised his right hand to his face and drags it to the back of his head, scooping excess hair from out of his line of sight. The gaze Himura granted him was only returned with an emotionless glare, a stare down that could be registered in the book of legendary battles. Still, however, Tethys forced his self to admit defeat as he nodded his head and backs up a few feet. "Fine," the Hogo mutters as he paced back to his original spot.* - Tue Sep 08 19:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) snaps his fingers, spawning two jutsu scrolls from behind a puff of smoke. He chucks them toward Kirie, expecting her to catch them.* - Tue Sep 08 19:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a sigh of slight annoyance; he didn't expect a simple spar to turn to such chaos. A gaze is set upon Baen at this point, clearly showing that possible disciplinary acts are due. "You didn't have to do that, guy.."* - Tue Sep 08 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) folds his arms across his chest, listening to the argument play out.* - Tue Sep 08 20:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) a vein is seen bulging from the right side of his head.* - Tue Sep 08 20:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) stomps his right foot, easily caving in a good portion of the tiled turf.

"Enough. Whatever transpired while I was gone is over. Himura, you're not going anywhere. If you truly want to leave to go somewhere, it'd be on a mission to go pick flowers and calm yourself down. Baen, you and I both know that was necessary and you'll face the consequence when I figure out how to inflict torture on you enough that you actually 'feel' pain. Setsuna, I thank you for healing Himura and I'll handle what ever happened during my absence."* - Tue Sep 08 20:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) snaps his fingers, two NPC Guards appearing from behing a puff of smoke. "If you even think he's planning on making a run for it, tie him to a tree and make him watch road safety videos."* - Tue Sep 08 20:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walks off into the mansion, locking the doors behind him.* - Tue Sep 08 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) shifted his head a bit, gesturing for the guards to leave. Upon thier departure, Tethys looks at Himura and gave him an emotionless glare. "Do as you please. You claim that you can be replaced, but there will only ever be one Mitsuru Himura."* - Tue Sep 08 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) decided to just let them banter until their tongues got tired, or pulled out; whichever came first.* - Tue Sep 08 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes ventured around, catching sight of every person in the courtyard that was once involved in this conversation and every person still involved. A sigh is released, signaling that he was truly growing wary of the topic at hand; still, though, he had to find a way to bring this once well-oiled machine of a village back to its prime when it came to communication amongst others. Tethys looks at Himura, raised his left arm and pointing to the general area of Jin and Baen.

"See what happens when just the smallest piece of a machine is broken? See what happens when even the smallest piece of a machine decides to stop working? Mayhem, chaos, disruption, heartaches, headaches, all the aches that are allied with the stress of knowing a component in what keeps this village running quits. You said that you can be replaced, rank wise that's true. Another Chuunin could spawn any moment, but there was a reason you were made Chuunin and there are reasons why everyone else were and are being made Chuunin.

I'm not the sentimental type of guy, but I'll tell you this Himura, you're needed in the village just as much as me. You may not see it, and knowing you, you'll ask exactly how; just know you are. You want to leave, be my guest. You want to stay and actually work through your mind and emotions, great. No one here hates you. Dislike your attitude, yeah. I'm pretty sure everyone here hates my attitude as well, I'm the ideal hot-head, but they don't hate me because they know I'm willing to put my life on the line for them. Tighten up, Himura. Think straight like you usually do."

Tethys had nothing more to say; at this point he learned how to block out the empty threats between Baen and Jin. The most the Hogo did was walk off to the side of the locate village map and lean against it, tucking his palms back in his pants pockets.* - Tue Sep 08 21:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) doesn't care for respect points. They all look to him when their lives are on the line anyways.* - Tue Sep 08 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Do all genin gut their own legs? - Tue Sep 08 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's left eyebrow raised in interest, the display of wind was truly impressive for a supplemental thing. To Tethys, however, he could easily tie this jutsu in to one of the Hazo style wind jutsus he knew how to perform. Still, though, the Hogo remained quiet and kept listening intently.* - Wed Sep 09 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took grasp of the jutsu scroll, wasting no time in beginning the process of learning its content. With Hassan, along with the other two that attended this lesson with Tethys, teaching the Hogo the basics it was just a matter of time before his studious mind and prodigal nature kicked in. The scrolls unraveling of information within Tethys' mind sent anxious shivers up and down his mind, it was nearly scary how thirsty Tethys was for this knowledge. Still, though, Tethys made sure to read thing thoroughly.

At first Tethys' mind didn't exactly register what exactly this scroll was trying to teach him, it was just babbling on and on about the flow of chakra through weaponry or anything used as a tool. Then the scroll went on to state the fundamentals of chakra, a lesson taught to Tethys when he was merely an Academy Student. Despite feeling like rereading these tips and instructional words were a drag, the Hogo continued on. A sigh escaped his lips.

By time Tethys reached the midpoint of the scroll, though, things made sense. Just like how Hassan talked, you had to register your mind that every other statement tied in. So lines one and three were to be put together while lines two and four were supposed to be up together, it was to assure the level of concentration in the mind; damn Hassan was smart for doing that. Nevertheless, though, the scroll was still a bit confusing.

Once Tethys reached the last bit of information displayed in the scroll he felt like he was ready to actually try the jutsu out for himself. He places his right palm over the inside of his left wrist and activated the seal that was there. From behind a small puff of smoke came a single shuriken, poised and ready for usage. With the metallic item now in his right palm, Tethys would center his breathing and sync it with his chakra circulation. From there, with surprisingly amazing ease, the shuriken was slowly being engulfed with chakra.* - Wed Sep 09 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) centered himself once more, raising his arms out in front of him and poising his palms in the same general direction. One thing about this jutsu, though, was it was extremely similar to that of Wind Lancer. There were still differences in the jutsu, but the bases of the two were extremely identical. Not wanting to disrespect the teachings of Hassan, though, Tethys made sure to no tie the two techniques into one another.

With his arms raised and palms poised, Tethys closed his eyes. The circulation of chakra within his body would slightly speed up; all while his chakra, in itself, thinned. With the flow surging through his arms, at this point, the Hogo would wait until the numbing sensation of any new jutsu someone was exposed to ran through his muscles. That being said, Tethys would exert the rush of chakra out. 

Naturally, due to the rapidly thinning chakra that started off within his body, Tethys was allowed the ability to shoot off a mere gust of wind. It was nowhere near what it should have been, but it was some form of progress. A spark of realization came over Tethys though; Wind Lancer was different in more than just one way. The nonchalant smirk that usually plastered itself on Tethys face returned.

His arms were falling asleep from being in that one position for long so, instinctively, Tethys began shaking them back and forth. After a few minutes he was back at it again, his arms raised and open palms poised in the same direction. The same concentration of his chakra circulation was returned, but this time around it was more intense. As if trying to push the chakra out while forcing it stay confined, Tethys basically sent the entire floor in overdrive.

While the flow of chakra was surging, Tethys allowed it to break down. Just like before, the chakra thinned and seeped into his cannon-like arms, ready to be fired off at will. Not wanting for a mere gust of amateur wind to be launched, Tethys gave the chakra a massive push. The end result was better, but it was obvious that Tethys was no master at the ability.* - Wed Sep 09 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) watched as the stronger gust of wind, this time around, dispersed. He wasn't exactly proud of the progress he made thus far, but he had to understand that this was of an element he barely used ever in his life unless he was forced to. Still though, Tethys was impatient. Knowing Hassan, if Tethys was to procrastinate or take long to master this technique, the old head would change his mind on teaching the next level of technique; Tethys couldn't have that.

An audible sigh came from Tethys as he began shaking his arms, loosening the muscles up once again. Koeki and Jin were in the background a few lessons ahead of him and determination was kicking in for him to catch up. With furrowed eyebrows and a jolt of inspiration, Tethys raised his arms again and poised the palms forward. He closes his eyes and concentrates on his chakra network.

"Alright," thought Tethys as he allowed his chakra circulation speed to slowly pick up pace. "It's a vortex of wind so naturally it should spin in a tornado-like formation, right?" With his arms still hoisted up in front of him, Tethys would allow his chakra to manifest within them; starting from his shoulders to the very tips of his fingers. The Hogo clan-head takes in a slow, deep, breath and exhales it as slow as he took the breath in, he had to concentrate.

Within a few minutes of just feeling his chakra out, circulating it through his arms and the rest of his body, Tethys felt as though he was ready. Instead of exerting all the chakra at once, Tethys figured that it'd be best to let its natural nature take control. As the he slowly pushed the chakra out, he allowed each step of the way to thin the manifestation a bit more; giving the chakra the ability to actually form as wind once it was out of his body. By time the chakra was half way out, Tethys realized that it was forming into a vortex after all; progress was indeed being made.* - Wed Sep 09 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) managed to establish a thorough vortex this time around, granting him an understanding of the jutsu on an expert basis. Being an expert at something was nowhere near the same as being a master though, so Tethys continued on with his training. Seeing as though Jin and Koeki were levels ahead of him in their training, they were granted the chance to rest; Tethys, on the other hand, was fixated on catching up while they rested. Once again, like the times before, the Hogo began flexing his arms muscles to loosen them up.

Unlike the last few times, it didn't take long for Tethys to loosen up his arm muscles and wake them up from their slumber. Now that Tethys was on an expert level with this jutsu, he felt as though it may have been necessary that he took a different approach with arm formation. Rather than having them both stretch out in front of him, Tethys raised them to his sides. The form he took made him look like a lowercase t.

Tethys was used to using the concentrated chakra within both hands to exert the necessary wind so, to trivia himself, he decides to have his arms only depend on themselves rather than each other. The concentration of his chakra began, the ease of this was noticeably better but not where it needed to be. His breathing managed to sync with his chakra circulation and his mind already had the basics down pat as far as what to do in each arm. Still though, it was a matter of supply enough chakra in each arm to make up for the absence of the other.

With the swelling of chakra now numbing up his arms, which was less than when he first attempted to perform this jutsu, Tethys began exerting the thinned power source. With each wave of fresh chakra being exposed to the atmosphere outside of Tethys body, it was clear that each were thinner than the last. Eventually, with the different layers of wind merging together, a legit vortex formed. Now, each arms knew what to do to compensate for the lack of the other; this gave Tethys more than enough room to be creative in potential battle.* - Wed Sep 09 01:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's training with Body Flicker has been rather successful thus far. He managed to wear off the intense side effects from before and replace it with a subtle disorientation that could be worked off in a minute or so. Still, though, Tethys found that "minute" to be extremely crucial in the midst of battle; that left him with the idea to continue practicing the technique. With a deep intake of breath, Tethys began the process.

"Alright, so if I can train my body to consecutively then I won't have to worry about these damn side effects. I really hope it's not going to be as much of a pain as Jin said it is." During his little pep talk, which was missing the actual 'pep', Tethys began preparing his body for the physically straining feats. To start off, Tethys walks over to the bank of the beach and turns to face the usual tree he used as a checkpoint.

With a single handseal, and a swift burst of chakra, Tethys synced his loosed body with his movements. A puff of white smoke replaced Tethys at the bank of the beach, leaving Tethys to successfully reside at his checkpoint. Still, though, Tethys forced his self to refrain from staggering back in disorientation. With another burst of charka and syncing of his body, Tethys was replaced with yet another puff of smoke. His destination was for the bank of the beach, but due to him not giving himself anytime to recuperate; Tethys only made it half way.

The Hogo drops to his knees, panting to catch his breath and holding his head with one hand. The dizziness resulting in the rapid succession of the Body Flicker technique only proved that his body was not fully used to the intense speed. It took the same length of time to regain stability as it did when he first started using Body Flicker; this was the true torture of training to be the greatest. Still though, Tethys makes it to his feet and waits out the effects, slowly moving his head from left and right to ease the spinning of his brain.

Determination was one hell of a drug for Tethys. Mix that with his stubbornness and you'll get a possibly suicidal maniac when it came to training. Before his head could fully gather itself Tethys was on the move again, planting his feet firmly on the ground while loosening his remaining body up to comply with the push of chakra he was about to exert. The required handseal was formed and Tethys pushed his self. Following said push came the usual push of smoke that signaled Tethys successfully used the technique, resulting in him residing at the bank of the beach. Again, though, without letting go of the handseal and pushing another burst of chakra forward, Tethys vanishes behind a cloud of smoke. His destination, this time, was by the tree but he was laid out on the ground panting and struggling to keep grasp of his piece of mind.* - Wed Sep 09 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave Lera a nod of gratitude, accepting the scrolls and placing them in his universal back pouch.* - Wed Sep 09 08:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) heard Jin's statement, narrowing his eyes a bit but doesn't say anything in return.* - Wed Sep 09 12:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked both his hands in his pockets, keeping his narrowed eyes fixated on Jin. "You all compare yourselves to Baen too much. Are you seriously going to make him get under your skins like this? It's pitiful. I acknowledged Baen and let him know that he'll suffer consequences for his actions; it's not easy disciplining someone with his attitude and bone density abilities. Still, though, you all are too emotional."* - Wed Sep 09 12:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) slowly shook his head. "I guess I know what I have to do. The second your arm is healed, you're going on a mission. You and Jin both."* - Wed Sep 09 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was able to sense that his words hit home.

"Never said you were a disgrace, Jin; that's something I don't ever think I'll view any of you as. The fact of the matter is: you're all going through a stage in life where certain things are becoming more aware to you and you're finding your path. I went through that stage and I see, now, how hard it was for my higher ups to deal with me. Instead, though, your lives aren't on the line like mine was. 

Believe it or not, there was a 'Baen' in my generation of villagemates. I was the 'Baen' once upon a time. Look at me now.. I am one of the most loyal Shinobi of Kirigakure and my allies. It's up you all though; I can't guide you through this path. You have to walk it yourselves and decide what you want."* - Wed Sep 09 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) hands her a scroll for Kai.* - Wed Sep 09 13:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's attention was revamped back to the frame of Jin, sizing him up a bit and listening to what he had to say. Through the monologue Tethys couldn't help but shut his eyes, not to sure disrespect or to imply he was drifting off, but to put give Jin his undivided hearing attention. Once the Genin was done speaking, Tethys gave an audible sigh.

"As I said before, Jin, a path has many curves. It goes from left to right in an instant, and then it straightens like an arrow. The most you can do is stick strictly on that one path, no looking back unless you're learning from the mistakes you made. Life isn't easy, that is a given.

You said you have no allies, right? That you don't consider any of us useless, but it's the fact that we don't know what you're thinking? Fine, let's go with that. Let's go with the fact that you're right. We don't know what you think. And let's go with the fact that the only person that needs to know what you're thinking is you and yourself. Your loyalty to the village; I never questioned that. You do what you have to do for the village, and that's appreciated.

None of you are disgraces. None of you show actions of being a disgrace and I hope when I dead and gone you're not disgraced by one another or the village as a whole. The point in me trying my hardest to assure that you all are safe and happy is the fact that I didn't have that growing up. I grew up in the era where Kirigakure was known for the cursed seven. Every three days seven people died.

You said you hate the path you're on. No one likes their path when things get tough and unbearable, but it's up to that person to continue moving forward until their sun shines and make the puddles of hardship dry up..

Long story short, it's up to you."* - Wed Sep 09 13:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released an audible yawn.* - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) punched Himura dead in his shit.* - Wed Sep 09 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took his usual stance, hands tucked in his pockets and a nonchalant lean to his frame. It's truly been a long time since Mizumi and him had fought, so he naturally suspected that his student had achieve worthy enough power to contend easily. A smirk formed on Tethys face as he watched the thick mist engulf the immediate area, he now understood why Mizumi suggested this place as the battlegrounds.

Nothing was said from Tethys, he only wanted to see how far Mizumi would go. Once the combinations from the elected Hogo were finished, Tethys pulled his hands out and formed a succession handseals; he synced them with his breathing and chakra molding. By time the mist was to fully cover the battlefield, Tethys would inhale through his nose, pucker his lips and exhale through his mouth. At that moment, he unleashed a gust of wind meant to make it easier on his self to see. Naturally, by logic, his opponents would feel the gust.* - Wed Sep 09 15:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The pace of this battle was intense right of the bat, something Tethys expect no less of from Mizumi after nearly six years without training the lad. Just like Mizumi, though, Tethys had a few new tricks up his sleeves; he didn't use them though. While stay true to his usual arsenal when it came to fighting Mizumi, Tethys allowed his chakra to moderately seep into the body of water. Tethys knew he wouldn't be able to effectively see or sense Mizumi in the clones, so he used the last known location of them from when he dispersed some of the mist to his advantage.

He poised his arms up, aiming his palms in the general directions of each Mizumi. While continuing to seep his chakra into the lake, Tethys would expel another powerful gust of wind. It's duty was to relinquish some of the mist while possibly dispelling the water shuriken.* - Wed Sep 09 15:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Soon.. Soon."

Tethys formed a single handseal, allowing his chakra to continue the process of seeping into the water below him. By this point and time most of the massive body would be filled with it. As the flames forced most of the mist to subside, Tethys was granted the ability to sense the general location of the remaining clothes and original Mizumi.

While continuing to charge his chakra, however, Tethys allowed a steady stream of thick syrup to poor out his mouth and covers his general area.

"You're going to have to try harder, Mizumi!"* - Wed Sep 09 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Soon.. Soon."

Tethys formed a single handseal, allowing his chakra to continue the process of seeping into the water below him. By this point and time most of the massive body would be filled with it. As the flames forced most of the mist to subside, Tethys was granted the ability to sense the general location of the remaining clones and original Mizumi.

One thing Tethys had to admit, though. Mizumi knew how to make one hell of a combination. Now that his vortex was merging with the flames, Tethys had to react quickly. He already formed the necessary handsel, the only thing left to do was battle off the blames the best he could. A torrent of water would shoot from his mouth, designed to only nullify blunt force of the explosion; his natural Ninjutsu Defense would kick in for the remaining effects.

At most Tethys would suffer some burns and crisped clothing.* - Wed Sep 09 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Seemed as though Mizumi truly didn't understand Tethys' level of sensing. He was already merging his own chakra into the lake and now that Mizumi was attempting to do the same, but with his body, it made things all that easier. By time the clone formed and readied itself to form the shuriken Tethys was on the move. "It's ready," he thought as he dashed forward.

The point of this dash was to make an attempt to oust speed the shuriken, but soon enough Tethys halted and just resorted to his basic reflex to evade them. Space was now formed between him and the two Mizumi's. "Come on, work with me here, chakra."* - Wed Sep 09 17:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Just like Mizumi stated, parts of the lake weren't coated in a layer of mist due to the fact that Tethys' chakra was already heavily infused with the body of water. Tethys has been charging his chakra for nearly four RP rounds now, so basically he had the entire lake to his control by this point. A smirk overcame him as he turned to face the only plausible location where Mizumi was in; where mist was slightly able to be formed.

With the forming of a set of handseals, Tethys would crouch and slam both his palms into the water; stopping when his hands were wrist deep in. "Water style," thought Tethys as he continued to concentrate. "Syrup trap jutsu!" The final words echoed within his mind as the entire lake turned into his own infused trap. Since Mizumi was now on top of the water surface, the only thing for him to think was that Tethys was just continuing to charge chakra, not knowing he already activating his jutsu.* - Wed Sep 09 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Stage two is ready," thought Tethys as he looked up and saw the clone dashing forward. A torrent of water is spewed from the clones mouth while a secondary weaponry type jutsu was formed in its midst, this was a unique combination. Tethys, reacting as fast as he could, would attempt to juke to the left, evading the attack all together.

"Tell me, Mizumi! Are you ready!? THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST MOVING MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE! FEEL IT, MIZUMI! FEEL THE WAVE OF A TRUE HOGO!" Tethys releases a battle cry of both chakra strain and slight pain as the massive lake of syrup began to shift. The entirety of the fucking lake began to fucking shift. Tethys formed the necessary handseals for his next jutsu.

At that very moment, from the end of the lake where Himura was standing to where Tethys was instantly raised. The size could be compared to that of a sky scraper in the imagination of those first witnessing Tethys use this jutsu. With haste, Tethys jumps and firmly planted his self on top of the tsunami, riding the devastating jutsu through the end. The destination? That was obvious.* - Wed Sep 09 18:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) saw Mizumi apparently dodge a tsunami. His chakra was wasted so he just walks off. "I quit, you win."* - Wed Sep 09 18:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's jutsu failed, wasted chakra for no reason. "Yeah, I'm done."* - Wed Sep 09 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked his hands in his pockets, panting and exasperating from the massive chakra that the combination of two jutsus entailed. He walks over to the knocked out body of Mizumi, grabbing him by the collar and throwing him over his shoulder. Tethys knew the answer he was going to give Mizumi once the kid woke up, and quite frankly, he didn't know how Mizumi was going to take it.

The Hogo family-head walks back to the main group of people, setting Mizumi down on the bank and waited for the guy to wake up.* - Wed Sep 09 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) created a clone and made him do that shit.* - Wed Sep 09 19:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave a shrug. "That exhausted the hell out of my chakra."* - Wed Sep 09 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) walked over to the young Hogo, dragging him by the collar. "Alright, Mizumi. Lets go."* - Wed Sep 09 19:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took in a slow, deep, breath. It was that time of night where he could squeeze in a quick training session. Anyone that were around at the time could tell that this wasn't the best time try and communicate with the Hogo, the look on his face said that loud and clear. As he exhaled the breath he sucked in, Tethys would begin stretching to loosen his muscles; the last thing he needed was to have a Charlie horse mid-session.* - Wed Sep 09 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) ' training started with the stretching and slowly transitioned into the main course. After completing the last stretch, Tethys would eye the area to place mental checkpoints. He starts with the Shopkeeper then the farthest most bench. "Alright, Tethys; you can do this," said Tethys as he formed a single handseal and began concentrating his chakra.* - Wed Sep 09 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) didn't pay much mind to anyone else at the moment, he had to get this small bit of training in no matter what before the day was over. With his chakra now swelling and its circulation speed picking up in pace, Tethys gave it a sudden push. The end result of doing this was the obvious, he Body Flickered. His former position was replaced with a puff of smoke as he appeared by the shopkeeper. Tethys didn't end things there, though. Despite his wary state of mind, he tough through and gave his chakra another push; this time around he was by the farthest left bench.* - Wed Sep 09 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , by nature, was dizzy from the double succession of Body Flickering. He staggers back a bit, tipping over on the bench and taking a sit to gather both his mind and breath. "D-Damn, still takes a lot to do this." After a while, despite knowing he had to rest a little bit longer, Tethys stood back up formed the same handseal once more.* - Wed Sep 09 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , this time around, would take things easy. He first focuses his chakra circulation and synced it with his breathing, giving his self the needed concentration. After a minute or so, Tethys would vanish behind a puff of smoke; he reappeared by the shopkeeper. Instead of Flickering right off the bat, though, he waits a few seconds before going back to his original spot. "Alright.. That's enough for today."* - Wed Sep 09 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed a single handseal, summoning the Hiramekarei from behind a cloud of smoke.* - Thu Sep 10 00:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) had been standing in that one place for the longest, allowing boredom to rein a tyrannical fist over him. If it wasn't for Jin, the savior, Tethys would've most likely stood there for a few days before remembering that he truly did have a few jutsus to work. With a sigh of relief, the Hogo family member dug into his back pouch and takes out a few shuriken. He opens his palms, having the metallic objects rest in the middle, and began concentrating.

Due to the fact that Tethys had begun the process of advancing his wind style arsenal, the requirements of this jutsu was off base easier. On base, though, it was something that required a lot more attentiveness than the previous jutsus. With enough concentration, however, the shurikens should be granted a layer of wind; resulting in it rotating on command. Tethys focused his self, allowing the necessary amount of chakra to swell in his palm

Soon enough the shuriken was slowly levitate off of his palm, occasionally descending back due to the lack of proper chakra output. The task was strenuous, beads of sweat dripping down his face. An exasperating sigh came from Tethys as he refreshes his mind and chakra output, causing the shuriken to steadily levitate and rotate. A smirk overcame the Hogo at this point as he slowly moves his arms around; getting the proper feel of the required amount of chakra he needed to use the jutsu.

Second stage of the technique was to figure out a way to launch it at will, effectively making the jutsu all that more dangerous. Using the bench as a target, Tethys would raise his arm a bit and aim the shuriken. Upon doing so, Tethys would allow his chakra to engulf the shuriken once more, watching it levitate and rotate. With a quick push of his chakra, he'd launch it forward and watch it soar.* - Thu Sep 10 07:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's yawn was cut short when he caught a glimpse of Kirie standing in front of him, "..Whoa.."* - Thu Sep 10 10:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) hands her a different scroll. "Forget about that wood mission, you seem to be struggling with it."* - Thu Sep 10 10:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) smirked a bit, watching Ken approach Violet.* - Thu Sep 10 12:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Happen to know any blacksmiths? - Thu Sep 10 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: There was a armorsmith roaming around here once upon a time, but I don't know what happened to her. - Thu Sep 10 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) untucks his right hand from his pants pockets and snaps his fingers, allowing a sudden cloud of smoke to spawn in his palm. By time the smoke cleared, a mission scroll was present. "Ken was it..? I'll start you off with this mission."* - Thu Sep 10 13:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) repeats the same process for Mizumi, handing him the scroll in the end.* - Thu Sep 10 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Mainly one that involves assassination. - Thu Sep 10 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) extended his right arm, taking grasp of the items being offered to him. His eyes narrowed a bit, the sight of the money reward confusing him. "Are you implying you're giving back your money payment for the sake of the village?"* - Thu Sep 10 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) placed a hand on Kirie's shoulder, insisting that she calmed down. A sigh came from the fill-in Mizukage as he took a single step forward, maneuvering his way between the female and outsider. Tethys recalls seeing Seisuke before, but hadn't engaged in a thorough conversation; suppose that's going to change right now. "Your search for the Mizukage is over; how may I help you?"* - Thu Sep 10 21:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes wandered from one guard to the other, giving them a slight chuckle. He held a high respect standard for the Gezo, that was a given, but this kid was doing nothing to help the situation at hand. Nevertheless, respect was shown for Seisuke. "My shinobi do what is required to protect their kingdom. Customs are different here than it is in the Gezo Empire. I assure you, though, if you were to state that you're a Gezo Representative they'd show you the respect you feel you deserve; might. Nevertheless, you have my attention. What is it you need of me?"* - Thu Sep 10 21:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) couldn't help bu chuckle at Seisuke's words, they were that of a true gold-spoon born child. Still, though, Tethys held that level of respect for the Gezo heir. "Our customs are controversial. We take after a samurai-like life while staying loyal to our Shinobi side. Each of my shinobi are required to learn the basics of using a Tanto before being granted a promotion to Genin. We are loyal to the Gezo as well, even taking on direct missions from the Empire every now and then. I am a Private and old man Hassan that dove into a standing slumber is a Sergeant."* - Thu Sep 10 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) tucked his hands in his pockets, hearing the words of Baen. A simple chuckle is released from Tethys, showing no intention of reprimanding the Genin. It was almost like Tethys was enjoying this. The fill-in Mizukage's attention was still fixated on Seisuke, waiting for any more questions the heir might harbor.* - Thu Sep 10 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes eventually wandered off of the renowned Prince of Gezo, slowly falling upon the frame of Baen. On the Hogo's face, however, was an amused smirk. There was respect heard in Tethys' voice when speaking to Seisuke, but his actions and facial setting showed the opposite; Tethys could easily be judged as being sarcastic. Still, though, nothing more was said from the fill-in Mizukage until Seisuke managed to register the information provided to him; nothing out loud at least.* - Thu Sep 10 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) gave Seisuke a nod of understanding, the request being doable. Knowing that the Gezo were rather wealthy due to the supplies they fund the world with, Tethys decided to possibly push the matter a bit. "Very well, that will be a million yen."* - Thu Sep 10 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a true chuckle of amusement. "You don't seem to understand Heir of the Gezo Empire. Kirigakure was recently in war, having majority of our troops decimated. Of course we managed to win the war, but still, funds to reimburse my military power would be magnificent. Keep in mind, this all originated from Gezo granted Hassan and me the mission to take out Zetsumo and his forces. We successfully did that with the battle front of Sunagakure and Kumogakure. Of course a reward for such an accomplishment would suffice our needs. If anything, one million is a modest request. Besides, you're royalty; you must have more than enough money."* - Thu Sep 10 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released yet another chuckle, watching the guards stand their feet. Just like a true savage, which Tethys was, the Hogo took a half step forward to meet the guards and Gezo Heir like a man. "Our mission, from the Gezo, was to eliminate Amegakure's forces. Zetsumo's death was a personal affair that the Kage's came to a decision about at a summit. We did our part in the mission for Gezo, so payment is due. Hell, Kirigakure is the only village that shows elegance to the Gezo Empire. Unlike the other nations that spit at the name of the Gezo then go crawling for supplies when they go through tough times."* - Thu Sep 10 22:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The smirk on Tethys' face subsided, but not into a look of anger. A wide grin crept on his face, revealing a maniacal side of Tethys that only a few had witnessed. Hell, the most people saw was Tethys' angry side; this was a completely different case. "Haha," chuckled Tethys as he pupils became engorged. "Hahaha," the chuckle continued; the hair on Tethys' head began standing on end. Anyone that knew of Tethys history with his primal transformation knew that once he's in this form, there was little to nothing that could stop him other than the seal placed on him by Noriko; she was also the only one that could activate that seal.

"Hogetsu! It's time, haha! It's time, my brother. IT'S TIME THE GEZO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE WAVE OF A HOGO!" The thunderous voice of Tethys, with an evil amusement hinged in, clapped through the courtyard. By this point Tethys' pupils vanished from existence and were replaced with nothing but the whites of his eyes. At that very moment, with no more words being said, Tethys sent a devastating punch for the guard residing at the right of Seisuke. Whether or not the heir, or the remaining guard, retaliated, Tethys would bring his pupil-less eyes to glare at the boy.* - Thu Sep 10 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: ( (*Ossa, Baen his jaw dropped to the floor as he contemplated the insult. It was clear that Tethys wouldn't just let this slide, and if he did...well Baen would probably be too shocked to even say a word. In the meantime, he glanced towards Jin, and maintained his stupified look. "Yo...." He took a step to the left as shit was about to get hectic. "He about to kill a Gezo heir. He about to become the most infamous man alive. He's about to pull a luffy." He thought to himself. *) ) - Thu Sep 10 23:22:14 2015
