<br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) waited the side effects out once more, grunting in annoyance. He found that this technique could be extremely useful in battle at some point and time, but not with this troublesome effect. Tethys takes a jab at that the tree he used as leverage, frustration overcoming him slightly. Hell, if anything Tethys was more determined to quickly perfect this jutsu before his next life or death battle; knowing Zetsumo's group that'd be too close of a time lapse for comfort. Once the effect wore off of Tethys he stands up straight and readied his self. This time, however, rather than locking his knees and loosening his ankles, he does the inverse. With his ankles now acting as a crutch in stiffness rather than actual ankles, Tethys hoped to possibly add more power to the Flicker technique; this was all in an attempt to find a method of the technique that best suited him in comfort ability. Of course, though, that attempt only made Tethys apply more than the necessary amount of chakra behind the technique. Once he sent the burst of chakra out, his instincts over his network kicked in and forced him to expand more chakra than normal to compensate for the locked ankles. By time Tethys arrived at he previous location he was even more nauseated and dizzy. "D-Damn it, yo'," he manages to mutter as he sat his self down and held his head.* - Thu Sep 17 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The effects of Body Flicker was easily comparable to that of a bad hangover after a night in the town. Still, though, progress was being made; even if that progress was so minuscule that it could barely be identified. Compared to the very first time Tethys used the technique, this previous time was a major step forward. Nevertheless, the effects afterwards were still a bitch. Tethys makes it back to his feet once more, letting go of his head and centering his mind. Rather than thinking about the technique as a quick power rush, maybe having the mindset that it was as much of an ally as his Black Blade and fellow shinobi. With a deep inhale, and concentration of chakra, Tethys formed the necessary handseal. Upon doing so, while placing an image of the tree he wants to dash toward, Tethys pushed his swelling chakra out. After doing so, with both his knees and ankles slightly loosened, he found that the chakra used was lessened this time around. The effect, though, was a damn bitch. He doubles over, placing a hand on the side of his head and an arm around his stomach. If the tree wasn't where it was Tethys would've easily tipped over as he resorted to leaning shoulder first against the trunk. "I refuse to let such a skill claim me as its bitch, I'm going to master it and I'm going to add it to my fighting arsenal," thought Tethys as he waited things out.* - Thu Sep 17 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || "Alright; so it's clear that if I'm tense that this damn technique have heavier side effects. It's also clear that if I loosen myself too much that I'd out speed myself. My best option is to just relax and find that midpoint," thought Tethys. He takes in a slow, deep, breath and exhales it after a few minutes; that provided him the ability to center his mind and body. His right hand formed the necessary handseal, acting as a trigger to help him circulate his chakra flow. Tethys closes his eyes and allowed that same chakra to slowly pick up pace, surging through his network at an alarming rate. With the image of his destination in mind, the Hogo pushed the chakra outward. The push of chakra was basically on an expert level at this point; progress Tethys, progress. With the burst of chakra reigning out, Tethys allowed his body's tension to react accordingly; finding that midpoint where he didn't try to reduce, or enhance, his chakra to comply with his body. Instead, Tethys allowed his body to comply with the necessary chakra level. That being said, with his body now in tuned with his chakra, Tethys Flicker back to the bank of the beach. Normally, he'd double over from the effects of the technique, but this time around he merely staggers back a bit whilst slowly shaking his head to regain his piece of mind.* - Thu Sep 17 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's training with Body Flicker has been rather successful thus far. He managed to wear off the intense side effects from before and replace it with a subtle disorientation that could be worked off in a minute or so. Still, though, Tethys found that "minute" to be extremely crucial in the midst of battle; that left him with the idea to continue practicing the technique. With a deep intake of breath, Tethys began the process.* - Thu Sep 17 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest)  || "Alright, so if I can train my body to consecutively then I won't have to worry about these damn side effects. I really hope it's not going to be as much of a pain as Jin said it is." During his little pep talk, which was missing the actual 'pep', Tethys began preparing his body for the physically straining feats. To start off, Tethys walks over to the bank of the beach and turns to face the usual tree he used as a checkpoint.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest)  || With a single handseal, and a swift burst of chakra, Tethys synced his loosed body with his movements. A puff of white smoke replaced Tethys at the bank of the beach, leaving Tethys to successfully reside at his checkpoint. Still, though, Tethys forced his self to refrain from staggering back in disorientation. With another burst of charka and syncing of his body, Tethys was replaced with yet another puff of smoke. His destination was for the bank of the beach, but due to him not giving himself anytime to recuperate; Tethys only made it half way.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The Hogo drops to his knees, panting to catch his breath and holding his head with one hand. The dizziness resulting in the rapid succession of the Body Flicker technique only proved that his body was not fully used to the intense speed. It took the same length of time to regain stability as it did when he first started using Body Flicker; this was the true torture of training to be the greatest. Still though, Tethys makes it to his feet and waits out the effects, slowly moving his head from left and right to ease the spinning of his brain.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Determination was one hell of a drug for Tethys. Mix that with his stubbornness and you'll get a possibly suicidal maniac when it came to training. Before his head could fully gather itself Tethys was on the move again, planting his feet firmly on the ground while loosening his remaining body up to comply with the push of chakra he was about to exert. The required handseal was formed and Tethys pushed his self. Following said push came the usual push of smoke that signaled Tethys successfully used the technique, resulting in him residing at the bank of the beach. Again, though, without letting go of the handseal and pushing another burst of chakra forward, Tethys vanishes behind a cloud of smoke. His destination, this time, was by the tree but he was laid out on the ground panting and struggling to keep grasp of his piece of mind.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took in a slow, deep, breath. It was that time of night where he could squeeze in a quick training session. Anyone that were around at the time could tell that this wasn't the best time try and communicate with the Hogo, the look on his face said that loud and clear. As he exhaled the breath he sucked in, Tethys would begin stretching to loosen his muscles; the last thing he needed was to have a Charlie horse mid-session.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's training started with the stretching and slowly transitioned into the main course. After completing the last stretch, Tethys would eye the area to place mental checkpoints. He starts with the Shopkeeper then the farthest most bench. "Alright, Tethys; you can do this," said Tethys as he formed a single handseal and began concentrating his chakra.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) didn't pay much mind to anyone else at the moment, he had to get this small bit of training in no matter what before the day was over. With his chakra now swelling and its circulation speed picking up in pace, Tethys gave it a sudden push. The end result of doing this was the obvious, he Body Flickered. His former position was replaced with a puff of smoke as he appeared by the shopkeeper. Tethys didn't end things there, though. Despite his wary state of mind, he tough through and gave his chakra another push; this time around he was by the farthest left bench.* - Thu Sep 17 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , by nature, was dizzy from the double succession of Body Flickering. He staggers back a bit, tipping over on the bench and taking a sit to gather both his mind and breath. "D-Damn, still takes a lot to do this." After a while, despite knowing he had to rest a little bit longer, Tethys stood back up formed the same handseal once more.* - Thu Sep 17 07:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , this time around, would take things easy. He first focuses his chakra circulation and synced it with his breathing, giving his self the needed concentration. After a minute or so, Tethys would vanish behind a puff of smoke; he reappeared by the shopkeeper. Instead of Flickering right off the bat, though, he waits a few seconds before going back to his original spot. "Alright.. That's enough for today."* - Thu Sep 17 07:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) stood before everyone, a sigh releasing from his visage. It was that time where he started his progressive training once again, yippee. To start off, whilst continuing his conversation with Jin, Tethys begins stretching his legs; he bends one leg at a time, extending it after a minute or so, and then repeats the process with the opposite leg. Once he was done, he starts looking around for his check points.* - Thu Sep 17 07:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) had used the far left bench for a checkpoint last time, so it was only natural that he used something else this time around. He continues to move his head from left to right, surveying the area. After a few seconds of looking, Tethys decides to just pick the right post in front of the building as the first checkpoint. The second checkpoint would obviously be his current location.* - Thu Sep 17 07:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed the handseal necessary for his training, allowing his chakra to knead and swell within his body. Within mere seconds, after pushing his chakra outward, Tethys was replaced with a cloud of smoke. Like usual, his new location was identified as the right post in front of the Academy's door. Once there, without any hesitation, Tethys allowed his chakra to burst forth once again; his new location being his former.* - Thu Sep 17 07:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) has yet to get over the side effects of shunshining in succession. It drained him both physically and mentally, having him exhausted and dizzy as hell. Still, though, he didn't let up on his training. He staggers back a bit, panting for air and attempting to catch his breath. Not wanting to give up, he straightens up the best he could while keeping the handseal woven.* - Thu Sep 17 07:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) , for the last time of the day, bursts his chakra out. This time around he didn't make to the post, but half way there. From behind a cloud of smoke was his laid out body, his chest heaving and audible panting escaping his lips. "D-Damn, why does this take so much," he asks his self out loud as he laid there on the ground.* - Thu Sep 17 07:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's training was going fairly well if you were to ask the Hogo. He was getting the hang of repetitive shunshining, ridding himself of the side effects little by little. Still, though, Tethys was suffering greatly. His mind and body was just getting used to the entire process, so naturally it'll take time. Nevertheless, Tethys was determined to fulfill the requirements just to use the Flicker technique effectively.* - Thu Sep 17 07:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) stands to his feet, allowing his mind to set in place his checkpoint; a spot next to Setsuna. He was still wobbly on his stance, showing proof that despite his efforts he was still pushing his self. With a lack of care for his own wellbeing, he forms the necessary handseal and prepared his chakra. While amplifying his chakra circulation, Tethys loosened the tension in his muscles and pushed the chakra network forward.* - Thu Sep 17 07:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's placement was instantly changed. He arrived at the first check up with ease, but not without the well-known side effects. Seeing as though Tethys wasn't fully recuperated from the last training session, Tethys found himself leaning against the buildings wall. Refusal was apparent on Tethys; he keeps the handseal woven and began charging his chakra once more. He was then replaced with another cloud of smoke.* - Thu Sep 17 07:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was located at his original spot once more, laid out on the ground and returning to his panting. He wasn't exactly exhausted just yet, but his mind was spinning endlessly. "Oh.. my fucking," he murmurs as he sits up, tightly clenching his eyes shut. "There is no giving up with these side effects, damn it," he grunted as he holds his head.* - Thu Sep 17 07:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) decided that that was enough, no more for the day. He continues to heave, allowing his mind to catch up with his body. "This damn jutsu isn't going to hold me back," spoke Tethys out loud to his self. He slowly shook his head a bit, trying to shake off the rust.* - Thu Sep 17 07:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) knew sitting around here waiting on Amegakure troops to attack was pointless; there was work that needed to be done and he's giving his allies time to train and relax at their own pace. Now that he was the Mizukage, Tethys knew that picking up the ball and carrying the team when they were down and out was his duty; he took pride in that. In his mind, there was nothing wrong with him taking the weight, hoisting it on his shoulders and powerhousing forward with no regrets; a feat that only a special few with the will to Ride or Die with his allies could accomplish.

Tethys starts off with ordering a two hundred poison bombs from the weapon salesman, carefully placing them in a sack. He finishes up with ordering the same amount of kunai's as he did poison bombs. From there, after also placing the metallic objects in a sack, he walked off to the middle of the main square. Once there, he gently placed the sack of poison bombs down on the ground, making sure not to spring the damn things. Tethys, himself, sat on the ground, placing the sack of kunai's on the opposite side of him.

Following the placements of the sacks, Tethys takes out two hundred or so sheets of paper; they could be identified as the same papers used for explosive tags, but they were blank. With a slight sigh, knowing that what he had planned was going to take a while to complete, Tethys takes out a small ink tube and pen. He dips the tip of the pen into the ink and began writing on a sheet of paper. What he was writing wasn't exactly words, but a formula. Upon finishing his formula, Tethys opened the sack of poison bombs takes one out. He places it on the sheet of paper and formed a set of handseals.

Signaling the sealing of the poison bomb was a small shroud of smoke. From there, Tethys took that sheet of paper, with the formula on it, and wrapped it around the hilt of a kunai. This process was repeated several times, supplying Tethys with fifty trap kunai's. For security reasons, Tethys pulls out a scroll and took grasp of his pen once more. He dips the tip inside the ink tube and began the process of drawing another formula within the page of the scroll. Upon doing so, after doing the initial handseals to actually set the formula, Tethys began stacking the trap kunai's within the page; on top of the seal.

Handseals were strung in compliance of the stacking kunai's; a shroud of smoke signaling the sealing of those kunai's into the page. Thus far, Tethys had formed two formulas' that tied in to one another. Following the last sealing of the trap kunai's was Tethys dipping his pen inside the ink tube once more. Yet again, as the last seal for this scroll, he draws a formula on the raveled scroll front. Said formula would be the initial trigger for the remaining seals.

The first formula, on the raveled scroll, was to give the wielder of said scroll the ability to unravel the scroll through chakra means. Said trigger had a timer, granting the wielder enough time to chuck the scroll if need be. Once the scroll was unraveled by means of the initial seal, a spring within the second seal, where the kunai's were located, would launch said kunai's out. The immediate area will be barraged with fifty kunai's. Of course, with the final formula where the poison bombs were located, Tethys allowed the second seal, within the scroll itself, to act as the trigger for the third seal. Meaning, once the kunai's were unsealed by means of the second seal that was activated by the first seal, the third seal would start it's timer. Once the timer was up, the poison bomb would be unsealed and activated.

This was a three part supplementary project. Seal one led to the trigger for seal two seal two's trigger activation led to seal three's trigger. Each seal had their own set timer to give the initial wielder enough time to follow things up. The handseal needed to activate the initial seal was the same to activate an explosive tag manually.

The process of sealing the remaining poisons and kunai's were repeated until everything was done. The same exact traps were set and the same exact intentions were upheld. Tethys had spent a few days plotting this plan, to him it was fool proof.* - Thu Sep 17 10:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yan. - Thu Sep 17 12:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed a single handseal, spawning a Kirigakure Chuunin vest. He holds it out to Yan, offering it to the boy. "Along with your promotion to Chuunin, I'm entrusting you with a mission when we meet battle front again."* - Thu Sep 17 12:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Hmmm.... I haven't even touched the field of battle yet, and I was chuunin before then. I did see his battle with Lera, so its no surprise that hes useful there. - Thu Sep 17 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) folds his arms back across his chest. His eyes close momentarily, allowing his mind to wander for a bit. "I've created for scroll traps. It's a three trigger trap that leads to a barrage of kunai's that are wrapped in tags. Those tags have a seal drawn on them that will spring, and activate, poison bombs. The first initial trigger is sprung by the wielder of the scrolls. The activation of the first seal triggers the second seal, the activation of the second seal, known as the seal of kunai's, leads to the third seal leading to the activation of poison bombs." Tethys' eyes opened, fixating themselves on Yan.

"Long story short, it's a trap that leads to physical damage and internal damage. You, being as sly as you are on the battle field, are being trusted to wield one of these scrolls and sneak it into the middle of Zetsumo's army. Form the handseal to activate the first seal and get out of there. Each seal has a short timer to assure the safety of the activator, but also the unexpected death of the enemy." With that being said, Tethys takes out a silver scroll and offers it to Yan. "Bear in mind, you have the free will to decline this mission."* - Thu Sep 17 12:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) took in a deep breath, exhaling it once the need for fresh air dawned on him. Yan stood side by side with Tethys, earning the respect of the Mizukage with great ease. Tethys understood that this may be a suicide mission for them both, but it was necessary to assure the safety of his village and country; a rather Spartanous mindset. Just as Yan prepared his self to depart with his scroll, Tethys formed a single handseal and allowed six shadow clones to spawn behind shrouds of smoke. A single clone took a stand next to Yan, already knowing the mission at hand.

Tethys paced his self, along with the remaining clones, northward to where the other camps for Amegakure's troops resided. Tethys hands one of the scroll to the remaining three clones and told them to await his orders. From there, Tethys and the clone that stepped forward made their ways to the other side of the body of water. With haste, the original Tethys launches the scroll in the midst of this northern camp and formed a single handseal. His chakra was already infused with the scroll so it was a matter of activation. The clone allied with Tethys began the process of weaving his own set of handseals at this point. By time the poisonous gases were triggered, the clone would unleash a Great Breakthrough into the troops, spreading the gases far and wide.

The clone residing with Yan, at this point, managed to tunnel freely beneath ground. While Yan took charge and his portion of the troops, the clone would prepare his handseals and wait until Yan sprung the trap to unleash his own Great Breakthrough.* - Thu Sep 17 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) found his self being trapped, the Amegakure troops fighting off the poisonous gas the best they could for the sake of capturing the Mizukage. The second Tethys was captured the clones he left behind knew something went wrong due to the fact that the Great Breakthrough was sounded off. With haste, on their part, they would dash to the battle field whilst forming their own handseals in compliance with the situation.

By time the clones came to the front lines, they would unleash an allied Great Breakthrough, combing the jutsus to double its power and become more effective.

Tethys, the original, would use that as an attempt to get away.* - Thu Sep 17 17:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) blinked a few times, hearing the demands from Alice. He couldn't help but chuckled at the fact that a female, a newly graduated female of the Academy, was putting such orders in. Nevertheless, the spunk emitting from Alice was admirable, he might as well shrug it off for now.

"Well, walking on water is as easy as it can get really. I suppose you already know how to manipulate your chakra on some extent, so performing this miniscule feat should be relatively easy; unless you're a complete dunce that is." Tethys formed the universal handseal that is regularly used to concentrate ones chakra. In an attempt to mime the process of circulating his chakra, he takes in an audible breath and exhales at the same volume of the initial suction. "Allow your chakra to circulate throughout your body, get a good feel of things. Upon doing so, while getting familiar with your own circulatory system, allow said chakra to seep to the soles of your feet. Keep a constant flow and allow yourself to advance on the water."

That being said, Tethys walks on to the surface of the lake and looked at Alice.* - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) watched Alice's progression intently; giving her a nod for each step she took in an attempt to push herself closer the goal. Once she obtained said goal, he gave her applause of felicitations.

""Good job, kid."* - Thu Sep 17 23:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) said nothing to no one. He had no reason to talk, nor did he have a reason to explain his reasoning for being here. Blue Fox, on eye contact with everyone around, formed a quick string of handseals. Upon doing so, while inhaling through his nose and puckering his lips, he allowed chakra to knead within his lungs. Afterwards, he'd unleash a devastating gust of wind.* - Fri Sep 18 00:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) wasted no time on seizing a follow up attack. He formed a single handseal once more, allowing two shrouds of smoke to spawn on both his sides. From behind them came two carbon clones that mirrored his strength and looks. The bore their own blades and both respectively unsheathed them. Tethys, the original, placed his main focus on Aiyana, allowing the pivoted female to have close to any retaliation as he unsheathed his own sword and slashed it in a vertical manner; starting from above her head to below her pelvic area. He surely hoped to chop her in half.

The two clones seized forward as well, but not to attack Hideki and the third-wheel female. Their intent was to block off any interference in the original's attempt.* - Fri Sep 18 00:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed, seeing that the female truly didn't  have a counter to his attack. A clear sign of holding back emitted from Tethys as he stopped his slash just before it was to penetrate the head of Aiyana. Instead, however, Tethys allowed his free hand to shoot forth and grab her by the collar. At that moment, in only an attempt to save, yes save, Aiyan's life, Tethys hoisted her up and shot forward. His awareness of the Raikage's attack was keen due to his ability to sense.

Just like the original, the clones followed through with stringing their own handseals together, most likely doubling the speed at wish Ushinawa was able to weave his. With the molding of their own chakra system, they would combine their efforts in sending a massive wave of water toward the dragon flame to hopefull negate and overpower it.* - Fri Sep 18 00:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) couldn't really do much when it came to Aiyana, a feat that he should've known that he wouldn't be able to accomplish. There wind enhanced fire came crashing forth, holding no one that weren't able to get out of the way as ransom. Tethys, on the other hand, thought on his feet. Knowing that the advanced fire would cause a good amount of burns on him, he did the next best thing.

Let's back track a bit. Ushinawa launched the fire-based attack from the initiatives of this battle, leaving Tethys in a tight spot to even charge toward Aiyana for the fatal blow. That being said, the two clones had a small timespan to form strings of handseals and unleash a wave of water forward to combat the wind aided fire. They knew that they'd be overpowered when the ending of the clash was sounded, but it was enough time for Tethys to forget about Aiyana's safety getting out of the blunt explosion.* - Fri Sep 18 01:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) was in a tough situation at this point and time. Now that he escaped the battle for the most part, Ushinawa was still on his ass attempting to finish off the job. Still, though, Tethys had a few tricks up his sleeves. He formed a single handseal while still making the attempt to haul ass, allowing a shroud of smoke to manifest alongside him. The clone knew what the deal was from the get go, stringing together a set of handseals and using his self as a shield for the original to get away.

Just as the handseals for the clone were complete, he'd stop his dash alongside Tethys and turn to face the oncoming lightning. With a large exhale, another Great Breakthrough, from the clone's chakra reserves, would launch to negate the lightning.* - Fri Sep 18 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) was having no luck with just getting Ushinawa off his back. The Uchiha was fully in his range of sensing, giving him the ability to think of every way out of this as he can. The clone Tethys set watched as Ushinawa used yet another Dragon Flame to lead an assault, the same counter was placed. The clone formed the necessary handseals, molding what chakra he had left in his own reserves, to unleash a torrent of water forward. Just like the previous clones, this one put up a good battle, but it was soon overwhelmed; he managed to take out the blunt force though.

Meanwhile, the original formed yet another handseal to spawn more clones, determined to use them to counter as much as possible until he was home free. One of the new clones, this time around, stopped to battle on the next incoming attack of Ushinawa while the remaining clone ran alongside the original.* - Fri Sep 18 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) took advantage of the halt in attacks, not even looking back to see what was going on. Behind massive steam and debris, Tethys slipped into the ground and make an escape while having his clone continue to run on foot as a distraction. There was no room for Tethys to make a mistake at this point and time.* - Fri Sep 18 02:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) || Things went from bad to worse at the arrival of Zetsumo. The clone sensed the immense power of the war God, sending sheer shiver up his spine. Tethys, on the other hand, used his magnetic sensing from the hiding like a mole technique to aide him in his efforts to get away. That being said, from when Zetsumo first unleashed great breakthrough, Tethys would enter his more primal state to increase his overall speed and tunnel deeper and more southern rather than following the trail of his clone.

The clone, on the other hand, had to do everything within his power to fend off Zetsumo while letting his creator break free. To his best efforts, the clone would form an handseal and Body Flicker more out and away from the original's general location.* - Fri Sep 18 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) had to think tactfully at this point. His life was on the line and quick frankly it was a matter of desperation. Tethys, formed a single handseal, using the space given to him from tunneling, and formed another shadow behind him. From there, the clone above ground would continue to sacrifice himself for the cause; he forms another handseal and goes to shunshin just outside the radius of the bamboo-thingy. His goal, as stated, was just to continue deceiving Zetsumo, and now the Earth Mask.

The second clone, below ground with Tethys, would break off away from the original Tethys and tunnel upward and ready itself to be exposed once the earth mask managed to kill off the first clone. Basically, the second clone was lying in wait while Clone 1 was suffering more dire effects from flickering again.

Tethys, the original, would continue to break away in an attempt to get free.* - Fri Sep 18 03:21:36 2015

The second clone, below ground with Tethys, would break off away from the original Tethys and tunnel upward and away to expose itself to the Earth Grudge and Zetsumo. With efforts to continue the distraction game, the clone would begin the process of forming a string of handseals and unleash a river made of mud toward Zetsumo's general location. It wasn't damage zetsumo, but to sap up what water it could to help cushion the lightning grenade.

Tethys, on the other hand, just continued hauling ass.* - Fri Sep 18 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) || The clone used to be an evasive aspect was all in vain, Tethys had to get out of here one way or another. At the feeling of more substances being summoned forth, Tethys knew he had to unlock a transformation that he rarely ever used. With his attempt to continue progressing forward, he flips the switch within his body. From there, his speed and Taijutsu ability increased to higher levels; in this case, he needed the speed.

The clone left behind would turn to Zetsumo, forming a set of handseals and allowing his own bank of chakra to mold. The plan was to prevent the rest of those masks, so with the earth grudge's attention fixated on the original Tethys, he unleashes a power gust of wind to prevent Zetsumo from launching the remaining masks the best he can.

With his new found speed, Tethys would figure that staying underground would be too dangerous at this point so he resurfaces and continues progress.* - Fri Sep 18 04:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) was surely in a tough situation at this point and time. The only thing he could think of doing was forming a single handseal and allowing his chakra to expand on a mass scale once more. As the earth grudges continued to close in on Tethys, a spawn of 10 shadow clones would stand guard for the original. They knew that that'd meet utter destruction, but the point was just give Tethys that bit of chance.

As they spawned, running along side their creator, they already knew what the deal was. Five formed a quick succession of handseals, watching intently as the Wind/Fire grudges combined their powers together to unleash a massive attack. In retaliation, All five would spew out a massive torrent of water, easily comparing to the size of a tsunami. The remaining five, having to deal with the lightning as it was shot forth, would string their own handseals in unison with the first five shadow clones, sending off a powerful gust of wind to battle the Earth Flash. They knew that they'd be overpowered, but quite frankly it was all just to absorb as much of blunt damage as possible.

Tethys, on the other hand, would make an attempt to continue advancing forth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) s punch didn't do as much as he hoped, but the fact that the dome went down was more than enough for him to make another attempt. With a quick succession of handseals, while taking a page out of naruto's book and continuing his top speed running, Tethys jumped as high as he could into the air and spawned two Shadow Clones.

The first shadow clone spawned below Tethys, supplying him as quick stepping stool; giving Tethys that mid-air jump type tactic. The second Clone spawned beside Tethys, gripping him as fast as he can and chucking the Hogo away. Now, the Earth Grudges weren't forgotten, with the rampaging flames making their presence known, the first clone that was used as a mere stepping stool would form a string of handseals and just send a regular raging waves forward; the second clone 'hoping' to do the same after chucking his creator forward.* - Fri Sep 18 05:38:08 2015

Still, his mindset of living to fight another day was steering his car. Determination allowed him to progress further, but soon enough a massive explosion signaled his possibly death. A mix between lightning and fire sprang forth and collided with Tethys' body.

Tethys, as a result, was shot forward; his body sizzling from the electrical surges and his half crisped skin proving that he came back from an hellacious battle. The impact in which he landed on the ground would fracture several bones in his body, allowing for both an internal and external damage set. Still, though, with half consciousness, Tethys struggles to his feet with the aide of his mountain sides and pushed forward.* - Fri Sep 18 06:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Blue Fox(Uptown Realest) wasn't a coward, he was far from it. Running away from this battle started long before it even started, something that Tethys desperately wanted to solve in the midst of war, but surely everyone's life must come to an end. The pace at which Tethys has been going to escape death proved to only last for so long, so once making it to a certain distance he turns to meet his destruction. He digs into his pockets, taking grasp of the communication device that every Kirigakure shinobi harbored. Since he was the Mizukage, his radio connected to all the speakers of Kirigakure. He pressed down on the required button and yelled is final battle cry.

"I am Tethys of the Hogo, damn it! I refuse to make the likes of you force me to throw away my honor and pride, you damn monsters! Here I stand, ready to dine in hell with my fallen brethren. You, creatures of Zetsumo, and Zetsumo himself, strike no fear in this body! I AM.. I AM TETHYS OF THE HOGO!"

From this point on, he unsheathed his blade, allowing his self to dash into the electrical flames and bombardment of earth bullets. As if a last attempt to redeem his self, Tethys started swinging with all his might; he even occasionally smacked away an earth bullet. Still, however, eventually he was jellified and evaporated, leaving nothing of his existence behind. The black blade would've eventually be destroyed  due to the overwhelming effects of the bullets and over all jutsus.* - Fri Sep 18 06:34:27 2015
