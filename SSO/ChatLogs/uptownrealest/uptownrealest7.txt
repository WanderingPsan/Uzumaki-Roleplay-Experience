<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes narrowed, no words said as Koeki darted forward in an attempt to close the distance. Caring not for safety at this point and time, Tethys brings his right palm to the back of his left shoulder. Once there, in haste, he applies chakra to the seal that was tattooed on his skin. From behind a cloud of smoke came his newly modified Black Blade. By time he did so, the Hogo-known shinobi dash forward at full speed. Upon doing so, with wind chakra now engulfing his blade, Tethys made an attempt to lift off the surface of the water into a jump.

On his descent, with absolutely no remorse, he aims to chop down on Koeki's being; possibly chopping her in half as a result. Throughout this entire process, however, Tethys' thoughts rained down on him. "If Koeki can prove her worth right here and now then I know the village is in safe hands. Hassan and I can't carry Kirigakure on our backs for long, it's time for someone to step up and let us know how fight to keep this place safe wasn't in vain."* - Mon Sep 14 23:38:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's body was pushed back, causing him to skid across the surface of the water. Luckily, by time the momentum ended, Tethys was able to continue his flow of chakra beneath his feet. With a slight grunt of annoyance, the Hogo loosened the grip he had on his blade. He thrusts the blade straight up into the air and swiftly weaved a quick succession of handseals together. By time the blade came back down, Tethys gripped it charged forward.

Within his stomach, however, was the kneading and thinning of chakra. Of course, by time Tethys made it to Koeki, he took in a deep breath through his nose and expelled a pointblank gust of on his exhale.* - Mon Sep 14 23:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) watched as Koeki avoiding the Great Breakthrough, a feat only battle experienced shinobi could pull off. Koeki's summoning of the Chakra Scalpels sparked quick interest in Tethys, seeing as though this was only his second time fighting against them. Just like before, Tethys made it a priority to not let Koeki hit him with those damn things. The split second Tethys had between the launch of his wind and Koeki's emitting of her chakra for the scalpels is all Tethys needed to release his primal state.

Just as Koeki came forth, Tethys used his free hand to send a quick jab right for the females' jaw; making sure to add authority and sheer strength behind it.* - Tue Sep 15 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...Guess I'll have another training sesson tomorrow. - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's sword vanished in another shroud of smoke. His look supplied no emotion to the scenario, just blunt disdain toward what he had to do at this point and time. In his mind, this all was for the better cause; his mind wasn't always agreed with by the others. He didn't feel like he owed anyone an explanation, just the brute force of his authority and goals was enough. With Koeki skidding across the water surface, Tethys trailed after her. He clenched both fists, allowing his trained stance to rain hell down on the female.

By time he poised herself up to accommodate for the launch back from Tethys' first strike, the Hogo attempted to grab her by the collar, swing her and thrust her toward the waterfall itself. "Come now, Koeki! You and I have never been serious before, SHOW ME WHAT YOU CAN DO!"* - Tue Sep 15 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) cared not for anyone's wellbeing at this point; it was a matter hit fast, hit hard. Koeki's frame exposed itself, a vibrant blue of sheer chakra swelling around her as if it was made for this specific purpose. Still, Tethys' goal and determination didn't falter. By the end of today a firm foundation will crumble at someone's feet, be it Koeki's or Tethys'. No time was wasted, just pure action. As if this was some alternate universe, Tethys crouched down a bit and dipped his fist into the body of water below him.

When the distance between him and Koeki was closed, Tethys' arm was fully maximized from his own moisture throughout his body and the extra juice from the lake. Tethys' aim was dead on at this point, fixated on the bottom of Koeki's chin. By time the two met face to face, Tethys unleashed a devastating uppercut.* - Tue Sep 15 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..>Any Genin here lookin to train? - Tue Sep 15 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || The burning sensation Tethys was experiencing was unreal. From sheer instincts, Tethys dipped his hand in the lake once more in an attempt to relieve himself of the pain. Still, though, with determination he launched his self forward after Koeki. The two were going at it like wild animals, caring not for the safety of one another. This time around, however, Tethys would use his left leg to provide the blue-haired female with a round house kick to the left shoulder; this would possibly send her flying out of the zone of the lake and on to lake's bank.* - Tue Sep 15 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's attack landed once again, but not without side effects. A loud roar is heard coming from Tethys as his very skin began to burn from the acidic. The feeling was almost unbearable, but Tethys was also fighting on sheer instincts. Koeki closed in the distance between them once more, giving the Jounin no time to recover. Just as he looked up from his sweltering fist and leg, he was met with a devastating punch to the jaw, causing the very lake to explode and erupt in a shroud.

Tethys was beneath the surface now, dazed over and contemplating on what the hell to do next. His arm was deflating and the moisture returned to the rest of his body, reducing his strength a bit. Whilst beneath the water, however, his chakra began to swell within him. His body began to pulsate before he regained most of his control, allowing him to swim off a bit and resurface a few feet away from the rampaging female.* - Tue Sep 15 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I...don't know.... - Tue Sep 15 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hassan.... You're Koeki's teacher right? Do you have any idea whats going on with her chakra right now? - Tue Sep 15 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's body reacted from primal instincts, watching the chakra engulfed Koeki edge in only made matters worse for the Jounin. Nevertheless, though, a counter had to be made. Haste was the key element in this situation, if anyone had it, it was Tethys. A jolt backwards provided Tethys with the necessary time to weave a quick set of handseals together. Seeing as though he was kneading his chakra since he was below the waters' surface, Tethys did nothing but expel it with as much force as he could. If his efforts prevailed, Koeki would be sent hurling back due to a massive implosion of wind.* - Tue Sep 15 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) formed another series of handseals, watching the woman extract herself from what was remaining of the waterfall. This wasn't a battle to determine the political standings of the village, this was a battle to prove themselves to be worthy enough all together; a battle long in the making and would have to be settling between just them. With the handseals successfully strung, Tethys would allow six water-based bunshins to manifest around him; each of them forming their own set of handseals once completely forming. With an exasperating push of their own chakra and water affinity, they each unleashed a wave of water toward Koeki; this gave the original Tethys time to recuperate for a few moments.* - Tue Sep 15 01:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Each bunshin was destroyed with ease, relentlessly impaled by the wind from Koeki's gullet. Tethys, on the other hand, found some form of security from crossing his arms into an X and attempting to tough things out. If he was given the chance, while Jin go the momentary attention of Koeki, Tethys would use his own draining blood from his mouth and spread it within his right palm. From there, after forming the necessary handseals, Tethys would crouch to slam his palm on to the surface of the water; deep below was the spawning of a shark.

Tethys, on the other hand, simply waited to see if Koeki would continue to attack; of course he prayed that she did.* - Tue Sep 15 01:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) was indeed fatigued at this point. He suffered burns across his body and bruises riddled his face, just the thing he needed. As Koeki dropped to her hands and knees, Tethys did the same. Honestly, the only thing holding him up from sinking below the surface was the fact that his loyal shark was beneath him as leverage.* - Tue Sep 15 01:27:40 2015

In the scenario that Hassan and I do have to be the sacrificial pieces, whose going to lead our kingdom of potential kings? Think, Jin. It's not a matter of us slicing each other's throats to prove a point; it's a matter of preparing for the worse and expecting the unexpected."* - Tue Sep 15 01:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) sighed; Jin is truly a younger Tethys. This same exact conversation happened when Noriko was elected as Mizukage and Tethys didn't understand what was going. With a slight shove of Flexus' body and a step forward in Jin's direction, Tethys spoke.

"It seems as though you don't understand, kid. You were promoted because I felt you were ready, not because you are some replacement. You think any of this is easy for me..? You think I want to come home nearly every day near death? You think I want to look my two kids in the eyes every night and let them know if anything happens to me that I'll always be there for them..? You think I find any of this fun? Jin, I do what I have to do for two reasons; Ride or Die and family. I explained numerous of times Kirigakure, as a whole, is family. If I have to force the position on Koeki, like it was forced on Kakei, Noriko and myself, I'm going to do just that.

I've done too much to allow a war against a tyrant like Zetsumo to be the downfall of Kirigakure. With every blood, sweat and moisture in my Hogo body, there will never be a tike I quit when important matters are on the line. It's a matter of assuring the thriving and security of Kirigakure. Even before I even considered being the Mizukage, I came home half dead. I was a damn Genin taking out A-Rank mission to make sure shinobi with potential, like you, would have nothing to worry about. Hassan and I have played our cards numerous of times. We've won many games against death and we just don't know if we're winning this next game.

If you hate me because of all this, fine. Want nothing to do with me, fine. I'll accept all that after I know once I kick the bucket, the village is thriving."* - Tue Sep 15 02:01:48 2015
