<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) didn't take Ozui literally at first, given the fact that Tethys' didn't think such a useful technique would be as simple as explained. With defiance in mind, the Hogo formed the necessary handseal and distributed a portion of his chakra outward. As it took a physical, gassy, form a dysfunctional clone formed. Not only did the clone favor a zombie, but it slumped over like one as well. With a bit of blush on Tethys' cheeks, he dispersed the clone in haste; no point in giving anyone around enough time to register the fact that the great Tethys failed at something.

With a slow, deep, breathe; Tethys would concentrate on his chakra network. Upon doing so, while taking the Ozui clones' words into consideration, the Mizukage would push a steady stream of chakra forward. Learning from his previous mistake helped greatly this time around, giving him the knowledge to know that too much chakra would most likely implode since too little cause it to slump over. In the end, from behind a cloud of smoke, came a clone that was ideal to the occasion.* - Tue Sep 15 23:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || What do you call someone that works day in and day out to protect what they love the most; an honorable person? What do you label the actions of someone that kills to protect what they love the most; a necessary evil? What do you say when that same person stares you in the eyes and tells you that you're next on his hit-list because he feels, within himself, that if died what he loved the most will live? What if that same person gives you an ultimatum; live by serving as the soul protector of what he loves the most, or perish where you stand?

What decision do you make when you find yourself being in that persons' shoes and having to either chop someone in half or lose your own life? What route would you take when you know the opponent that stands before you slips up, giving you the choice to either run or take their life; both options only having a fifty-fifty success rate? Who do you go to for help when you're the head of the household and the breadwinner? What about when you're the head of the household and your own children despise you because you're never home? Maybe there's an easy way out of all this; maybe, just maybe.

"It's now five o'clock a.m., the year is four o'five and my name is Tethys. I am of the Hogo family, also known as the Hozuki. I've been assigned as the temporary Mizukage in place of Noriko Hogo, originally known as Noriko of the Uzumaki. She is my wife for over five years now and she has fallen sick to unsuspected illness. We have two kids together, Masami and Atsushi. They are our pride and joy, we'll do anything to assure their happiness and safety."

The room Tethys currently resided in was lit by a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. It was clear that the room was more the size of a basic closet size rather than an office. Hell, the building he was in was more of a one bedroom apartment with the living room and kitchen attached; no doors were present. Still, though, the tight spaced room gave the feeling of security; possibly even assurance that whatever happens in this room was meant to be and nothing but the best would come out of it. A few questions that could easily be asked were: where is Tethys right now, maybe even what building is he in or possibly where is this building located in Kirigakure?

"As I write this, I reside in a small cabin on the outskirts of the village; the boarder of the Land of Waves and Land of Fire to be exact. The village is in tight lockdown at the moment, but that's actually beside the point --- yes, that does seem absurd. I don't know; when I was younger I wanted to be the Mizukage, but now that I wear the cloak, hoist the hat over my head and sit at the desk, it's more complicated than that. Is it because my wife, the true Mizukage, is sick and I'm just the fill-in? Is it because I know for a fact that my life, apart from what I have waiting for me at home every night, is too chaotic to be the Mizukage?"

He looks up from the paper, eyes meeting a pit of darkness; the single light bulb provided light, but not enough to illuminate the entire room --- his immediate area at most was the radius of its stretch. Still, though, the pit seemed to broadcast something to him, a vision if you will. What was it that formulated and harvested from the darkness? Was it his imagination? He wasn't all that tired. Was it his conscious? He's sure that he came to mends with that a few months ago. He lowers his head, continuing his writing.

"I'm not too keen on expressing myself, neither out loud nor privately. I rather get a few jugs of liquor and down it at a moderate pace; alright maybe not moderate, but enough to keep me both feelings-free and full control over my body. If it was up to me I'd make liquor a delicacy of Kirigakure rather than the amazing fishing spots --- maybe I'll do the paperwork for that send out possible business contract suggestions to the other main countries to review. Where was I? Oh, my feelings; yeah, I'm not too in tuned with that."

There was a sensation of observation present in the room. Not from Tethys, but rather on him. He didn't sense anyone nearby, was exhaustion really taking its toll so soon? His head raises slowly, eyes fixated on the same manifestation in the pit of darkness from before; was it someone actually there? Tethys squints, examining the possible illusion. Instincts usually kick in when something appears before Tethys and he doesn't know who, or what, it is. There was a feeling of safety present with the manifestation though, like it was just there to look on and guide him. He returns to his writing.

"After Hogetsu, my older brother, died I felt as though I was lost. I knew where I was physically, but mentally I was there nor here. Spiritually I was too far gone, didn't even leave a trail behind or nothing. Emotionally I was broken; some may say I was so broken that there was no such thing as 'picking up the pieces and putting it back together'. I was the ideal rebel; I acknowledge that with pride. I packed what little stuff I had and decided to move to Konohagakure, I don't know why there but I just had to leave Kirigakure. I suppose Konohagakure wasn't really my set destination, but the knowledge that I broke free of the place that harbored my despair and depression sent a chill up and down my spine at the time. It was more of a thrill rather than chill now that I think of it; maybe it was just my young mind making me anxious to go out and roam. Still, though, I knew I just needed a break from the constant reminder of Hogetsu's death.

Was I so wrong for that? Was I truly an enemy of Kirigakure the second I stepped out of the village without notifying the new Mizukage? Did I leave that part out? Yeah, Kakei learned of Hogetsu's death and went in to a deep depression; almost instantly in fact. When he found out was what really made things worse. Raiden, a known criminal, was spotted with some chick walking out from the Kirigakure's vault. Kakei easily disposed of Raiden, but the chick sold the poor guy out at the drop of a hat. Kakei proceeded with telling his life story to everyone present; little did we know suicide was being contemplated in his mind. We started from the very start of his life to the very end; at the time we didn't know it was truly the 'end'. Soon after finishing his narrative, Kakei turns to a brother-like figure to me named Smith and requested that Smith aided him in one last mission."

The feeling of being observed thickened. It didn't fright Tethys nor sent him on high alert, but it felt like the sensation responded to how deep in his writing he got. The more he wrote about what he have experienced in his life thus far is the more it felt like the manifestation before him grew more aware and had its attention firmly grasped. Tethys, still not being alarmed in any way, kept his head lowered and main focus on what he was writing.

"Everyone originally thought Kakei wanted Smith to be the one that is hailed as his successor, but apparently there was a hidden agenda. Noriko, known to me as Tora or something at the time, was trusted with the position. Hell, if anything, now that I look at it, that was the best decision. Noriko's doing a hell of a job with the village, but that the time emotions were too high. Hogetsu dying, Kakei dying, me coming up as a Genin and grinding to become top-dog; it was all just too much. Next thing I knew, I found myself going rogue after cursing the name of Noriko. I gave her no true reason to trust me as a shinobi of Kirigakure.

Reminiscing now, after all these years, I still don't know what made Noriko have that faith and trust in me; my looks certainly didn't help wave her mind. Still, though, after I went rogue with Ikaro and Smith, it didn't take long for Noriko to hire an Agent to come for us. It was about a week of living in Konohagakure when Hari of the Hazo showed up and convinced me to return back to Kirigakure. One thing led to another and I eventually came face to face with Noriko. She sat behind the office desk, beautiful red hair flowing over her shoulders and a emotionless stare on her face. At the time I was too much of a rebel to look at her past the whole 'you're not my Mizukage' state of mind, but I couldn't deny the fact that she was truly beautiful.

After about ten minutes of just staring each other down, while shinobi came in and out of the office to receive missions, Noriko finally spoke. She gave a sigh of frustration and simply asked me why. Why had I left the village and did I truly hate her to the point where being rogue seemed like a better lifestyle? I assured her that my hatred wasn't for her, but the fact that losing Kakei and Hogetsu all within the same week sent me overboard. I assured her that my loyalty will always be to Kirigakure, no matter the situation. Staying within the village, at the time, only made me feel like I had nothing to progress on. I already surpassed the other Genin; Koeki was the only other Chuunin and old man Hassan was barely around. Hell, if anything, the trip to Konohagakure was more a self-progression mission rather than a rogue attempt.

What amazed me the most, however, was the fact that she asked no more questions. He gave another sigh, a less frustrated and more understanding sigh. The only comment she made on my explanation, which really wasn't directly toward my explanation, was she had a mission for me. Surprisingly, she took my trip to Konohagakure as a good thing on a whole; giving me the position of International Relations Officer. Anything dealing with transaction between Kirigakure and another village was in my power to make a call, a position that I was granted within hours of returning home after being labeled as rogue. Still, up to this day, I don't know what made it so easy for her to trust me. I didn't exactly rebuttal to the position and mission, I just questioned her judgment on allowing me to have such power; I wasn't given an answer.

For the most part, after returning to Kirigakure, which Smith and Ikaro soon did as well, my time was a bit easy going. Sure, there were those times when my emotions sprung a leak, but it wasn't all that detrimental. Noriko and I became more intimate, not physically but more in a way where we knew we were flirting; we just didn't want to acknowledge it out loud. We found ourselves getting into arguments that a couple would get into; another female being too close to me, another male hitting on her and she not doing something about it; we still haven't fully acknowledged that we had feelings for one another, it's just something that we automatically knew."

A smile overcame Tethys, the sensation of being watched slowly leaving him. His smile didn't radiate from the dispersing feeling, but the memory he had of Noriko and himself back in their early days. A sigh was released from him, a notable sigh that would've surely caught the attention of someone; if there was anyone with him that was. He releases the grip he on his pen, allowing it to drop on the paper he was writing on and roll of a bit. By now the feeling of being watched was gone, but still he didn't really acknowledge it; he simply stood to his feet and walked out the room. It was time for him to return back to the village and complete his duties.* - Thu Sep 17 07:45:42 2015
