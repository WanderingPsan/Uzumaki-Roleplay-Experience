<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) released a sigh, looking at Hideki with a serious face. "It's obvious that Zetsumo has every major Village out for him," said Tethys as he took a step forward, approaching the situation like a titan of his own right. He points to the ground they stood on, "This isn't Sunagakure, this isn't Konohagakure, this isn't Genjigakure.."

Tethys' arms raised, exactly how Dom's arms raised when he went face to face with Hov in Brazil. "This is Kirigakure," he exclaims with his continuous stirn face. "What happens here, stays here. Whatever ties you have with the rest of the world doesn't belong here. You come to train, live peacefully and enjoy yourself.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course it be that... but sure whatever, if its for a mission.  - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Let's see what you've two got team wise against a little 'ol weak Tethys. - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm~ - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Alright. You two may have the first moves each. - Sat Sep 12 07:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) looked on, hands momentarily tucked in his pockets and an observant mind examining Jin and Lera's ability to synchronize their abilities. After watching the two unleash their jutsus in collaborations, Tethys applies chakra to his feet. While using the blind spot forced by the expanded flames, Tethys sunk into the ground.* - Sat Sep 12 07:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's ability to sense was keen. As Lera generated the necessary chakra to perform her Earth Flash, Tethys simply emerged from the ground, meeting the flash head on. However, with the dismount of both his hands, Tethys took a few hops back and wove five handseals together. Just as the lightning was to hit, Tethys puckered his lips and exhaled; a massive gust of wind unleashed itself, eliminating the Earth Flash all together.* - Sat Sep 12 07:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) smirked a bit, watching the continuation of combinations reign upon him. He had many ways out of this, but he felt like testing to minds of the two Genin's were the best options. They knew that he was able to negate Lera's lightning with ease; they also know Tethys was able to pick them apart if he got close. As the two were forced to split, however, Tethys focused his chakra once more. Just as the attacks closed in, he seeped back into the ground. This time, though, Tethys traveled closer to Lera than Jin.* - Sat Sep 12 07:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) sprang out of the ground, jumping high into the air. His location proved that he was aiming for Lera, but that mattered not at this point. Just as Tethys made it into the air, he executes a series of handseals and allowed his chakra to knead in his stomach. At that moment, with the kneading chakra swelling, he'd take in a deep breath through his nose and exhaled through puckered lips.

In response to that, the kneaded chakra would thicken and merge with his earth affinity, causing a thick slick of mud to be exerted out. The main purpose of this was to catch both the shinobi off guard whilst providing little time react; perfect training to see how they responded in the heat of battle.* - Sat Sep 12 08:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) 's eyes wandered from the vanishing Lera to the dispersed Jin. A smirk overcame the Hogo at this point, sensing him appear behind his landing path. Just as Jin readied his self, Tethys would bring his right palm to his left wrist and summon five shuriken from the seal tattooed there. From there, on his way back to the ground, Tethys would apply chakra to those five shuriken and allow them to launch forward. Their path led to Jin's body and their purpose was to possibly render Jin incapable or back up.* - Sat Sep 12 08:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) || Seemed as though it was time for Jin and Lera to fully understand the capabilities of Tethys. Seeing as though there were factors in this spar that made things complicated for both parties, the Hogo decided to pick up the pace. With Lera making an attempt to cast a Genjutsu that needed a trigger, it passed over Tethys without scathing him. That being said, Tethys' main focus was on Jin.

With his descending body closing in on Jin, who was struck by the shuriken, Tethys unsealed his legendary Black Blade. He quickly infuses it wish chakra, sending its wide wingspan to the right side of Jin's body. His aim was to swat the hell out of Jin, most likely sending him flying a baseball for the homerun. Once doing that, with no hesitation, Tethys broke off in a full speed dash toward Lera.

If he managed to close the distance on her, he send running swat toward her; another attempt at a homerun.* - Sat Sep 12 09:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) kept his usual posture intact, hands tucked in his pants pocket and a nonchalant lean to his body. Some may say that Tethys showed extremely disrespect when posed like this, implying his opponent is nothing but fodder; on the contrary, Tethys doesn't underestimate his opponents. With the muffled sound of Ketsueki's voice, Tethys decided to take the initiative.

The Hogo broke off in a full fledge sprint, aiming to close the distance between them drastically. Upon doing so, while keeping his hands tucked safely in his pockets, he bends back at the hips and goes for a quick roundhouse kick to Ketsueki's head.* - Sat Sep 12 16:57:23 2015

All I ask for you in return is loyalty and honesty. With our combined forces we'll easily dissemble our enemies and allow the wrong to be corrected."
