Yes, it made sense. It was a strategy revolving around flanking the cat's possible exits in a cardiographic fashion. By creating a cardioid, they would be able to rout the target from all sides and prevent the cat from actually fully penetrating the shield. 

"I think we've made it." Tetsuki stated. She reaches out for the cat by holding out her arms like a basketball screen or box out. * - Wed Oct 21 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) places her hands together, clasping together. Suddenly, she jets out her chakra. She fails.

She has no idea how to make a slicing action occur. She can propel her chakra, but she's little clue on how to make that slice.* - Thu Oct 22 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) takes hold of the paper. She nods. "Okay, really quick one time right?" Tetsuki states. She concentrates her chakra along her hands deciding that she'd do what Muhhamed had just done.

She fires out her chakra quickly and precisely. However, it doesn't... cut the paper. It is like a blast of chakra that pushes the paper straight out of her hand like she had shot a gun.

"Oops!"* - Thu Oct 22 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Or... is it opposite? - Thu Oct 22 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Opposite. - Thu Oct 22 04:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We can keep it up until you get it. - Thu Oct 22 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) // This time, Tetsuki did it the opposite way. By concentrating her chakra and splitting it in a split second, she slices the paper in half. Tetsuki looks to be extremely happy with her accomplishment

Her slice cut through to her skin though, surprisingly. 

"Owie..." Tetsuki placed her lips over her skin and tries to soothe her wound.* - Thu Oct 22 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Good. - Thu Oct 22 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Chakra control is key. - Thu Oct 22 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Oh...okay.... - Thu Oct 22 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) takes hold of another strip of the paper that she had just cut. She focuses this time. 

She was fearful of cutting herself though. So she restrains herself.

She slices through the paper, but doesn't cut it all the way. She slices it perhaps 3/4 of the way.* - Thu Oct 22 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Keep on trying. - Thu Oct 22 05:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) observes the handseals and nods obligingly. She imitates the handseals as well, deciding that she was going to test it out. At first though, Tetsuki messes up the handseals due to overexcitement.

After a second try, she masterfully executes the sequence/string of handseals without a single mistake. She was a relatively fast learner, despite not being a prodigy like other Genin. Not only that, but Muhhamed had given her some basic wind elemental training. Maybe she'd be able to catch up to this technique in record time! 

"Okay! Here we go." Tetsuki shouted. She exhales from her mouth into the desert's atmosphere, resulting in a similar small vortex to have been made. Granted, she doesn't understand the technique very well. Not only that, but it may have looked the same as Muhhamed's, but it probably didn't bear its same effects.* - Thu Oct 22 05:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) // "Please forgive me." She quietly nods. She slams her hands together. In a blink of an eye, blue energy radiates from her hands and she unseals her weapon of choice. The massive blade pops into her hands and she clutches it with her two hands with surprising ease.

"Black Blade Summoning." She quietly murmurs, looking at Tetsumi with unease. And with a sudden burst of speed, Tetsuki quickly closes the distance between herself and Tetsumi and swings the blade, spanning enough to cover their distance without a problem while also being swung with excessive brute force.* - Fri Oct 30 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I've been at this all day.. One match after the other. - Fri Oct 30 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) | | She swung her blade in a chopping lateral motion to divide the current of waves that looked to push her away. Tetsuki was reflexive enough to react to the speed of the waves luckily and could force it back without being too encumbered by her sword. She steps back though, and notices how he was spreading the materials.

If he meant to use it, it meant that his only purpose to spread all of it was to manipulate the entire battlefield---it'd only be troublesome for Tetsuki. Tetsuki bites her lip and jumps back. She weaves a single handseal. 

Her body shifts into the current sand. Whilst in the form, Tetsuki disappears and merges with the sand itself. She aimed to disappear from Tetsumi's line of sight and reappear to his side to side her blade promptly at his midsection with the flat end of it, perhaps to knock the wind out of him if she wasn't detected.

Hopefully, she'd pull this off before the battlefield was swamped in the iron sand and was rendered useless for normal sand manipulation.* - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) | | The sand was now wrapping around Tetsuki. She was surprised. However, Tetsuki lacked physical form. She attempts to assimilate with the ground once more to disappear from the ensnaring prowess of the Iron Sand Coffin and reappear elsewhere to Tetsumi's side. She only then noticed how durable the wall being used was. 

"You have a very strong defense.." She commented quietly, mostly out of compliment. She attempts to regather her standings and instead, upon releasing her sand form directly underneath Tetsumi's body, she'd attempt to directly smack into his ankles and yank them backwards, to perhaps trip him. She was confident enough in her form.

Since she was made of sand---she had no organs to worry about. No blood would flow if she was stabbed. She was sand. And it'd be hard to kill sand.* - Fri Oct 30 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) | | Swiftly, Tetsuki sweeps the landscape of excess sand that may be nearby her as she reforms on land. Tetsuki bites her lip. She was envious.... Envious of one thing
.
"How come you can fly?!" She cried out. "That's not fair..." She muttered. She holds her blade with both of her hands before suddenly swinging it through the air before Tetsumi could get high enough. She'd leap if excess distance was causing her to be unable to reach him---well aware of the sand that was near her. She had swept it away so that she could get a buffer space from a directly manipulated below attack---compliments of her flexibility when it came to fighting style.

"You're very strong!" She shouted, aiming to slam the blade into Tetsumi and knock him out of the sky like a ping ping ball.* - Fri Oct 30 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) | | Suddenly, her blade had been stopped. She had not anticipated anyone's defense being strong enough to block her sword. Tetsuki pulled her sword back and was eventually captured by the iron sand. As she struggles, Tetsuki's sand form dissipates briefly, knowing that it was ultimately a loss for her. Tetsuki muttered lightly to herself. "I've so much to learn...." * - Fri Oct 30 04:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) quietly looks at Tetsumi and stares at his fist.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) forms a fist and fist bumps Tetsumi. She blinks. 

"Oh... okay." She says quietly. She had originally been working on stuffing away her sword and then, because of the fist bump, had gotten distracted and had let go of her blade.

The sword falls on the ground with a smash, though nothing that could harm anyone or anything.* - Fri Oct 30 04:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) | | She really did not want to displease Muhhamed with a meal that would be bad or poor quality. She decided then to just make something that was really simple to make and almost impossible to mess up. She quietly scuttles over to grab a pot and she pours milk into the pot after withdrawing the carton from the fridge. She turns up the  heat to a medium high and starts to wait for the milk to bubble a little. 

Once done, she'd grapple hold of a box of oats and pour it into the milk, little by little so that the proportion of oats to milk was appropriate. She shoves some sugar into it as to sweeten the flavor of the oats and she waits for its completion.

Easiest thing ever. And she wouldn't have to chop anything!* - Fri Oct 30 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) cups the oatmeal into two bowls. She squeezes some lemon juice into both of the oatmeals as to make it more sour, not realizing that it was counterintuitive since it was supposed to be a very bland dish. She steps over to Muhhamed and Marrisa and places both of the bowls on the table. She then rushes to grab herself one.* - Fri Oct 30 04:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) hoists the blade over her shoulder and starts to trot off.

"I'll go to the shop now, Trilliam!"* - Fri Nov 27 08:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) claps her hands together. A surge of blue electricity streams along her hands and into thin air. Once the air had gathered enough of the chakra, Tetsuki formed her blade; it was a seven foot obsidian-colored sword, whose ebony edges were sharpened to near perfection.

"I'll use the flat edge, Hanai-san!" She gleefully smiles at her senpai.* - Sat Nov 28 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: You're super strong anyways. - Sat Nov 28 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Please no. - Sat Nov 28 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Then I'll take the first move! - Sat Nov 28 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) suddenly swings her blade in a lateral fashion towards Hanai. She uses the extra reach to attempt smashing into Hanai's side with the flat part of her blade. It was wide and hopefully, that expanded width would be able to capture any efforts to dodge that Hanai had.

"First swing. Batter up!" She shouted playfully.* - Sat Nov 28 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Fuck. - Sat Nov 28 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Thanks! You're strong too, Hanai-senpai. - Sat Nov 28 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: But this attack won't be easy to dodge. - Sat Nov 28 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Uh? You might need to recover fully first. - Sat Nov 28 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'm fine. - Sat Nov 28 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nah, rather not have you die on me so recover. - Sat Nov 28 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'm fine though. - Sat Nov 28 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: R-Really. - Sat Nov 28 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) props the blade back up on her shoulder. Resting the shaft of the sword on her shoulder, Tetsuki takes a deep breath. She weaves three handseals, before simultaneously swinging her blade to Hanai's opposite side. Once the blade had landed, Tetsuki's mouth puffed open to release a vortex of wind: trademark of Hassan.

"Wind Style: Godly Wind From the Mountains." She thought to herself.* - Sat Nov 28 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No really. - Sat Nov 28 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm seeing bandage. - Sat Nov 28 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-It's fine. - Sat Nov 28 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Get Bryson to heal you if you want to train so badly. - Sat Nov 28 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Just relax Momura... - Sat Nov 28 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Sat Nov 28 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) recognized how fast Hanai was. Her vortex was immature and didn't push him back or deal enough damage it appeared. Tetsuki had to retaliate though before Hanai could reach her. Tetsuki's blade is reared back to her side and Tetsuki simultaneously brings the blade back while she leaps backwards a short distance. Once the blade intercepts the kick, Tetsuki does skid back some in order to cushion the rest of the appalling force. 

"Hanai-senpai, your hits are still as hard as ever.... I feel like your punches might damage my sword..." She complains a bit. * - Sat Nov 28 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..I couldn't find him.. - Sat Nov 28 23:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'll see you later I-I guess. - Sat Nov 28 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I have to go root for Momura-chan. - Sat Nov 28 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-See you later h-hanai! - Sat Nov 28 23:34:49 2015
