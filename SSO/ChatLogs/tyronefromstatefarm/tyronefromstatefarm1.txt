<br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) made her way from around the building, having been tending to the nearly dried up plant she had planted not long ago. She clapped her hands tussling off any loose dirt that clung to her hands. She looked over to the black cloaked Ozui and the figure behind him. *He can't enjoy standing out in the heat with that black cloak....* she thought as she gave a puzzled look towards the figure she had yet to meet. She clasped her hands together, standing up as straight as possible. Her soft pink hair draped over each shoulder, resting on her pearly white cloak.* - Wed Sep 02 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) gazed her emerald eyes at the duo. She gave him a rather odd expression, having glanced at his shirtless torso. She didn't really notice anything special about his physic, quickly looking back at his face. She tilted her body slightly, the cloak mimicing her actions as she tried to lean enough to notice the 'maid'. 

"Right. Tension release from your maid." she said, unfamiliar with the duties and responsibilities a maid followed. She thought nothing of it, giving a quick sigh. "So. Have you been able to acquire the medical kit?" she asked as her sea-green eyes sparkled in anticipation.* - Wed Sep 02 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) walked through the doors, her coat softly dragging along the wooden boards of the strange building. It was an unknown place and her desire to explore seemed to spread within her. "Mister Kimura...what is this place?" she asked looking around at every wall ornament, clock, bookcase, seats. "It looks nice."* - Fri Sep 04 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) pulled out a scroll from the inner workings of her lab coat. With a quick roll of the parchment, the blank canvas was revealed. She pulled out a single pen, placing it gently on the surface of the scroll before scribbling down everything Ozui had said in great detail. "Right..Will start working on that." she said beginning to calculate chemical formulas as well as herbal remedies.* - Fri Sep 04 00:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) 's emerald eyes remained fixated on the scroll in front of her. She gave a quick glance towards her employer, her eyes peering past the pink hair that seemed to droop down over her face. She hadn't been paying attention, only catching the last portion of his question. "You mean...you're experiencing trauma from the past?" she asked to reconfirm her diagnosis.* - Fri Sep 04 01:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) took a soft breath, looking at Ozui with compassionate eyes. "I see, sorry for your loss," she said with an air of half truth. She hadn't really been working for the man long, nor did she really have a connection deep enough for her to feel a certain way about his past, regardless of how sad it was. 

"Well...I'd have to check one of my medical journals, but it seems to be a Reocurring trauma disorder." she said clenching her hands together. "Have these...episodes been happening for a long time?"* - Fri Sep 04 01:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) had rather ornate and delicate handwriting making it easy for anyone to clearly read what was written on the slab of paper. She made no effort in hiding or covering her work, indicating she didn't mind or had no reason to keep anything hidden. "Well...I'll have to think about that.." she said turning towards the gothic figure that loomed over the seat nearby. Everything about him seemed glum, his appearance, the shade of his eyes. Her diamond encrusted emerald for eyes glistened in the low-light of the room as she reached up to brush the hair behind her left ear. "So...What do you do? You've never really told me."* - Fri Sep 04 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) had heard something looming around the doors of the library, a faint shadow peering into the chamber of knowledge from underneath the door. Without hesitation she pushed away from her desk, making her way to the door, opening it to find an empty pathway. Curious as to what could have been the cause, although a speck of insight seemed to fester in her mind; knowing who it might have been all along. As she entered the grand hall, it was easy to catch her employer hiding between a plant and the bookcase on the second level. She gave him a quick look, hiding her inner emotions on the matter; disguising her weirded out expressions with a smile. "Are you really just...standing between a plant and a bookcase?" she asked unsure of what he was really doing, although she could assume several things.* - Fri Sep 04 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) quickly placed her hands on her hips, flashing the rather depressing boy a smile of her pearly white teeth. She was a twin, fraternal of course, but they were complete opposites...her sister and herself. While her sister seemed to share Ozui's rather blue characteristics, Renkin had always been the more positive of the duo. Who knows what clicked, maybe it was Ozui's mannerism or the way he was following a suicidal path, but nevertheless it clicked.

"Do something productive you goof." she said ecstaticly as she rushed over towards him extending her hand in good faith. If her hand was grasped she would try to pull him downstairs towards the living quarters. "Alright. Do some training. I want to see one hundred push ups and don't you cheat!"* - Fri Sep 04 18:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) smiled. "See...excercise produces endorphins in the body...If you produce enough, it helps eleviate depression and...and it's a good way to releave some stress." she said still slightly perky. "Now...Continue doing some physical exercise while I try to see if I can make a quick batch of pills." she said flipping her hair over her shoulder with ease. She would head back to her lab in search of pills.* - Fri Sep 04 18:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) returned, her rather excited and determined look from before was now more sedintary. "I'm sorry...I couldn't find any healing pills nor vitamins." she stated, baring empty hands as she stuffed them into her lab coat. With a slight rummage she was able to pull out an odd looking plant. It seemed to look like a smaller looking cabbage, although slightly different in other characteristics. "This is an Herb needed for some forms of health pills...If you chew it...it will slightly boost your energy, but that's about it." she said extending a singular herb. "Chew it after your workout. It will help with cooling down and will make it so you aren't as fatigued later," she finished, a smile starting to scrawl itself back onto her face.* - Fri Sep 04 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) 's eye twitched slightly as he had disobeyed her instructions..."I...I said after...After!" she shouted in annoyance, but at the same time she felt a slight sensation of humor at his incompetence. She crossed her arms under her chest, slightly pushing them up as she entered her thinking posture. "You're going to need to pay more attention...I'll see if I can come up with a pill for that..." she said towards him trying to cause the information to sink in.* - Fri Sep 04 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) gave a soft giggle. "You know..If you keep this up, you could really improve your body. Get some muscle on those twigs and abdomen you call a body. " she said looking at his rather average to unimpressive body. She didn't mean to put him down, in her own mind, this rather negative talk was actually a peptalk in hopes of motivating the scrawny man.* - Fri Sep 04 19:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) looked at the scrawny boy with expressions of disbelief. "You know...you told me you wanted to be the best at every form of combat...That includes Taijutsu and requires to not be paper-thin. " she said scowling him. "I don't know how you were engaged with that appearance...she must have been desperate or blind.." she said trying to enforce her tough love attitude.* - Fri Sep 04 19:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) Sighed. "Just admit it.."* - Fri Sep 04 20:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) made her way towards the living quarters, making sure to stay on the second floor. She peered down onto the two that were there, glazing over the odd girl that was there. *She was here before....Who is she?* she thought as she began to create several ideas and scenarios in her mind. *She's probably Ozui's sexual toy..* she again..thought.* - Fri Sep 04 23:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) could somehow see a randomly immediate change in appearance when it came to Ozui's body. He wasn't bone anymore, but instead a little more leaner.* - Fri Sep 04 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) coughed slightly. "So..what's this all about? Who is she?"* - Fri Sep 04 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) sighed, crossing her arms as she looked over at Ozui. "I can't do anything....I can't continue my work...not at this time..."* - Sat Sep 05 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) slowly placed her head onto the surface of the cold table. "Why.." she said softly as she just rested her head.* - Sat Sep 05 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) would begin to rummage through several notes she had scattered amongst the desk in front of her. These papers not only had several descriptions of herbs and chemicals and all of their properties, it also had images and details on the human body and how they are affected. She was going to begin her research on the human body so that her abilities can better help those in need...even if they were Ozui.* - Sat Sep 05 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) had continued to look down at the several layers of research papers and textbooks. "I've had a breakthrough...I think I can do it." she said as she began to furiously write down in her notebook several chemicals, herbs, and other ingredients that might be able to help her in her studies. It also helped to be reading about anatomical structures, specifically that of the male genitalia. "Ozui...I need you...I need you to bring me Five large fish. It's important for my research. I can't do it..I'm too busy." she said before looking down at her books.

There was a diagram of a penis plastered on two pages of a red textbook by her left hand. The other textbook near her, a green one that was rather thick, had an image of a rather large fish on it. She was indeed in need of this fish. "This fish has properties that are very...how do i say this...Desireable amongst a portion of the population..If I can isolate the properties..I can add it as an ingredient."* - Sat Sep 05 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) looked up from her books and furious scribbling of her notebook. "You know, you should teach me this technique sometime.." she said before turning back to her work. She flipped the page of the red textbook causing her to now look at a flacid penis with diagrams of what the inside and inner tubings appeared to be. "Great...this is good." she said as she looked over to the other book.

She began to flip pages in the book, accidently closing it. It would reveal the title as, "Marvelous Fish and What They Do" in golden letters. She groaned, turning the pages back to the fish diagram. "Right..Scales and eyes.." she muttered writing it down in her notebook. "Now..It's going to need a base.." she said outloud this time as she scrambled to look for another book.* - Sat Sep 05 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) began to slowly read each line of text underneath the diagram of the flacid penis. "Right..so what can I use as a base..." she said outloud once more as she focused intently on the page and words before her. She would then look over to another textbook about the bodies digestive system as she intended to solve the mystery of something that could contain the ingredients without causing harm to the body. "Of course.." she began as she looked over towards  Ozui. "Could you do me another favor....Could you...Could you also get or rather...capture two rabbits? They can be dead...just don't destroy their body..."


She would look back down at her books and papers furiously as she began to rummage through as much text as she could trying to understand the human body...mainly the male organ....it was necessary for something she wanted to remain secret...something she was going to use to make a rather pretty penny. "Sorry about the odd requests...but...It's necessary.." she said as she looked over at Ozui.* - Sat Sep 05 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) pulled out a small sketchbook as she began to design a pill with great detail, making sure to take glances at the flacid penis for reference. "Hmmm....Alright.." she stated sketching out as much of the drawing as she possibly could. "It should be round at the edge to stop from cutting anything..." she said making small notes on the image. 

She would begin to write the formula for the pill on that same page, below everything making sure it was visible and clear, but in a sort of handwriting and language that she only understood. She didn't want other to go around learning her methods of preparing this pill. "How is the projects comming along?"* - Sat Sep 05 01:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) nodded in gratitude as she grabbed the fish and rabbit from the clones. "Great great.." she said as she slammed a fish onto the cleared portion of the table. With a scalpal she began to slice and skin the fish making sure to keep the scales and outter skin intact. She observed the body of the fish, its muscles and bones. "What a marvelous creature this specific fish is...It's rare in some parts of this nation you know.." she began to spout as she continued fixated on the anatomy of the fish.

She quickly shook her head, regaining focus. "Right...Gotta focus." she said as she began to pop the eyeball out of the creature's lifeless body. "The ingredients will be Fish scales and eyeball of the rare Madarara Bass." she said penciling it down in a secret coded language. She would look over towards one of her anatomical book this time in regards to the rabbit. "Right. This book says the protein in the fatty portions of this Marsh Rabbit can be decompsed with heat to create a gelatin...I can use this gelatin to produce capsulets. Now...This red pepper as well as spinich mixed with the other ingredients should work..." she stated with confidence. "The formula is complete."* - Sat Sep 05 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) would bring out her mortar and pestal as she began to place the ingredients at its center. With a quick rotation and thrust of her mortar, she was able to smash and mix the ingredients into a mushy substance that was then heated until dried and powdered. She then began to poil the fat that clung to the rabbits flesh causing it to clump up. 

She flattened the fatty subtance that was now maleable. She placed the dried powder at the center and began to roll it up producing about ten gelled capsules that contained the powder inside. "Right...This should work...This should be it.."* - Sat Sep 05 01:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) 's eyes widened as she stared directly at Ozui. "Wha-...How...I thought it was too expensive.." she said getting up from her seat as she made her way towards the Medipot. "It's...It's beautiful.." she said rushing towards Ozui in an attempt to hug him. "Thank you."* - Sat Sep 05 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) pulled her head back to look at the boy. "Thank you....again.." she said feeling his lean body against hers for the moment. She would let go, taking a few steps back away from him. "Now...I'm going to need to learn how to use this.." she said lookinh at it oddly.* - Sat Sep 05 21:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) made her way steadily to her lab. It seemed she was all alone in this rather large mansion. She made her way behind her desk, pulling out the manual she knew all too well. She read her hidden scripture, temporarily memorising the formula as she seemed to always forget. 

Taking her time, she gathered the ingredients she kept in jars. Mixing them and grinding them, they quickly began to form themselves into pills. It wasn't easy, but it sure did take a while.* - Wed Sep 09 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: So.... - Sat Sep 12 20:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: So... what was your life back in Suna like before you met me? - Sat Sep 12 22:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Wasn't that lucrative. - Sat Sep 12 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: It was...average.. - Sat Sep 12 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Huh. I lived the life of a rich person. Graduated when I was thirteen. Still lazed off for another five years or so, then I started to become more interested. I only became a shinobi because my parents wanted me to. - Sat Sep 12 22:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Guess you could say my life was and has been boring. - Sat Sep 12 22:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) gave him a quick look. "Pftugh.." she snarked. "You're a sad individual." she said closing the book in front of her.* - Sat Sep 12 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I don't have a motive for anything. I don't exactly see who I need or want to protect. Other than my daughter. Eitherways, didn't ask for her either. - Sat Sep 12 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Why's not having a goal make me sad? - Sat Sep 12 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Because then you're just there....you have no purpose on this Earth. You are needed less than the ants outside. - Sat Sep 12 22:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hn.. I wouldn't consider the two things I think about 'goals'. But... someday I want to be the God of Shinobi. Not just one of the greats. -The- great. I want to gain power. Regardless of the cost. - Sat Sep 12 22:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Then that just makes you a sad fool. - Sat Sep 12 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: A sad fool is someone who doesn't have the instinct needed to achieve goals like that. I do. - Sat Sep 12 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozui D. Kimura(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Call me what you want. None the less, if I am wrong about what I am. If I'm too much of a fool to not notice it, then I thank you for being here to guide me from my foolishness. - Sat Sep 12 22:42:08 2015
