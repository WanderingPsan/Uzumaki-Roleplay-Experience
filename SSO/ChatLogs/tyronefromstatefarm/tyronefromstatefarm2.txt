"Hello all, it's a pleasure to meet you here. "* - Thu Dec 10 01:51:47 2015

"I've only recently decided to stop being a hermit. It tends to dampen one's sense of....admiration for nature." He stated, placing his hands together in a calm fashion.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) Concentrating the energy in his hand, it quickly transformed into electricity as it darted out from the tips of his fingers. They flew at the wall, burning and cracking the paint that covered the walls of the house. Without hesitating, he lifted his hand up into the air, creating spears of pure darkness above him. With a quick descension of his arm, the spears flew across the room, impaling themselves against the same wall before dispersing.* - Thu Dec 10 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) Could feel the rush of energy within him. A desire to push himself, to release this pent of frustration.

"Soon...I will have unlimited poiwer!" she shouted, a contrast from his rather quiet personality. The lightning rushed towards the plant, frying it rather quickly. His crystal blue eyes staring at the life leaving the plant. "Very good."* - Thu Dec 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) continued to release the surge of dark electricity from his hand, Its tendrils of energy torpedoing towards the already murdered plant.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) reappeared onto the scene, a small bead of sweat placed precariously on his forehead.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Secret. - Thu Dec 10 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Why? - Thu Dec 10 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Cause I can do that - Thu Dec 10 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: . . . - Thu Dec 10 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) spaced out a bit. "Right...Okay...So...what can you tell me?" he asked, his hands slipping into the rather deep pockets of his robes. His gloved hands clenched slightly, hidden away from all to see. "I like secrets." he added, just because.* - Thu Dec 10 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) squinted slightly. "Right....I like you....Mysterious but at the same time....approachable....What was your name again?" he asked, knowing full well what the man's name was, but just wanted to hear him say it one more time....for clarity.* - Thu Dec 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Shabalabadingdong. - Thu Dec 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Shabala-....I'm going to call you Dong. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: So....What do you do for fun here? - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Panty Raids. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: I don't see many women. - Thu Dec 10 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: You just go to search man. - Thu Dec 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Seems like a hassle. - Thu Dec 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) sighed, realizing that this village seemed about as redeemable as a hooker. Without a single gesture, he turned his back on the remaining people there and left towards the southern portion of the village.* - Thu Dec 10 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) slowly made his way towards the rather large body of water. His vision focused on the trail that led there, rather than those that were already there. A quick glance at the water caused him to quickly realize he wasn't going to be alone on this meditative quest. His crystal blue eyes locked onto each individual there, taking a quick mental note. *Ugh....people..* he thought as he approached the edge of the water. "Evening." he stated, a sense of calmness in his voice.* - Thu Dec 10 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm...Can I ask a favor? - Thu Dec 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Me? of course. - Thu Dec 10 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) whispers: Could you by chance give us a bit of privacy for 20 minutes,? I know that's a massive request, but i'l do you any favor if you help me out. - Thu Dec 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: What's your name? - Thu Dec 10 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: They call me Ziare, of the Linkyazhi clan. - Thu Dec 10 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) gave a rather warming smile, his gaze shifting towards the girl for merely a second. "Alright, Ziare of the Linkyzhi clan. Consider me gone. " he said with a politeful nod. "I'll remember you." he said, raising his hand, pulling his black gloved hand from his pocket. He would give a farewell wave before disappearing back into the village.* - Thu Dec 10 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) made his way towards the land south of Kumogakure, it was barren at first glance, a long stretch of land deemed wealthy with coasts. Making his way towards the dock that seemed to be there out in the open, an oddity amongst the bland. Standing at its center, he lifted his hand high into the air. Streams of lightning seemed to easily flow out from the tips of his fingers, crackling and sounding with each second he held it..

After a moment's rest, he placed his hands together, channeling his inner darkness. "This land will make a great place for my practice...my teachings.....my castle." he stated under his breath, who knew if someone was listening. With an outstretch of his arms, the darkness seemed to gether furiously. "Let the darkness eat those who are not worthy."

As the darkness gathered in his hands, he knelt down before placing his palms onto the dock's wooden surface. A rush of darkness escaped him, enveloping a large portion  of space in front of him. The darkness spread into the water, causing its surface to take on the property of acid. Once the darkness passed, a few fish appeared, dead from the power.* - Thu Dec 10 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) watched the horrifically pleasant view as he stood up from his knelt position. "Marvelous...marvelous.."he muttered, placing both hands together once more. As the energy began to course through his body, he would begin to separate his hands. The dark energy rushing towards his open palms. "They will follow my creed." he declared before slamming both hands onto the surface of the dock once more. A wave of darkness eminated from his person as it stretched out over the sea. The wave of darkness brought nothing but a smile on his face. "Go my precious magic..." he whispered out into the ocean. 

Outstretching his hand, a sudden rush of electricity would be sent forward, the several tendrils of electricity stretching across the open air. This surge of energy releasing itself from Rotori's body. "Yes....Yes..." he thought as his Dark Spears formed above his person. They would remain stationary for a moment before releasing themselves onto the dock, impaling the wooden surface before dispersing. * - Thu Dec 10 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) made his way towards mansion once more, hoping that this journey would in fact prove fruitfull. As he walked amongst the earthen terrain, he eventually found himself looking at two individuals with whom he had never spoken with. Unsure if they were in fact having a conversation, Rotori waited.* - Thu Dec 10 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Hello? - Thu Dec 10 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ...... - Thu Dec 10 17:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Do you know where Eiyu might be? - Thu Dec 10 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Right. I knew that. Was testing you. - Thu Dec 10 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) 's eyes widened slightly, having not expected for the man to respond; being that this village seemed as active as a ninety year old. "Hello there, so you must be Eiyu, the Raikage. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Rotori, and I see a fortuitous future for this village. Might I request some work?" He asked wanting to get this village some well-needed money.* - Thu Dec 10 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) tilted his head a bit. "Hmm? I do not have a craft." he stated clearly, before clasping both of his gloved hands. His crystal blue eyes seemed to shimmer slightly before he spoke once more, "I'm from here, Kumogakure of course." He laughed for a second before returning to his relaxed demeanor. "I was looking for work, missions, something to improve this village."* - Thu Dec 10 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Then your S rank is kill Sanoke. - Thu Dec 10 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) willingly took the missions assigned to him. A polite bow was performed, before the young man gave a slight wink towards the Raikage. "It's been a pleasure." he commented, turning to leave.* - Thu Dec 10 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) made his way towards the shop which was designated to give him an order of flowers that required delivery. A bit annoyed at the fact that he had to deliver flowers, he himself, but at the same time understanding of the circumstances. Within minutes, he had received the dozen roses that would create the bouque he was tasked on delivering.

A quick glance at the card showed they were from a man named Ziare, destined to meet their way towards his beloved. Holding onto the wrapping that bound the stems together, he made his way through the village, hoping to find the girl in which he could finish this task.

At the lake's edge, a young woman was seen, baring every description written down about the target. Without hesitating, Rotori rushed over to her, giving her a polite bow and greeting. After introductions, he politely handed her the flowers and expressed from whom they came causing a smile to appear on her face. "Have a lovely day, fair lady." he said before departing.* - Thu Dec 10 20:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) Began to quickly head for the village's boarder, tired of waiting for nothing to happen. THe Raikage had said the village was bustling with livelyness, but even someone lik Rotori knew this to be false. Before long, the young man would have already departed.* - Fri Dec 11 13:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: omit - Fri Dec 11 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) smirked, having seen the girl perform a technique that created a clone of herself. "Should I muster up the courage to join in?" he questioned as she walked through the gates.* - Fri Dec 11 14:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Not Suna here...mm...  - Fri Dec 11 14:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) smirked ever so slightly. *I still don't understand if coming here was a good idea or not...Anyways...* his train of thought seemed to rush onwards. He crossed his arms before turning to exit along with the red-headed girl, not wanting to really deal or care about any of the events that were about to transpire.

*I wonder if they will know it's just a clone and not the real girl....Oh well..* he thought before finally exiting the room.* - Fri Dec 11 14:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Hmmm.... - Fri Dec 11 14:46:33 2015
