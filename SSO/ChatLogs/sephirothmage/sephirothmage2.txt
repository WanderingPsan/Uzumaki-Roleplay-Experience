"....Mrm."* - Tue Dec  8 11:30:20 2015

"Ah.. I'm not sure about going on a date.... maybe we could hang out, but.." She shrugs- as she reaches and unseals a small pen from a tiny piece of paper- that she taps against her chin for a moment, thinking as she reaches for another scroll from inside her robe- and starts to doodle on it nervously.

"Ah.... anyway... what's this about a group meal?" She inquires softly.* - Tue Dec  8 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) coughs a few times as she walks towards the field, humming gently.

"Ah..?" She murmurs as she looks around quietly, scratching her head.* - Wed Dec  9 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and smiles peacefully as she walks into the Arena, chuckling softly as she looks around, humming warmly.

"Ah... don't worry, alright?" The woman says softly. "I'm sure that Mister Anbu doesn't mean to scare you, mrm. He's just trying to be firm and supprtive, yeah! So don't worry.. calm down- take your time... and think on what you want to say, mhrm?"* - Wed Dec  9 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) walks in and bows, smiling gently.

"Ah... I was just coming to turn in one of those missions from the other day... although, I still haven't found anyone to spar with.." She admits- blushing faintly as she shifts to lean against a wall near the Hokage, smiling peacefully.

"Ah.... sorry. Ah.... Is there anything you need, while I'm here?" She inquires gently.* - Wed Dec  9 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and bows her head- speaking softly.

"Ah.. I wouldn't mind just keeping you company- I can study while we talk." She offers with a gentle smile- as she reaches into her robe, and pulls out a small book- humming gently.

"Ah.. if that's alright."* - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and nods, holding the book at her side rather than moving to begin reading it, as she nods slowly.

"Ah, I see... that's fine, sure- we'll call it a date!" She says with a bright, naive, innocent little smile as she holds her book close.* - Wed Dec  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently- blushing lightly at the Hokage taking her hand, then nodding.

"Ah, s-sure! Lead the way then, Lady Hokage!" She says gently- a bright smile on her face and a gentle gleam in her eyes.* - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently as she sits down inside the tea shop- quietly lowering herself into the seat and humming gently- as she looks towards the counter- and waves someone over.

"Ah, so... was there something you wanted to talk about, or..?"* - Wed Dec  9 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly at those questions- scratching the back of her head. 

"Ah.. I've actually lived in this village all my life.." She admits softly- smiling gently. "And as for my life.. it's not been very exciting, I have to admit... I've just always been a very studious individual- and eventually.. after I stumbled into Fuuinjutsu a year or so ago.. I decided to become a Shinobi- and so.. well, here I am!" She says with a bright smile.* - Wed Dec  9 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and nods- accepting the other womans words as she reaches for her own cup of tea- mimicking the other womans motions as she blows away the steam, before taking a long sip.

She sets it down and smiles gently.

"Ah.. I see, Genjutsu..? Mrm... I've considered that as well- but..." She trails of, shrugging. "I never found anywhere to learn any, so.."* - Wed Dec  9 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and shrugs- smiling gently.

"Ah... well.." She chuckles at that. "Both are interesting schools.. I also have some interest in the medical fields- and... to be honest...? My body is very suited for Taijutsu, but.. I have no real interest.."* - Wed Dec  9 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly, nodding her own agreement before taking a sip.

"Mrm... I don't know why- I just don't seem to get tired until I've either just trained really hard... or been awake for days, you know?" She explains with a gentle smile.* - Wed Dec  9 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Interesting.......can I s-see....? - Wed Dec  9 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and nods, stepping back. She finishes her tea, sets down the cup- and steps back, cutting her thumb on her teeth before turning to slam her bleeding hand into the ground.

There's a puff of smoke, a surge of chakra- and a sleek black Doberman barks as it pants happily, tongue wagging cheerfully from the dog's mouth as she hugs it around the neck and grins, petting it and scratching it's ears.

"Ah, this is my freind."* - Wed Dec  9 08:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) appears from the shadows of the resturant..!

No, she walks out from behind the counter and sighs, hanging up an apron and stretching out; apparently she has a part time job here..? She turns upon recognizing Asteroth vaugely from the Hokage's office.

"Hrm..? Oh, Miss Asteroth- hello!" She says brightly.* - Thu Dec 10 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently, nodding. She's reaching under a counter for her robe- making her usual figure beneath it visible. She's a beautifully well built specimen; though perhaps lacking in real definition or tone, she seems to be passively fit without trying.

Then she slides her usual Kimono on and sighs gently.

"Mrm, part time. Gotta pay the bills somehow, with how rarely the Kage hands out missions, and how poorly low ranking ones pay, you know?" She says warmly, scratching her head, then looking between Asteroth and the man at the table with her.

"Ah, I'd like to talk more- but if I'm interupting something, just say so, yeah?"* - Thu Dec 10 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly at Asteroth's words and nods. She tugs her robe around her body tighter and smiles gently as she's looked up and down. Her form is, as noted- incredibly feminine in a deeply, deeply soft way.

"Mrm.... I suppose you're right about that... or, maybe if I just ask more often.." She trails of, coughing a fewt imes, scratching her chin and smiling gently.

"...Ah... I guess from the way you put it.... you don't much approve of Miss Rias... I guess I can see why." She admits softly- smiling gently. "And.. I see. Ah.... was the owner always so.." She grimaces with distaste. 

"Rude?" she says quietly- making sure she's not heard as she steps closer, and smiles gently.

"Ah.. and.. do you mind if I sit down?"* - Thu Dec 10 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and nods- the hostility flying right over the innocently warm girls head as she nods, smiling gently. She turns towards one of the actual waiters, and waves the woman over.

"Hai, Nadine!" She says- before turning to Asteroth. "Ah... so, what do you want then?" She asks cheerily, still standing nearby without actually moving to sit down. There's a warm gleam in her eyes as she stands by, hands crossed before her as the waitress walks up and waits for an order.

She seems used to accepting other's being demanding with a general ablomb!* - Thu Dec 10 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles softly and passes the order onto the normal waitresses; who shift to walk away, taking the order. She shifts to move- sitting down next to Asteroth delicately.

She nods quietly, smiling warmly.

"Ah...I suppose you're not at all wrong, no..... Konoha is a very... quiet, town. I like it here, but.. it is boring, yeah.." She admits with a soft chuckle as she arranges her robe carefully. 

"...Still.. it is my home. I was born here.. raised here... I've never been anywhere else- and now that I'm a Shinobi, I have to stay here anyway, mhrm."* - Thu Dec 10 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently as she listens quietly, arms crossed over her lap as she soaks in the other womans words- and nods slowly.

"Mrm.. I apreciate the quiet for my studies... but a lot of that does sound like good ideas, mhrm!" She says brightly, leaning into the table and thinking quietly. "Ah... so... what is it you do around here to relieve boredome, then..? I mean.. there has to be something you can do around here, yeah?" She says warmly.

"If you had /nothing/ to do, after all, you'd be somewhere else, right?" She offers warmly.* - Thu Dec 10 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and nods slowly, scratching her chin.

"Ah... you don't like having attention on you- well.. except for good attention, I suppose.... but at the same time.." She trails of, scratching her chin and smiling peacefully. "You like having something to keep your own attention on.. Mrm.." She trails of, thoughtfully.

"Sound's like you need a hobby, or a project to work on! Mrm.." She trails of, thinking quietly as she leans forwards on her elbows- smiling gently.

"Also sounds kind of sneaky, really... like to watch things from the shadows, huh..?" She trails of, grinning queitly. "Mrm... Still. I can understand. It's stressfull to have lots of attention on you....but it's awful to be bored, huh?"* - Thu Dec 10 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Eh... - Thu Dec 10 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and nods calmly. There is, of course, no food for her- she ordered none. At the question, she chuckles softly.

"Ah... in this resturant? I wait tables and clean.. in Konoha..? Well.. I'm a Genin. I practice Fuuinjutsu, so far... ah, summoning specifically." She explains with a peaceful smile. "Admitably.. so far, I mostly just clean up things.... and take notes on meetings." She says softly- coughing awkwardly.

"I'm not much, really..." She admits softly, blushing gently as she scratches her chin.* - Thu Dec 10 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Fuck that guy. I should go find his friends and kill them.. - Thu Dec 10 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: Ah.. everyone here seems so nice and freindly.. - Thu Dec 10 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes even more at the womans egotistical words, scratching her head.... then nodding, smiling peacefully as she breathes in and out- then nods and she giggles.

"Mrm...Ah, I s-suppose so....I guess I should just... Mrm.. find some more things to do.." She admits softly- scratching her head and chuckling softly. "Ah... I mean... I'm sure that one day... I'll be very strong.... even if.. I'm not really right now.."* - Thu Dec 10 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..? - Thu Dec 10 07:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Kill yourself.. - Thu Dec 10 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: A-ah..? I see, Osuda... H-hai! - Thu Dec 10 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't know you were a goddess.. - Thu Dec 10 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: Of course I will... I have to, for my family and my home... to make Konoha great again.. - Thu Dec 10 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.... R-right.. - Thu Dec 10 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I could never abandon my Dogs.... even if it's not what I'm the best at... though, I might branch out into other fields.. - Thu Dec 10 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Eventually. - Thu Dec 10 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's pretty good. I was just going to say not to accidentally kick anyone into a fence..or anything.~ - Thu Dec 10 07:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Something you know she'd like as a present? - Thu Dec 10 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Dec 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: A present? - Thu Dec 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe I should go ask her what she wants? - Thu Dec 10 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods calmly, smiling as she pushes herself up to stand.

"Mhrm! Maybe- or, if you know some kind of thing she likes already.." She shrugs and smiles, chuckling softly. 

"If you want, I could help- I know my way around town pretty well, if you need to find something.. but, I might not be able to if it's something really odd.."* - Thu Dec 10 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Thanks, I'll think about it. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're pretty helpful. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I do my best to be! - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Watch out for a woman from Sunagakure.. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says:   :D - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Huh? - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She seemingly likes war. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She's also pretty odd looking.. - Thu Dec 10 07:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kind of chubby, and wields a sword.. - Thu Dec 10 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I see.. - Thu Dec 10 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right! Go get them! - Thu Dec 10 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns to skip out of the resturant, giggling!* - Thu Dec 10 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) drops to the floor in the arena...

And begins to calmly do push ups. She has trouble lifting herself.. but at the same time, she's in stellar shape; her body almost naturally perfect, in some ways.

As she starts to repeat push ups- one after the other. She grunts quietly as she strains herself; but works through the strain calmly, grunting again and again as she does so- moving in steady, consistent reps. * - Thu Dec 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) wakes up- stirring from where she had meshed in with the Arena floor due to being covered entirely by her robe- and rises. She yawns and stretches, having passed out doing push ups last night.

"Mrm.."* - Thu Dec 10 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) looks on, rubbing her eyes and stretching- yawning out.

"Huh...? Whasgoin on..?"* - Thu Dec 10 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. . .what are the odds she'll teach me. . . - Thu Dec 10 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm..? Ah.... someone is teaching the Hokage... I see... Mrm. - Thu Dec 10 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hey, Ah. . .Lera? Yea. . .that's it. . .perhaps when you're done teaching her, I could talk you into helping me out? Trilliam isn't going fast enough. .  - Thu Dec 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh...I guess? - Thu Dec 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh. . .sweet, thanks. - Thu Dec 10 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok, and Akechi... no matter what rank or age you are you never stop learning - Thu Dec 10 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah. Theres always something new. - Thu Dec 10 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Also congradulations on making Chuunin - Thu Dec 10 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? Of cou- Huh? Ah.... what? I'm a Genin.. Oh! You're speaking to this Miss Lera, of course. - Thu Dec 10 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) rubs the back of her head sheepishly, smiling warmly as she looks on. She stretches out and yawns- still smiling brightly.

"Ah, anyway... I should go continue my Fuuinjutsu studies, probably.."* - Thu Dec 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Fuuinjutsu huh...been meaning to pick that up...when I can be bothered. - Thu Dec 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Dec 10 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Mrm... I'm a Summoner, mhrm. - Thu Dec 10 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: No chuunin for me. - Thu Dec 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im refering to you Akechi... - Thu Dec 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns and scratches her head sheepishly- squinting at Rias.

"...Wait, but... I haven't attended any kind of exam.... and I don't know anything exceptional, just basic Fuuinjutsu.... you're kidding, right?"* - Thu Dec 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: She made some random girl a chuunin?  - Thu Dec 10 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. Weird. - Thu Dec 10 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Nope... you have a recconmondaion from Osuda. Also I need more ranks - Thu Dec 10 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: That or do you wish to actually test your skills? - Thu Dec 10 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head, frowning at that news.

"I mean... I'm sure I can handle the paperwork, but.... while I think I am responsible enough- I... Miss, I /know/ I'm not /nearly/ strong enough... not yet. I don't think there's a single person in this village who couldn't defeat me, as I lack any combat applicable abilities or talents, apart from having hidden weaponry!" She says- sounding confused as she furrows her brow.

"...Ah... I mean.." She trails of- uncertain what more to say.* - Thu Dec 10 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well you can test that on the upcoming chuunin exams - Thu Dec 10 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.... as you say, Miss Hokage... - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: It will be held in Sunagakure - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm...I'll be taking part~ - Thu Dec 10 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I see... - Thu Dec 10 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Be gentle with me~ - Thu Dec 10 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Dec 10 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: What kind of weird village did I walk into? - Thu Dec 10 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) winces as she reaches into her robe and extracts a small book- which she crouches to set down on the floor in front of herself. She looks terrified for... perhaps understandable reasons! As she begins to read from the book; while doing push ups. Clearly intent on getting ready as quickly as possible as she procedes to work out while occasionally shifting to turn a page with one arm while holding herself up with the other.

She's soon sweating- but seems to have little issue pushing on despite that!* - Thu Dec 10 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Heh - Thu Dec 10 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tch. . .Everyone is working but me. . . - Thu Dec 10 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Should change that. . . - Thu Dec 10 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Thu Dec 10 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) continues her push up reps- pausing only to wave one handed at Niga.

"Ah.. huff.. Hello!" She greets him- before turning a page of the book perchedb efore her face, against the ground- and then returning to her push ups; grunting as she continues to strain her generally weak limbs... but her inhuman constitution allowing her to push on in spite of everything!* - Thu Dec 10 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Training. - Thu Dec 10 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Lera is helping her out. - Thu Dec 10 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Damn, I need to go chill or something. Feeling off today. - Thu Dec 10 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. huff.. you big.. Huff... - Thu Dec 10 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Oh, him. - Thu Dec 10 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) lifts her right hand to shake as a fist at nigen, before returning to her push ups.* - Thu Dec 10 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I be they'd be good together. - Thu Dec 10 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hahaha. - Thu Dec 10 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Rahh! I'm nowhere near ready for a Chuunin exam! - Thu Dec 10 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you don't feel you're ready. Don't take it.. - Thu Dec 10 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm sure you'll do fine. - Thu Dec 10 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Huff!  - Thu Dec 10 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Turning down such.. huff.. an option... huff... is not an option! - Thu Dec 10 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Huff! - Thu Dec 10 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's the spirit.~ - Thu Dec 10 21:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Rawr! - Thu Dec 10 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) continues her push ups- grunting, her eyes almost ablaze with some inner glow!

She seems to be filled with DETERMINATION.* - Thu Dec 10 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well, I'll let you guys continue with that.~ - Thu Dec 10 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Dec 10 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was waiting for Lera to finish helping her. . .and lack of motivation. - Thu Dec 10 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ah. - Thu Dec 10 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well, don't wait too long. You might get rusty.~ - Thu Dec 10 22:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure Hun I will train on what I have now - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Now to master this.. - Thu Dec 10 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) grunts as she continues her push ups- grunting out the number she's reached with her incredible stamina and sheer determination. Her tiny muscles are bulging from the strain, and her entire body has begun to burn as she continues the repititions. (3)

"S-sixty two.." She murmurs- as she keeps her eyes on the Fuuinjutsu text beneath her. Her muscles strain with each repiition- but she continues with a certain determination. (4)

It's solid and firm- as she keeps on going up to a full hundred repititions of push ups.. then shifts.

"Hufff... I swear, if I wasn't having to go do these Chuunin exams..." She grumbles quietly, as she adjusts her posture to be sitting upright- and looks towards Rias,s cratching her head.

"...Hey, would you maybe... be willing to help me out, by teaching me some low ranked Genjutsu?"* - Thu Dec 10 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure I dont mind love - Thu Dec 10 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I'd really apreciate it. - Thu Dec 10 22:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Wih your push ups - Thu Dec 10 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I just did a hundred... - Thu Dec 10 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: So I figured I would focus more on studying for a little bit, then do a hundred sit ups after a little rest. - Thu Dec 10 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) rubs the back of her head sheepishly.

"Ah, but you have that Jutsu to focus on, so.. I guess I'll do the situps now, while you train with that.."* - Thu Dec 10 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Th-There a-are going to be...Ch-Chuunin exams..? - Thu Dec 10 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes im Sunagakure - Thu Dec 10 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No sweetie... come - Thu Dec 10 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shifts- she'd been just about to lower herself into situp posture, but upon being adressed further.. smiles and nods, shifting to stand up and walk towards Rias, scratching her head as she tucks away her Fuuinjutsu text.

"Ah... Alright then!" She says brightly as she approaches.* - Thu Dec 10 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: O-Oh...G-Guess i'll just have to...Mm...Wait here or g-go watch the Ch-Chuunin exams... - Thu Dec 10 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I've ah...made some theoretical study of Genjutsu, but I don't know any yet... - Thu Dec 10 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I don't want to be a chuunin...then i'd have to lead a squad...I can't do that... - Thu Dec 10 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: I don't want to be a Chuunin, but someone had to sign me up for it.. - Thu Dec 10 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-I'll just give our village s-support...Since I-I can't take part in the e-exam... - Thu Dec 10 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I'm too weak anyway...everyone would laugh at me and hate me when I make a fool out of myself. - Thu Dec 10 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok are you ready? - Thu Dec 10 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, Hai! - Thu Dec 10 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods slowly- soaking in the woman's words and accepting them. She listens calmly- as she looks into the Hokage's eyes and clasps her hands together- bowing calmly before lifting her gaze towards Rias and smiling brightly..

And then the handseals are formed. She gulps- as she see's darkness around herself- then looks up.. and beholds; a huge orb of flame falling towards her. At once she is convinced utterly of the illusions reality- but she still remembers that she was being educated on Genjutsu.

"This is..."* - Thu Dec 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I should just go off to the side and train...the Hokage won't hate me for being weak...right..? - Thu Dec 10 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods slowly- looking around quietly at the illussion around her. She nods slowly, as she soaks in Rias's words. She nods again, as the illussion is released. 

"Ah... I see... Alright. So... I use the Handseals you just did... and..?" She trails of- as she squints hard and attempts to replicate the technique with minimal guidance and- of course...

Initially, nothing happens; chakra shunting itself from her; though, suprisingly... her reserves are large, for a Chuunin.

"Mrm.. Ah, I guess I.. Hrm.."* - Thu Dec 10 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes... actually would you like a scroll of it? Are you more of a reader? - Thu Dec 10 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.... A scroll or direct teaching- whatever is more convienyent, I guess! - Thu Dec 10 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) catches it and bows, accepting the scroll with a smile.

"Ah... thank you, Hokage-Sama." She says gently. * - Thu Dec 10 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sets the scroll down as she shifts a short distance- much like she earlier did her Fuuinjutsu text.

"Ah... I'll be sure to study this a lot while I work out some more, mhrm!" She says brightly- as she squats back down into the push up posture- the scroll laid out before her eyes as she pushes up and down...

Eyes reading on the technique she was offered, as she grunts and quietly begins to strain; her muscles resuming the burn quickly; having rested while she was being lectured by Rias; as she grunts and begins to read- humming calmly as she does.* - Fri Dec 11 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. Miss Hokage... huff.. - Fri Dec 11 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Didn't you have a new jutsu to practice, as well? - Fri Dec 11 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *Yawn* - Fri Dec 11 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Its really boring today... Ughh.... - Fri Dec 11 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea, but I want to see you two spar - Fri Dec 11 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) grunts- as she continues to push herself up and down- both arms on the ground as she pushes up and down.. up and down. It's persistent, boring motion as she works. She pauses, however- at the suggestion of a spar.

"Ah..? Me and who..?"* - Fri Dec 11 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: You and Kai - Fri Dec 11 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. - Fri Dec 11 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: - - Fri Dec 11 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) grunts, pushing herself up to stand slowly- then turns to look and smile at Kai, waving.

"Ah... I see.."* - Fri Dec 11 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I will count to 3 to begin - Fri Dec 11 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) frowns gently, scratching her head as she steps forwards.

"Ah... a-are you.. okay?" She says- looking more concerned than anything.* - Fri Dec 11 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 3.... - Fri Dec 11 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Miss Hokage, he really doesn't seem willing.. - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Actually, he seems afraid.. - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It'd be wrong. - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 2...... - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-Don't... - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) realizes with inner horror that the Hokage does not care about consent.

She fears for her anus.

"Ah... Kai.. don't worry. Just come at me with whatever you cam, yeah?"* - Fri Dec 11 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 1......... - Fri Dec 11 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm should I heed this warning? - Fri Dec 11 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) frowns. She doesn't make any kind of advance on her foe- because she wants to be freinds. She holds up her hands with an innocent smile- and speaks gently.

"Ah... Kai.... don't worry, yeah? I don't want to hurt you either.."* - Fri Dec 11 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Don't stop.. - Fri Dec 11 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Fri Dec 11 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... sorry, it's just.. - Fri Dec 11 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ...He really seems like he doesn't want to fight at all. - Fri Dec 11 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Is he a shinobi? - Fri Dec 11 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I don't know... I assume so, if Miss kage wanted me to spar him.. - Fri Dec 11 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) frowns at the boy's apparent emotional collapse. She sighs- as she walks over to pat the man on the shoulder- frowning gently.

"Ah.... please, don't be sad.... I'm sorry, did we scare you..?" She says gently- her tone warm, almost motherly in it's gentle kindness.* - Fri Dec 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: .......What..has Konoha turned into...... - Fri Dec 11 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: You all are weak... I need my family stronger... - Fri Dec 11 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: ....Ah... is this guy even a Shinobi..? - Fri Dec 11 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: ...It wouldn't have even been a spar, would it..? - Fri Dec 11 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Fri Dec 11 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... apologies, Miss Hokage.... I just... - Fri Dec 11 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Don't think it would have been a fight, if he didn't want to spar at all... - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ....Sorry. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I only want to make you all stronger but since noone wants to spar I guess I will go do paper work or something - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: .. No, I do want to spar.. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: But... - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It's pointless if the other person can't or won't fight. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: OKAY OKAY! - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: You don't learn anything from bullying someone who doesn't want to fight back. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Let's.. make a deal, Hokage-SAMA!!!! - Fri Dec 11 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm? - Fri Dec 11 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: If....If... I spar her... you stay and watch?... I'm not much, but its still training?... - Fri Dec 11 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Nope... - Fri Dec 11 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) is thrown back- her jaw snapping sickeningly as her attempt at comforting him is met with brutal violence. Her nose splinters into her face, and blood sprays from her face- hiding it as she sways back. She nearly blacks out from pain- but as she sways back... she steadies herself and plants her feet. Her head jerks back into steadying itself and she frowns.

Her reaction is fluid. She forms a series of handseals- and to his perception, initially.. sand, explodes into a small duststorm around him as she enacts a basic Genjutsu- swaying backwards as blood hides her face- several broken facial bones and a dislocated jaw her reward for attempting kindness...

But sheer, stubborn, DETERMINATION, keeps her standing.* - Fri Dec 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Fri Dec 11 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: ...Oh-Oh... A fight... - Fri Dec 11 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Well... looks like you got your wish, Hokage... Now they're fighting, *sigh* - Fri Dec 11 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Violence, Violence, Violence. - Fri Dec 11 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Grover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: hmm - Fri Dec 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Another one?... I swear, tho-Woah... those look tasty!!! - Fri Dec 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Fri Dec 11 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really now... - Fri Dec 11 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) frowns. She cannot see what she is making him see- as she continues to back away from the boy lashing out at thin air vicously; attacking thin air to no effect. She gulps- but holds the illussion with a frown as he rages at thin air.

"Ah... Hokage-Sama... I guess I'll hold him like this until he tires himself out and passes out..?" She suggests softly- unaware that this is basically the equivalent of intense psychological torture, and completely ignorant of potential side effects.....

As she holds the Genjutsu and feels a part of her soul shrivel up and die in response to the boys screams of pain and suffering, his rage and pain making her sad- as she continues to hold herself steady, staring at him even as blood streams down her face..

"Ugh.."* - Fri Dec 11 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) grunts- wincing as she releases the Jutsu and nods, swaying back and forth.

"Ah... H-hai... apologies, Hokage-Sama... I panicked when he hit me.. ugh.."* - Fri Dec 11 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) meanwhile, is rubbing her face- blood staining her hand. The flow has stopped; she's in no danger of bleeding out... and with her incredible heartiness, she's nowhere near passing out- at most a little lightheaded.. but damn, it hurts.

"Ugh....... Ah... sorry for the Genjutsu, but.. you almost went berserk when I went to try and cheer you up, so.. I panicked."* - Fri Dec 11 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) responds in her usual soft, gentle tone as she rubs her nose- herself feeling rather guilty about the fear Genjutsu she submitted him to.

"Ah... I forgive you. It hurt a lot, but.. I'm sure what I did hurt more. My apologies."* - Fri Dec 11 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Everyone is going to hate me after this...why did they try and force me to fight... - Fri Dec 11 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. - Fri Dec 11 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Anyway... Think its time for a... trip. - Fri Dec 11 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really.. - Fri Dec 11 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This was something else. - Fri Dec 11 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head- and then smiles, noddign warmly. She rememebrs his issue with being touched from before, smiling peacefully as she fights the urge to hug him down.

"Ah...As I said. I accept your apology fully... It's okay, and I hope we can be freinds after this, yeah?"* - Fri Dec 11 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently, and reaches out to shake his hand. Her grip is gentle and warm- and there's a simple.. softness, about her.

"Ah.... Mrm."* - Fri Dec 11 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I already have, so don't worry, yeah?~ - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: You will be forgiven for now but DONT let it happen again... - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trices(Ignacious) says: Rias. - Fri Dec 11 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes? - Fri Dec 11 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trices(Ignacious) says: I want more burger resturants in village - Fri Dec 11 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im I will see what I can do about that - Fri Dec 11 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs at the sheer emotional sadness that is every other thing Kai says. She wants to just grab him and hug him and tell him it'll all be okay...

But she knows he'd break her like a twig she did.

"..Ah.... Kai..... do you want to go hang out, maybe..?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: He.. seems like he could use a freind. - Fri Dec 11 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trices(Ignacious) says: no new friends no no no no - Fri Dec 11 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) holds out a hand for Kai to take- smiling peacefully and gently.

"Alright, then. I'll lead the way, if that's okay with you."* - Fri Dec 11 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) she smiles gently- almost Maternally- and shifts to lead him along. Her grip is gentle, not demanding or fierce. Just warm and soft as she hums peacefully.

"Ah... c'mon, let's go have some Tea... Ah, Hokage-Sama... I'll see you in a bit, mrm..? Oh.. does that fight count for that mission to spar someone else that I had earlier..?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..let's see..that was odd. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes you to behave - Fri Dec 11 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. of course! - Fri Dec 11 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) calmly smiles as she walks Kai into the little Ramen and Tea shop, siting down on a stool and smiling. She bandages her own nose quickly with some scrolls, and smiles softly.

"Ah.. so what do you want?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles peacefully and nods- ordering a glass of water for him, and a cup of tea for herself.

"Mrm...So. Is there anything you'd enjoy talking about, or like to discuss..?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods, continuing to just smile gently.

"Ah, I see... well, any questiosn for me..?" She inquires- wanting to ask different questions. Wanting to ask the boy who hurt him, who scared him. But...* - Fri Dec 11 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) tentatively reaches out a hand- but doesn't touch him; just frowning sadly... as she starts to speak softly.

"Sh... it's okay. You don't have to say anything... just... Shh. If you need to cry, you need to cry- if you need a hug, I can give you a hug.... please, just.. let me help." She says softly- before striking on an idea..!

She usually summons Dobermans- but... she shakes her head- Dobermans are adorable enough! She cuts her thumb and quickly focuses..

As, behind the boy- the most beautifully sleek, adorable looking Doberman pads up, tongue hanging out- eyes bright and cheerful, fur coat sleek and warm.

It's a puppy. She literally summoned a puppy to cheer him up.* - Fri Dec 11 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles peacefully back at her, sighing gently as she notices the tears.

"Please.... just.. trust me, okay..?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh.. d-didn't expect people to be here... Garsh... - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: ..... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: He's crying again?... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) as the boy begins to sob- she moves without thinking. She gently hugs him- and lets him cry into her shoulder as she wraps her arms around him. She's gentle, warm, soft. It's instinctual, almost- this little boy kicking up all her maternal instincts to try and help him as she pats his shoulders.

"Shh.. shh, it'll be okay... one day..."* - Fri Dec 11 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns- wincing. She'd just been getting him to open up a little, to let it all out- and this guy. This guy! She shakes her head at the Anbu agent- frowning as she looks at him.

"....Did you have to..?" She says with a frown.. sounding.. dissapointed, as she shifts to stand up and moves to follow Kai.* - Fri Dec 11 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Yare Yare daze.. - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) facepalms.

"...Mister Anbu, this isn't how you help someone open up.."* - Fri Dec 11 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Why not?..  - Fri Dec 11 03:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You shouldn't be soo timid about things, another thing. If it weren't me, you'd be dead for trying to attack someone. I'm too nice~, but I really wanted to sit down with you.. and Akechi. Talk a little, joke a little. Never meant for this to become serious, you're a little red in the face too, ahaha. - Fri Dec 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Point taken. - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Now I'm remembering why... I hated shinobi.. - Fri Dec 11 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs, rubbing her head.

"..I do talk and joke. But not during sserious situations where it's out of place.."* - Fri Dec 11 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: He needs to calm down... I-I just.. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm calm now, your words really helped me. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Please let me leave now. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: *voice* Why do you bother, leave the kid alone. He doesn't even want to bear the sight of you. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh*  - Fri Dec 11 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll just leave him alone.. Why did I even try to help? - Fri Dec 11 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) would indeed follow Kai, sighing warily. She pauses briefly to bow towards the Anbu agent- speaking softly before following Kai.

"Ah.. I'm sorry... he's just.. very emotionally unstable right now, clearly..'* - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh* - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles peacefully as she walks with him- sighing gently as they sit down. She nods slightly- speaking gently.

"I understand... he was just trying to help, but.... he wasn't going about it the right way, so it just upset you more, right?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) gently reaches out to hold him again- just like in the other resturant. She pats his shoulder as he turns away- and she speaks softly.

"...Sh.. It's okay. I don't mind, it's okay....  I want to help you- and if what you need is someone to lean on, someone to cry to..? I can be that person. If that's not what you want? Then fine... just.. let me help you." The older woman says- a gentle smile on her lips. She's in her early twenties, fully mature at this point..* - Fri Dec 11 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs softly, motherly instincts kicking in as she pats his back and rubs it gently- holding him gently as he leans into her shoulder; speaking gently and peacefully.

"Shh... Sh... I'm here... don't worry. There's nothing to be afraid of, here.."* - Fri Dec 11 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) hugs him- rubbing the small child's back gently.

"Sh.... you don't have to be alone. You can talk to people.... you don't have to ever be alone, if you don't want to be... you understand me..?" She says gently, warm and soft.* - Fri Dec 11 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) rubs his back gently- and sighs softly.

"But it's clear that being alone, isn't making you happy. If you are too afraid of losing people to reach out... you'll never be happy in the first place, you know..? It's not worth it, to not take those risks.."* - Fri Dec 11 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) rubs his back- and winces. She fights through the pain to keep talking- as even just the squeeze of his fingernails is enough to draw blood from her back. She breathes in and out as he hugs her- and she hugs back.

"....Well.. let me help you, then..."* - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently- blood hidden by her clothes as he leans back- and speaks softly.

"Because... helping people is just what I do, you know?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently, and pats his back.

"..You're welcome."* - Fri Dec 11 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Of course not. I promise. - Fri Dec 11 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...O-Okay... - Fri Dec 11 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Now... you feeling better? - Fri Dec 11 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Y-yeah...much...I-I forgot what th-this was like... - Fri Dec 11 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Mrm... - Fri Dec 11 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: He makes me so sadddd. - Fri Dec 11 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-do um...Mm... - Fri Dec 11 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: What? - Fri Dec 11 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-Do you think w-we could do this a-again..? - Fri Dec 11 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah. Sure. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) simply leans into it and smiles gently- sad that someone else is this sad, but glad to be comforting him.* - Fri Dec 11 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Y-you're a nice p-person Akechi...I-I wish I...Mm...I wish I had t-talked to you sooner. - Fri Dec 11 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... thank you. I wish you had talked to me sooner, too. - Fri Dec 11 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns, walking down the street, and smiles gently as she waves.

"Ah.. Kai, hello.."* - Sat Dec 12 00:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly, rubbing the back of her head.

"Ah... pretty tired, for once. I've been training a lot, lately..'* - Sat Dec 12 00:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and nods- chuckling softly.

"Yeah, yeah.."* - Sat Dec 12 00:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly, tucking her hands into her robe and holding eye contact with a gentle smile.

"Mrm... I was headed towards the Kage's office to see about getting some work done, then train some more."* - Sat Dec 12 00:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) (*Akechi chuckles softly, tucking her hands into her robe and holding eye contact with a gentle smile.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently, before turning to keep walking.* - Sat Dec 12 00:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I guess she's not in. - Sat Dec 12 00:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, guess so. - Sat Dec 12 00:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, I suppose so.. Mrm. - Sat Dec 12 00:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently as she turns to walk towards the training field- holding out a hand to hold hands with Kai calmly.* - Sat Dec 12 00:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly as they walk out into the training field- humming gently as she lets go of his hand upon entering... and then takes of her robe- setting it down and humming calmly.

She unrolls the cloak she wore over her Kimono- and behold...

It is festooned with Kunai, Shuriken, a few explosive tags- and some scrolls. She hums calmly, as she unfurls a scroll- and begins to work on sealing assorted weaponry into the scroll; smiling gently.

"Mrm.. So, how are you today?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly- humming gently as she pulls out of... nowhere, really... a folded up windmill. She hums calmly as she shifts to twist it out into full expanditure- before sealing that in it's own scroll entirely.

"That's good."* - Sat Dec 12 00:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly, as she hefts out a huge shuriken, this time- speaking calmly.

"Yes? What is it, Kai?" She inquires warmly as she moves to seal that away, too; huming calmly as she works to slide it into the scroll.* - Sat Dec 12 00:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and nods, smiling peacefully as she this time, sets a series of Kunai and shuriken on a scroll to seal them away; humming calmly as she does; working diligently and quietly.

"Yes? What is it, dearie?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) pauses her work to cross her hands over her lap- and with a gentle, motherly smile.. she shakes her head in the negative- stopping her usual chuckle.

"Mrm.... No. I think you're someone who was hurt, who needs help to get better.. but /wierd/..? No.. Sad, maybe.."* - Sat Dec 12 00:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and shrugs.

"Well... might be so... Mrm. Maybe. Other people might feel differently than me, you know..? Well... maybe you could try being the one to start conversations, maybe?" She suggests with a smile, as she begins to flow chakra through her system- practicing her basic technique for Genjutsu..* - Sat Dec 12 01:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shrugs at that- as she continues the basic chakra exercise- even holding the correct seal for her Genjutsu- but refusing to practice it /on/ anyone.

"Mrm... well, I can understand that- but.. if you don't want to be lonely, you have to learn how to deal with people, you know?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly, shaking her head and humming gently as she does. She continues the exercise, even as she speaks soothing, gentle words towards him.

"Mrm.... Life is made of risks, you know? If you never take any, you'll never get anywhere, you know? Mrm...."* - Sat Dec 12 01:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles peacefully- and nods calmly, legs crossed as she leans back, sliding the scrolls she has prepared into her robe again, before she dons it.

"Mrm... Maybe... just.. pick someone who seems nice, that you think you'd like to have as a freind... and try to talk to them, you know?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and nods.

"Mrm.. that's good, then!"* - Sat Dec 12 01:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: A-Are you d-done here..? - Sat Dec 12 01:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I suppose, for now.. - Sat Dec 12 01:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-Do you mind me c-coming again o-or have I annoyed you e-enough today..? - Sat Dec 12 01:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly at that, smiling warmly.

"Ah, it's fine. Sure, let's go together." She says warmly- holding out a hand again.* - Sat Dec 12 01:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Guess she's still out.. - Sat Dec 12 01:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Sat Dec 12 01:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly at that, squeezing his hand gently. She looks at him in a fashion akin to a little brother, these days...

"Mrm.... I'm not sure what you mean, by that.>"* - Sat Dec 12 01:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs gently at that- smiling warmly.

"Mrm.... I suppose it is a bit quiet, sometimes.."* - Sat Dec 12 01:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-I wish there were m-more people l-like you around... - Sat Dec 12 01:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Aw... that's very sweet of you to say. - Sat Dec 12 01:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? You okay? - Sat Dec 12 01:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm.... - Sat Dec 12 01:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) reaches over- patting him on the shoulder.

"...Hey, what's wrong, lil guy?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mmmmmm... - Sat Dec 12 01:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) looks down at the younger boy- and smiles gently, speaking in her most soothing tone.

"C'mon.. you can tell me. What's wrong?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently at the boy- and speaks softly.

"Mrm.. you're like the little brother I never had, you know..? I care about you. Mrm... you make me feel.. protective. Like I have to take care of you, you know?" She says warmly.* - Sat Dec 12 01:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently. She hugs him back warmly, not sure what else to do here- chuckling softly as she pats him on the back, holding him warmly.

"...You don't have to be afraid, or alone... understand?" She says warmly, patting his back gently, her motherly embrace holding him close as she leans into him in return, and crouches to rest her chin on his shoulder.
