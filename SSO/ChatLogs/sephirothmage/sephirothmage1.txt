<br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: There's really no need.. I mean.. unless you really want to... even so... - Wed Oct 14 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) sighs as she walks towards the crater that was once the mansion- then frowns.

"What's going on..?" The young genin murmurs- furrowing her brow curiously.* - Wed Oct 14 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? Oh, people. Yo! - Wed Oct 14 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) blinks at the narrowed eyes, and raises her hands defensively, coughing.

"Uh... sorry? I just.. was tryin to say hello- didn't realize you where in the middle of somethin."* - Wed Oct 14 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) sighs, rubbing the back of her head at the cold response- then turns to walk away.

"Jeez.. Sorry."* - Wed Oct 14 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) shudders quietly as she walks through the barrier; admitted entrance by the man standing guard. The young Senju Genin frowns quietly as she looks around, gloved hands held at her sides casually as she looks around- then notices the Kage.

"Ah.... Kage-Sama... what's going on here?" She says- furrowing her pale brow ever so slightly as she approaches.* - Wed Oct 14 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) nods slowly, sighing as she looks around the crater.. before shifting to bow to the Kage.

"Understood... ah. In that case.... I'd like to report for duty, as a freshly graduated Genin, Lady Raikage-Sama." She says- a serious expression on her face. Her headband is worn around her throat, like a cross between an animal's collar and a gorget, and her form is clad in a loose leather coat worn over a plain shirt.

"If there is anything that I could do, I'd be more than happy to."* - Wed Oct 14 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) says: I'd be happy to complete any kind of mission for the village, Kage-Sama. - Wed Oct 14 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Hn.... in that case.. - Wed Oct 14 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Finish it in a timely fashion, otherwise there isn't really a "deadline". - Wed Oct 14 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) bows her head obediently, clasping her hands together and beaming happily as she realizes that, for her first mission, she's being given something C Rank.

"Thank you, Kage-Sama. I will complete the mission as soon as I am able."* - Wed Oct 14 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) says: Guess I just need to get an axe to cut down the tree with.. - Wed Oct 14 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Good luck. - Wed Oct 14 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) says: ...Hai! - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mira(SephirothMage) thinks: ...Where am I going to get an axe to cut a tree down with.. - Wed Oct 14 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) after a short while of looking around town and haggling for a woodsmans axe, Mira is headed out on the road to look for a tree- any tree, really. She's eager, if a bit frustrated with the mission itself. Still- anything for the village, anything at all. So the Kumogakuran Senju heads out of the village, setting off along the road wtih a smile on her face and a spring in her step.e* - Wed Oct 14 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mira(SephirothMage) sets out on her treck with a gleam in her eyes and a smile on her lips, as the road soon begins to leave the villae behind her; as she hums cheerily while walking along the stone pathway. The woodaxe held in her hand is a hefty weight- she simply hopes that it's not of poor worksmanship...

As she then wonders about the other important thing about the trip. Where the hell will she find trees?* - Wed Oct 14 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) looks around the Kage's office and coughs a few times- smiling gently as she draws her cloak around herself- thinking quietly as she does. She looks around the room, and rubs the back of her head, smiling gently.

"Ah... hello..? I'm a recent academy graduate... I came to register?"* - Fri Dec  4 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hello - Fri Dec  4 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are you knew to the village? - Fri Dec  4 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) steps forwards and smiles gently, shaking her head.

"Ah.. no. Akechi Senju, it's a pleasure to meet you." She says gently- smiling. "Like I said.. I've only just graduated from the academy- but I've lived my entire life here."* - Fri Dec  4 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Welcome to Konoha miss... - Fri Dec  4 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. Hai - Fri Dec  4 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I just wanted to, you know. Come here and say hello, as a new Shinobi. - Fri Dec  4 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes a bit, scratching her head and smiling softly- chuckling faintly.

"Mrm... Ah... anyway, I guess that.. unless you need something, or have something you want to say... I should head out, or something..?" She murmurs softly.* - Fri Dec  4 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Akechi Senju? - Fri Dec  4 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, yes. - Fri Dec  4 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Proffession, uhm.. Fuuinjutsu and Summoning. - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well since you just started I want to congragulate you on a job well done - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... huh? - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blinks in suprise, still smiling in a vaugely innocently fashion.* - Fri Dec  4 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: My name is Rias and I am the hokage of Konoh - Fri Dec  4 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh, thats a very unique skill set - Fri Dec  4 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... a pleasure to meet you, Miss Hokage. Hrm..? Ah... - Fri Dec  4 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Thank you. I've always found sealing to be a very interesting art, and... then I ended up making a summoning contract with certain dogs, in the academy. - Fri Dec  4 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I will want to see your abilities later later - Fri Dec  4 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I'm glad you're saying that, but.. I'm really not that good.. - Fri Dec  4 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But yes while I am here and awake dont hesitate to ask me for anything - Fri Dec  4 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and nods, bowing her head gently and respectfully, a bright joy radiating from the young girl.

"Ah, thank you, Miss Hokage." She says brightly- scratching her chin. "Ah... I suppose from what you said, I'm the first Fuuinjutsu user in Konoha that you know of so far, or..? If so... I guess I won't be able to find a teacher.. ah, well.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No I have noone like that here - Fri Dec  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her chin and thinks.

"Ah, well.. I guess all I can ask you for right now is if there's any missions you'd like done.." She admits softly.* - Fri Dec  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm I have something - Fri Dec  4 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..? What is it? - Fri Dec  4 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods and smiles- catching the scroll and unfurling it.

"Ah.. cleaning detail..? I can do that, certainly..!" She says brightly- not even hesitating at the news of a dirty, unpleasant mission. She smiles warmly- then looks over at the other person in the office.

"Ah... I feel rude- it's nice to meet you too." She says warmly. "But.. I have work to go do, it seems!"* - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) cracks her knuckles as she advances into the hospital- looking around and smiling warmly as she does. She sighs as she coughs briefly- a cloud of dust flowing up around her.

She sighs at this- before moving to bite her thumb- spilling blood and slamming her hand down. What emerges from the seal is a sleek black Doberman. It barks at her- and she chuckles, reaching to scratch behind it's ears- before giving brief orders.

"Hai.... Could you look upstairs and take a look for anything dangerous? Thanks!" She says brightly- as the dog yips and turns to head away... before she moves to grab a feather duster from a closet.. and moves to brush away dust on counters..* - Fri Dec  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) cracks her shoulders as she stands up and looks around- smiling gently as she does. She continues to dust the counter- as her dog reports back, barking at her. She chuckles as she pauses dusting.

"Hrm? Somethings up? Well, lead the way then!" She says brightly as she follows the sleek black dog upstairs, cheerfully humming as she skips upstairs. What she finds- is that her dog found a batch of broken glass vials and strange liquids. She sighs and nods.

"Ahhh, yare yare daze... what a drag... " She murmurs, sighing as she shakes her head. "People shouldn't have left dangerous stuff here..!" She says with a frown- as she crouches to begin tidying up shards of glass, humming calmly as she brushes it all into a tray... which she dumps into a bin.. which she double bags.. which she gathers up with other stuff..

Humming cheerfully.* - Fri Dec  4 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) eventually finishes that- and spends a few more hours dusting, sweeping, and mopping floors- humming as she works tirelessly. She hums cheerily- her freakish stamina letting her just.. drift around working at cleaning the hospital bit by bit.* - Fri Dec  4 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) walks into the Hokage's office- but stops as she notices someone else is already in audience with the Hokage.* - Sun Dec  6 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes, do you need something? - Sun Dec  6 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and nods- bowing her head respectfully as she steps forwards.

"Ah. I finished that mission you assigned.. well, I finished it a good while ago, but I wasn't able to find you when I did.. or at all, up until now!"* - Sun Dec  6 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: The items will be handled in a week's time. In the meantime, is there anyone in Konoha looking to make a purchase? - Sun Dec  6 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and bows gently, clasping her hands together. Her robe-cloak hides her figure entirely behind it- but she seems from her face at least, to be very classically well formed as she straightens up.

"Ah.. and I believe last we spoke, you mentioned wanting to see what I could do at some point, yeah..?" She says gently, blinking a few times.* - Sun Dec  6 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: If not. I'll head on out. - Sun Dec  6 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ask this person here... - Sun Dec  6 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I wouldn't have any money to make a purchase with... - Sun Dec  6 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Sorry... - Sun Dec  6 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. Well what of you, young lass? I'm a craftman. - Sun Dec  6 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Mmm. Out of curiosity, what would you have asked for? - Sun Dec  6 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I can buy some for you if you really want something hun - Sun Dec  6 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Well... Honestly, I'm not sure.. I'm a Fuuinjutsu specialist, so.. I might have asked about some assorted weaponry to seal away into scrolls for later use... or maybe some kind of armor- I am kind of... frail, when it comes to being hit.. - Sun Dec  6 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ...Armor would be the most practical thing, but... - Sun Dec  6 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes slightly- as if flattered and slightly embarassed by this attention.

"Really, I don't want to be any kind of burden.." She says softly.* - Sun Dec  6 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ohhh, so cute... - Sun Dec  6 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I doubt it's any burden. - Sun Dec  6 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: This is your kage. - Sun Dec  6 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Armor is easy to make. I suppose you'd like light armor. - Sun Dec  6 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, I suppose so... then... yeah, something I could... wear without much issue, just in case someone aims at me in a fight, mhrm. - Sun Dec  6 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: As for 'assorted weapons.' What does that even mean? - Sun Dec  6 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) bites a lip- as if she is outright embarassed by being given charity like this..

"Ah.. that is, uhm.. if it wouldn't be any trouble, Hokage-Sama.. and I'm ah... sure I could make it up to you, somehow, eventually!" She says softly- before turning back to Marco and coughing.

"And well... Shuriken.. Kunai... small proctiles I can seal into scrolls for later use in traps, when I'm more experienced.."* - Sun Dec  6 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Think of special types of weapons hun - Sun Dec  6 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Like...hmmmm Kunai chained together as a net! - Sun Dec  6 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Shurikens and Kunais are trivial. - Sun Dec  6 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: A net? It'd be do-able. - Sun Dec  6 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Coupled with your fuuinjutsu, it can be used to catch your opponents off guard. - Sun Dec  6 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) coughs and thinks for a moment, scratching her head.

"Well.... Ah... something good for a Fuuinjutsu user.." She murmurs- as if thinking aloud. "Well... a net like that would be fine- though it'd be better if it was chained Shuriken then Kunai, more edges... n-not that I like hurting people!" She protests aloud- before thinking quietly.

"Ah.. but some kind of chainmail net, which I could wrap tags and seals around the chains of in some places, where in others it would be too fine to pass through- and the places where there are gaps.. seals... yeah?" She suggests softly- blushing faintly.* - Sun Dec  6 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Oh my she is adorable... - Sun Dec  6 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods slightly- and smiles gently at Marco.

"Ah.. true- but.. my focus is more on.. helping my team mates, than hurting people myself.."* - Sun Dec  6 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Such timidness. Do you fear me? - Sun Dec  6 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shakes her head, smiling gently.

"Ah... no... this is just how I am, I suppose." She admits bashfully.* - Sun Dec  6 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I want to rub her head... - Sun Dec  6 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: She is so adorable! - Sun Dec  6 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Like my Paine! - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. w-well... I'm not sure either, but.. - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Squads? - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I dont have squads - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I just know I'm not suited to solo work... s-so I guess it's a good thing I'm a summoner! - Sun Dec  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Summoners. .A very type of shinobi. Albeit, the hardest to develop. - Sun Dec  6 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Summons are so cute - Sun Dec  6 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... yes.. even if my contract isn't very suited for combat.. yet.. - Sun Dec  6 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well some of them that is - Sun Dec  6 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: And what do you summon? - Sun Dec  6 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... - Sun Dec  6 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ... Dobermans. - Sun Dec  6 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Marco you are very interested in my shinobi all of a sudden - Sun Dec  6 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec  6 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Just making small talk. - Sun Dec  6 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I haven't a clue what a doberman is.. - Sun Dec  6 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It's... a type of dog. - Sun Dec  6 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: My contract is with dogs. - Sun Dec  6 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Dogs? Thats rather common - Sun Dec  6 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. I suppose so, yes.. - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) coughs awkwardly, smiling sheepishly.

"...they are.. very fluffy, you know.."* - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: In anycase. i suppose it's time I get back home. - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Well.. not the dobermans.. but the poodles are... - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: You all take care. - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: The Dobermans are nice and sleek... - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, good bye. - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Bye hun - Sun Dec  6 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But I want to see this summon, hmm what wsa your name again? - Sun Dec  6 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... - Sun Dec  6 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Senju Akechi. - Sun Dec  6 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles sheepishly as she turns to face Rias and bows her head.

"And.. I'll show you in a bit, yeah..?"* - Sun Dec  6 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure - Sun Dec  6 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Ignacious) says: take me to suna - Sun Dec  6 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns to face Rias and smiles gently, scratching her head.

"So.. you wanted to see my summon, t-then..?"* - Sun Dec  6 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes dear - Sun Dec  6 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods calmly- then breathes in.. and out. Then she bites her thumb- and slams her hand into the ground. A puff of smoke expands from the ground as she pours out her chakra...

And a woof rings out through the office- as a sleek black doberman pads out of the smoke- walks up.. and licks her hand, panting happily as she begins to scratch it behind the ears. It's a tallish, sleek dog- and it's sniffing the air constantly.

"Ah... this is the only dog I can currently summon.. but he's great, isn't he..?" She says- beaming happily. "I call him, ah.. Angel." She explains softly.* - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles peacefully as she looks at the Badger, and nods as she continues to pet the doberman- who seems to wag his tail happily in response, leaning against her. She looks at the badger, and nods.

"Ah, that's adorable." She says gently, beaming happily at the Hokage as she smiles gently.

"Ah... so are you a summoner to?"* - Sun Dec  6 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) chuckles softly and nods. She's no child, it might be noted- though the dogs age is unknown. Akechi herself looks around seventeen- nearly a grown adult. She smiles warmly as she gently scratches behind the dogs ears.

"Ah, of course you can pet him- and.. I see. I've considered Genjutsu... but I'm probably goign to end up... devoted heavily to Fuuinjutsu, and maybe later.... Medical work.."* - Sun Dec  6 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently- she's about the same height. She chuckles softly at the womans words- and nods slightly.

"Ah.. I see.. I've always found myself quite.... able to pull through most anything- but I think that's mostly the Senju genetics talking, you know..?" She says gently- a warm smile on her face as she looks over and thinks.. before shrugging of her heavy cloak. It seems to be lined with a few scrolls- and she stretches out.

Beneath the cloak, she's dressed simply- and her figure is.. curvaceous, to say the least. She's wearing simple white pants, and a simple white long sleeved shirt- and her ample bussom presses the shirt out notable as she stretches out and smiles, laying on her belly as she looks at the beaver.

"Ah, is it alright if I pet your beaver?"* - Sun Dec  6 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes at being hugged, smiling gently as she hugs the other woman back. The armor feels cold against her- but the body beneath it feels warm. She hugs her back gently, before letting go and leaning back, smiling peacefully.

"Ah... alright.. and.. thank you." She says- smiling gently as she leans back and sighs- before going to pet the badgers fuzzy fur- and giggling as she feels the fluff beneath her hand.

"Ah.... she's very soft, Hokage-Chan." She says warmly.* - Sun Dec  6 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and looks over, blushing as she stops stroking the badger and shifts to look at the Kage, blushing faintly at those words.

"Ah.. I'm glad you're having fun with me, Hokage-chan." She says warmly, shifting to sit upright and beam happily at the Hokage- feeling happy to be making one of her superiors happy, simply.

"Uhm.. That is... it's been a pleasure getting to know you better, too!" She says brightly.* - Sun Dec  6 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and nods cheerfully- as she scratches the doberman she summoned earlier behind the ears- before dismissing it and letting it return to whence it came in a puff of smoke. She sighs- as she pushes herself tos tand upright, stretching out and limbering up briefly to loosen up after so long on the ground on her knees, humming as she reaches to put her cloak back on- bending over to pick it up, before straightening back out and sliding it back on.

"Ah... thank you, Hokage-sama." She says warmly- bowing her head gently. "I'll be sure to remembe that, mhrm!"* - Sun Dec  6 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Because the mind is a wonderful thing - Sun Dec  6 07:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods, smiling gently as she shifts to sit in the chair next to the Hokage- blushing fervently as she pulls her cloak around herself and nods at the request to sit next to her.

"A-ah... hai."* - Sun Dec  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Ah huh. - Sun Dec  6 08:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes even more at the hand- but nods and smiles, enjoying the touch against her as she relaxes into the chair and puts her own hands above the table- for now, at least- as she looks towards Abraxas.

"Ah... you know.. s-she has a point.."* - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blushes as she reaches down to tentatively place a hand atop the hand on her thigh- just.. leaving it there as she nods.

"Ah... yeah.."* - Sun Dec  6 08:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) finds it increasingly hard to focus on the topic at hand in response to this- but responds by stroking that hand as it works, holding it gently and letting Rias move as she likes while holding the hand gently, stroking the fingers softly.* - Sun Dec  6 08:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Or it dies on me. - Sun Dec  6 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: One or the other. - Sun Dec  6 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) meanwhile.. tentatively reaches to put a hand on Rias's own thigh, to mirror the Hokage's actions. Her entire face is red- but the bold action just seems.. like the right thing to do, to her... * - Sun Dec  6 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blinks at this- her hand pausing in rubbing her Hokage's thigh; her warm, gentle touch pausing and hovering as she stares quietly- freezing.

"W-woah.. that sure is some Ninjutsu.."* - Sun Dec  6 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Summon? - Sun Dec  6 08:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: And it was strong enough for the previous mizukage to die from it. - Sun Dec  6 08:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Regardless, the fool punched it, and got shredded because of it. - Sun Dec  6 08:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ....Ah... it's getting late. I think I'll be headed to bed, alright..? - Sun Dec  6 08:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns and smiles gently- pausing with her hand still against Rias as she coughs briefly and looks for permission to leave.* - Sun Dec  6 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok hun I will go to sleep too. And you tell me your decision when you decide - Sun Dec  6 08:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) hums calmly as she approaches the scene, hands in her pockets and a smile on her face.* - Sun Dec  6 22:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and frowns as she looks on- frowning blankly. She looks obviously confused as she looks from person to person, blinking a few times as she does.

"Ah... I see... where is the potential criminal?" She inquires softly, scratching her red hair curiously. Her cloak ruffles around her and she looks... blatantly confused.* - Sun Dec  6 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Well. . . - Sun Dec  6 22:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ...Uh...? - Sun Dec  6 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ..Ah, what? - Sun Dec  6 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Where are you guys talking.. About?  - Sun Dec  6 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, miss... - Sun Dec  6 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I have no idea. - Sun Dec  6 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hm.... Alright then..  - Sun Dec  6 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'll be patrolling the area. - Sun Dec  6 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shrugs and nods,s miling. She's confused by the entire situation- but the older woman nearby seems freindly. So she walks towards Claudette- after briefly nodding to Osuda and smiling.

"See you later, Osuda! You should be able to find me if- actually! I know!" She smiles- as she forms a few handseals, bites her thumb, and summons a dog- she gives it a few orders, then nods.

"Ah, send my Doberman back to me if you need help, yeah?" She says- as the dog moves over to follow Nigen around, as she moves to introduce herself to the new face.

"Ah, it's nice to meet you, Miss. Do you live and work here too, or..?* - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Actually. . .everyone is busy. . I should be free to get some Tea now. . . - Sun Dec  6 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Two redheads? Kiss, Kiss, Kiss. -omit- - Sun Dec  6 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches an eyebrow at the awkward silence, coughing.

"Ah.... it's nice to meet you, then! I'm Akechi Senju!" She says brightly- stepping forwards to hold out a hand and shake, her incorrigably intense cheer unstoppable.* - Sun Dec  6 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) while cheerful and kindly- hasn't any real cosmic alignment or great moral standing one way or the other... but even she feels a strange chill. Still- she's far from wise; shaking it of and smiling as she nods.

"Ah, hai. Then it's nice to meet you, Claud- feel free to call me Akechi, or whatever nickname you like, then! Ah.... Well- so you live here? As a Shinobi, or..?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods slightly, smiling gently.

"Ah, a civilian! Then, ah.. I'm sure I'll be proud to protect you, as one of this villages Shinobi!" She says proudly, beaming happily at Claudette- a certain innocence shining about her.

She's no one- not yet. She's new, recent. Unsullied- and ungrounded. Moral, but.. not strongly in any way. Untested, even.

"Anyway.. then I should stop bothering you and let you get to whatever it is you do, huh? Ah... unless you /want/ to talk, or have something that needs doing?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles and nods gently.

"Ah, you're a doctor, then? Hai, I'll remember that for the future- especially if one of my summons get's badly hurt!" She says brightly, scratching the back of her head.

"Ah.. anyway, I don't have much to do right now, so... I wouldn't mind just spending some time to make a freind- that's the best way, after all!"* - Sun Dec  6 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Friend. Gah.  - Sun Dec  6 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Friends, people in general are trouble. . . - Sun Dec  6 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blinks a bit at the question. She's not sure what to talk about- but she decides to think for a while- before speaking firmly.

"Ah, we could talk about hobbies..? Or... how our jobs are..? Ah... how about we go sit down?" She says- gesturing to the Ramen shop with a smile.. "And talk about.. ah, whatever, I guess..? I mean- is there anythign you'd like to talk about?" She inquires cheerily.* - Sun Dec  6 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, sure. I'll buy food, and we can talk! - Sun Dec  6 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) calmly walks in and sits down, smiling gently.

"Order whatever, I'll pay! Ah.. anyway... so what's it like, working as a doctor at the hospital?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and nods slowly.

"Ah.... I'm sure it is hard, mhrm. Do you use Chakra medically, or are you a more traditional doctor..? And.. how exactly does it work? I've always kinda liked the idea of helping people that way, too, if I'm honest.."* - Sun Dec  6 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) nods slowly, smiling as she soaks it in- ordering some ramen herself, then handing the money to the ramen man for her meal and Clauds.

"Ah, I see.... Hrm.... Well, I can see that, yeah... still- it's always good to expand what one can do with both methods, I'd guess, right?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Yes it is..  - Sun Dec  6 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... mhrm. The expansion of knowledge is the expansion of ways to help people! - Sun Dec  6 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: To bug them. . .or not to bug them. . .that is the question. - Sun Dec  6 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ... Well, that and it's interesting- like how I'm always trying to figure out new ways to use Fuuinjutsu, mhrm! - Sun Dec  6 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Though,, I'm not very good yet.. - Sun Dec  6 23:36:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles brightly at that, sighing contently.

"How about you..? Why did you decide to become a doctor..?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Can't tell her I was forced. She might be a spy...  - Sun Dec  6 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Uhm..  - Sun Dec  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Just because  I wanted to. - Sun Dec  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Hmmm. . . .nah~ I'll just creep for now~ - Sun Dec  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, a whim then.. - Sun Dec  6 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I guess that makes sense. Do you at least like it? - Sun Dec  6 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Yes ofcourse. - Sun Dec  6 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: That's good then! It'd be a shame for someone to decide to do something on a whim, get good at it, then not like it, mhrm! - Sun Dec  6 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . . - Sun Dec  6 23:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles calmly as the drinks arrive, and nods slowly, sighing.

"Mrm.... I like what I do, too... Fuuinjutsu is just so.. so interesting! It's fun having to wrap my mind around complex problems, and solving them, you know? So much harder than just.. rawr, I work out and hit things! Man.. I'm glad I didn't go into Taijutsu, mhrm."* - Sun Dec  6 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm...  - Sun Dec  6 23:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Well.. I'm just not sure what else to talk about.. - Sun Dec  6 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ... Hmm. - Sun Dec  6 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Life? - Sun Dec  6 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs softly as she starts to spoon up her Ramen.

"Ah, so.. Claud.... how are you today in general?"* - Sun Dec  6 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Huh.. Uhm.... I-I guess I am alright hm. - Sun Dec  6 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Yourself? - Sun Dec  6 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. very well, mostly! - Sun Dec  6 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: These people are boring. - Sun Dec  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Small talk. - Sun Dec  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Gross. - Sun Dec  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Anyawy.. - Sun Dec  6 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Good talk. - Sun Dec  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and coughs, as she finishes up her Ramen...

"Ah.. it was nice meeting you, Claud-San..."* - Mon Dec  7 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm.... - Mon Dec  7 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I'd like to speak with you again sometime, mhrm! - Mon Dec  7 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) yawns and smiles- walking into the Hokage's office and bowing.

"Ah... Hokage-Sama, Hai!" She says respectfully- bowing and clasping her hands together, giving a decent view down the top of her shirt before leaning back up. 

"How are you today?"* - Mon Dec  7 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) rises from the bow with a gentle smile- blushing at the familiar tone of adress.

"Ah, I am fine. I was just wondering if there where any missions available at the moment?"* - Mon Dec  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hello do you need anything? - Mon Dec  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: No. - Mon Dec  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Of course you do... come here please - Mon Dec  7 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I'd rather not. - Mon Dec  7 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Pfft, come come! - Mon Dec  7 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: No? - Mon Dec  7 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Denied... come here... - Mon Dec  7 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Leave me alone. - Mon Dec  7 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are you a villager here? - Mon Dec  7 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) bows her head and turns to leave, sighing.

"Ah... Miss, this is the Hokage.." She warns softly as she passes Saika.* - Mon Dec  7 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) coughs slightly as she walks out of the archives, tucking a notepad away into her robe as she looks at the figure entering the hokage's office.

"Ah.. hello?"* - Mon Dec  7 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently and nods her head at the greeting.

"You're here to ah, talk to Miss Hokage, right..? Sadly, she's ah... napping, right now- but I might be able to help you?"* - Mon Dec  7 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smilse gently- and coughs, shrugging..

"Ah... well, I see. I can't assign missions- no.. but I am more than happy to help you train- although.. I might not be the best in a straight fight." She admits with a sheepish smile.

"Still- I do have this mission I was assigned to spar another Shinobi.... anyway!" SHe smiles warmly. She seems a bit nervous- but also exceedingly outgoing and freindly.

"Ah.. so- right outside the mansion, or at the training field..?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Actually.. - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Yes? - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: You'd probably defeat me in a few moments. - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I'm no good at physical fighting- I'm a Fuuinjutsu specialist.. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You say this like Fuuinjutsu is a handicap. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It's not... - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Exactly. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: But I don't know any combat applications yet other than having weapons sealed. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Do you see how this is turning out to be? - Mon Dec  7 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: We are already agruing.. Over a spar that will never happen. - Mon Dec  7 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs and nods.

"Ah.. anyway. Sure, let's go." She says gently, scratching her head. "I think I know a place- a little park.." She frowns at that.

"And... I didn't think we where arguing..?" She says- frowning at the man as she scratches her head awkwardly- before sighing as she adjusts her headband on her forehead.

"Anyway... I think alot of what you said isn't right, because I can't imagine people really getting that worked up over a practice spar... still.." She smiles gently. 

"Ah... if you'd like to just go study and practice Jutsu, that's fine to.."* - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) coughs and calmly walks out- heading away.* - Mon Dec  7 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) calmly walks out into the woods behind the monument- and smiles as she shifts to sit and lean against a tree, as she reaches into her robes for a small scroll.

"Ah.. here we are."* - Mon Dec  7 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently, and shrugs gently.

"Ah.. I have a fire affinity, but no Jutsu of that element known." She says softly- as she begins to carefully write into the scroll; elegant and delicate caligraphy. She looks around and taps her chin, thinking.

"I don't suppose you have anything small you'd like sealed to keep on you?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I do not. - Mon Dec  7 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Listen... - Mon Dec  7 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I will be using medical ninjutsu. - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..? - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I want you to watch~ - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. sure.. - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and speaks softly- looking on quietly and observantly. She scratches her head and holds up a hand.

"Ah.... isn't it true though, that ah... medical ninjutsu can heal wounds- but not.. you know.. raise teh already dead?" She says softly- squeeking. "Isn't that fish dead, not just wounded, and thus beyond any Shinobi's abilities..?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) squints as she continues to write into her scrolls- nodding slowly as she listens to him.

"But aren't you just accelerating natural healing proccesses by applying chakra to the creatures body..? I don't think you can really supply air to empty lungs with that kind of a thing.." She says- squinting. She is apparently quite intelligent, despite her earlier mannerisms, as she scratches her head and smiles gently.

"I mean... it's clear you are using medical Ninjutsu.. but I think you're misunderstanding what it's supposed to do.. you could heal the damage to it's body gained from not having air- but it would still not have air, causing the damage to instantly re-appear, right?"* - Mon Dec  7 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Of course not. - Tue Dec  8 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) hums calmly as she walks into the Hokage's office, scratching her head as she looks around.

"Ah.. is some kind of meeting going on..?" She asks softly as she looks around.* - Tue Dec  8 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: No..no.. - Tue Dec  8 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? - Tue Dec  8 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) looks around and nods slowly as someone pushes past the gentle looking girl- before she chuckles softly as she looks around, blinking a few times.

"Ah.... I see... no meeting, huh..? Okay.."* - Tue Dec  8 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Have a great trip.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..? - Tue Dec  8 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Miss Hokage is going on a trip..? - Tue Dec  8 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If she is on leave, I assume she'll be taking a break to care for her child. - Tue Dec  8 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: I will see you all in a few... yes to Sunagakure... Osuda only has power to answer questions... I will return to pass out missions - Tue Dec  8 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.... - Tue Dec  8 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Well okay then.. - Tue Dec  8 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't get paid enough for this.. - Tue Dec  8 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) scratches her head and coughs as she walks towards Nigen..

"Ah... I was actually coming to turn in a D Rank Mission I performed the other day.. .though, I still haven't performed my other one... to spar with another Shinobi.." She says- coughing a few times.* - Tue Dec  8 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I was actually hoping, if you're standing in, you could handle the reward for the other mission.. - Tue Dec  8 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, I can not. - Tue Dec  8 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... alright.. then.. - Tue Dec  8 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: All I am able to do is answer questions when it comes to matters. - Tue Dec  8 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) calmly steps back and towards Osuda- and looks towards the newcomers.

"Ah.. where are you two from, and what do you need?" She inquires warmly, scratching her head as she moves to stand near Osuda, trusting her fellow Konoha-nin.* - Tue Dec  8 06:37:39 2015

"...They probably expect their attempt at full seccession from Sunagakure to result in war, and want Konoha as an ally.."* - Tue Dec  8 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ...Right? - Tue Dec  8 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe. - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: We came here to discuss a treaty. - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: But seeing as the Hokage has left. - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I see... - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, you'll most likely have to reschedule. Sorry for the wasted trip. - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You just missed her. - Tue Dec  8 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You are welcome to stay for a few days. - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Eh. . . - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Last time we were here. . .I placed a panty flag ontop of the mansion's pole. .  - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. yes. - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Lady Hokage is, as we said, out and about. - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright, see ya. - Tue Dec  8 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well that was great. - Tue Dec  8 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ..Ah.. Unfortunate. - Tue Dec  8 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It seems war really is brewing.. - Tue Dec  8 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Is it? - Tue Dec  8 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe this is why she left.. - Tue Dec  8 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Possibly so.. - Tue Dec  8 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, and I'm certainly not ready for war.. oh my. - Tue Dec  8 06:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I doubt war will happen. - Tue Dec  8 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... what makes you say that? - Tue Dec  8 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: I mean.. it looks like it, right? - Tue Dec  8 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What may seem to be true, may not always be the case. - Tue Dec  8 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if a war breaks out, there's nothing stating that Konoha will have to be involved. - Tue Dec  8 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: True.. - Tue Dec  8 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So don't worry. - Tue Dec  8 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Yeah.. even if it happens.. it's not our fight.. - Tue Dec  8 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yep. - Tue Dec  8 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs, scratching her head and smiling faintly.

"Well... I guess that's a relief. I think I'll go work on my Fuuinjutsu, then.. or maybe.." She trails of- thinking quietly. She turns upon noticing someone she hasn't met before- and waves cheerfully.

"Oh, ah.. hello!" She says softly, cloak shifting around her form as the redheaded Senju girl notices someone else in the Kage's office. "What brings you here?"* - Tue Dec  8 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shakes her head, smiling gently.

"Ah.. no. Akechi Senju, Genin. I was just here talking to Osuda-San, you know?" She says warmly, scratching her head. "Apologies, but Lady Hokage is out on business, I believe.... I'm not sure when she'll be back. Ah- maybe I can help you?" She offers cheerfully.* - Tue Dec  8 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What. .? - Tue Dec  8 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh her Asteroth... - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Get ready... there might me trouble... hide of you need to - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) smiles gently as she is called Super Freindly- and nods, giggling.

"Ah, yeah, I a- Huh what?" She turns, as she spots a huge wave of people entering the building and coughs, shifting to stand next to Asteroth, then looking towards the Hokage

"Ah.. Lady Hokage?"* - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) whispers: ...Ah, all that said, it's very nice to meet you, Miss Asteroth! - Tue Dec  8 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I deserve this seat... - Tue Dec  8 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: Mhm. I'm sure it is. . The hell is going on here? - Tue Dec  8 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) whispers: Ah... Miss Hokage /was/ visiting Suna.... I don't know why she brought an army back with her, though.. - Tue Dec  8 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: This is awkward.. - Tue Dec  8 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: I wonder what can I sell to these people here. - Tue Dec  8 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Weird. - Tue Dec  8 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: I should try to get information on the two while I'm here. I'm sure she'll know something. - Tue Dec  8 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 07:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ZE KRIEEEEGGGGG! - Tue Dec  8 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Seems as if she's still eating from the palm of Sunagakure.. - Tue Dec  8 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: So that's what this is all about. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: If I keep this up, I'll learn something. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Unecessary. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) blinks at Rias's statement.. and nods slowly. She frowns, and then sighs... she looks to Nigen- and sighs.

"... Seems you where wrong, Osuda-San.." She says gently- sighing as she closes her eyes.* - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kekekekek.. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe I was. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I still doubt there will be a war. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. maybe. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Anyway.. ah, Hokage-Sama... I'll talk to you later, then. I'll.. be around town, training. I'm.. certainly not ready to help with this kind of thing. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: War huh? - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) whispers: Sorry, Miss Asteroth. Maybe we can get better introduced later, but... I'll be heading out of the office, for now.. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I guess I should start making some calls. Whoever has the better supplies will win in the end. - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs softly and turns to head for the exit, frowning slightly.* - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wait... War?... Nope! Going to flee this village too! Nope Nope, NOT AT ALL! I WON'T BE DRAFTED!!!! - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ..... - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Gentlemen... - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: War. - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thak you Trill, Yes this is my office... who are you again?; Osuda these are shinobi and guards from Suna to help us if we are attacked - Tue Dec  8 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: Mhm. Take care. - Tue Dec  8 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) thinks: I kind of want in on this..I bet the others will want in on it too. It'll be an adventure! - Tue Dec  8 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Excuse me, may I have your name? I just can't keep looking at your beauty without knowing who you are. - Tue Dec  8 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) calmly sits down- and pulls out a scroll. She begins to practice her calligraphy, for the sake of Fuuinjutsu- and for it's own sake, if she's entirely honest. She hums peacefully as she draws and writes- a gleam in her eyes as she works calmly to paint the ink onto the paper in the correct forms precisely.

It consumes a little while- before she heads off to the hospital.* - Tue Dec  8 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) looks up from studying her Fuuinjutsu as she notices two people walking down the road. She smiles gently and lifts a hand to wave- leaning against the side of the wall.

"Hrm?"* - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: It's been a bit. I've got to say, you were a help.  - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Sadly, there were some complications with the trade route, but we managed.  The other two are still there. - Tue Dec  8 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What are you doing here then? - Tue Dec  8 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: Selling goods. - Tue Dec  8 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn, I see. - Tue Dec  8 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: When you are back home safe let me know and I will rush my order to you. - Tue Dec  8 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Itsujin, Tetsu(Shiziru101) says: I'll let you know when I get back. - Tue Dec  8 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: At first anyway. - Tue Dec  8 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) shrugs at the discussion going on- and returns to writing in her scrolls- humming calmly as she can barely make out anything from the two nearby anyway; humming as she practices her Fuuinjutsu by scrawling calligraphy on a scroll.* - Tue Dec  8 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Im not going to war... I telling you now... - Tue Dec  8 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You told me that you wouldn't eat from the hand that raised you. - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) walks back in after a while- and sighs, looking around as she shifts to lean against the wall, and thinks.* - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Please dont look at me like that. - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Did.. She really leave me with the kid?.. Now she's going off to war? Ughhh... - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You clearly are.. - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If anything..you'll just serve as a distraction for Sunagakure. - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Ma'am.. May I have a word with you before you go? Privately? - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: So... there will be a war, then... how sad. - Tue Dec  8 08:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Dec  8 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) turns and waves, cheerfully smiling at the new face as she does.

"Hai!"* - Tue Dec  8 08:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akechi(SephirothMage) sighs and shrugs.

"I just hope no one dies.."* - Tue Dec  8 08:34:33 2015
