<br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) Take a seat on the floor corssing his legs once he was seated. hands come together to form Ox, Dog, Rat, Bird,  and Snake hand seals. Each seal gives him the needed chakra from his poles to complete a jutsu. Biting the side of his cheek a little to draw blood into his mouth. He then spits the mix of saliva and blood onto the ground then presses his hands ontop of the blood and saliva mix. "Summon"He said, seals appear on the ground written in the blood of the caster that being Cassi. Seal erups into a cloud of smoke. Sitting there just next to Cassi hands was a mole.

"Hey there." Cassi said to the mole just looking at animal, though he had hisr easons for wanting to summon it. He carefully moves his hands towards the moles head but the mole takes a few steps back. * - Wed Dec  9 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) Carefully moves his hands back and watches the mole closely. 

"I'm just trying to be a friend to you is all. I really want to hold you."He said moving his hand into his bg taking out a little bag of puff snacks. Cassi opens the snack pack up and then empties its contents onto the floor. He then tosses the snack bag to the side and places his hands in his lap staring at the mole.

The mole sniffs at the air picking up on smell of the snacks. 

"It's okay they are really tasty. Go ahead try some."Cassi said.* - Wed Dec  9 19:53:23 2015

The mole just slowly extends its head nexk out so its nose can get closer to the pile of puff snacks. It sniffs and sniffs the at the air, picking up on seasoned puff snack. Cassi eyes start to widen up as he was really thought the mole was going eat some of his snacks. "That's it just get a little close and give them a lick."He said. Cassi believing that all animals can understand human talk and human can understand them but it take a little longer to get the hang of it.

"I did summon you..Don't reject me okay budy?"Cassi said again. The mole would look up at Cassi before looking back at the pile of snacks..It carefully moves closer to the pile.* - Wed Dec  9 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) Would slowly start to move his hand up to mole. The mole would have got to pile of snack and began to eat on a snack puff slowly. This made it easer for Cassi to pet the mole, his fingers tips lightly touch moles head and he starts to pet it slowly. The mole doesn't notcie it all tha tmuch it really just enjoying the sack. Cassi face gets all bright and he jumps for joy in the inside..He can feel his heart beat pick up, he was really happy and really wanted to have mole in his lap..

"It's good right..I just know what animals want I guess."He said.* - Wed Dec  9 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) WAtched as the mole ate on one of puffs it seemed pleased with the food. THe young boy figured he had made good friends with th emole after feeding it so he moves his hands to try and pick it up. But that was not a good idea the mole would wiggle and wobble around using its claws to scratch up boys arms. Cassi would let go and look at his arms then look at the mole.

"H-hey what was that for!"he shouted..the mole would quickly dig its self into ground vanishing from sight. Cassi would rolls his eyes and stand up. "Man I blew it."he mumbles.* - Wed Dec  9 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) Forms the hand seals needed for the bunshin jutsu he learned in the academy. Once done he focuses on creating the clone. Quickly the clone would appear next to him a perfect copy of the young lad.

"Huh, I love this technique."He said.* - Wed Dec  9 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) presses his hands together and would release the bunshin. He then forms the hand seals for the jutsu once more trying to creat clone again and maybe one more. He wanted to master it so he could make more then one copy of him self.* - Wed Dec  9 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cassi(TigerKitty) Blinks a little seeing only one clone he then wves his hands aorund the air cooling them. "Okay next time two clones come on."He said, before releasing the first clone then repeating the hand seals for the jutsu. His chakra is then pushed out of his body creating one clone and maybe another who knew.* - Wed Dec  9 20:21:32 2015
