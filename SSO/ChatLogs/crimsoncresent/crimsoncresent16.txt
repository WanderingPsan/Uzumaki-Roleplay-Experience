<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) punches him harder in the shoulder, though it was clearly one of her usual friendly gestures. "Well good, I did promise you a spar in the morning. So, when you're filling up to it. I'll be more then ready to take you on!" She says loudly, far more energetic then Lera or Yan.* - Sun Nov  8 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began reving one of her arms around, spinning it in circles. "Oh if you want to fight now, then lets do it! You were just looking sluggish there." She said, really feeling up to another fight. Though, she had a feeling this would end up like all the others.* - Sun Nov  8 17:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was already taking her steps marching towards the ground, as he patted by her. She turned around laughing "Of course, you can watch silly!" She said not afraid to show off the same techiniques, she already had shown to Lera. 

Looked over to Yan, as he said he had to go somewhere. "Don't chicken out! You might not get another chance." She said finishing with a laughter, as she continued to the training arena.* - Sun Nov  8 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) already was swinging her sword several times in front of her. Her body not seeming to have a care in the world for swinging around the giant sword. Her blade cutting the air in front of her. The genin all the more ready for her upcoming match, if she didn't die from waiting too long for him to show up since he did get side tracked. She seem far too eager for some good rough housing.* - Sun Nov  8 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, sorry about the wait... - Sun Nov  8 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continues waving her sword up and down, until Yan comes back. She seems a bit sweating, as she waves the sword back and forth ."Ah, finally you're back!"* - Sun Nov  8 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Don't get tired before you have to deal with me. - Sun Nov  8 17:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then come on! - Sun Nov  8 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to charge at him, sword raised as she only slowed her momentum a few feet away from him. When she finally reached her stop, she was already in position. Her blade hanging over her head, as she then took one last step forwawrd to Yan. Her blade coming down in an arc over his shoulder, being proppelled by gravity at his being. "VON GIEN!" * - Sun Nov  8 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let out a surprised, "Ahh!" to the clones being summoned. She pointed at him "Hey thats not fair! We didn't start yet." She said stopping her feet on the ground. Though she still readied her blade, pulling it over her shoulder.  "Well, like my dad said. Battle isn't fair." She stared at the four clones looking at them. Her eyes closing for a moment for a rather surprising moment of thought from the girl.

She then seemingly abandoned any snese of strategy, as she held her blade out fully with two arms. She then took a full force run at the center clone using her blade as almost a lance. Trying to drive it into the stomach of the first clone, in an attempt to push it all the way through towards Yan himself.  * - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015

She stated, as her swords was now embedded in a pile of mud. Her hands trying to pull back, but the mud was just too thick for her. She then just laughed it off, as the various blunted spears came after her. "Guess I lose! Hahaha." Just before she then got beat in by the blunted tips.* - Sun Nov  8 18:25:55 2015

She takes a few moments to step back, pulling out her blade at Shira. Seriously, she was going to attack him if he made any more atttempts to get closer to her. She then pause, as she hears Mizora. Turning her head, "Huh? Wha- I'm a bit busy with this attacker." Her eyes giving a blank 'What the heck are you doing?' look to Mizora.* - Sun Nov  8 19:17:07 2015

When the hit land, whether it hit him or crash into the ground she look at both people talking with her.

"Hello, hello nice to meet you both. Chikyu... but I'm a bit busy here with this psychopath!" She says, quickly flipping her head back and forth between Mizora and Ryutaro. Then, she finally went back to her opponent.* - Sun Nov  8 19:32:28 2015

The steel barely able to manage to stay undamaged, as it fluttered back and from from the hit. The swordswoman's body nearly twisting completely along with it, as she kept a firm hold on to the blade. The blade being practically embedded in the dirt. Chikayu having to spend several tugs until she finally plucked the steel sword out.

She then turned to Hokuma, as she then pulled back her arm...... She then threw it out as a open handshake. Her eyes lightning up, as she looked at Mizora. "That was amazing! You're so strong." Her mind competely forgetting about Shira entirely. * - Sun Nov  8 19:42:43 2015

Not noticing the unconscious laid out Shira that was slid several feet away. Probably dreaming that he somehow could've pulled out and block with that giant steel on his back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) walks away a few steps. "Well okay then... sorry if this ends quickly." She says holding up one hand in front of her, as if in a prayer bowing her head real quickly. The other reaches behind her head, grabbing the sword. She swings it back and forth in front of her with one hand seeing no issue with the weight of the steel at all. She then looks over ot Akimora to ready herself, or suprise attack. She was getting used to those things.* - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabs the sword in front of her, as she takes a step. Her head tilts back and forth a moment, rolling her thoughts on how she should attack. Though after taking a glance at that light katana. The girl thought it be best to approach just like this. The girl then charged forward with the sword, before stopping about four feet from Mitsunara. While that was some distance, it was still good enough reach for that human tall sword of hers.

 She then began to thrust her blade forward like a spear. Using her length, just to give her some space from a pontential quick counter hit so she had time to react with her slow reflexes.* - Mon Nov  9 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: ....What're you weirdos doin'? - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) eyes light up, as she notes the inability to actually damage this person.  However this doesn't seem to bother her too much, as she lets go of the handle, as with one hand. Her body to forward in the attack to actually block the strike or pull out enough strength to knock her away. However, she had one move in mind which is why she kept at range to give her enough time to react.

The girl brought up the free'd arm. It then twisted outwards, armguard trying to strike the steel of the blade. Then using  the force of her rotating arm to deflect  the slash coming at her.* - Mon Nov  9 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gets drag along as the kick connects to her. Her body having no defense at the moment, thanks to her being in mid-attack when hit. She was then sent flying to the side, landing on the dirt on her back. However, she quickly scurried back up on her feet.

She was injured for sure, though she seemed much more used to it then she should be. Chikyu then lifted up her sword keeping it, shakingly, pointed at her opponent. "Not bad yourself, another person above my level." She said, as she held it.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: If you want, I could help you train outside the village, secretly. Away from others so it's not so embarassing. If you where just a bit stronger, you'd definitly be on my level- and I'd want that to happen. - Mon Nov  9 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: After all, I fight for the sake of the challenge. - Mon Nov  9 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) straighted up a bit more, as she listened to her offer to keep going. She did pause for a moment, as she listened to her whispers.  Her usual laugh coming out much rougher. "Ha...ha... That sounds fun, though I'm never embarassed. I know humility, and I accept every one of my loses. So, if you want I don't mind where it is. But, I always accept the challenge." She said, answering her first question to continue.


 She took a few steps back, then she brought up her sword before slamming it into the dirt as a challenge to Mitsunara. Her body to take herself to breathe, the sword's tip still laying at the sound. "Come at me, I'll admit defeat if you can touch me again... Haha! I surely wouldn't be able to take another in a real fight."* - Mon Nov  9 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) just kept her eyes on the sword, as she kept her hands gripped tight. No matter what movement the right made at all. When the sword comes in to strike her, the girl lets out a rawr.

 A loud scream at her body to take action to move. She then turns her body to the side. The twisting motion puling at her arms to go backwards, her blade then follows in its own slice at her sword. All of her energy put into just hitting the sword, aiming at the point closest to the handle she coudl hit. Putting all she could in this techinique to just simply disarm the opponent.

The punch would land with with ease, smacking the girl senseless with one hit. The girls body all ready shaking from the first kick, and with no intent to suck in the damage from this one. She quickly lose on her own terms.* - Mon Nov  9 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: How about we head out to train for a bit after you've rested? - Mon Nov  9 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) takes a few steps back, her head spinning around for a moment. It takes her awhile before she falls backwards on her rear. "Yeah... sure after I've...-blurg- rested. It was a nice fight Mitsunara. You're really strong."* - Mon Nov  9 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) would return the thumbs up. She then leans back, resting on her arms hitting the ground. Her sword by her side at the moment since...well she couldn't sit with it on. "Well, my dad told me that you respect everyone equally as a warrior. Arrogance for gender and race will just get you killed. Though, he trained me like a boy... just because he didn't know I was a girl for a long time. Hahaha!" She chuckling at a fact most people wouldn't want to admit.* - Mon Nov  9 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Hehe, well I hope that thing you have to prove changes. I think you can put all your energy to just proving how great a warrior you are, not trying to prove that you're a 'good female' warrior. "* - Mon Nov  9 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) jokingly shakes her fist at Akimora.

"I can't let you do that. Because, I'm going to become 'The Strongest'." Her eyes giving a rather competitive glare at Akimore, more then happy to add anybody as a rival or friend if not both.* - Mon Nov  9 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh.. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, if you intend to be in my way... - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'll have to prove to you why that's foolish. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In the mean time, though, I'll just seem to help you along. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's better if you're at least a challenge.~ - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, how about we get something to eat..? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And then head out like I said, once you've got some food in you? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I want it to be a secret, because I have some moves I want to keep a secret, y'know? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sounds good to me. - Mon Nov  9 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. - Mon Nov  9 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly grabs the first waitress already listing off the various foods she wanted. Turning around, she quickly listens to what Mitsunara had to say about their training. "Well... if thats the cfase. I have to give out a flat no. Though, I don't even have a clue about any of your techiniques. Hahaha." Her sword being taken off to lay at the side of the table, her arms and elbows rudely placed out on the table.* - Mon Nov  9 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Fair enough. - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In that case, just general tips and working out, mhrm. - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sounds good to me.  - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: That sounds like a pretty good place, but thats also a no can do.  - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, you want to stay near to town then, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Fair enough. I just don't want to stand in the Arena, because I'll be using something that I don't like showing off, or being well known. - Mon Nov  9 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I won't be showing you how to use it, but it's still not something I want more than one or two other people really being aware of, y'know? - Mon Nov  9 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Theres a bunch of corners in the village. The walls are guarded by shinobi, but if they're loafing off enough to watch genin fight.  Then, you won't have to worry about them  learning your techiniques from watching them. - Mon Nov  9 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I suppose that's true. Still- you can understand my paranoia when it comes to a family technique, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course, teaching someone a techinque or even showing it to you. Is giving a person the advantage of a techinique that could mean life and death. When you hand something that important to someone else, you have be sure you chosen carefully...even in family. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Definitly. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah! And there is our food. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I'll admit, part of this is selfish on my part. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I need a chance to practice this thing outside of the public eye, with someone who won't go telling others, who is at just the right level to give me a really good fight, without either of us totally overwhelming the other. - Mon Nov  9 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That way, I can train for long periods of time at once, while not unveiling things, mhrm. - Mon Nov  9 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Thats true, but to fair though... I guess I will share you something-... " She pauses to bite into one of the pieces of meat shes ordered. Biting into it and tearing it apart with teeth alone.  She swallowed down the meat before continuing. "I guess it be fair and not too revealing, since I'm far more open with using my techiniques in a spar... Something thats goes along with giving any opponent your all. But since your a little bit secretive, I think it be fair to exchange a bit of info."* - Mon Nov  9 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) the girl then surprisingly leans over to whisper. This was honestly the first time, she had whispered to anyone outside the village. "Those techiniques...well they aren't my families real techiniques."* - Mon Nov  9 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: No... something else... my dad hasn't taught me them. - Mon Nov  9 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not yet, at least, I take it. - Mon Nov  9 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shrugs her shoulders. "Well I don't know... but I've fought my dad every day of my life until I began to work full time as a shinobi. He doesn't use a sword in our training but a stick...still. Not once, have I ever seen him use those moves in a spar, only did he use them to show me them when I was doing basic training." 


She then stops to go back to her hushed tone. "....So one night... I heard my pops messing around. He actually pulled out a sword. And, I saw his techiniques...they were rather ghastly and nothing like what he ever showed me." She said pulling back, letting out a shiver. Her head twisting to the corner of her shoulder, almost as if she was hiding behind it. A frown breaking the normally cheerful smile she put on.* - Mon Nov  9 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nodded slightly to her first first guess. "It was the first time... I ever felt like what it was really like to fight against a sword user. When, I fought him in spars he sometimes came close to really hurting me... but I had to follow quite a bit from my home to see it. He didn't want me to see and I can see why... if I fought him I be torn to bits in an instant." She said, as she even continued onwards. "His attacks... I don't know  what they're intended for... It doesn't feel like someone made it to fight humans... More like... slaughter."* - Mon Nov  9 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its rather scary...ha..ha... It felt like a beast that didn't need to eat or protect itself was standing before my eyes. Just...pure...instint to kill. - Mon Nov  9 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see.. fascinating. - Mon Nov  9 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So... anyway. Done eating? - Mon Nov  9 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah...yeah. Sorry for the long story. - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not a problem! - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It was interesting. - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, what do you want to do. Try another spar in secret? - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, sounds good. It's night now, so a good time for it. - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We'll find somewhere a ways out from where people normally go- or we can just spar inside my house, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Your house sound fine. - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. In that case, follow me yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure... lead the way, Miss warrior. - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: . Right.. - Mon Nov  9 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just remembered I never asked Yan for keys... - Mon Nov  9 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want to go see if hes around? - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .... Nah.. while he did give me an open offer to stay there, I feel a bit off about bringing guests before I even have keys myself. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It would feel rude. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Do you have a place, or shall we just find an isolated corner? - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I haven't bought a place yet. Hehe... but I think if we fight in the corner behind these buildings. It should give us enough cover not to be noticed. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Right.. so a bit out this way. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So.... first thing is first. You're pretty good with that sword- but I couldn't help but notice. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your durability and other defensive traits where quite poor. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Correct me if I'm wrong- but so far, you've placed a heavy emphasis on offensive traits, yes? - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I suppose it does come with using a sword of that size, though. Still; it /is/ a big sword. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Have you considered using your weapon as more of a... a shield, almost? - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's a large enough weapon to do so, allowing you to rely more on it's durability than your own. - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I do sometimes, but I'm too slow often to pick it up in time.  - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watches the girl for a moment, as she begins to pull out the blade out of seeming a dark void. The blade coming out of her hands, and being of such length. Chikyu couldn't hold back giving a low level clap to the jutsu. "Oo-oh-oh! That was amaazing. Guess, thats one thing you dont' want to share."* - Mon Nov  9 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Now. Let's work on your defense, shall we? - Mon Nov  9 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) smiles learning of the opponents secrets. She let out of smile, as she pulled her blade up in front of her. She wouldn't dare ever let out the concealed abilities of the girl, but she did now have a deep interest in learning what else the girl could do. 

Closes her eyes for a moment, nodding for a moment before raising her sword up in a shield. "Now, don't be aiming for my neck here. We are just supposed to be training right. We don't want to wake up the guards now do we." She asks obliviously pointing out what she thinks of Akimora at the moment.* - Mon Nov  9 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks down at the girl, as she begins to sweep an attack at the bottom of the girls legs. The girl bringing down the blade suddenly in front of herself, embedding the metal in an attempt to block the striking sword coming right at her. 

"I was hoping a cute girl like you be a fellow warrior...but... I guess I was wrong about you." She said, putting all her energy into trying to predict her opponents next blow. The only way she be able to survive the womans next strike. "Just leave now, and I won't alert everyone to your prescense.* - Mon Nov  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent)  looks down at the girl, as she begins to sweep an attack at the bottom of the girls legs. The girl bringing down the blade suddenly in front of herself, embedding the metal in an attempt to block the striking sword coming right at her. * - Mon Nov  9 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) is forced to let go of her, blade stepping to the side as the blade comes over her sword. The strike managing to still draw blood, as it cuts across her stomach since she was unable to dare predict the move. The blade still standing up right without her help since the tip was stuck in the soil. 

However, the girl doesn't even think for a moment of attacking her opponent. Knowing that striking her would be pointless. Her attention just paying attention to the blade and the girl. Mind running what she do now, if anything.* - Mon Nov  9 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabs her blade pulling it out of the earth, looking at the opponent. Her eyes viewing down at the line of blood coming from her belly. She takes a breath, and pulls her blade forward to her opponent. Her mouth keeping shut, as she then looked at Akimora silently. 

"Hmmm... well I'm already bleading. Haha., maybe the time to call it quits. Pretty late at night as well."* - Mon Nov  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Haha... good night then. You're staying with Yan right? - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, he offered. - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I've yet to give him my answer, admitably. - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well next time, you should know his house is in the north eastern district. He invited me to the party there. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, that was the first place I checked. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... But I'm horrible with directions.. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, the first thing we swordsmen should do is sheathe ourselves after practice. - Mon Nov  9 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I intend to keep using mine, and it's very draining to summon it! - Mon Nov  9 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nods. "Also, hope you have better directions when you guide someone to that waterfall in the woods." She says, keeping her head turned towards Akimora. her right hand gripped on the blade as she makes some distace between the two. Only shen she reaches her full length, does she even begin to slide in the sword.* - Mon Nov  9 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wait...Akimora... - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: What do you think of swordsman ship? - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It is my life, I suppose you could say. It is not just a style of combat, but something that differs from person to person. By seeing how someone truly fights, you can see their soul. - Mon Nov  9 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Mon Nov  9 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It is a craft of honor and dignity. Pride and spirit. - Mon Nov  9 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I hope you can match me in it well enough to make me bleed, one day, yes? Yes, I think that'll be very fun. - Mon Nov  9 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Is that so... well, I guess I can't agree with that. Because, I've  told you about my father, if I believe that then I would see him as only cruel and merciless...but my father is a loving man. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ones soul is not the same as ones heart, or ones mind. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You can choose to act differently than your soul dictates, if your heart wills it, or your mind calls to it. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: One's soul is one's nature- and one's nature is rarely how one truly acts. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Then, I saw it the same. My dad soul is pure as one can get. I wonder what made him pick up the sword like that.... But yes, I hope I can make you bleed as well. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: For now, farewell. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Keep practicing. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Let's go again, sometime. Maybe keep training in the future. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Not yet. - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: What kind of armor can you make? - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Any. - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Even special armor? - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Special is a broad term. - Mon Nov  9 15:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: With capabilities that don't apply to normal such as reactive to chakra and more. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Possible, I'd suppose. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hm, I do not have any money at all at the moment though . . . So I'll most likely pay a visit whenever I do. - Mon Nov  9 15:47:37 2015
