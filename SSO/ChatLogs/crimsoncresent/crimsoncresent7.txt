He wouldn't be against... with some reason of course. He believed there must be a plan to strike them now and force them to take leave from the village without sacrificing the Raikage.

The chuunin felt a small knot form in his gut, but quickly passed it off as everyone was off training or doing missions. Wrapped his arms and waited, he wanted to show Tethys his recent progress with his training to wield his Zanbatou properly. However long he waited, Tethys wouldn't show up. A few moments later a buzz came from his pocket, as he picked out the radio hiding inside. Then, just as he took out the handheld electronic device. The Kirigakure speekers began to rattle letting out a low droning noise before, it aired his words.

"I am Tethys of the Hogo, damn it!  I refuse to make the likes of you force me to throw away my honor and pride, you damn monsters!  Here I stand, ready to dine in hell with my fallen brethren.  You, creatures of Zetsumo, and Zetsumo himself, strike no fear in this body!  I AM.. I AM TETHYS OF THE HOGO!" 

Stood nearly blind struck, not able to properly respond to the words being spoken out to the village. Hands shook for a moment, as the voice ended its call. The chuunin picked up his handset begin shouting into the microphone. "TETHYS RESPOND! TETHYS WHERE ARE YOU AT? TETHYS!" He shouted repeatedly trying to get an answer back. Until his voice dried up, and he couldn't yell anymore. His hand pushing off the button to speak, and only heard static as a return to his cries.* - Fri Sep 18 07:29:55 2015

It was break or give moment for Jin, he either gave himself in to the emotion or forced himself to accept it. Taking a gulp, he took down a large space of empty air that occupied his throat. He then closed his eyes, and  noded to himself. His hands trembling when he verbally acknowledged the situation. "Tethys... is no longer with us... We'll ... have to inform the new Mizukage and..." His voice cracked, as he dropped the radio in his pocket. "...put them in power as soon as possible."* - Fri Sep 18 08:09:10 2015

"We'll inform him, and tell the rest of his family what happened.... then we can work on a funeral." He said peaking up to the entrance to the courtyard.

Anything else then just this unbearable unknown silence.* - Fri Sep 18 08:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stood at the bottom near the rubble of Tethys and Koeki's last... final spar. He looked at the small torso sized boulder he displaced from it. He then reached down grabbing the sides of it. Bending his body down, he took to lifting it up with more ease then yesterday. Pulling it up to waist height in a single rather fluid motion with his body bending together to lever the weight up.  From there, his body began to take things slower. His arms more then used to accomidating holding such weight now barely felt the strain of his muscles, as he finally took to raising it up to head height. He then swung the stripped hard stone downwards in front of him gritting his teeth and letting out a "RRrrgghhaa!" with the throw of his arms.

Still craddling the rock, the chuunin already begins lifting it up infront of him. His eyes starring into the jagged rock, and giving it another simple vertical swing downwards letting gravity do all the work before stopping it by locking his body. He was already used to throwing this massive weight with full force, already forcing it into another downwards attack. He continued to copy this motion, forcing his mind to believe that this lumped orb of mixed stone was a sword. Trying to ingrain his body that this would actually one day be his weapon, and he needed to master it.

Finding a rhythm to his chopping rock motion, the chuunin began to quicken the pace of his training. Pulling up the rock in his body only made him let out a hissing exhale of the carbon in his body, and when he let it drop in his hold he pumped air back in with a whistling gasp. His hands trembled each time, fingers trying to dig into the hard surface of his impervised training tool. Only for his palm and fingers to be cut as the surface grinds across his bare skin looking to break free of him. The cuts stinging and only being clotted with dirt from the rock. Still he continued because these minor stings, were nothing compared to the pain in his heart.

This training was nothing more then to cover up the anger he felt. A mixture of uselness and need for progression that wasn't being answered. The training he picked up so he could follow the foot steps of Tethys that he left behind. He gave another swoop of the rock, gritting his teeth as he thought about the few days ago he even asked how to train to weild swords like Tethys. If it was a day later, how he might not even had the chance to learn. How Tethys might have been wiped off the face of the earth before he even got to ask. If maybe he asked earlier... He could've learned everything. On that thought, the genin threw down the rock with his next motion. The sound of a crash as the rock pounded into the earth. The bottom being chipped from the intensity of his quickly frustrated throw.

Bit his lip until a single teardrop of blood traveled down his lower lip to the corner of his mouth pooling for a moment, before trickling down his chin. Wiping off the drop only to smear crimson under his lip. The chuunin reached down with red stained hands, and grabbed the boulder again. His mind only reminding him how Tethys would have chided him for letting his emotions over take him. Especially in training, there was no need to be frustrated or angry. He had to focus on his work or none of this would sink in. 

Heaving the rock back up to level with his eyes. He began doing the chopping motions once more. Trying to concentrate on his own body, feeling the travel of the weight and the motion it took to stop. Giving several more flaps of his arms up and down. The chuunin began to do another motion. Curling his arms slow, he began to pull the boulder to his sides. His knees straining to pick up the task in such a new direction. He could feel his torso tighten as he pulled to side, his abdomen twisting around towards the direction. His arms trembling not used to hold such heavy weight in this manner. It took him some time to find that inner balance that allow him to achieve such a feet, before posting himself boulder over his shoulder in a position somewhat similiar to one doing a diagonal chop.

Taking three heavy deep breathes in a row,  he prepared not to over extend his swing. He definately wouldn't let gravity take a hold of a swing he had no knowledge of undertaking. He then began to slowly bring the rock down, going from over his shoulder to across his chest.  His body cracking like that of a unoiled toy or device. His joints literally creeking as their forced to slowly grind against each other while holding the weight of the rock. The rest of his body and his legs carefully adjusting to take the weight. Until the rock reaches down past to the left of his hips, as he trembled trying to hold such weight in an awkward angle. Then pulling it all back up to his shoulder.

The chuunin continued doing these motions over and over. His muscles snapping with each juttery movement. Soon, he felt like he had a hang of it. His cheeks and brow dripping with line so sweat. He then set himself up for the swing the first time he give into the natural flow of gravity and the motion. Taking a deep breathe that inflated his own chest, he then swung the mini-boulder diagonally to his hips. The weigth was too much his own body almost being pulled and tossed along with the boulder. His fingers trying to hold on to the sides of the rock slipping agains this own blood that had made his hold slippery. The rock being thrown several feet away with a bang, as Jin crashed forward hitting his torso on the grass.

Two bloody hand prints, as he pulls himself back up. Clenching one hand into a fist, and smashing it on the ground as he pulls himself up on all fours. The pain of his work out suddenly over taking his body, and forcing him to rest off the exhaustion of the training.* - Fri Sep 18 14:10:08 2015

Earth jutsu users digging holes to reach their without being noticed. Then, come out on the other sides and surround his forces into a large flank attack. On the other hand." He then makes two more marks that surround the circle. "If he has his troops split up into fours. He could easily alert his men to come to the point of attack and we might face a real problem battle. Especially if they come to attack us on the sides." He says drawn an arrow to forces, and showing routs the enemy could take to get there. "Then again, we could trick them to run to fortify that area, and switch our attack on the opposite side of the village."* - Fri Sep 18 15:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) points to the two main gates. "If hes only protecting the main gates. Then we can easily arm and fortify the areas to the opposite side. Making it hard for them to progress forward even if they get word of the attack. Since we'll be on the surprise and the other just needs to guard the side until we're done. Then we will have all the time to finish off this side of troops while using minimal on the other side."

He then points to the four points with the tip of his sword. "If hes got these guarded it be much harder. But, thats why I say if we can bring his troops trying to go guard the place. We can catch the opposite side in their movement and take them out. Trapping and other obstacles won't be much use here."* - Fri Sep 18 16:06:11 2015
