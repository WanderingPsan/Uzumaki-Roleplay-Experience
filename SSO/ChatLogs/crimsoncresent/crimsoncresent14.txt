<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) taking a step in the sand, she took a larger portion of the arena for herself. She wanted teh proper space to begin doing her practices. The genin then quickly got to work, not afraid to get down to the meat and bones. Her legs hitting the dirt ,as she began to take lively sprint. The swordswoman's feet quickly picked up off the ground, as she took heavy leap. Her leg stretching out in front of her, as the rest of her body took pose to keep itself from falling off balance. She flew in the air for several moments, the power and momentum all behind her extended leg. However, she quickly then came crashing down into the sand as gravity took its hold.

Chikyu slowly pulls herself back up off the sandy grounds of the training area. Getting back up on her two feet, the girl already begins taking a run in the opposite direction. Her legs kicking up dirt and sand,  as she gets up enough speed to take lift off. Her body slowly getting up a few good feet over the town. Her leg shot out in one long kick. Her propelled body being the entire weight behind the attack.

She slowly begins to dip in the air, hitting the earth with another "Thunk!". Chikyu rolling as she finally hits the ground. She quickly again recovers from her crash into the earth. She wipes off the dust, turning her head around how she stops that last bit without an opponent to bounce off of. She begins to ponder it for a moment, because it was worth the thought. Falling on ones butt in battle, would be a bad way to end your life.

She continues to work on her ability to go through the techinique. Chikyu decided the only way would be to test out different methods. Her body quickly taking charge once again. Her body taking a long leap forward. Her body posed in the air with the kick. The genin then began to bring down her legs hitting the soles of her feet on the sand. She began to skid across the golden grounds. However, she didn't manage to stop instead she flipped face forward. Head scrapping across the ground in one long drag line leading to where she stopped.

Her face peeled off the ground, as she wiped off the tan particles from her cheeks. The swordswoman then began to get frustrated. Her mouth contourting into a zig-zagged frown. Just as quickly as she got up from the ground, she was now off of it as well. The ninja already forcing herself to perform another attempt...followed by another... and another. Until, her whole body was beginning to become bruised and red thanks to continous beatings into the earth. 

She still continued thick headly directly with her training. Her body still falling face first with each test run. The kunochi was soon growing used to falling. Still, she continued to fail to land. She, however, began to begin to tumble after each trip. Her body managing to acrobaticly protect itself. Covering arms in front of her head and chest, as she then rolled to safely on her bum. 

Her butt then began to take most of the abuse of her training. However, she then  took focus on working on her form in the air. Since, her landing was currently decent enough to her standards.  She then took focus leaping in air, and shooting out her leg. Bending her body to take the proper pose. Using her experience with Leaf whirlwind, she began to balance herself into a flgiht over the ground.

Her push off the ground, began to get her bigger distances. Her speed and power increasing as well thanks to her. Her muscles now sparking with energy every time she took a leap. Without her sword on, she felt even lighter then a feather. This training only making the effects feel even greater. Her toes and soles of feet digging in before each jump, and the entire force of her lower body in proper form took her soaring.

She slowly came to realize a bit better way to find her balance in the air. Her joints and arms making better alignments and adjustments mid flight. Soon, her stance began the perfect balance of rigid and flexible. She was able to hit the opponent( or in this case the ground) and be able to bounce right back up. However, she always did end up hitting (Landing) with a big bang.* - Wed Nov  4 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued her training with vigor, as she slowly began to get a hang of the techinique. Her foot prints of her training, now getting deeper as she runs back and forth. Her body leaping into the air with growing dexterity. Her dynamic entry fitting more and more of the proper image for a user. Her body enjoying finally pulling out a exorcise that requires all of herself to work together. Glad to soon be able to put the books behind her.

She kicks the ground for a more a moment, shaking out the sand stuck in her sandals. She then starts to rush forward preparing the popular jump kick. Chikyu trying her hardest to keep her attack straight. Her shadow going over the numerous foot steps that he continued to make with her attempts. Her body landing only to turn around. She begins to get ready to run, but she then stops sitting down on the ground.

She pulls back on her legs, raising her knee so she can rest her cheek on it. Her breathe was heavy, as she took her break. The recovery of her entire body exhausted from leaping into the air so many times. Legs and feet burning after being used to stop most of her jumps when she landed, and arms bruised from taking those impacts when she figured out how to tumble from it. Still, all these pains only reminded her that she was working towards a goal that was worth it.

She then stood up, after waiting for her body to be able to go for a few more times. Using the little energy she gathered to get back to her work. Legs jolting into action, as she passed across the sand in one long run. She went nearly half way across the training grounds before she stopped for a moment. The push of moving still could be felt, forcing her torso to lean. Her legs leaned down, squeezing down on her muscles building up the tension she was trying to make.

She then unleashed all that energy along with the momentum she got from the run. Her body came up into the air, arms pulled back being dragged along with the rest of herself. She the quickly forced her limbs into poistion. Legs extending outwards, forming a spear for an attack. Her other leg bending inwards to keep from throwing herself off balance. Her arms being used to stabalize at the same time streamline, as they came out in front of her. 

She felt like she had done it to the closest one could call perfect. She then noted her body was slowly drifting downwards. She then closed her eyes, bringing down her right leg till her foot touched the other. She then gave a tiny leap, that just kept her in the air for a moment. She then brought down the other leg, foot touching the ground again. She then slowly began to almost 'step' slowing down her movement with each time the sole of her foot grace the ground. Instead of tumbling for a stop, she had finally came out standing from her taijutsu.* - Wed Nov  4 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was almost celebratory at how far she manage to take her jutsu. She then began to throw her body about. Leaping back and forth, her body just naturally doing the dynamic entry. The kunochi was extremely happy for herself. Kicking up sand and the earth, it was hard to believe she had just finished such long training while being so energetic. She then finally stopped, her lungs pumping back and forth for air. She then turns around to notice a new person has shown up.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) actually took a different place for training instead of the good old sand covered training rounds. Stopping in one of the empty spaces of the village, the only living thing around being the cacti that populated the village just as much as the humans. She stared down on of the green plants in front of her. Her hand slipping behind her back, as she reached into the pouch given to her by Marissa. Two shining metallic stars coming out of her pack, resting in between the gaps of her fingers.

Holding the two range weapon famous for their use of ninja. She took one out of her right hand, holding it with her left. She then brought back her right arm, throwing the shuriken before quickly tossing the one in her left aiming to get it to follow behind and in the first shuriken's shadow. However, there was one major issue even if she knew the techinique and how it worked. Her aim was terrible, the first shuriken completely missing her target. The second shuriken being thrown straight to the earth, a mere two feet away from her feet. 

The girl gasped at her own incompetence with the shuriken. Her mouth dropping to her knees, as she was left gaping in a stun silence. She quickly wakes up with a dog like shake of her head. Her legs quickly picking up, as she runs over to the shuriken pluking them out of the dirt. A hand coming up rubbing her forehead, as she lets out a sigh. "Well...I guess this is what I get for not using shuriken after I graduated." She then grunts, holding up a hand clenched in a fist. "But, I won't let this stop me."

Coming back to the spot she once stood for her target practice. Her teeth grinding down on themselves, as she decides she needs to get back to using shuriken again. Her hand holding one shuriken straight up. Her arm flinging down, her right leg shooting up as if she was some sort of pitcher. The shuriken hitting...nothing... swooping right by the cacti once more. Her head shaking itself, as she pulls out the next one with similiar results. A foot stamping the dirt with several stomps on the ground.

She continued to pull out one after another shuriken out of her pouch, until she went through all six of her shuriken that she recently bought. The range weapons littered all around the needle covered plant, which had not a single scratch. Chikyu running over to recover all her little weapons. Throwing them back into her pouch except for one that she held in her hand. Her arms  chugging them over towards the direction of the plant once again. 

She once again machine gunned the shuriken at the cactus. However, she failed to leave a mark again. However, she was just harded as she was inaccurate. The genin picking up her shuriken once again. Her packed filled with her ammunition again. Hand already carrying one of the shuriken. She took a moment, weighing the piece of metal. She then clenches it into her hold. 

Chikyu then pulled up her arm with the shuriken, as she closed one eye to use the other to fully focus on the cacti. Her fingers rubbed back and forth on the sides of one of the sharp edges, carefully avoiding it cutting the inside of her fingers. The girl finally decided to pull her arm all the way back. She then threw it forward, the shuriken flying by to the right in its vortex esque spin. The girl then brought her arm to grab the next one. 

The next shuriken being brought up into her hand. She then stuck her tongue out to her lips, leaning over her upper lip. Her one open eye zooming in on her green target. Her arm being swung out, a shuriken sent out in a fast projectile until it crashed...into the ground. She brought out the next one into her hand. The next throw still missing, with the next one still being thrown off. They followed until her pack was completely left barren. Her projectiles digging closer and closer to the base of the cactus.

She continued to retrieve her shuriken until her pack was filled. The girl then again until to throw the steel over again near the cacti. The shuriken flying by buzzing as it cuts off a bit of needle. She then picked up her next, and pulled her entire body back. Throwing the star with a roar, the piece of metal flying so fast to land half embedded into the thick plant. She let out a happy shout, "YEEAAAAHHHH!" Her body leaping up and down, arms throwing up into a V-shape victory.

The girl began to chuck her projectiles. The shuriken beginning to hit the trunk of the spiny cactus. The metal sharpnel now lining down the cactus. The kunochi cheering her own success, as she finally gains the physical memory she had lost of using shuriken. Her smirk showing more then enough her confidence in using the ninja tools. Running up, she began to pull back the amunition out of the cactus. The genin was fully prepared to now go back to the root of training her shadow shuriken techinique.

The genin then pulled out two shuriken at the same time. Her hand flcking along with her arm, sending the first shuriken towards the cactus. The other arm twisting to let go of the shuriken, trying to time it with the other shuriken. She watched both hit their target; however, she was able to accept that the techinique was done wrong. The angle, height, and timing of the second shuriken was completely off. However, her grinning smile as she pulled out another two showed she hadn't given up.

The kunochi continued her shuriken practice. Her arms give a few test runs, temporarly pulling back and forth for a moment. Her body tensing up ready to unleash the shuriken back to back. The two piercing blades just seemed to flow together, spinning like saws until they hit a dead stop. Their spikes dug into the cactus, their thunks following one another perfectl. Showing she had the timing down, as one would only notice the first before the other had already hit.

However, the other was nearly side by side the other shuriken. She pulls the last two shuriken out of her pouch. The girl then began to throw the last two at two different heighs. Over handing the first shuriken, and the other shuirken with a low throw. Though, the heights weren't too different. Pulling out the six shuriken once again, already to stand back. Her hands throwing off two more sets of shuriken. Each time, the gap between them growing larger and larger. Until finally, she got satsfied with the height.

She then began to glance back and forth to the sky and down to the earth. She gazed intensly at the sun. Then, she looked down to the cactus shadow. Looking at how it was formed and shaped, she then looked at her own shuriken. Doing so, she then began to calculate how to curve the shuriken into the shadow. She then nodded getting a good idea how to twist her hands and throw her arms. She then swung remembering everything she had gotten from the scroll in an instant. Her eyes sparking, as the first shuriken was thrown. The next one following closely. Just flying a few inches below the other, flying to the right away from the sun. It was hard for even for Chikyu to spot, and she knew where she threw it. The happy sounds of the two hitting target being the sound of success.* - Thu Nov  5 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to grind the small kinks still left in her shuriken throwing. Her hands quickly flashing through series of three throws. The shuriken coming out in quick bursts, each time at diffrerent heights and curves. The harders one being a lot of tight curving shuriken. Trying to balance the curve plus giving the same curve to another shuriken, it was a tough challange. 

The girl's throwing began to get smoother. Body and arms flowing into each of her tosses into the cacti. The shuriken following behind one another. The cover of the higher and first shuriken leaving a very sneaky punch, as the second one following the first hits. Her hands getting better at letting the blades curve into their target. The sides of the cacti now lined with spikey shuriken, instead of needles.

The girl then began to jump back and forth. Shifting distances from the cacti. Her throw being changed so it compensates with the range. Being shorter range meant, the girl need to be faster throwing the second shuriken. At longer range, she had to give a harder throw. Pitching both as hard as she can, that way they manage to actually damage the target.  Still, neither range provided that much of a challenge for the girl.* - Thu Nov  5 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stood back, her pouch filled  with her shuriken once again. She then decided for the final test run. Swiftly, Chikyu shot one hand into the pouch pulling out both shuriken. Throwing both with the shadow shuriken techinique, the second one leaving after the first at lower height. The moment both left her hand, she then swiftly shot back into her pouch. She then did the techinique again, as fast as she possible could. Doing it once more with the last set. The sound of six heavy thumps of the shuriken hitting could be heard. * - Thu Nov  5 18:46:49 2015
