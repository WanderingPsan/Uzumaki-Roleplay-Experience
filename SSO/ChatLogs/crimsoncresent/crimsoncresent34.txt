<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: There's no need to act like you care if I live or die, Priest... Hrm? Yo, Marco. - Wed Dec  2 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hah! With how excited you are over this all, I wonder if you just want to see lots of people in maid outfits and swimsuits. - Wed Dec  2 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah...she already asked me.... - Wed Dec  2 09:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: This will be a most interesting series of events - Wed Dec  2 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hah! - Wed Dec  2 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I guess your future wife really wants to see you in a swimsuit, huh Lera? - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or do you think it's the maid outfit that she's more interested in, neh? - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What a hilarious world we live in.. - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I guess so... - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Not like she hasn't seen me without anything... - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Sometimes skimpy is sexier than nothing at all, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked shocked, as she recoiled back arm over her chest. The look of  her face was more then obvious that Mitsunara had hit the obviously sticking out nail on the head. Chikyu's eyes wide open and a mouth dropped in horror at her secret being revealed. The girl then quickly tried to recover, with a low hanging head. "I mean... no..no...no of course not."

The girl's pointer fingers begin to push against each other. Her head slowly shaking back and forth in a no fashion. Her hips squirmed side to side, as if she was ready to retreat at a moment's notice. "Just..just because I offered the idea to the Kazekage...gave him the plans and the finacial data... You know, and made sure that it happen. Doesn't mean it was just to see... you girls in maid outfits. I mean... I just wanted all of us to have fun...together...ya know." Her voice wrecked with guilt that she had to lie to the group.

Then out of her chest plate, a picture slips out from it. Only Mitsunara woudl be close enough to see the picture of the other girl, she was dressed in a maid costume and had fallen over revealing the hidden underside of the long frilly skirt. Chikyu's eyes widen and glowed, as she focused on the target quickly grabbing it as it still fell in mid air. She then stuffed in quickly back into her chest.

"I mean... Its just all for fun right. Hahaha."* - Wed Dec  2 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Even if I do think you're a bit young to think about those kinda things, it's nothing really wrong, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Shinobi never cease to ammuze me... paying lera to dance... a maid cafe, what ever that is , and a swim suit contest, should be ammusing - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Well.. - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ....At least things are still cheerful, even after... - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ....God, why am I still sad about his death..? - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What kind of a killer am I, feeling sad about stupid things like that.. - Wed Dec  2 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nods her head wildly, as she almost seems to believe that Mitsunara actually bough her story. "Yes, see you get it! I was just thinking of the success in the event of course!" A arm wrapping around Mitsunara in a hug, as her eyes darted to the corner away from Mitsunara afraid they give her secret all away.

"Ashamed..PFF..Hahaha...Who would be ashamed of anything like that." 

She then begins to sweat, as Mitsunara whispers into her ear.* - Wed Dec  2 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Think about what kind- of things... Haha..hahaha.. You're so silly MItsunara. - Wed Dec  2 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: She knows my secret. She must die -omit- - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Oh, you know..~ Lewd things!~ - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh... you're acting all cute n' stuff. You know, if you still find me attractive in two years or so, look me up, neh? Hah!~ - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked extremely worried at the hug, as both her arms shot up in the air as if she had just been caught by the cops. She then gets a shocked look on her face.* - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hrm? What's wrong, Kohai? - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: *Blushing* Wait...what are you saying. Hehehe its not funny to tease me around just because you know I'm a lesbian.  - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Y'know, funnily enough, I didn't know that? But I'm not teasing or kidding. If you like me, I'm fine with that- personally, I don't favor either gender, really... beauty is beauty- but I've got a minimum age on people I'd date. - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So- yeah. I'm serious.  - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I should really start on that training... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Really...Oh! Oh... *she bites her lip* Well I mean... I just always saw you as a good friend. I didn't even think about you like that...but maybe if you really want to.. in two years... *she trails off* - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: But training is so boring... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean. I've thought of you as a freind to, so.... It's whatever you know? If you wanan give that kinda thing a try- cool. We'll see where it goes and if feelings of /that/ kind happen. If you don't wanna give it a go? Don't. - Wed Dec  2 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: That's life, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) lightly hugged back, and let go when she did. Her hands were clutched together hanging below her waist. Her head was still pointed to the ground, but there was a small smile that showed it was out of depression.* - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Have any of you seen Makoto? - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: That sounds...like tit be really nice. Guess, I'll just have to wait and see in a few years. - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Mrm. Yeah... and before you ask- no, it's not that you're not pretty. It's that I'd feel like a pedo or something, goin on a date with someone less than sixteen yearso ld. - Wed Dec  2 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Where is that girl - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: No... No I understand, don't worry about that. I really do. I'm.. just surprised theres another girl thats like me. And even if its in a few years, that she might want to date me. - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: You are suprised by this after we earlier this day talked about how Lera and Kiyoko- also two girsl- are getting married? - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah! Man.. you really can be clueless, sometimes... Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh no! I knew there were others like me, like you said Lera and Kiyoko. I just didn't think any of my friends would like people of the same gender, and then beyond that actually like me in return. I'm normally just...used to it being one sided. - Wed Dec  2 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah, I see... Mrm. Well- I mean. I think the way you tend to act is kinda cute, you're fun to fight, generally fun to spend time with.. I get along with you- and I like both genders, so... I mean, I figure if you turn out to have a crush on me, it'd be pretty smooth. I guess that's an odd sounding way to put it- but.. - Wed Dec  2 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: The way I see it, someone I know I can be freinds with, would be someone pretty safe to date? - Wed Dec  2 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Well... I mean I never look at my friends that way. Maybe this event thing has gone to my head a bit, but I really don't want to view my friends as merely crushes. Though- I think you're really beautiful, if you don't mind that coming from a younger person.  - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I guess I see what you mean. Honestly, I'da never guessed you where into chicks if not for this whole thing... - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: You also fun, nice to talk with, you have a really solid way with thoughts and words. I guess fun to fight you as well, though you seem to enjoy it a bit too much. *She softly elbows Mitsunara in the side* - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh, it's whatever, I s'pose... Mrm. I guess I think of dating a bit over logically- but then.. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I think of most things that aren't fighting a bit too logically.. and I think of fighting with almost no logic at all, bwahaha! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ahh.. Heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Gah... You and Rias both said that, I thought it be obvious... Maybe I should wear a badge or something. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: I don't think with much logic in either. Hehehe! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I don't see how it's really that obvious until such time as you actually show attraction to a chick. How am I s'posed to guess someone's sexuality unti they do something to show it off? - Wed Dec  2 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh... I guess so... Hmm, ah that makes this all much harder. I have to be friends with people, as while subtly showing I'm attracted to them without making it seem thats the only reason I'm friends with them... Phhffaa! This is all really hard to think about. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And stuff like this? - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Is why I don't even try to be subtle about that kinda stuff. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Too much hassle. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Hmm... Sounds good... I guess I'll be more obvious about this stuff. I guess I'll test it on you first! I think you look really pretty in that kimono you always wear. - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean, more often than not, I won't be picking up on subtle signals from someone else... and I'm no good at i- - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh. Thanks- I agree, I look fabulous in this Kimono!~ - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Meanwhile, your outfit goes nicely with your hair, even if it is a bit suprisingly skimpy! - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I really like how the red contrasts the white, though, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Yeah... Well, my dad raised me like a boy for most of time. So I just tended to train without a shirt, and well.... when I started growing these. My dad forced me to wear something, and well... I just don't normally feel comfortable in something like that. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ah? Explains a lot... - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Heh, is that so... Sadly the only thing else I have to wear is this maid outfit. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: As if you really mind that much, heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway... It's gettin pretty late.  Anyone know if anyone moved into Yan's house after he died..? If not, I'll probably move in- I was living with the guy anyway, and... I'm kinda homeless otherwise, so.. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well... Give me a second. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Sanoke, Akira told me he gave the key to his house to you. Is that correct? - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Akira told me, he gave it to you to give it to me. I really like to have it. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . Hrm. .  - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabbed it and bowed in grattitude. "Thanks, and well I haven't gotten a message from him which is worrying. I'll send him one first, and I'll tell you how hes doing."* - Wed Dec  2 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Or looking for a home for you - Wed Dec  2 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) came back a little with a heavy pant. "Wheew... took a while to find him. But, if you can't get Yan's home. You're more then willing to stay at my house."* - Wed Dec  2 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: And, its just because were friends. Not anything else. *she says with a smile* - Wed Dec  2 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: More lesbians.... why was I assigned to this village... - Wed Dec  2 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Because you a priest, the only thing your laying down in the middle of the night with is the bible -omit- - Wed Dec  2 10:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shook her head. "Nah, I'm sure you won't be much of a hassle. If you are, I'll just kick your butt into shape in a spar." She chuckles jokingly. "And, it will always be open for you and any my other friends. Just being honest with you." She says giving a nod. She really was open to just having her home shared with firends.* - Wed Dec  2 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure, let me lead the way. - Wed Dec  2 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls out a key and unlocks the door. The place is slightly dusty, as if people haven't stayed here in awhile. She said looking at the dark place with a small smile, it was tiny only made by the curls of her mouth. She looked upon the place as if shes seen it a million times. "OH!" She exclaimed before turning and letting in Mitsunara. "Theres no food for now, so if you need anything. You'll have to go get it or I will, but other then that. Its free for you to roam around in."* - Wed Dec  2 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) returns the hug with a squeeze. "No need to thank me." She then chuckles a bit as her new roommate just suddenly plops down on the floor and the dusty cushions. She leaves the room for a moment to go change into her pjs. She then hides her key in a special place, and comes out to get of drink of water with a yawn. 

She then passes out falling over the arm chair of the couch, and falling asleep face first in the leather seats of the couch. Her legs hanging off the sides.* - Wed Dec  2 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took a seat in the dirt, her hand reaching into the tan satchel that rested on her back. Slipping her hand through the opening, she pulled out the jutsu scroll that was handed to her by Ai. The tan swordsman took a breathe, before pulling the scroll open. Her pupils slowly going through the information at a brisk pace, reading the fundamentals of the shunshin jutsu. The simplicity of the jutsu and its effectiveness really shining through to the girl, as even she got its conecpt from the very start. This was her kind of jutsu.* - Wed Dec  2 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued to read as the person walks through the tight passage between the rock walls that acted as a border for the training grounds. Her eyes were compeltely focused into reading the jutsu, and her mind slowly gorging down on the jutsu in front of her. Currently, her reading explaining some of the basic explanations of how the chakra works in the jutsu. The way one will use it to accelerate themselves forward and then use it to do a safe landing. However, it seemed quite worrisome the numerous warnings that began to be stated through out the scroll. Her just stopping at the line about how this jutsu had a far bigger step up of mastery for it. She would've continued, but the sound of a stranger's voice lifted her out of her studies.

She looked up and over to the apparent visitor, she assumed. His clothing was something she was different to what she was used. The only person she knew that wore clothes like him, wore it in a very different fashion. Hearing his name the dark skinned girl bobbed her head in a nod. "Chikyu...Chikyu Kasanari. Its a pleasure to meet you." She said offering out a hand shake. She flashed a row of white teeth in a brilliant smile towards him.* - Wed Dec  2 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) clutched his hand in a tight grip, and practically whipped his hand up and down a few times with her shake before she let go. The silverish hair of the girl that was growing wild along her bangs and the end of her hair bounced, as she held up the scroll. "Oh this... its just a simple jutsu scroll. Its something about going at a super fast speed with chakra. I got it from a friend of mine." She said, as she dipped her head back at the paper finishing reading the paragraph she on.

Again, it was suggesting some rather terrible side effects for the jutsu. Nausea, gut pain, and a state of delirious all coming from the speed of the techinique. Apprently, the movement is so quick that not only can the body not adjust to it. The mind as well lags behind and is throw off its equilibrium. This results in a painful concoction of a medical state. Practice can minimize these effects; however, this was more then the usual effort to train up other jutsus. You had to dedicate a large amount of time to fully grasp and physically take this jutsu as a useful tool in battle.* - Wed Dec  2 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked up from the scroll again, and nodded to his words. She gave him another smile saying excitedly "Oh wow whoses your teacher, maybe I should go ask them for training! Hehehe." She chuckled clearly joking aobut it. "Have faced off with Kinami or Hideo both of them are extremely good at pure Taijutsu too." She mentions before once again lowering her head.

Now the scroll began to get into the more complicated matters. The information of actually performing the jutsu. It first began with the person scoping out their destination. It was important to choose one in your range, which one had to test for. The next step, the users forms the tiger seal while using it to focus chakra into their legs. Using this building energy in the feet and legs, the user would let it go all at once saving a portion that would then be used to stop them on their destination. Her head began to dip lower and lower, as she began to read complicated formulas about the amounts of chakra to use...explanation of chakra user per distance in several measurements, it was too foreign to use such calculations for a girl who went with natural instincts and guts then high caliber logic.* - Wed Dec  2 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gives him an applause. "Thats pretty impressive. You should try out Kinami and Paine if you want more of a challenge." She says, beofre smiling at his second words. "Oh really, I'm learning from my father too, though he just lives his life out as a farmer now."

She then looks down to complete the last bit of information she had to pull from the scroll. She took quickly the last bits of notes and suggestions on how to train. Though, it all boiled down to doing the jutsu over and over till it became more natural for ones body. A person aiming to use the jutsu also had to test being precise with their measurements and distance. Though, Chikyu wasn't too worried about that considering shes been fighting with a sword all her life. She knew about measuring and keeping track of positioning.* - Wed Dec  2 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nope, I'm a swordsman. - Wed Dec  2 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) rotates the scroll in her hand for a moment, as she rolls up the piece of parchment. She then quickly slides it back into her satchel. Where she gave it a few safety pats to jostle it down in there so it wouldn't fall out.* - Wed Dec  2 16:06:49 2015
