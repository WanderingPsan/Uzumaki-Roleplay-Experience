Damnit... I guess theres never enough time to think about such things... Just do what your duty is.> He thought to himself.

He then looked over as the man named Kenshin came into the field. <Another guy that even the kages seem to know. And, Raikage seemed to notice some of our own people as well.

He then looked over to Himura and Fujitora who he was teamed up with to protect the inside of the village. A head scratching, as he wonders what they could do against people that join in a battle that include such insane strengths and jutsus. Like running on air.

He sighs, pulling off his headband from his leg, and tying it over his forehead. A quick synch of his knot to keep it there.* - Sun Sep 13 21:23:12 2015

The bridge to Kirigakure comes from the west. And, its clear they're attacking there first. So, we need to get ever civilllian away from the battle as quickly as possible to the east. This all while prevent any possible attacks from the north or south beaches. We can hide them in the buildings there, and give them protection while giving us more room to fight without worry about innocent casualties."

He then thought for a moment. "Then, we'll support the front lines. Protect the roads, for escape or giving supplies and troops. And, we'll be the second line of defense they'll have to get through."* - Sun Sep 13 21:30:52 2015

He would explain as promptly and confident in his words as he could to the people. He wouldn't rush them or sound scared. He just simply tell them in a collected manner about the attack on the village, not informing them that it was Zetsumo that was behind it. Just saying they need to be moved away from the western lines, and take in the safe shelter that will protect in the East. He then, headed back as fast as he could to the village academy with a simple shunshin disappearing in a flash back to his meeting spot.* - Sun Sep 13 21:41:58 2015

But until then, he would continue to give orders when he can. 

He then let out a sigh, as he heard them talking about Kirigakure girls. "..." He thought about it for a moment. "Lera is pretty nice.... right?" he said looking to Himura questioningly.* - Sun Sep 13 22:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) let out a loud sigh of relief, a smile ticking up on the corner of his cheek. "Good...Good... " He then looked to his side. "Oh great, you're here." He said looking to Kubo. He walks up to to him. "Please tell me you have your village assigned radio on you."* - Sun Sep 13 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stares at him for a moment, still keeping the smile. Eyes widening. "You're kidding right, you must have gotten one when you got out of the academy. Along with your village tanto..." his hands gripping the side of Kubo's shoulders. "YOU KNOW! The one thing you're caught with out you get fined and punished as a shinobi! THE ONE YOU TAKE SIX MONTHS OF TRAINING WITH?" Jin was breaking.* - Sun Sep 13 22:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) isn't even going to answer Koji.* - Sun Sep 13 22:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Did you send anyone to scout out the west part of the village? - Sun Sep 13 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) paused for a moment hearing Kubo statement, before snapping his neck to Himura. "No... if you wish to, go visit it and report on the status of our front line. But again, don't get caught up in it. I need you on defense."

He then turned back to Kubo. "I don't have time to question how you missed six months of the Academy new REQUIRED, training with Tantos. To the point of a near mastery with them. But right now, I have a village to protect."* - Sun Sep 13 22:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Damnit... I send more people then Himura, but thers no way of coumminicating with anyone now. I still haven't heard from the guy with the sword. He could've falled into one of our traps or fighting an enemy ninja for all I know. - Sun Sep 13 22:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Yet I'm the only one getting a fine. - Sun Sep 13 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Is there a reason you aren't slapping fines in their faces? - Sun Sep 13 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Himura and the sword guy, I now know why Tethys picked us three to stay here. The only ones that matters. - Sun Sep 13 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: If you haven't noticed some of these guys aren't even part of our village. The other half didn't give me a smug attitude about it. - Sun Sep 13 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Uh huh.. - Sun Sep 13 22:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Not here, now. If I remember seeing you fight. You're pretty athlet-.... Anyways, you're pretty atheltic. Run to north, south, and east shores and check on them. - Sun Sep 13 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: *that was at Kubo* - Sun Sep 13 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) then turned to Kida. "I would like to have posted scouts, that can inform me of their positions at any time. Which is the point of the rules and regulations of the village. Which apparently nobody learned in the avademy.  Besides that, until an enemy arrives or we hear new information. We're stuck here. This is the best we can do. Thats the problem with playing defensive.* - Sun Sep 13 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh also, Kubo do note the villagers are hiding in the east. - Sun Sep 13 22:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I rather be on the front lines, helping even if it's a little. - Sun Sep 13 22:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, you're on the line thats to protect our village. That should be your goal as a shinobi, boring or not. - Sun Sep 13 22:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Once Kubo's gets back, I'll send you out on scouting duty. That way it will give something to do, because I know just as much as you. However much it hurts to be standing still in this. - Sun Sep 13 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It just feels like I'm of no help. - Sun Sep 13 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "I'm pretty sure the villagers you help evacuate don't believe that, and I sure don't." He says shaking his head. "But feeling useless is natural, in a situation like this. Because you won't be changing the big picture. But what you can do, is keep yourself alive and the others around you."* - Sun Sep 13 22:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: True.. - Sun Sep 13 22:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: You'll get your chance, and just trust Tethys and others for this moment. - Sun Sep 13 22:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well the ones we do have, are rather antagonistic I suppose. Well the one I've met so far. - Sun Sep 13 23:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm..Maybe. I haven't really looked at them like that anyway. Not like it matters or not. - Sun Sep 13 23:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) hears another explosion, and the sizzling in the enviroment is starting to get to him, as he makes a call to Himura to check on the western front.* - Sun Sep 13 23:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Checked. - Sun Sep 13 23:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Ehh looking good at the west. - Sun Sep 13 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kubo(Jell0) says: Nothing out of the ordinary anywhere else. - Sun Sep 13 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That steak was delicious. - Sun Sep 13 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It was high quality. - Sun Sep 13 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Just the right amount of seasoning. - Sun Sep 13 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Kida and Renkin, both giving something other then the war to focus on. He decided once Kida seem to be bored or do nothing, he send him out for the next check on the shores.* - Sun Sep 13 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Good job, thanks for doing. - Sun Sep 13 23:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So it seems that we have the upper hand for now. - Sun Sep 13 23:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's mostly a stalemate from what I could see and learn from others. - Sun Sep 13 23:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... hmm... Hopefully, we can push them back. - Sun Sep 13 23:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed. - Sun Sep 13 23:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, West side was clear too. - Sun Sep 13 23:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Renkin(Tyrone From State Farm) says: ..so...What do you do? - Sun Sep 13 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) lifts his hand rubbing his head. "I'm just worried about the destruction they could do here, if we don't get them back. Any of number of days they continue the siege, the more destruction will become of Kirigakure. And the more time it will take to recover."* - Sun Sep 13 23:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It will all be well, we have many fine shinobi. - Sun Sep 13 23:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm just a regular shinobi. - Sun Sep 13 23:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And I don't  know if Amegakure has enough forces to go against 3 villages at once. - Sun Sep 13 23:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They don't. - Sun Sep 13 23:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Then again, war isn't won only by forces, but my strategy. - Sun Sep 13 23:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's possible that they may win if we lack the proper strategies and tactics. - Sun Sep 13 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Same for them. - Sun Sep 13 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But in terms of numbers and force, I think this joint alliance has the upper hand. - Sun Sep 13 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys is commanding. - Sun Sep 13 23:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: And he is quite tactical. - Sun Sep 13 23:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) runs to a near by vending machine and begins dumping quarter yens into it, and pulling out water bottles by the dozens. He then stands over a neat bottle stack, wiping his hand over it. "This should be enough for Tethys when he gets back. I should've prepared a larger stock." he says letting out a sigh, as he sits down next to it. "Guh... I hope another village shinobi doesn't have to drag him back injured. Maybe he'll atleast make it to the courtyard by himself."* - Sun Sep 13 23:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What's with all of those bottles? - Sun Sep 13 23:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) said out depressingly. "Tethys." He sighs, and continues. "He has no idea of gauging himself in battle. He always comes back near death. You think a shinobi would manage himself better, but not Tethys." He then looks to the bottles. "Of course for a ninja that comes near death like that in every fight, he has a special way of healing. And not to stain the secret, those bottles are key to his recovery."* - Sun Sep 13 23:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh..Ok. - Sun Sep 13 23:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) let  out a sigh. "Tethys, quickly we need to supply the recent genin with Radios. Nobody but Himura, had them. It was hard to set up scouts and watchouts with no means of communications." he said rubbing his skull, it was clear the chuunin had a rought time while Tethys was away. "It was a mess, I'm just glad nothing serious happened."* - Mon Sep 14 09:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Luckly, at least they were more then willing to listen to orders. And Himura, Kida, and the one tan taijutsu guy kept up rounds. surveying the beaches and guiding the villagers to safe houses. - Mon Sep 14 09:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulling back, feet digging in the grass. The newly evolved chuunin contemplates the previous attack on the village. Though, they've thrown off their attackers this time. It wasn't no thanks to Jin, whose envolvement was little to none. He doubted himself, that he be able to actually take a jonin one on one. He needed to continue his work, he thought to himself as he leant back. Lips parting to let in the air down his throat. Pressing at the bottom of his lungs pushing them downwards. When their elasisty stopped in that direction the sides begin to expand as his tank of air began to full. He then switched through five handseals, before leaning over. Feet momentarily leaving the earth as wind blew out of his body shooting on the ground before directing itself forward. The water decompressing into a morphed semi circle as the wind crashed  into it.

Looked over to the waves that splashed back and forth, pressing itselt to recover. He then leaned back once more taking in the air. His torso bloating as he takes in the momentous amount. He then dug into the earth, as the soles of his feet slide left and right. He then blew another blast of air that dug up at the loosened earth. Dust blowing along with the water off towards the horizon in view.

Shaking off the dust that clung to his face, the chuunin brought his back out once more time. He was already loading another chamber for his jutsu. Chakra swirling in his chest already preparing to do the jutsu again. His wind nature developing already trying its best to ingrain itself in the air he was taking in. His hands already knowing the seals to follow, as they weave the chakra flowing under his ribcage. He then let out the blast of unhindered wind out of him. The coursing wind on a trail straight forward, like a full speed locomotion train on the rails. Easily brushing aside the water in its path only dying when its chakra powered engine died. 

Thought for a moment his training was going well, until his mind roared out <Did you not hear the explosions... The fear that you faced... This is not the time to be padding yourself on the back.> It was for a moment he felt breathless....until he soaked in the atmosphere, and took back the wind inside his own body. The expanse of his chakra filling his lungs already packing in the tension buidling up the pressure with its own energy. Feeling his body about to burst, he unleash the wind of frustration out of his body. The blast propelling forward, the genin continuing to blow air until his body felt strained. His lungs crumpling into wrinkled empty sacks, before lets go letting out a gasp as he takes in air again. 

Handseals were already wipping out of the chuunin's hand. Jin fingers rubbing against each other, scarring the skin with calluses. His body not mind to being abused once more as he sucked in the air. The wind streaming in a spiral into his lips, mouth puffing up until he was looking straight up. Body stiff from being so filled with air. He then managed to bend down to direct his attack forward. The chakra streaming out first, before the wind comes flying out in a loud roar. Tumbling over the surface of the water. 

Leaned over, as the water splashed up seperated from the wind, coming back together in a large clash of waves. His breathe coming out in heavy pants. Weaving the five handseals together, he pulls himself up again. Taking a quick suction inside his mouth. He then reversed this with a powerful blow. The wind coming out in another stream but less volume then the one before. Clearly, he didn't take enough air this time. Which leads the chuunin to smack the side of his head to remind him to keep fresh.

Crushing down on his teeth for a moment. He goes back to taking in air treating his body nothing more then a tank. Filling his chest with as much air giving it all the space he could spare before blowing his lungs out. He then directs his attack forward, wind coming out of the chuunin in one large gust. The chakra causing it to surge and stick together to improve its force.

Keels over after his last gust, landing on all fours on the ground. His breathe paced for several moments. He then stood back up for a moment. His body trembling as he recovers himself back up. He takes one long extended inhale, as his hands work their magic with the handseals. Chakra sparking into his lungs with each one. He then blows forward, the wind taking all that was left in his lungs. Splashing across the water several times. His body dropping once he finished his jutsu. His chakra still useable, but his oxygen rates too low to not spend time to rest.

Checking our defensive measure and testing our range might." He then closed his eyes, and thought for a moment. "Seeing no pull, they retread with their loses. A well enough victory for us, but we also showed our own strengths to them. Theres no way in hell they searched for a direct battle in the first place, and I doubt they do one now.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stood at the usual spot of his training, finding himself rather now fond of the spot. It was a good place to train, and very few poeple come bother him. Taking in the air around him, the chuunin voluntarly grew plump with air. His mouth the only viable seal for the held gust that was building in his chest. Chakra seeping into his lungs, as he forged several seals. He then opened up his mouth blowing outwards. A sweeping wind coming out breaking the surface of the water into violent whitewash of bubbles gurgling as it intakes open air.

Watching his attack jumped over the surface, Jin begins to notice that the power of his attack wasn't improving. He wondered if he could find a way to help improve this. Not thinking of something at the moment, he begins to just try out his jutsu again. Air going into his chest until expands, and begins wielding the store energy for a moment until he comples the seals. He then unleashes the gust from the center of his lips. A cannon of pure wind firing outside, the recoiling forces blowing away his loose clothing. 

Taking a few breathes to recover his stamina, as he felt himself already suffer completely eveserating his air supply.  He pulls in more air from the outside inside his lungs. Quickly flashing in a pale white, his hands as they form the series of seals. The chuunin lets out another burst of the chakra enchanced air. The gust rushing forward with one large ball of force that left a vacuum like trail in the atmosphere.

Shook himself awake, pulling himself together gathering in the wind from the open air. He lengthens the time he holds on the air, giving him more time to send chakra and move his fingers into seals. Feeling himself ready to unleash the attack, he shoves his chest forward the muscles in his abdomen pushing out the bottom of his lung. Pushing his head downwards, he lets go of the valve sending out the wave of air into the surface of the water. The water began to push down into a circular hole. The water begins to swirl inwards, filling up the void made by the jutsu. Watching this made the chuunin's eyes spark for a moment.

Took a moment to intake the air by opening his mouth. The hiss of the air going inside his body his let out loudly as the amount is far more then normal. Finally full on the air, his lips having trouble holding back all the amount stuck in his chest. He then does the quick five seals with his hands, he then blows out. However, this time the chakra that left in the wind begins to spin. The raging wind now focused on a more refined point, as the circulation spins faster and faster. The wind's rotation giving it a true trail to follow. The gust coming off of it blowing out ripples over the water surface.

Decided he had three more gusts left inside his body, as he pulled back taking in air greedly. His lungs now fully expanded, as the chakra swirls inside his lungs and up his trachea. He the pushes forward squeezing out the air in a spiral motion. The chakra keeping the shape of the wind as it drills forwards diagonally down until it rams into the suraface of the water. Pushing so deep its taken under the waves, in a few moments the bubbles of air come rising up giving the sea a small layer of foam.

Chest was bounding from the pain, as his muscles learned to stretch in more ways then they were prepared for. Still, the chuunin ignored the signals to stop. Ingesting more of his air, as he took in more fuel for his jutsu. He then pumped in the nesscary chakra ignoring giving it a spin for now. Not having the energy to spare for such a task, he blew out the air in one large burst. Leaning over as the last bit of air escapes in a fizzle.

Pulling up his fingers already to start again. He charges up his chakra bringing himself ready to cast the jutsu first. Taking in his own personal air at first with a few short breathes, and when he was ready he changed to one large inhale. Taking in as much air as he could, before he felt the pain of shock hit him. Unable to hold in the air, he then let it go which only came out on equivilent to the godly wind from the mountains. His body felt like it was going to collapse. His knees pressed on the grass, letting himself take ease for just a moment.* - Mon Sep 14 22:42:08 2015
