<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued ot hold her head against the wall. Her cheeks blushing, mind rerunning the same image of Rias over and over in her head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Mizora, as she began pulling out many things that her father never had to cook with, like seasoning and sauces. She watched with a rather hungry animal stare, until Rias interupted with her finished shower. 

When Mizora dropped the bowl on the table, Chikyu quickly picked up the bowl and began wolfing it down. Her mouth swallowing the stew greedly. When she was done, she wiped her mouth off then turned to MIzora. "Gah!" A breath of satsifaction escaping her, "That was delicious Mizora.

"Ahh...thats so good~"* - Mon Nov 16 00:19:37 2015

"Hehe...I'm glad you include me in a good group of friends like that." She said laying her hands over her legs, which were right now curled beneath her.  "I'm glad I gained a good friend in return."* - Mon Nov 16 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was hit by the embrace, a warm smile and eyes looking to the girl who was truly thankful. The dark skin of her arms went around, and squeezed back. She nuzzled lightly on Mizora's shoulder.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "I'll be by your side all the way." She says, as she stands up. She begins to unlcok her armbands, each one coming off with a metallic click before opening up for her to take off. She turns around "Guys? Hahaha! Whats good about them."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Okay then." She said turning and nodding in Mizora's direction.

Chikyu then grabs the large silverware bowl she was handed, and actually pours the stew herself. Though, it was a bit cold thanks to it sitting on the table for so long. Still, it was better then sitting on an empty stomach. Chikyu also poured another bowl for herself. She sets the two bowls on the table in front of Ai and herself. 

The kunochi slowly eating this bowl this time. She seemed still a bit full from the other bowls she had earlier.* - Mon Nov 16 02:15:40 2015
