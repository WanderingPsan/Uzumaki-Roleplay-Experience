<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or are they meant to be kept secret? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Had he gotten caught in his genjutsu and his focus dispersed, would the masked be rendered useless? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's the theory Tethys came up with, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The contents were a variety of Tethys' techniques. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: When I remember seeing him, I don't recall any threads being used to control them. This is somehing different than puppetry, I believe. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Well..we need to test that theory out. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If they were just normal threads then they would be no problem.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: These threads, perhaps are composed of chakra. I know of only one style that could counter those effectively.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: But yeah, the masks' bodies seem to be composed of these threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Maybe you could stick them together. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Actually Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Theres a lot of those mud clones and that syrup water jutsu. That might tangle them. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Zetsumo was able to operate them, and still fight himself, from high in the air. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He infromed me the threads were easily cut but blade edge. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015

"I didn't complete my training while he was alive, and its still not done." He then looked back up. "I was just curious if you knew where it was, and if I could pull it out just to train with. Then I put it back until I knew I was capable of wielding it in a battle."* - Sat Sep 19 19:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) clenching to the sides of the stony tan rock hes been using for training. He places his hands exactly on the dried crimson patches that mirrored the other side. Bending his knees, the chuunin hoisted the cumbersome lump of mangled earth in one swift motion. With the rock poised in front of him. The chuunin began to swing the orb up and down. A swoosh and hiss were heard over and over. The swoosh coming from the wind being divided, as the rain of dirt hit the ground in a sizzle of numerous molecule crashes.

Changing his motions, Jin took to lumbering the rock over the shoulder. Before pulling it down past it and to the side of his hips. His posture shifted back and forth, keeping the weight in a singular part of his body.  Jin took to repitition to make sure he made the flow of his attacks to perfection. Keeping his knees bending in the move to hold himself up, as the rest of his body went to a slight limp. Stretching instead of constricting to keep himself from breaking in the weight or slowing himself down.

Feeling far more then comfortable with those two moves. He then brought his training rock to his side pressing into his Chuunin Vest. Feeling his body ready, he then let out a loud "Rraggh!" flinging the large rubble to the other side. He the continued swinging back and forth, his body on a swivel. Letting itself be take with the move flying in its way, until slowing it down with a tightening of his hips. The rock just hitting into the protectioni of the vest. He continued until his arms wouldn't move any more, and hung below under his waist. Wavering back and forth but still being managed to be carried by the shinobi.

Taking a few breathes but not letting go of the cause of his exhaustion. He then thought of his next training, and just the mere mental image gave Jin a grimace of pain and fret. Taking a big as breathe as he could, Jin clenched down his right thigh and stiffened his lower leg to lock his right leg into a tight support. He then lightly lifted the back of the heel of his left foot, his body twisting to press the weight of the rock to his right leg. Jin whinced at the pain feeling all the stress switch to one side of his body, and make him feel so off balance. It made him pause in the middle of his strating stride. He then lifted more and more of his left foot until it finally passed that gap of actually pulling off the ground.  He quickly shot it forward, before his right side collapsed. He then moved the rock to his left, and did the opposite. Painfully dragging another step with his root foot this time.

Jin made his tiny steps in that dreadful march continuing moving at a snail's pace. He was carrying the heavy burden in his arms, fingers feeling like they'll pop off which gave fear to him dropping the rock on his foot.  Bitting and swallowing down his fears. The chuunin continued inching himself across the grass. His knees rattled each time he lost the suppot of either one. But, he needed to be able to move with this even if it killed him. Soon, he began to get a mechanical plan inside his head. Pulling his body forward slightly getting a stride that lack any sign of rythm, but it was a stride. Continuing until he hit the wall of the waterfall, dropping the rock in satsfication of what he done for the day.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the upcoming Erebus only because of the ear shattering noise that came from his dragging cargo. Two hands coming up to plugging his ear to prevent the shrieking coming from the metal. When, he finally came to a stop and let out his attention begging sigh. Jin, slowly dropping his hands to his sides looked up to Erebus. "Is there something I can help you with? You seem...distressed." * - Sun Sep 20 06:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked at the man seeing he wouldn't respond to himself. He wished Baen was here then there could be some chain of communication, since Baen was the only one with any ounce of understanding to this guy. Maybe Jin just wasn't sympathetic enough to handle a guy like Erebus. Looking at the cloak figure and his scythe just made him feel concerned over that fact he could easily start a ruckus. Just by people seeing him or the local enforcement watching a guy wander around with a scraping scythe.

<Well he hasn't done anything wrong... Theres nothing I can do.> He nodded his head. "Forgive me, if I'm getting personal with your affairs." He says, turning around with his cloak looking up at the sky to note what time it was, before looking back to the courtyard and the Jashin. <I wish Fujitora was here... then I could get my hands on Tethys sword and work on my training.>* - Sun Sep 20 06:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) hairs raised slightly as the man came closer. Jin tensed for a moment, as he watched the weapon holder get closer. Jin hated this he had no way to read this man, and thats what really made him edgy around Erebus. He was clearly not right of mind, or at least not in a good state of mental health. Emotional swinging like that of a pendulum of a ancient grandfather clock, social awkwardness, and a far too interest in that of death and religion.

Still, Jin tried to remain civil about this. "What sins have been done?"* - Sun Sep 20 06:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a step back at such a violent lurch that came from Ereberus as he found conflict inside his mind. Jin reached a hand out for a moment, only to retract it back not thinking it was best to touch the man at the moment. His eyes only slightly flinching from the sound of his bones clacking together. As much as he hated to admit it, he was getting used to that sound coming from this guy.

"Well... How can they be repented?" He asks prying for some information to what in the world could be racking around inside the Jashinist's mind.* - Sun Sep 20 06:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Submit yourself to my cause; for it is the only hope you have left.. - Sun Sep 20 07:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: What is your cause? - Sun Sep 20 07:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: To dine with gods. - Sun Sep 20 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ...And how will you be doing this... - Sun Sep 20 07:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: By stitching my into the fabric of this shinobi world. - Sun Sep 20 07:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) eyes narrowed, looking at Erebus very questioningly. A sort of spark hitting his chest, as he looked to him. "Weren't you the one who said that having a end path without being properly preparred for it is a quick way to death. How are you going to stich your name into the shinobi world? Are you already thinking you far surpassed those making history right now? And isn't that a rather vague goal begin with. Even making a single jutsu thats powerful or versitle enough could put you on every scroll in the land."* - Sun Sep 20 07:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My end path has been identified; stitching my name into this shinobi world is merely a stepping stone on the path. My abilities far surpass plenty, but I have yet to surpass all. My goal is not vague, but broad due to how wide my path is. I resort not to jutsu like you shinobi, but the faith I have. - Sun Sep 20 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lets not joke around here. Your path is fame, you're looking to be famous. It might be a part of grandious picture, merely a step. But in the end, all your looking to do is get famous in the best way you know how. - Sun Sep 20 07:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I care not for what publicity I obtain in your world; for my actions are done to suffice one entity. My cause is true, my cause is set; my cause is sinless. - Sun Sep 20 07:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Perfection is the result of stitching my name into the fabric of this world. - Sun Sep 20 07:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But, you haven't done that. And if you aren't perfect, the chance you scerw up your own guidelines is a possibility? - Sun Sep 20 07:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Sins are made by choice, I choose not to do so. - Sun Sep 20 07:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I simply choosen to sin. Thus, I'm a sinless mortal. - Sun Sep 20 07:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) slips under the brown cloak collar, a jingle of silver is heard as he pulls out a thin chain link of low grade shining metal grey. At the end of his pulling he snags for a moment, before gently pulling out the last bit. At the end of the link, hangs s a contrasting bright yellow symbol that at first glance one may mistake as gold but merely a shined bronze. It is made up of three circles, each one is welded to each other in the form of a pyramid, with one circle standing on top of the other two.

"I believe in that of the selfless, loving mother of chakra herself. The one who gave birth to the spread of chakra. Just like the tree which bore the fruit she ate , she gave roots to this earth that made our world that is today. I seek to use my jutsu to give peace to the land, and spread myself as far as I can go extending like a root itself tracing myself and my foundation to the original tree." He said rather proudly while holding the necklace, and then slowly slipping it back down towards his chest. * - Sun Sep 20 08:19:24 2015
