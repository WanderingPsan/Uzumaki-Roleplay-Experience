He then draws arrows going towards the north. "If we can draw them in, we can make attack to the other side wiping out those troops with ease.... If they attack. If we can set up the barrier at the last moment of their attack. We can have our main forces come out and still take out the opposite side.

Before the barrier set up, hypothetically we attack the north with range or aerial attacks. Baiting Zetsumo forces to either reinforce or attack the other sides of the village. At this time we send forces to the south to attack that small portion of their troops. Activate the barrier, and retreat back into the village barrier."* - Fri Sep 18 16:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: What is this about attacking? - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The army will be able to retreat before Zetsumo shows up, that much is certain if we place the attack at the furthest point from him. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
