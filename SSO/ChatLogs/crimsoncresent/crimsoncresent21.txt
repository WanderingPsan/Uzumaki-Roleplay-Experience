<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure, sure. Well, the ninjutsu I want to teach you actually channels earth release chakra into your weapon or whatever you apply it too and it increases it's durability. - Mon Nov 16 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like your sword for example. - Mon Nov 16 15:38:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) places it down on the ground grabbing the sword off her back. She then smashes the bottom of the handle of the sword which is covered in a spiked golden bronze pommel. The pommel doesn't even managed to land a scratch in the kunai, as the pomel slips off its sides and smashes into the dirt leaving a small indentation of itself. "Oh...wow you are right!' She shout, as she pulled back her sword.

The girl then began to try and copy Yan's handseals. It took her awhile, clearly not as agile as Yan over here. Her hands took to forming the seals slowly, fingers curling in adjustments to the seals. When she finished, she gripped the handle of her sword with both hands. She then tried to shoot out chakra from her body into the blade. Her head trying to imagine her sword slowly transforming into stone. Her chakra begins to bleed out, but there was so little control. The energy merely began to disperse off the sides the moment she let it out. The blade not changing in the slightest.

"Ughh..."* - Mon Nov 16 15:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You'll get it..keep at it. - Mon Nov 16 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued to do her work. Dropping this attempt for another, as she went back to slowly weaving the seals doing them all rather properly. She had a lot of control of her own physical body, but something metaphysical like chakra was far out of her comfort zone. She took a breathe, and began to release chakra back out over her blade. The energy continued to come out, but in almost plumes of smoke. Energy just shooting off now, as she tried to press herself into pouring even larger amounts of chakra in it only to continue to fail.

The girl bit her lip, and tried it agian. The seals being done slightly quicker, as she began to memorize the movemetns. Her hands clenched and eased, several times on the handle. The girl lack of control was beginning to grow easily more noticable, as she started to finally grasp the concept of sending the chakra across her blade. However, the energy was fluxuating like that of the waves of a turbulent seas. There was no flat and calm layer of chakra, and instead the chakra quickly began to break apart unable to stay glued to the surface of the weapon.

Hands squeezed tighter on the weapon. The sound of her fingers slipping against the leather of the grip, could be heard with sharp squeeks of her sweaty skin losing traction. The girl breathe getting heavier, as she poured more and more chakra into the blade. Only for her body to lose it all, the attachment to the blade still unseccessful with the fourth attempt. The energy though began to get more solid better orcheastrated then the last.* - Mon Nov 16 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked behind her to look over to Sanoke. "Haha..thanks for the advice. But, I don't use any other earth jutsus and...well I don't know what you're talking about with the atoms and stuff."  She said finding really no help in the advice had to offer, but appreciated the attempt to help her in the training. 

The girl then turned her head back to her blade, taking a few more breathes and refreshing her supply of chakra. When she felt able she began to continue, as she once again spread her mental energy over the blade. This time, the energy began to adhere to the blade. Her hands shaking as she began to condense the energy on the blade. Chikyu then sat completely still trying to hold the energy as long as she could. Being able to accomplish a near minute of it, but realizing the blade hadn't changed properties at all. Losing the confidence with this attempt, and turning the jutsu off on her own command.

The girl let go of the blade for a moment closing her eyes. She then clapped her hands together, as if an act to pump herself up. She then clenched the sword in her hand after completing the nesscary seals. Her chakra spiked for a moment, as she sent out the blue energy across her blade. The girl then began to let out a growling hum. "Errgghghhghhh!" The girl's breath practically hissing, as the chakra begins to condense tighter and tighter. Until, it finally manages to become something of a protective layer. Though, the layer was still in its infant stages and wouldn't be much help with the girl's lack of experience.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) steps down from the Kirigakure, starring at the water with shock. "Wow...look at all of it! Theres no place like this in Sunagakure!" She says peering over the edge, starring at her reflection in the water for a moment. Pulling herself out of her stunned amazement, she stands up turning to Mitsunara. "Oh sorry... guess we should go and get on with the mission. Just kind of excited."* - Tue Nov 17 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) catches up to Mitsunara on the bridge, hopping along the ricketing bridge and its creeking boards. The girl got up to her, and looked over to her. "I see, I was about to ask how it was in your homeland... but its a shame to see its not much different." 

She walked side by side with the girl, arms waving back and forth like pendulums. Her exicitemnt and energy showing in her expressive movemetn. "Hehe, glad I get to see it with you then Mitsunara. Its nice to have someone share the beauty of this place."* - Tue Nov 17 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to her. "I guess your right." She said keepin gup with the pace. Her head shifting around, as soon as she mentioned keeping up her guard. "I just wish that it was much safer to walk around like this. Whatever, I sure the both of us can handle anything that comes up.... if not we run away as fast as possible! Hahaha!" She says letting out a laugh.

She then paused hearing her homeland, before patting Mitsunara on the back. "Well if you ever want to talk about it with me, I'm sure we can talk more in the Hungry Ant."* - Tue Nov 17 02:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shook her head, as she continued to walk back. "I mean we got to complete the mission. I mean if you want to I can take back the mission when we get close to Sunagakure, and you can go to Konoha. But, I wouldn't want to split up like that."* - Tue Nov 17 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) squints her eyes, as the unnatural mist begins to set in. The girl quickly grabbing her sword, as it passes over them. She then hears the voice. Her mind went to instant fight or flight mode. Her body tensing as she looks at her odds.

Her eyes tilted towards where Mitsunara was next to her in the mist. She almost let out a mental sigh, it was really expected of her. Especially, the attitude she had before the mission even began. She took one breathe to calm herself, being quite as to not give herself away in the mist any more then she should. Her sword poised read to swing at anything that comes at her.* - Tue Nov 17 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Sure is a lotta dudes.. - Tue Nov 17 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) flipped her blade to shield herself, as she saw the shadow of the shuriken flying from the trees. Holding the blade diagonally using its width to block most of the attacks. However, there was one thing that immediatly confused her about it as the attacks striked. Her eyes flicking over to the other people standing in the mist. Though, she wasn't smart enough to figure it out. * - Tue Nov 17 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) could see MItsunara try and strike the figures in the mist, but couldn't tell whether her attacks hit or not. So she was very much surprised that the real ninjas had been hiding behind them. The girl quickly took the hit to the back of the head, before letting out a "Ahhh-Ahhh!" as the sparks from the raiton flash hit her from from behind. She is all to easy for a prey for the far superior taijutsu users that laid beneath the earth.

Her body being fried, and taken beneath the soil. Her body too stunned, before she takes the major blow to her head, the kick rocking her brain back and forth.  Her body going limp as she is easily contained under the soil. Her head limping to the side, as she was completely incapacitated.* - Tue Nov 17 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) head quickly disappears under the soil. Her hands dropping the swords in her hands, as she hits in the anclove. Her eyes were closed shut, and her mouth was almost frozen in her gasp of pain from the sudden srikes. Her body is more then easily wrapped in bounds, and without the larger sword she was easily carried to wherever they wished.* - Tue Nov 17 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins to wake up, her head killing her with an agonizing throb from the back of her head where she was hit multiple times. The girl wakes up in an almost floating sensation. She tries to pull on her arms to help her get up, but she finds them inhibited. Her wrists painfully yanking against the steel cuffs that were locked around them. Her eyes began to open, a slight haze to her vision after being lost for so long in her mind.

She looks around finding her self in the room. She pulls again on her bindings, but the chains successfully keep her hoked on to the wall. "Aerrhh! AArgghg!" Teeth gritting, as she tries to pull out her strength. However, she was too physically weak to even budge them. She looked to the rest of her body, her legs were tied up as well with shorter bindings, leaving them stuck under her own body as if she was kneeling. The girl took a few breathes, not resorting to any form of yelling in fear or calling for help.* - Tue Nov 17 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to break under the silence, and the inability to even rest comfortably thanks to the restraints on her. She had to keep her body sitting straight, or elese feel the chains tugging on her arm. With no noise, she was left only to her own thoughts. Though, the voice of her father kept ringing in her head. It reminded her that one should save their strength in situations like this. Crying for help, will only gain you reprecutions from your captors. Keep calm... keep cool...look for the best moment to escape. 

The words rung mentally, but physically it did little to help her heart from beating like a machine. Pumping blood through out her body, especially to the constrained limbs being smothered by the tight hold on her skin. Her breathe was radical balancing out the carbon dioxide and oxygen that were blitzing across her body. Her mouth quivered for a bit, a gulp of fear down her throat. This was a very frightening possiblity of her never leaving this room... if not worse.* - Tue Nov 17 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to loosen her grips on her fathers words. The fear and worry beginning ot take root in her mind. With no way to rest, she just had to keep the thoughts running through her mind. She began to wonder what happened to Mitsunara. 'Is she hurt...is she captured? Maybe...Maybe...' Her head shake interuptring her thoughts. A frown going across her face, as she was unable to even lift a finger to protect her team mate. Instead leaving her all alone to deal with all those enemies. <Oh ... please... tell me she got away...oh please...>* - Tue Nov 17 05:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) hangs from the wall in chains, that have bruised her skin. Cuffs on her hands and legs preventing from any movement besides fruitless struggles. Her body completely bare of her armor and usual clothes. Her smalls breast wet and cold, and several marks. Her rear was forced to perk out, several red marks  made patterns on it. The girl's head just hanging lifelessly below, her energy to resist far gone after hours of physical abuse. Her body noting numerous scars from the the edge of the whip slicing into the upper layers of her skin. 

Her arms and legs are bruised, rubbing and pulling against their binds trying to escape. Her cheeks bruised from a few attempts of putting up a stoic face. Her eyes were still open, but their was no life to them. They were off looking somewhere else. The only voice coming from her mouth was screams as the whip smacked against her brown flesh over and over. * - Tue Nov 17 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins to wake up, eyes fluttering for a moment as she regains her consciousness. Her head staring straight into the white ceilings of the hospital. She blinks for a moment, every movement stings the wounds from the whip she was hit with. The girl notes the guards around her, at first scared that were more men. She pulled herself up a little bit on the bed to back away from them, only to realize they were Sunagakure.She smiled lightly, one hand going to clench at her wrists which still were dark from the experience. A frown going across her face, as she finds her only need is to rest for the moment.* - Wed Nov 18 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over, hearing the voice trying to peer around the guards watching her who step aside. The girl eyes open a bit, and her mouth curves to a tiny smile. "Ei-Achk!' She leans up coughing, her throat was sore from the yells of pain. It was easy to hear in her voice, how dry her throat was. She spoke softly which was such a jar from the normally above inside voice Chikyu.

"ai... hey... there..."* - Wed Nov 18 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) woundslaid back most of her body covered up by sheets and the hospital gown she wore. Though, the bruises she had on her cheek were mostly gone and then when she extends an arm which still had the bruises on her wrist had been wiped away most of the lashings. Chikyu then placed her hand on top of Ai's that was stroking through her hair. "Sorry... I made...yall worry..." She paused for a moment. Her eyes shifting for a moment. "Mitsu-nara... is she okay? I... wasn't much use... I hindered her."* - Wed Nov 18 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let out a light laugh, one that again would rustle up her sore throat. "Yeah...I was worried about her too. I was beginning to worry, I wouldn't get to have another sleep over with you guys." She said giving a light smile rathe taking this all in stride. "Please tell, Mizora shes free to come any time or to wait. Because, before she knows it I'll be up and walking around to give her some hugs..." She then paused another moment taking a breathe. 

"Thank you...for getting me back Ai... though, I made you go on a dangerous mission. I feel horrible...thats Mizora had to worry about us both, thats two fold." She said eyes starting to water a bit, before she wipes them away. "But, really... thank you and who ever helped. I'll thank the others later... I want to do that personally."* - Wed Nov 18 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) didn't really understand what AI meant by paper, as she was suddenly enveloped by their arms in a hug. The girl hugs back, not giving her usual tight squeezes still weary from her expeirence. "hehe... I'll make that four folds into eight." She snickers lightly, as she continues to hold Ai far long after she was done talking. Chikyu then let go and lay back down. "I won't let yall worry about  me again, I promise." She says, her eyes sparkling with far more life then the dull beads they saw while she was captured.* - Wed Nov 18 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Mitsunara blinking rather surpised like a deer in headlights, before snickering. "Hehe...didn't think you be the one to apologize."

She was still laying the bed, her throat noticably sore. "I was the one who was supposed to say sorry. I didn't help at all during the attack, I was worried while I was captured you might have been as well..." She shakes her head, then waved the girl to come closer to her bed.* - Wed Nov 18 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let out a half-hearted chuckled, eyes shut a little in worry about Mitsunara. "I'm... really not worried about any of that. I was taught not to raise my sword for self vengence and things like that.... I'm just glad everyone came alright, and that I can do this." She said bowing her head ot MItsunara. "Thank you for saving me, and I'm so happy you didn't get too hurt. Next, I will be of greater help."* - Wed Nov 18 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Well anyways, if you felt sorry for anything.

She takes a seat, her wrists and cheeks showing most of her bruises. She sits down with her blade laying flat down on her lap. She looks at it for moment, before hearing two yells almost in synch. She looks up to see Mirai and Sanoke, and she gives them a bright smile.

 "Hey guys, how you doing? Hope, I didn't worry you two that much." She says folding an arm behind her head, a hand scratching the back fo it.* - Wed Nov 18 07:14:20 2015
