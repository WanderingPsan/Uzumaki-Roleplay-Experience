Certain people will destroy just out of prejuidice." She says, before putting her hand down.

She then looks over to Sanoke. "Whats a... Burger?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Nov 19 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked rather worry at Sanoke state of shock, wondering if she had said something terrible.

"An... ascended sandwich? So...like a sandwich for warriors?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Exactly. - Thu Nov 19 20:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't know you guys haven't had one. - Thu Nov 19 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks at the hamburger, as she holds it in her hand. The girls fingers stretched across the warm sesame bun. The steam fresh, and coming off in a near transparent grey whisp. The girls fingers shaking, as she holds and looks over to Marissa. This heft of flesh procured from some of finest mixture of farm animals, from the mighty steer to the bulking pig. The smell pouring into her nostrils that sparked every one of her hidden animalistic instincts. The part of humans hidden beneath years of evolution, dug up by the sight of there prey cooked to their finest.

The girl paused for a moment, eyes glowing with awe and famish. "Am, I truly worthy..." She thinks in moment, but such thoughts are passed over her true instincts. Her mouth opening, biting into the soft layers of the bun that easily subcumb to her sharp fangs. The light wheat filling her mouth with the taste of the soil of the earth. Then, she pauses for a mere moment as she builds the pressure to pass through the firm bacon that crunched like bones. She then went through the tender slice of bovine meat. The brown soft piece of fat, flooding her mouth with the taste of grease and oil.

The condiments not even worth mentioning, as they merely the grail that held this physical form of a nectar that she thought only gods would ever taste. The girl stops, not daring to engorge herself on such a fine masterpiece of human advancement and technology. She takes a breathe opening her body to fully take in the meal that was before her. She then continued to enjoy piece by piece of the orchestrated dish of beef and pork.

When she finished she felt sadness, nay she felt the grief of a hundred warriors that had met their peak and finished their conquest. There would never be another battle in their entire lifetime that reach the thrill and excitement they just witnessed. Yet, she also felt the fuliment of living through such events. That her life had met its nesscary course, and now it was her free will that would guide her through her life.

She then looked upon the group, all that day could say she almost matured that instant. She who once matched her childish personality, had now a sharper look... eyes that looked full of valor and hope, and personal pride. Her mouth that once gave everyone a smile of naviety, gave the confident grin of someone that knew what was going on all around them. 

"C'était délicieux ma dame, Merci." She said to Marrissa, dragging one finger from her cheek past her lower lip. Her eyes giving everyone a heated look, as she gave a smile that fill everyone with a warming embrace that left scorched marks across their very souls.

Then, it was all shattered as she suddenly let out a burp. Her image had past, and it was back to the innocent teenager. 

"Wheew...that really was good."* - Thu Nov 19 20:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) comes over to Sanoke hair covering her eyes in a dark shadow, and brings up a hand brushing it down his jaw. "It is sad, that you haven't felt such a feeling." The hand goes to his chest. "The feeling of the warmth, and joy going through your body in... such a..glorious, exhil-arating..instance." Forming her words with  a slow tempo, her pauses formulating on those of the beat of the heart.
. She begins playing with a higher nature of her voice never heard before, using it like an instrument to play the song of her words. 

She then flips her hair up, and her eyes show wide and bright. "Hopefully you can get something that tastes that good too!" She then begans smacking him on the back. "I'm sure theres some kind of food you'll enjoy just as much!"* - Thu Nov 19 20:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) patted him on the shoulders letting him go. "Better!" She said letting out a smile "I'm doing fine, as I said. I had a delicious hamburger for the first time yesterday it was really good."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "I'm smiling see." She says wrecking out a terrible smile that looked like she had some pretty murderous intent towards HIroshi.

She then paused, going to a far more natural smile. "I love food too, nothing better then filling up a stomach. Its natural that as humans, nothing is more satsfying then getting the rewards of a good hunt...aka a full stomach." She laughs for a moment.

She then turns to Mirai, giving her a smile "Hey Mirai!" She says giving the woman a hug. "How...how *sniff* was the funeral. " She asked, her face going back to her pathetic frowny face and constant sniffling.* - Fri Nov 20 09:34:17 2015
