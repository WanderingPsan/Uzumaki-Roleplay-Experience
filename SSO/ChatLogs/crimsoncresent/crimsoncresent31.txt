<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly tries to dodge from one of the balls coming around her. She tries her best to avoid the numerous orbs flying about. Her eyes opened and her teeth gritted in surprise as the orbs began to shoot around the Arena. This wasn't what she was thinking at all, it kind of reminded her when her dad went all out agianst her. The girl ducked and weave trying to get closer to her teammates. However, her dodging didn't last too long, as one ball came from behind richochetting off the back wall. The strike grazing the side of her waist.

It was practically smoking, as it burnt a red mark across her skin. The girl, letting out a muffled "Errgh!" of pain. Still, she managed to stumble over to the others to assist in this deadly game of dodge ball.* - Sun Nov 29 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) ran over to help support  Momura, as the little watermelon girl charged at her teacher. She then came from behind Momura round to the side, pulling out her sword to block the next incoming ball. It looked liked she would at least manage to get i tto reflect back at Paine. Only for her to be bumped forward, her body lurching as the ball scratched over her shoulder. Hideo accidnetly knocking into her forces her to lose her balance, and take the hit off her shoulder.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) lands on the ground thanks to Hideo's bump in the last round. She stands up and notices a ball coming at him. She reaches a hand back, and basically throws him away from the ball and back up on to his feet. Chikyu, however, is still left on the ground. The grazes on her body making it even tougher to get up, as she notices a ball that was bouncing off the walls about to come to her direction. She tries to lift herself up and pull out the sword at the same time ,but it wasn't possible. Until, she felt Hideo grab her from behind and pull her back up.

Being helped out from her partner, Chikyu stood up on her two feet. Her sword thrown over her shoulder, as she then took a momen to bat the ball coming at her towards Paine. The sound of the ball hitting off the steal, echoing through out the walls as she aimed to smack the ball at Paine's body.* - Sun Nov 29 03:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) (***Concealed Figure** would look over towards her right and noticed that chikyu was joining in their training session as well. She guessed this could have been an exception since this was not a technique type of training session. Reaching into her kimono with both hands, it began to lossen a bit as time passed. After a few moments, she took out ten rubber balls which suddenly vanished from her hands before she reached into her kimono once more and took out twenty balls which suddenly vanished in her grasp.  This action was done once mroe but this time their would be twenty more balls vanishing from her arms in a shift of her body.

As she was doing this, the nervous girl would say. "c-chikyu...you may j-join....umm..now then...you a-all...will s-spar me...at the s-same time.....and..." A loud 'CHACHHH' sound was soon heard coming off the walls of the arena which surrounded them as she paused her words before continueing again. " t-try not to g-get hit by the r-rubber b-balls.." A nervous smile would be given to them as she took a step back. A rubber ball would pass by infront of her face before she came to a stop.  "b-begin." A nervous smile would form on her face...they wanted to see what exactly they would do...what they would acomplish working as a team...how this will help them in the future...and if they were ready for this type of training....

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) (***Concealed Figure** would extend her right hand forwards slaming her hand against the ball. However when this action had happened, this caused the whole entire ball to become quished. Her right foot kicked off of the sandy surface soon after and the upper part of her body twisted as she released her pull on momoura and spun around them. During this action a rubber ball suddenly met its mark on her right side as her right foot touched the ground sumbling slightly, her teeth clenched slightly as her breathing began to seem slightly irregular. The nervous female allowing Momura to run past her. 

Rubbing her side as she watched Chikyu and Hiroshi make their way closer to the female, they decided to povote backwards as she watched two balled pass by each of her sides towards her privous location during her backwards movement. Opening her mouth, the female would say "u-umm...they have...i-iorn in the m-middle.." A nervous slightly weak smile formed as she coped with the pain she had just felt from one of her own thrown rubber balls.  Her heart and will...egarly awaiting to see what the three of them would do next since...kinami...once again did not want to train with the rest of her student....or something had been bothing them that she did not know of...oh dear...*) -repost-* - Sun Nov 29 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) (***Concealed Figure** 's slightly weak nervous smile would slowly fade away as she watched her students and Chikyu continue their charge towards her.  Her focus had remained on them not noticing rias or anyone else, the female seemed to be very serious when it came to training and what not.  Landing on her feet sliding backwards a little before pushing off her feet and running forwards back to momura.  Their body suddenly vanished in a blur...but she ended up in a couching position holding her right shoulder. 

They did this skill to avoid the ball that was aiming to hit the right side of her back where her heart was...that would of caused her some difficutly in moving which may have made her get hit by momuras attack.  As the ball that grazed her was flying forwards past her with momoura infront of her at this time. Her right foot extened upwards kicking against her own ball......the ball being carried by the bottom of her foot to meet against momuras extended hand.

Ther left hand at this time was sent forwards towards the ground while her right hand was going to meet it at its respected side.*) -repost-* - Sun Nov 29 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over not very surprised at all by Paine's ability to deal wit hehr sword. She knew more then enough to not dare underestimate her. Her blade jittering and shaking, as she pushed against her but the swod unwielding to budge. When, the kick hit her weapon sent it easily flying above and behind the girl. She tried to respond, only to get knocked to the side along with Hideo. 

The ball paine hit, then quickly hit Chikyo directly in the stomach. A large whelt coming from it, as her bruise swell from the pain. The girl's mouth opened up, as she let out a gasp of air as it was forced out by this one blow. The pain made her body shiver, and the life nearly knocked of her. She laid, across the ground not able to really move any more thanks to the multiple blows in succession. * - Sun Nov 29 04:45:26 2015

She first leans up on  knee, clenching a hand on top of it before standing up. She let out a big sigh, as she nodded over to Paine. She then gave her a light smile. "That was fun... if not a bit sore inducing." She said rubbing a blacked part of abdomen.
