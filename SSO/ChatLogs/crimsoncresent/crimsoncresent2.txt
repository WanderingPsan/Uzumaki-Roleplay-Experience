<br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holding his energy in place, Jin began to tighten the strength of the chakra clinging to the blade. Bonding the energy tighter to the surface, the perimeter of the blade. He didn't want to completely freeze the energy, because movement is what increased the power of the edge compared to the other chakra natures.  He just merely wanted to keep the chakra connected. Holding together the particles of chakra and giving it bonds. Giving form to it like that of a thicker consistancy, like something made of mud.* - Wed Sep 09 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) suddenly throws a Kunai cloaked in Chakra Flow that kills who ever we're talking about.* - Wed Sep 09 23:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) held out his blade, and taking a moment to cloak chakra. Sawing the two halfs together, pressing them against each other along the edge of the blade. A small hiss is heard, as he reaches the right didtanceof the jutsu. He then holds still for a moment, as he completes the bond of chakra around his blade. He then quickens the speed until they seem to blend into a single edge.

"You mean this?"* - Wed Sep 09 23:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) paused for a moment pulling out a jutsu scroll... He then paused and smiled handing Tethys the scroll with bright letters named pants on it. Tossing it over to him.* - Wed Sep 09 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) walks over to Tethys's rubbing the back of his head, a slight sigh of hesistation coming from him. One of the few times he didn't look straight at a person when talking to them. "Hey Tethys, about those legendary swords. Have you handed them all out?"* - Wed Sep 09 23:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) avoided Tethys then.* - Wed Sep 09 23:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) sees that Tethys is done with his moment of intensity. He pauses thinking for a moment. <God what were the ones he mentioned... I don't want to even touch that axe-hammer....Uhh..> He then mutters out "The two handel one,  the Himeakarei...  something like that."* - Thu Sep 10 00:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) reaches down to touch one of the handles with on hand. He then tried to pull on it, and couldn't even move it. He then reached down grabbing the other handle, and begins another shot at trying to move the ridiculously heavy sword which as expected fails. He gives it one last shot tugging his body back, till the sword just gets up a hair's inch off the ground. "People... use this thing in battle?" He gaps out still trying to hold it. "I can't... believe it..." he says  placing the blade back on the ground.

He sits down, and looks at the blade for a moment a hand still weak holding on to it. Looking like a young child befuddled by a simple magic trick. He the nelts go. "Ahh man, I can't even hold it." Letting it go, and wavving his hands for Tethys to put it back if he wanted. "Guess even legendary swords have their drawbacks... at least for me." he said, as he began to think about it. A sword risking their lives for... he wondered what it be like to even wield it. Yet he couldn't even do that much. His thoughts going idle as his imagination tried to wonder what its powers could really do.* - Thu Sep 10 00:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stands on the sand, hopping up and down for a moment imprenting his feet in the surface beneath his feet. Once he stood landed off of his last hop, he brought out his tiger seal. Chakra flowing out of him and across his body. He looks down the beach starring into the spot he knew he would come out from. His head lifting upwards to the next jump spot. Releasing his held energy, he vanishes down the beach. Coming out his body is already holding into the state of his next jump. Chakra coming out from his center completely surrounds him and he vanishes in a instant.
Coming out of his jutsu, he felt his body crumple in on itself once more like all his times before. However, this time he bites down his teeth. Forcivly sending his chakra into his bones, trying to raise an arm only managing to make it to shiver harder then his other limbs. His body then regains himself, as he gives himself a few seconds going over his jump. Nodding to himself, he brings back his seal up to his chest pressed tightly together.
Going out of sight in a burst, he managed to land himself to go backwards to his orignal training start. Taking a bit at his lip, as he passed another several meter jump. When he landed it was only for a mere glimpse, as he goes off again doing another jump. His body shaking again, as Jin tried to force his body to respond. Only managing to tug his torso forward, lurching his chest over his locked knees. He fought like a man locked in chains, unable to break the steel bonds of his physical limits. When, he finally managed to take his movement back. He fell forward on the sand, cheeks dirtying themselves in the sand along with his clothes.
The genin quickly pulled himself back up. His body feeling numb to anything but the pain of his sparking pains of limitation. He jumped up back and forth, trying to restart the feeling of his muscles. Energy dispersing in his body as his nerves sparked back and forth responding to his movement. Feeling himself well and awake, his body responding perfect to his orders. He brought up his fingers again into the seal.
Driving his body to produce the chakra he recovered, he vanishes off in his smoke cloud in a loud "Poof!". Coming out of it, he doesn't come out with his tiger seal lik esuual. Instead, he spends just one instant a photographic moment. He then pulls out the chakra, as the moment he claps his hand together the chakra activates. The spark of the jutsu comes out moving out in another burst of movement.
Coming out, his face is already clenched into one of determination with a gritted teeth. Cheeks wrinkled, as he extends his angry scowl across his face. He stands shivering his body responding to him more then ever. His hands curled into fists, that shook full of his anger. His shoulders begin to work back and forth, though no truee sign of movement comes out. His arms still remaining in place, but one could see his vessels pumping blood and their desperate attempts to follow his comands. His whole body shaking in a terrible vibrations. . When he came out, he fell on hands and knees breathing hard. A chuckle escaping from his head that was held downwards. <I'll do it... I swear I will.>* - Thu Sep 10 04:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulled out a kunai, spinning it around his fingers at the moment. He then stopped gripping the handle with his hand. He then blew out a breathe, that fell on to the blade and get swept up in the river of chakra that came out of the genin's hand. His energy took itself gluing to the perimeter around the blade, where he then started sending it to two opposing motions. He then gave it a few quick jabs keeping the rotating energy's in motion as he worked with using the blade at the same time.

There were several times when the chakra began to waver, as he took to slicing the air with several slashes. The wind razed through the atmosphere, but each move exposed a weakness in his jutsu.  The fluxing wind nature energy not spinning fast enough for the sharp edge, or left disapating into the air by flying off in the movement. He took another breathe stopping his attacks at the emptiness in front of him, and reforged the chakra that swallowed the knife.
Holding his chakra closer together, he begin swinging once more. However, this time the jutsu began to not move fast enough to generate the edge wind chakra was famous for. His chakra only dulling the blade while it remained cloaking in just what was now a cloud of wind. The genin sighed feeling his own weakness and need of control over the blade. He slashed it diagonally, letting loose the energy to fly away in the breeze. 

He then gripped the handle of the blade with both hands. Using one hand to send out the chakra to coat the blade in the chakra. The other focused on keeping the stream of moving chakra steady and going at all times. He then did a few light jabs with the point of his kunai, before giving two horizontal slashes into the air. He was managing to keep the wind chakra moving. However, he looked at his hand and then flashed back to Hassan chucking shuriken with wind energy contianing the piercing energy.

He took to continue holding the blade two handed, the genin focusing on just being at least able to keep up the power of the blade. He continued doing his practice forms of attacking. Not really moving far from his spot besides a step or two. His mind focusing less on his techinque of using the kunai, and more on the chakra flowing around the blade. Understand to himself the physics at work and how the chakra reacted to him. Forcing himself to naturally feel and get used to holding the energy, and producing it to last much longer then he was able to now. 

Jin gave out a few more attacks, crossing the blade across in front of him until his hand holding the blade hit his shoulder. He began to notice the chakra was slowing down. It was only the passing  thirty seconds on a clock, before giving  the sword another swing the chakra dispersing into nothing as he had done so. Looking down for a moment, the genin took some time to recover his energy. Taking a break, as he recovered the chakra to line up another blade.* - Thu Sep 10 06:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) feeling his energy return enough that he could continue. The boy pulls back up his kunai flowing his energy back over it. This time, he holds it directly out as far as he could. He then began to run the two storms against each other as fast as he could. The power of the two clashing winds, begin to spike out with jagged chakra teeth as they winds splash upwards away from the blade. Pulling back on his energy he lowers these jagged teeth trying unioning them to a single edge.
He then continued holding out the blade his pose not changing, as he began to heighten the speed of the flow. Building up the energy into a higher pitch of speed, all the while keeping it center on the blade. His chakra biting back, as it begins finding its perfect consistancy. He continued to generate the movements and hold them steady not letting them slow down. Just keeping his net around the energy so it wasn't accidently released.
The boy began to sweat, as he continued holding the energy at his peak. Raising the tension between to forces of chakra, but not letting them break free of his hold. It was ironic or speaking of doing the opposite of ones goal. A balance that was needed to keep the kunai flows going. A tip in the scales either way would end up the jutsu failing like it did before, or forcing the genin to redo his work with it.
Continued his task of intense concentration on the blade. His chakra draining from him, as he used it to just control the blade. Soon, his slipping hold on his own chakra began to show as the sides began to slow. The jagged teeth he worked hard to remove, appeared once more. His blade's chakra began to flicker, more of his coat began to disassemble itself. He continued to hold on to the blade until the final chakra flew off. His arms dropping together like they had weights tied to them, and his head drooped downwards.* - Thu Sep 10 07:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Seisuke, eyes opening wide for a moment whe he heres that he is from Gezo. His eyelids fall until they turn into a squint in the princes direction. <So hes from Gezo...> He takes quite pause, looking over to Tethys. Watching how he reacted.* - Thu Sep 10 21:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) shunshins over to Baen, and leans in whispering so he didn't disturb the prince and Tethys. "Okay heres the deal, the prince is here so he can learn how us...'henchmen' live. Hes got the two guards next to him, and considering how much I know you. Please do not harm the prince or his guards."  He was going to say something, but he clamped his mouth looking that it was Baen he was talking too. "I know you won't enjoy him, but just don't do something too bad."* - Thu Sep 10 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) also points to the two guards... one of which the prince was sitting on.* - Thu Sep 10 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took Ossa's response with a flat face staring at the back Yukimera, he stayed wondering what in the world Tethys would do. He then heard the chuckle, as his eyes slightly raised when continued on his laughing. Then the shout followed by the pupil-less eyes. The genin then watched Tethys send a punch towards the guard, which immediatly made the genin pull out his sword. Not to attack, but just out of a defensive mechanic as Tethys showed off his power.* - Thu Sep 10 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) seeing that this was going into a full out fight. Held tight on his tanto looking over at what just happened. He then turned his head to Baen, "Look.... I know you won't take orders. So I'll give you a suggestion, go wild and take out the guards." He then ran up behind Seisuke, and  attempted to bring his blade out and hold it up against his neck, the other hand wrapping around his shoulder to keep him from moving that arm to form a seal of any kind.  If he managed to do this he would shout for the guards to give up, any movement and he kill Seisuke. 

On the other hand, he knew these were competent men if they were guards. So he was ready to atleast attempt to give up on this effort and dodge if a attack was thrown at him. * - Thu Sep 10 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls back his sword the moment, the prince went around his attempted grab. Just brought his sword back to attack him. Only to see the wall of wind blow up from the earth, his sword grinding against it. When he heard Tethys, shout that this was enough. The genin slid his sword back into his sheathe, shooting a dirty glare at the prince before look* - Thu Sep 10 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) before looking over to Tethys again. "I need to learn to read you better Tethys... I have no clue about anything you do." He said looking over to each of the jonin level guards.* - Thu Sep 10 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holding up his hands, he begins grabbing his tiger seal. He continues to pull out the energy, until his body flashes out of existance landing a notable distance. He then comes out already manipulating his chakra into the Body Flicker, and does his second rapid disappearence. When he comes out the genin is left bent in the knees and arms flexed. His arms continue flex more, as the genin then threw out his arms out wide flared out like wings. Before clenching his hands into fists, and pulling them back towards the sides of his body. He was finally managing control on his arms. Now his legs.
He quickly turned around and charged up his chakra. He vansihed twice with his jutsu. Landing on the green blades beneath his feet. The genin did for a moment forcing his arms to wave slight, before he began to move his feet. His toes curling in response, as his thighs shook and his lower legs tensing his muscles trying to obey the nerves sending signals to it. However, all it manages is to slide the bottom of his soles left and right.
Pulling his chakra, the genin forced himself to do another jump coming forward with a burst of chakra. Landing to a stop, he did another shunshin use, his cheeks being pulled back as the force hits across his face. Stopping on his target goal, he dragged his foot to the side, and the other to a front. It was stiff but he could do it. He could move, he then threw a single punch forward. It was a long awkward attack but he could do it. Attacks after high speed movement with no delays.
Turning his concentration over to a near by tree, the genin clasps his hand in a locked seal. Chakra bursting from his body, before he vanishes appearing on hand on the ground the other hanging up in the air to give him balance. He then swings the front part of his lower leg light hitting the bark. He then leaped back grabbing his hands together and disappears to the other side. Where he throws the fastest jab he could into the wood.
Smoke began to appear back and forth  around the tree, as Jin appeared around it. Each time his body began to more use to the body flicker. His movements and response time began get quicker. The breaks in his attack began to lessen, as he found himself mentally aware of his movements and effects it had on him. His body getting used to take the forces, and breaking past the barrier he had with it before. He finally stopped with low chakra and energy finally finished with his training.* - Fri Sep 11 02:30:49 2015

As the others started to play with mud and water, he took shelter under the tree practicing with his blade. Holding out his hand chakra began to bubble from his hand until it covered the surface of his blade. He then began to spin the energy on both sides of his blade. A low hymn escaped from the blade, as the two edges wind crashed throguh and traveled down the edge until it flew off into the distance. The great wind nature chakra now being held out, as he focused on controlling it while moving.* - Fri Sep 11 17:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began to raise and chop his sword light in the air, not even standing up for it. Just testing on how it felt to wave it around, before checking on his hold of the Wind Jutsu. He noticed his was relatively fine for the first few attacks, until the winds began to slow down. He was holding on the nature energy too hard which was decreasing its rotational power. So he eased up, letting the wind breathe in its freedom again. Then feeding it chakra until he got back to its usual speed.

Giving a few more test swipes, he then decided he was finished holding the sword with his two hands. Letting go with one hand, and then holding the blade out steady with one. This was far more difficult, as the energy was no long being manipulated with both hands. One feeding energy and keeping it in motion, and the other keeping it connect to the blade so it didn't fly off. Immeaditly removing one hand, send the energy out of balance flying out and slowing the speeds of the wind immeaditly until it all dispersed on the genin.

Not one to be quickly defeated by one example of failure, the genin just began to work himself up from there. He first focused on doing the basic ground work. Chakra expanding from his hand began to feed until it finally coated the blade. He then stood there, letting leaves drop down in front of him or on top of him from the canopy of the tree above him. The genin just focusing down the middle of his blade to the point. A few glimpses of chakra falling off and going to the wind was seen, but he continued to hold it as long as he could.

Soon the the genin attempted motion; however, not to push himself too hard. He gave the motion to the energy to his entire blade. He started off with a slow current that snaked across the chakra field on his blade that then looped back to the start of his hand. Letting the wind get caught in the endless motion, he then began to speed it up. As he got faster and faster, he tried to hold on to his energy. But at only half his normal rotational speed, the chakra began to fall apart quickly before it could be restored. Until nothing was left.* - Fri Sep 11 17:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began channelling chakra back into his blade, until the blade turned blue with energy. Holding it out, he began to bring back the rotation he had last time. However, he only kept it at quarter his max speed. His hand trembled as he controlled the chakra's warping movements. <No speeding up no slow down.> he told himself, as he grabbed his extend arm with his other for support. Any noticable chakra that fell off, he quickly replace it before disrupting the flow. If he felt the current raising in energy he quickly cool it to slow.

Continued this plateued state until the minor twitches in his hand were to just make those minor adjustments to his chakra. His rotation keeping up wasn't moving too far out of the way he wanted. Deciding it was time to speed it up. He began pushing the wind faster down its already set path. Going higher and higher, as the wind skated across the surface of the blade. Breezing over it like a unstoppable gust over a barren plain. His hand already gripping hard as it made adjustment to the faster chakra.

His blade shaking lightly, as he pushed the energy down closer to the blade. His the blazing winds began to scrape against the surface, grinding at high speeds across the steel. Clenching his teeth, he began to hold back the energy as he felt tiny pieces of his chakra flinging off from the speed. Chakra traveling the center of his arm just barely fast enough to replace what was needed. 

He continued his hard squeeze on the blade. He could feel more of the energy that was curling around the blade begin to slip his control. His hold on his handel began to shake, as he sent out his own chakra to keep back any lost energy. However, this only failed as his loss of his chakra began to warp the speed and flow of the current. Giving up this attempt, he let the blade disperse in chakra. Then looked over to Himura who had walked off, and following him.* - Fri Sep 11 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Himura, are you still feeling depressed about what happened with Baen. - Fri Sep 11 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: No...Why? - Fri Sep 11 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Seem pretty depressed and not up for a talk. Like how the first thing you said to Lera was about being shot in the arm after it healed. Or the fact you seemed to quick to fight Lera's training style. Your mother hating you. Seems all to important in your mind right now. - Fri Sep 11 18:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Its not nothing, even you yourself said you aren't feeling that great at all. - Fri Sep 11 18:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's fine, I'm just dealing with some shit right now is all. - Fri Sep 11 18:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ...If I remember what you said to Tethys correctly is that everyone hates you... If you want to change people's mind staying the same or keeping yourself down won't help at all. And besides, Lera definetly doesn't and I don't think most people do either. But then again, I don't know anything about you so... Just feel free to take me as annoying pest. - Fri Sep 11 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: pest* - Fri Sep 11 18:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I will, don't be afraid of that. - Fri Sep 11 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls out his sword once more and continues to work on his chakra flow. Holding out his blade with on hand, just like last time. Coating the blade in chakra, and letting it humm as it rotates wind inside its coat. The blade then stood their in mid-air, most of Jin's training being something that was less then obvious and didn't require too much physical strength. <Just working on this step before I go on to the ne-> He then pauses groaning to himself, and sending his chakra on the blade slightly off balance. <I'm thinking like the old man.> he thought before recovering his blade back to normal.

Feeling comfortable with the feel of his blade, he began to speed up the rotation. Quickening the pace of the single current he had on the blade. The air now spinning like a snake coiled on its prey squeezing on to the sword.  He scoots his body up closer on the wall of the building behind him. His body tensing as he concentrates a bit harder on the blade. Feeling his chakra slipping through his control already, as he intensifies his efforts to keep it clinging to his blade.

Holding his arm out fully extended, chakra flowing down it towards the blade. Chakra swilling out of it in rotation counter to the current to keep it from getting too fast. The rest of the time was him concentrating on keeping the chakra in the shape he desired. His hand giving a slight tremble, as he felt himself losing control. One of his canines biting into the inner flesh of his peak to keep his mind awake and remind it to not let loose this energy. Keeping his best hold on the energy as he could.

The winds that tunneled around his blade continued to move. His will trying to force as much as it could over the flow of energy. His one hand showing its weakness, as he pressed for more control. More of his own energy dedicated to keeping the wind's movement. It wasn't long before his breathe, began to be audible pants. His strength being sapped by the jutsu, until he didn't have any more to fuel the winds. Slowly, the winds just died and the current of wind was lost.* - Fri Sep 11 20:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "Fine... fine! Here." He says pulling out a seal, and building up his chakra. "The way I do it is first build enough energy that it feels like its about to burst from inside." he says continuing to let his chakra boil inside. "You then activate your seal, and send the chakra through out your body. Its basically giving your body a shock to wake it up. You can also use it on other people by passing it through them."* - Fri Sep 11 20:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see how disliking a man that can't mind is own business classifies as being spoiled. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Just stop it Kida, I'm sick of fighting at the moment. Its an important skill everyone needs to know. - Fri Sep 11 20:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) goes over to the side as Otome begins to try out getting a grasp on Kai, he stands holding out his blade, though  pointed to the ground since so many were around him. Letting his chakra continue to leak out, and setting it up just like before. However, the constant bickering showed out by the flickering of his energy on his blade. He gave a look to all three speaking at the moment, before just giving a quick "You're welcome." to Setsuna.

<Its just best for me if everyone gets it. Best, I'm not the one taking care of a ninja that can't break out of a genjutsu.> He then brings his focus back to his sword, and watching the patchy work of his jutsu. Already sent into a rather reckless state of abandoment. Having to give up on it, and performing the jutsu again. Then recreating the effects he had worked on. Now having a fresh start, he just worked on the basics of holding the moving energy.

Feeling he had a grasp on it, he began to push all of the flow to one side of the blade. Letting the winds now go on a circut around the broad side of the tanto. Holding back the force one wide, while not letting it lower speed. It felt much more easy with all his work on such a thing, and keeping it confied to one side helped lower the amount to be controlled, but he was still worried what would happen if he could manage controlling two sides at once.* - Fri Sep 11 20:38:49 2015
