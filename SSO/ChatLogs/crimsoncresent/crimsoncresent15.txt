<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Sat Nov  7 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Well, I can't say too good!" She says scratching back of her head. "I already got beat by another sword user awhile ago. But, I have trained with it my entire life." She says before looking over Lera's back and noticing her sword. "Ah wow, you have a sword as big as mine. Don't see that often! Its always nice to see another swordsman around!"* - Sat Nov  7 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: mhm...want to spar? Swords only, I need the practice. - Sat Nov  7 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure! Want to head to the training grounds? - Sat Nov  7 14:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But don't go too easy on me eh? - Sat Nov  7 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) reaches behind her back, as she grabs the blade with one hand. Pulling it out and waving it in front of her still with only one hand on the handle. "Got it! I'll try to keep it tense!" She says, happily swinging her blade still. A sniffle coming out of her, as she continues to brightly smile. "Its been so long since I've trained with my sword. Good to be back." She says, then suddenly brandishing it in front of her. "Since, you're the new one. Want to go at me, first?"* - Sat Nov  7 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched as the girl came rushing towards her, eyes flickering as Lera took the offer to strike first. She was too slow to avoid the attack. Chikyu responded in a probably a very awkward way, by dropping the tip of her blade down towards the ground. When Lera got close enough to bring the down the blade. 

Chikyou then yelled out "GAN RIZE!" Her waist twisting around, as her arms snapped upwards. The blade flying up in a perfect angled semi-circular cut to hit at the bandanged blade. The rotation of her body and arms attempting to knock the sword off its path. Lera far too stronger then Chikyu to actually try and disarm her of the blade.* - Sat Nov  7 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was certainly left open, her blade was hanging up above her head after the counter. However, the momen the girl began to spun. The girl took a powerful stomp that blew up some dust. "FOLLOW! VON GIEN!" Her blade then came down in a fast arc, empowered by gravity and the flow of her body. The strike similar to a much heavier version of a basic kenpo hit. All of strength focusing on samehada to stop the attack on her.

However, the girl once again was struggling to face Lera's full power. Her teeth gritting as she spoke "I won't lose... that easy!" She said trying to put her all to stop this second attack from her opponent.* - Sat Nov  7 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) tried to get in a strike only for it to be easily knocked off by the solid wall that was the Samehada. Lera pushing the blade easily pushed Chikyu backwards a few feet, though she obviously fought again. Her feet dragging two trails in the sand, as she finally slowed down to the point of falling on her back. Her sword being thrown outwards to the right, to make sure it didn't accidently cut her when she fell.* - Sat Nov  7 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) chuckled lightly, as she was goaded by Lera. She pulled herself up, and put her blade in front of her. She then lowered it, holding it straight forward in front of her like it was spear. She then took a few steps to Lera, before she finally began to thrust the blade several times at Lera and her Samehada. Each strike, angled differently just trying to slip through her defense. All the while, Chikyu stood back matching distance so she could reach Lera from the safest distance.* - Sat Nov  7 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) blade was quickly knocked to the ground. Though, her head kept 
up trying to follow her opponent's movement. When Chikyau saw the hilt coming at her, she threw out her arm hitting the side of Leras. Another attempt of strength versus skill, as she tried to divert the attack once again. If she wasn't fast enough, she easily get the air knocked right out of her.* - Sat Nov  7 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) tried to raise a guard, by dropping the hold of her sword and crossing her arms.  However, she wouldn't have the defense nor the strength to stand the hit. Her body getting slammed by the massive legendary blade. The physical pain was something she had learned to deal with from many lost fights from her father. However, there was something else that ate at her. Like, her body's energy being ripped out of her. Both arms feeling heavier, as she fell back to the ground. * - Sat Nov  7 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Are you...okay? - Sat Nov  7 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Dead people should stay dead... - Sat Nov  7 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took a moment to lay the dirt, but soon began to crawl back up on her feet. Her arms raising up in triumph, a notable amount of her chakra had left her. Yet, she had more then plenty to continue to go on. Her storage being something probably notable for the chakra hungry blade. "Hahaha! Second person I lost too. Guess I can't be too okay with it, and you said you were a newbie too." She said not to worried on her loss and her injuries. "You knocked the wind right out of me!"* - Sat Nov  7 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Maybe . . . I'm not sure if I would regain those personalities. I do like to fuck around though now. - Sat Nov  7 15:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Cute? Why thank you, but I'm not satified until I have the strength to beat anyone soundly. - Sat Nov  7 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You said, you were elementalist right? You were holding back. Nothing is wrong with your victory, so celebrate. Not that a loser like me can request anything.  - Sat Nov  7 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You just need practice and you'll be good to go. - Sat Nov  7 15:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see...well I would reccomend learning a few at least. They are quite useful after all. - Sat Nov  7 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe, I guess so but... I want to master my dads swordmanship. Its where all my cocnetration goes, so while it may be helpful. My path is set for now. - Sat Nov  7 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. The offer is there if you ever need it...I know quite a wide range. So i'll be happy to teach you a few. - Sat Nov  7 16:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) finds a holy bottle of water that certainly musth have been left behind by a priest. She then throws it behind her. Splashing and exorcising Ghost Kilm.* - Sat Nov  7 16:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah and it depends Kiyoko. - Sat Nov  7 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: On what? - Sat Nov  7 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It takes some skill with the Doton element to fly. - Sat Nov  7 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) except Kilm is clearly an evil ghost. Taking over a human with no consent, reletionsly messing with the affairs of world and only seeking to bother other people. With not understanding of what he is doing, showing complete utter lack of empathy. Which, by design. Alignment is based on empathy and thus. Kilm is dispelled.* - Sat Nov  7 16:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) lets also not forget. That many ghosts are presumably just people trapped in a state of mind. That they are still alive, and are protecting their home from strangers (current residents). So an exorcism that works on them, would surely still work on Kilm. So again, fuck off Kilm.* - Sat Nov  7 16:18:20 2015
