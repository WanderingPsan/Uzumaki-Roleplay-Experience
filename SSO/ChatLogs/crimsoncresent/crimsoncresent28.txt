"Hey, Aza hope we can be really good friends like I am with Hiroshi and Rias!"

She lifts it up, and takes a large bite of it. Avoiding cutting it all, instead she began to hungrly munch into the flesh like a wild animal. The girls hungry chomps and tears could be heard as what once was a chunk of steak there was nothing but air. She then waved for another. "One more steak please!"

She then turned over to Aza, as she looked over to him. "It must have been very hard to travel so far. You would get along with Mitsunara, she has a similiar past." She says nodding ,and looking over to him. "If you dont' mind me asking , do you miss your homeland?"* - Wed Nov 25 06:32:57 2015

The girl shook her head, closing her eyes. She then had a flash back to the showers in Mizora's house. She shook her head. <Oh why did I have to see her that way... I'm such a bad friend! I should've been more careful.>

She takes a bite of her meat, hiding her tears of depression for even looking at one of her top four bestie girl friends as something sexual.* - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015

Because surely, she couldn't be doing this on purpose without the usual trigger.  She watched the girl, as the sauce dripped off her breast falling down the natural curve of such mounds. Chikyu's teeth biting on her lower lip, as she tried to bring up some urge to resist watching.

She then saw the tongue come out, sliding off her finger. Chikyu's toes clenching in her boots. She began to feel extremely jelaous of Hiroshi. <Ai...  Hanai... now Hiroshi... You guys have all the luck.> Chikyu's cheeks now blushed red, as she dropped her hands below the table keeping them crossed across her lap.

She then gasped, as Chi came into the hungry ant. <Oh god... if Rias is like this now... With Chi here! Ehh...> She raised a hand weakly waving. "Hey...Chi."* - Wed Nov 25 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) walked over to the group of people surrounding the reeking open pits to the sewers. The girl quickly held her nose together, by pinching both nostrils shut. A look of agony and disgust formed the curves of her mouth. Her eyes clenched as the smell made her eyes water in pain. She stopped when one of the men came up to her. She paused to listen before speakiing. "Three hourss ago? Thats pretty long. Do you not have any way to communicate with them, like a radio or something?" She asks all the while clenching her nose, making her voice nasely.

She'd also look at the holes that they would be able to use to get into the sewers looking at what was below. Hearing them say the floor was unstable was rather unsettling, and wondered if they would need to be worried about a collapse or loose foot work in the sewers. She also hoped their would be some pathways to walk on instead of through the muck.* - Fri Nov 27 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Where did you send them? - Fri Nov 27 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wait a minute they are where? - Fri Nov 27 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ...... - Fri Nov 27 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks over to the chief. "If it didn't smell so much...and if I didn't know what was in their.... I could say this would be a fun spelunking trip.

She then paused eyes widening like a beast noting it was spot. She then turned around to see Mirai giving Chikyu the 'Ain't no way, my pretty ass is going down their look.' She let out a chuckle mixed with a sigh. She then walked over to Mirai, and told the guy talking to them. "Wait a moment please."

She then moves over to Mirai, as she whispers. "I know... I know what you're thinking. But, there are people down there. With your sight, you'll be perfect for looking for them... Heck now that I think about it. Try and see if you can find anyone from above ground. Then, I can go in with your directions and you can stay out here."* - Fri Nov 27 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can just go in there I suppose. - Fri Nov 27 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: While, you don't want to talk to Sanoke. The both of us can hang out, until you decide to forgive him. - Fri Nov 27 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Mirai. She noticed the clenching eyes, just like what the other byakugan family member showed her the other day. She smiled seeing this, and wpatted her on the back before she lept into the sewers. "Thats the dependable Mirai, I know." She gives her a big smile. She then watches her take the dive into the underground.

She walked up to the edge of the crater of the ground. She peered over its edge, and shook her head. A hand clenched her noses, as she took the dive as well falling down into the pits a little away from MIra so she wouldn't accidently splash her with anything. She then rived for a moment displaying much more emotion then Mirai, but swallowed down her uneasy gut as well.* - Fri Nov 27 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) reached back pulling at her blade, as she stepped off the grounds that were beinging to crumple beneath them from their landing. She pulled up her blade. She her a small grate as the steel tip of her blade lightly bumped into the ceiling. She quickly pulled it down, and watched for any sights of degredation from the point. She held her sword flatly against her sides. She spoke to Mirai "This isn't really a good place for me to fight, I might cause a accident if I'm not careful. Also, I know most people wouldn't come down here. But, if I needed to hide from a village...like an opposing member of Edge's army. I would stay in the place nobody would go too..." She looks around at the sludge filled hole. "This seems like a good place."

"Though...I also don't know a shinobi that leave blood and ...writings on the wall either." She said, as she wondered closely through the dim scenery. The flickering of the light bulbs hurting her sight, and was happy she didn't have to go here alone thanks to Mirai. She took a few breathes of the foul air, before looking to Mirai.

She then followed keeping close, while on the ready to strike at anything attacking her. Her eyes flickering every so often to the two rivers of sewage that surrounded them. Her father always warned her about surprise attacks, and after her last mission, her eyes flaring at just the though of it. She wouldn't let that happen again, nor would she be only a handicap for Mirai.* - Fri Nov 27 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) starred at the carvings as they passed by, the number seemed unending. She swallowed a bit of her fear. She was rather superstious and tended to lean the farthest away from the nearest symbol. She wanted to smash them all, but beyond the fact it might bring this place down. She also didn't want to end up curse for breaking it.

She stuck closer to Mirai, feeling safety and trust with her. She was now really really glad to have her around. The flickering lights and terrible smells were something she physically could deal with. However, the symbols were something beyond her.

When Mirai stopped, she stopped to look at the dense gaseous layer of disgusting origin. She took a breathe. The realization that even MIrai couldn't peer through it made her worry. "Lets be careful... we don't want to get seperated." She said as she closed her eyes for a moment to test out to see if she could sense chakra through it. She wasn't amazing at it, so she wouldn't be suprised or really draw any conclusions from it.


After that, she follow Mirai into the wall of fog quickly being consumed by it.* - Fri Nov 27 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took forward to begin pushing through the gas, holding her sword out to try and at least give them some light protection from directly touching the mist when she saw it could be brushed aside. 

Ears picked up the wounds too, trying to peer deeper into the catacombs only to hear the responding voice. She shook her head hearing the disdain coming from it, and the lack of care what she was doing down here. She certain fit the bill of someone of that nature. 

She didn't respond to such banter, Chikyu was the sort to do that in combat. It was all about respect. Respect your opponent to be capable, and give caution for that respect. You must believe they can win, so you shouldn't leave yourself open to mental, physical, or verbal assualts.

Chikyu quickly glanced at the barrier in front of them, and then the wall behind them. She quickly stopped, and placed her sword down for a moment. She had to be smart about this, she didn't want to be a burden Mirai. She then took a breath and did several seals creating a bunshin. She then picked her sword back, the real one standing on the right as the fake was on the left. She then got in position to attack.

She wondered how strong the foe was, that they had to face.* - Fri Nov 27 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Mirai, as she quickly dashed forward to face the opponent. Chikyu being slightly paranoid on the other hand was more hesitant and probably not fast enough to really go and suppport Mirai. She inched slowly pas the barrier until, the sudden blast of energy and tremors. 

Her clone completely disappeared. However, Chikyu was moving slowly she took a defensive stance trying to resiste the blow, as the ground shook and the glowing glipyhs popped off. The girl would try to keep a stand, and be on the ready to help cover for MIrai fi she got in trouble. On the other hand, if she was knocked down. She quickly try and recover, and grab her fallen sword. * - Fri Nov 27 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) wasn't rather surpised by the sudden attack form the river, as she did predict this earlier at the start. Though, she couldn't have ever guess that it be a beast such as this one. The disguisting construct on abandoned material, leaking out its disgusting fumes. The attack of the tentacles manage to get the best of her,  managing to wrapping around her feet. 

However, the girl thne swung with an attack nearly just as fast as theirs along with the reflexes to do it. Her blade dragging diagnolly across in front of her, the tip barely scrapping against the already cracking and decrepted floors. She aimed to quickly cut the tentacles  that kept her. Her strength plus the edge of the sword being more then enough to slide through the hardy slippery apendages.

If she managed to cut herself free from the beast, she quickly close her eyes sensing the chakra in the area. She didn't know if the beast even had such energy, but it was her best guess to find it through all the muk of the river. If she couldn't sense it, she peel her eyes back open afraid she might miss the next attack from the beast.* - Fri Nov 27 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched as the two tentacles flew off, letting out a whispered "Yes!" However, she quickly lost any confidence in her success as she saw the tentacles grow back again. Quickly, she chopped them again before they could strike her once more, but it was clear they just regrow again.

She then turned her head hearing the belching roar, and the loud cries it let out. The figures mass expanding revelaing how tall it really was, as it pressed against the roof of the sewer's caverns. The girl pointed her blade for the moment until the sudden shot of that toxic substances.

She knew it couldn't be good, but she was rather too slow to fully doge it. The attack splashing one of her legs, feeling the numbing sensation. The toxic liquid digging into her legs, forcing a set of clenched teeth that let out a painful hiss. The burnng and slow muting of the signals in her nerve cells excrutiating.

However, she knew she could dwell on this pain too long. She quickly shoved her sword back in, and made four seals in the shape of the kawimari jutsu. She then quickly pulled out he sword waiting for the creatures next attack at her whether it be the tentacles or its toxic spit. * - Fri Nov 27 03:55:56 2015
