Around the tables to close the area off are some fences, and another sealed off space labled dance floor along with a Suna Muscians marked space. The rest are a bunch lines around all of the square that are labled Lights.

Another paper lists a dinner course for the event, starting off with simple salad, Consommé, Lamb or a Risotto, and ending with pudding. Theres then several crossed out lines of math, before a new handwriting style appears for the cost of such an event and prices for the table to make it  possible. 

The last page lists the nesscary maids, and surprisingly the cost of the maid uniforms when ordered in that amount.
