<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabs the map that Sanoke had handed to them. She stretches it out, and tilts it a few times. She shrugged, handing it over to Mitsunara. "I don't get the directions at all." She says looking rather confused at the moment.* - Fri Dec  4 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Lets just go straight out the road, thats the normal path most caravans would take. - Fri Dec  4 11:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued to walk by MItsunara rather aimlessly even the help of the map. Every so often, she shut her eyes and sense outwards looking for any pontential attempts to jump or attack them. A small flash back to her last mission with Mitsunara, made her slightly shiver. Though, she quickly swallowed up this fear. She then noticed the man out in the desert. She simply gripped tighter on the sword in her hands, as Mitsunara started the greetings.* - Fri Dec  4 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stayed behing the other two. She kept rear guard, once agian activated her chakra sensing abilities when they spotted the man. She didn't want to let her guard down at all after previous events. She was going to be keeping up her streak of being useful and helpful to the mission.

The sword slung over her back was brought forward a bit, holding it just barely offf to the side so she didn't jab Mirai or Mitsunara while they walking. But, it was close enough to quickly grab with both hands the moment something went hectic. * - Fri Dec  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are all around the place. - Fri Dec  4 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took a immediate stop when Mirai did. She was following her every movement, and knew to trust her when she was hesistant to go somewhere. When she announced the tags, Chikyu's head tilted down to look at the earth wondering what was going on.

She was then about suggesting to scout it out with a clone, but Mitsunara already had beaten her too it. She nodded though took a step back wondering exactly how many notes were around them. She also pondered where the people who set this trap were. * - Fri Dec  4 12:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched the two do their magic, as she was rather a helpless spectator. If she went in, she basically be letting the trap go off. The girl let out a sigh, before perking up. Her eyes closing as she focused on keeping an awareness with her chakra sensing. If the guy had the ability to go underground. It wouldn't be shocking for him to come up from under all of them. So, she decided that be her main role in this operation. Until, they manage to actually get far away from the explosive mine field in front of them.* - Fri Dec  4 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) her blade out in front of her, as the searing heat went right passed it scorching her arms and legs. The same with the shuriken that fell upon her, two being blocked by the wall of steel in front of her hands. However, the other two quickly sliced two red cuts on her lower arm and her bicep. However, this pain wasn't enough to keep her out of it. She quickly ran in to join in Mitsunara then going even pat her in the smoke. 

Chikyu using her chakra sensing went directly to the culprit of this entire scheme. She landed behind his current position. A sword being thrown over her right shoulder, as then swung at his back side. She hoped by swining in this way if he tried to dodge. He would probably need to go forward right into Mitsunara's attack range. * - Fri Dec  4 13:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly curled to the left, her body bending like a twig to the powerful fist breaking in her side. His fingers had perfectly connected to the underside of the leather band that held up Chikyu's breast plate. Only skin to take on the entire force. The heavy swing by harden fist breaking any of her body natural toughness. The force quickly cracked several of her ribs, which was a burst of pain for the girl. Her body then was sent rolling across the ground, as she was blown away from the attack.

She stopped but only to be hunched over her. Fingers clamping to the side she was hit in. They dug and rub trying to squeeze the pain away. However, there was no relief for the damage that was done to her. She was done for this fight unless, as she continued merely just keep huddle being immobile to prevent her injuries from getting worse.* - Fri Dec  4 13:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) attempted to try and move out of the way of the attack. However, the slightest movement of her right arm caused painful shocks from her chest. The girl gritted her teeth, she held out her left hand trying to move out of the way. Maybe if it was a slower attack, she might have been able to get out. However, the kunai's were too quick. She simply closed her eyes, and guarded her face expecting the blow to hit. Only to be pontentially saved by, the burst of Air from Mirai.* - Fri Dec  4 15:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) raises her head, and takes off her pauldrons. She throwns them next to her sword. She then sits crossed leg on top of shirtless Momura, as she begans doing her push ups. Chikyu on the other hand just simply crosses her arms, and counts for Momura as she does them.* - Fri Dec  4 22:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) sits on her back, her body raising up and a little down like she was resting on a ship caught in the waves. Chikyu is practically completely immune to the fact she was sitting on her half naked friend. She then looked over to Kinami as she began to do push ups. Chikyu then laid her hand out on top of Kinami pressing hard down on it with strength high enough to shatter stone and bend iron. She then let Kinami handle doing pushs ups with that.

Chikyu would then keep count for the both of them. When, Momura finished hers Chikyu would get off her back patting Momura on her sweaty back for the good job; using her one free...but slightly weaker hand. While still pushing down on Kinami's back until she had finished a set she was comfortable with. * - Fri Dec  4 23:09:13 2015

The girl did feel rather useless and left out from the training, but was more then happy to assist what ever way she could. Running off at one point to come bring the two some fresh water to revitalize themselves.* - Fri Dec  4 23:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let out a gulp, as she watched the girl spray herself with water. Her bangs falling down covering parts of her face. The droplets on her water falling down Momura's cheeks past her vulnerable neck going down the curves of that volumptous buxom. Sliding into the ridge of her- Chikyu then raises her hands to the sides of cheeks and then smacks them both so loud it sounds like a shotgun had gone off inside the house. She then held open a smile, with two red hand prints staining her tan cheeks. <Look at Kinami... shes got clothing on that will help lots.>* - Fri Dec  4 23:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shooked her head, her whole body waving with it. Her chest rocking back and forth contained most in her breast plate. The lower of her hips swayed side to side. The girl simply shouted back with embarassment. "OH nothing! Nothing...I just got all worked up with the both of you."* - Fri Dec  4 23:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulled out a cut wooden shaft of wood. It extended to be around four foot long. A the handle nicely shaven and sanded so that it didn't have any spliters or marks. The girl waved it around with one hand several times, the rod swishing through the air as it made its cuts.  She nodded to herself, it felt so weird to having something this light in her hands. It felt pracitcally wegihtless at the moment, compared to her much larger broadsword that she left at home this night. She then brought her other hand, and clasped it directly under the other hand holding on to it.

The girl then raised her arms up the sword going way above her head. She then held her pose for a moment. She began to adjust her hips, her waist slipping back and forth at an angle trying to find the best placement of her weight. She then slid her feet together in the sand. Normally her Mirosen forced her feet to be far a part that way her body could hold the weight of the chunk of steel. Here, she felt more ease to keep her body tight knit. She was less of a target, she could also feel the ease it be to move at any pace.

The girl then began to swing the stick down in front of her. She began to use it like a katana. Her body slowly taking to using something far lighter then the cumbersome steel blade she normally kept on her person. Her torso at first leaned too far forward expecting she need it to lift the wooden copy of a katana. Chikyu then began to understand how she didn't have to commit so much to her swings. She could keep to her own body's balance, and adjust her swing with merely her arms and wrists alone.

Chikyus arms and legs began to lean in and go back like a well oiled machine. Her body began to balance, as she continued to only do vertical slashes. It began to remind her a lot of when she was six. Where, her father truly kicked in his need to give her the lessons in the arts of swords. She had spent so many days just doing this. She could remember all the frustation that came out of it. Though now she knew better, one can't learn an art by merely watching. You had to make it your body and soul.

The girl continued to do her practice swings. Her head began to bob with the motion, popping up and down in synch with the position of her 'blade'. Though, she was simply training. The girl smile couldn't be ignored, she truly had enjoyment for the art. She also began to appreciate all her fights with Mitsunara. It was no wonder she could move her blade so skillfully and deadly. This made her chops more fiercied, biting into the air as they came down. She continued the boiling of her blood for actual combat beginning to show. Her wooden sword substitue began to wobble with each one of her aggressive blows.

The shaft of the wood shook violently, as if it had been hit from the blow a fist. Still, the girl was still too concentrated with her awe of Mitsunara's blade work. Her tighting grasp began to choke what little life the wood had. The middle of the blade splintering as it was bent over and over. Soon, the minor wound ruptured violently the wooden pole now split into two pieces. The girl quickly dropped what she had been using as a hanlde.

She then walked out of the training grounds her grin nearly ear to ear. "I guess, I will try out training with those swords then. Maybe, I'll find it really enjoyable." She thought to herself with eyes closed, she then went off to go buy a tanto.* - Sat Dec  5 07:50:36 2015
