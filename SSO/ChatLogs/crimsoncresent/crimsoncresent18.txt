<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls up her sword, and swings it out in front of her. The girl charging over the sand(and apparently a carpet.) She was much slower then most in the village, as she came over. Her weapon raised over her shoulder, as she got closer to Lera. 

She took a stop before setting up for a very familiar stance to Lera. The girl taking one last step forward. Her sword switching to be raised over the girls head, she then brings it down on the space that Lera took. Going fully strength knowing how powerful Lera was, and finding no need to ease up on her.* - Sat Nov 14 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gripped on to the blade, but her arm would shiver up and down feeling Lera's punch vibrate down the spine of the blade into her hands. Feeling the jitters, the girl even notice the greater insult of her dropping the sword showing no need for it. Biting her lip, the girl shoved her sword into the ground. Using the stuck sword as a leaver, she began to do a series of kicks at Lera. However, they noticably be light before she stopped at the last one.

She then drop her grip on her sword, and crouch down. She then try to knock Lera off her footing, not going for damage. Instead, Chikyu shoot her leg out to hook Lera's foot, and pull it out from under her.* - Sat Nov 14 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) if it was the Chikyu that had fought Lera the first time. She surely would've been hit with the move. Though, Chikyu had been working on her reflexes, strengthing her ability to react from an advice of an other. The girl seeing the last punch reacted as well as she could. Using one arm to do the usual circular deflection of Misdirect; however, she knew one arm couldn't push away the blow using her other hand to push the attack away as well.

If successful, the she manage to scape the blow. If she failed with Lera's far stronger base strength now enchanced domu. Chikyu would easily be blown away several feet into the air. * - Sat Nov 14 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) reached out with one hand pulling out the massive sword to her left with one hand, she then stood up as quickly as she could. The girl held up her sideways, the wide flat side facing Lera. The tip was pointed to the earth surprisingly, "Take this!" she then drove the blade down underneath's Lera's feet. She then pulled backwards in a similair fashion to Gan Rize. 

Basically, Chikyu had used her sword like a shovel digging undernearth Lera's feet. Then, she then attempted to flip Lera on her back by pulling the sword upwards. * - Sat Nov 14 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: hmm... - Sat Nov 14 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) leaned hunched over trying to budge her sword, but it was completely halted by the weight of Lera and the presure of the Samehada on it. The girl looked up, near exhausted for fighting at full pontential this entire time wasting more of her body stamina. Still, she put up a strong smile that was only broken by a few gasps of air. "Hehe, thats what training is for." 

Just as she finished speaking the girl then twisted her body, turning it counter clockwise. In attempt to pull the sword out from underneath the Samehada and Lera with a horizontal movement before pullit back out of the Earth. If it was successful, she try to stop the motioin and turn it back to strike Lera in the side of her waist.* - Sat Nov 14 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) could feel her blade stopped so easily by Lera's wrist. Chikyu would then feel the Samehada jut right into her chest. The girl gasped for a moment, as not only was her lungs rattled by this but the chakra leached away from some of her most important organs. The Samehada getting a nice tasty treat of her chakra, as the girl let go of the sword thanks to the combined impact of the two damaging blows. 

The girls waddled backwards for a moment, as she took a moment for herself to recover. Her breathe was already short thanks to the fight, and now her chakra had been hit too. <Again...this weird feeling...> Before anyone could ask if she was okay to continue or could come check on her. The girl shot back up and began charging at Lera. She then leap and try to give the girl a flying kick in the face, though there was no way the blow could actually hurt Lera.* - Sat Nov 14 18:09:42 2015
