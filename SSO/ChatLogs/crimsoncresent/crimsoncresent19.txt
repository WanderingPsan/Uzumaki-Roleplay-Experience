<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) lifted up the sword over her shoulder. She paused for a moment, <Meh...I really don't know what she can take.> She then looked over to Mitsunara, and gave a tiny light wave. She did feel bad that she didn't spar with her. The girl's mouth went to a frown, as she began charging at Hokuma. The sword prepared to swing the giant sword the moment she got in range.* - Sat Nov 14 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Bitch you know exactly who i am. - Sun Nov 15 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) came in sliding to a stop, as Mirai seemed prepared for the blow. Chikyu felt a little reassured once she noticed that. She took a moment to squeeze down on the handle of the blade. She then swung with the flat side, notably holding back to just check how strong Mirai was. The swing was slower and the power notably a large dip, still it was not some slap on the wrist. It was aimed at knocking Mirai down with pure blunt force.* - Sun Nov 15 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) (attack speed 7, and Damage 15. Both of these lower then my real stats))

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) didn't even notice that the girl was coming at her, as she dodged the blade until she had already landed beside her. The attacks quickly stunting the girl before she could even bat an eye. The hits piercing beneath her skin, and cutting several chakra points. The sensation of having her chakra cut off felt similiar but far off from what she faced when fighting Lera. The girl turned around giving another swing at the girl. The same attack speed, but this time just out of the injuries hitting her sides.* - Sun Nov 15 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to raise up. She then saw the techinique she had used on Lera this morning, but was too slow in anyway to really react to it. She tries her best to just prepare her body ,as the block completely whips her off the feet. Her body bouncing several times as it slides back on the surface of the sand. She land on her back, bringing a hand behind her to push her back on her feet. Her sword somehow managing to stay glued in the other hand.* - Sun Nov 15 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulled out her sword with one arm, she then began to swing it around in circles over and over. She then turned her body for a moment. "Yep...feeling a lot better!" She said happily, before holding the blade out in front of her. "I'm ready for you." She says holding the blade in front of her, she seemed slightly happy for the moment.* - Sun Nov 15 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to run fast to Mitsunara's side. She raised the blade with both hands. She quickly attempt a jab at Mitsunara's side, there was a notable increase in her form improving the power of her strike but not that much from last time. The girl whether the attack hit or missed would bring the sword back, ready for a follow up from her notably trick opponent.* - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) is noticably is quicker to react this time. She actually steps behind the blade to us as a shield. Her blade flipping to face vertically agains the strike of the nodachi, the girl then drops one hand off the grip. The free hand supporting the spine of the blade to keep it stiffened when the flat of the blade strikes the metal so it wouldn't just be completely blown away by the stronger Mitsunara. Her feet moving back in the sand from the hit.

However she doesn't stop there, as she uses her opponents blow against her. When she blocks the attack she pushes back against it. However, not only does she push back bust she moves the tip upwards. She then attempts to spear the tip into Mitsunara's neck trying to stun the near indestructable brute.* - Sun Nov 15 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins to feel a straight the sudden shift of momentum, as the girl pushes back with pure strength. The girl pauses for a moment, as the blade begins to grow the visible spectral figure. The girls eyes spreading and focusing on it like a wild animal spotting a predator. The girl had no words to say to the girl, as she pushed the sword completely back on the girl.

The girl felt the weight of the force pushing down on her. Her blade actually beginning to cut into her own skin. She then bites her lip thinking for a moment of what to do. She then pushed down the blade, grinding against her opponent's blade till her blade rest against her handle. She then tried to push the attack back to the side, using the better leverage in an attempt to fight the pure power of Mitsunara.* - Sun Nov 15 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) takes a moment to think, as she feels the relief of their clash being parted. Her body getting back into position for an attack. She then looks at her sword, waving it at the moment. She let out a gulp, her body letting out a cold sweat. She then took a large breathe, before charging forwards at Mitsunara. Mid-run she leaps off the ground sword still in hand. She lines up her body for the classic dynamic entry.

However before her foot tries to hit Mitsunara, the girl stabs her sword in the  ground. Slowing herself to a near dead stop. She then lands to do a low sweeping kick at her opponent's ankles. In a similiar fashion to what she did to Lera in an earlier spar, and try and knock her down by trying to pull the leg out from under her.* - Sun Nov 15 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) along with her lowered body to do the ankle-sweep, she merely ducks her head beneath the flowing blade. After the blade had glided over her head, she reached behind grabbing the sword from behind her. Standing up quickly, and bringing down a rather classic move of hers. The Von Gien, the familiar step and smashing attack downwards.* - Sun Nov 15 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oops... - Sun Nov 15 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was breathing heavily from the attack, she clearly had been using up a lot of energy to keep on fighitng like this. Once the girl swung her blade back onto Chikyu. She had no strength in her legs to dodge an attack like that, along with the mental awarness to let go of the blade after an successful attack. The back of the blade hit her in the side, the girl crumpling to the right as it got her. She quickly kneeled down out of breathe and badly bruised.* - Sun Nov 15 04:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) held out a hand for a moment, as she tried to stand back on her own two legs. Her body feeling tired from not only multiple spars, but multiple beatings. She then took one breathe, her voice still a little shaky. "I'm fine...but are you okay. I didn't actually think I would hurt you." She says looking extremely worried at Akimora's shoulder. Going up and touching it for a moment, and her face looking extremely shocked at the sight of the blood.* - Sun Nov 15 04:07:02 2015
