"He is hurt."* - Mon Nov 23 17:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I didnt mean to hurt you. It was a spar... I was testing strategies - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right, So when I quit and gave you the win because I was hurt. - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: What is your problem? - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You were so concerned with my well being. - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What was it you said? - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: 'I don't need your pity'? - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I didnt want you to do that, you did it of your own accord - Mon Nov 23 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are you mad now? The Akira that loved me is upset becasue I hurt him? - Mon Nov 23 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Rias with a rather note of shock. "Hey, hey Rias. I know what he saying is mean. But, you really did hurt him. Its understandable that he is upset, hes been sitting here doing nothing thanks to it. Spars are meant to test the other person not hurt me."

She then turned to Akira. "Can, you stop for a moment, argueing isn't going to make this any better." She then looked at the both of them surprised that was even going on. * - Mon Nov 23 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not arguing, she is. - Mon Nov 23 17:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Tch. - Mon Nov 23 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I said I was sorry! I didnt mean to hurt you like that... it was a unexpected  incident - Mon Nov 23 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) tapped Rias on the shoulder. "Look, I don't know how your getting all that stronger. But, you have to learn to control it. It doesn't matter if it was a mistake ro not. It happened, and you can't blow it off as an incident it can easily happen again. You have to be aware what your doing, and I know thats not much coming from me."

She then turned to Akira. "She said, she was sorry for hurting you. I believe she really does mean it. Now, say sorry back because what you said was no better."* - Mon Nov 23 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Once you're all done apologizing. - Mon Nov 23 17:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Something a lot more important to me that you broke. - Mon Nov 23 17:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Really? - Mon Nov 23 17:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It hurt that I spent time checking up on you every day to make sure you were ok. - Mon Nov 23 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But you wouldn't bother to do the same with me. - Mon Nov 23 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't even care that you won't return the feelings I have for you...but basic friendship I expect... - Mon Nov 23 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I was busy training, If I had time I would have checked on you - Mon Nov 23 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...and that's what hurts Rias. - Mon Nov 23 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pauses for a moment to come over, and chop Akira. "You said your part."

She then looks over to Hassan. "No, I prefer to keep on training and wait for the next one."* - Mon Nov 23 17:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabs his finger, before it even touches her. "If you want me to stop, then don't do something stupid like that again." She then threw the hand away. She was actually rather fuming at the moment. She wasn't even mad at her captor, this was the first time she was lightly steaming ever in the village.* - Mon Nov 23 17:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Akira's not fighting. He can't even abide by your rules anyways. He can't even fight a hundred percent thanks to his arm. - Mon Nov 23 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: He can fight 100 percent with his arm - Mon Nov 23 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'll fight at eighty percent since a broken arm takes away twenty percent. - Mon Nov 23 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ...Don't question my reasoning. - Mon Nov 23 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took a breath before they started, she took off her sword planting it in the ground nexter to her. When, Akira threw his shuriken with a thud, as the dust exploded to take cover of the sand. She really wasn't feelign up for this. Her teeth gritting under a firm grimmace, as she began to focus on Rias's chakra. 

She didn't even motion to her sword, as she kept it standing in the sand. She then ran into the smoke, attempting to come up against Rias's side. However, instead of throwing punches or kicks. Chikyu attempted to grab her, and use the weight of her armor to pull her down... if Rias didn't simply escape the cover of the smoke. If Rias escaped the smoke, Chikyu would try and wait till the next turn continue to use the smoke as a cover.* - Mon Nov 23 18:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly rushed in, her brows folded as she sensed a disturbance in Rias's chakra. However with limited knowledge of what Rias did, she was only to get hit by the burst of chakra into her body. Her body being jolting with someone elses chakra, as her head tilted downwards. Her mind completely cleared and open for Rias to use as she wished.* - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued ot run, and when she snapped to it she looked at the wall in front of her. She gritted her teeth, a loud roar coming from her. If she wasn't warned about it before hand, she might have actually fallen for this. However, now wide awake as to what happen. The  girl pulled back both her hands along with her head, as she trips forward into the stone wall. She then smashes it with her fist and head. Her fists cracking the stone to soften the hit, as her head crashes into it.

She leans against the rock, taking a few breathes at the moment. Her eyes closing, as she begins focusing on Rias's chakra once again. Her breathe letting out steamed breathes, as she regained control of her body.* - Mon Nov 23 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) feels the push at first, forcing her against the wall for a moment. However, she then turns around hold out two hands. She fights against the flowing river of a mud, taking a few steps forward. Though, her movement is clearly impeded by the rushing mud. * - Mon Nov 23 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Is that the direction you're in Rias? - Mon Nov 23 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Aaand theres that move...again...I wonder if those are the corporeal clones... - Mon Nov 23 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oooo she can use those clones too . . .  - Mon Nov 23 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) held out both of her hands. Takcing the attacks, her teeth gritting as she felt the ground slowly become her enemy becoming more slippery and covered with the remnants of mud. She continued until she finally began to get pushed back thanks to the terrain and the flow of the two rivers. She had came at a stand still, she continued to push back for a moment. Her eyes still closed looking for Rias, still she knew she couldn't move any more forward at this point.

She stopped for the moment, trying to continue pushing back against the clone's river. The soles of her shoes digging deeper into the mud, as she waited for a moment. Waiting until she felt comfortable to roll out of the way of the attacks, and make her final charge towards Rias.* - Mon Nov 23 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thought for moment, as she was nearly frozen in place holding back all the continous mud coming at her. She had to dig her hands in the ground to keep herself from just going backwards. Her body breathing heavily, as she was surrounding blasts of mud. They didn't damage her, but resisting it was taking a lot out of her. She... then flickered her mind realizing she should try and resist.

She then let go of her hold on the ground, beginning to slip backwards. She then grabbed the ground again. She then let herself get pushed all the way, back surely to the point where the weak clone's river wouldn't be as effective.* - Mon Nov 23 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) When she got further back, she then rolled out of the path of the  river. Her body covered in mud which she quickly tries to shake off not wanting extra load to slow her down from trying to dodge the next attack.* - Mon Nov 23 20:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) couldn't sense chakra with as ease, if she look she not that Chikyu was literally fighting with her eyes closed. Her body sensing out Rias energy. She paused for am oment she sensed her, <Was she that close- No.> She stopped as she sense the real Rias (She had no clue it was the real one.) <Clones...dangit.> Her breathe was stuttering and she was letting out louder heaves.

She then booked it forward. She reached in her pack, she then pull out four shuriken, and threw them all at once at the group. The attacks were spread intending to force the clones to move or be destroyed. She wondered for a moment if Rias would move... or if she take it with that armor of hers. * - Mon Nov 23 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nice. - Mon Nov 23 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly did four seals, as she ran towards the clones. If Rias could see her, she quickly recognize that it was the Kawarimi jutsu. She then jumped mid air aiming for one of the clones, a leg kicked out in attempt to drive through the clone's head and then Rias herself. "RIIAAAAASSS!" She yelled out, as she came flying at full force. * - Mon Nov 23 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You're still fighting then? - Mon Nov 23 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took the hit, from the swinging kicks. Chikyu of course disappeared into a cloud of smoke. However in her place was one of Rias's own clones. She then pushed forward, as she lowered herself arms stretched out wide. She then attempted to tackle Rias in the legs. Her chest, legs, and arms were all sore. However, she could see a chance for victory she take it for all its worth. Her mind completely focused on attacking what she believed to be the real Rias. The sudden shake and boom of the northern walls completely escaping the woman.* - Mon Nov 23 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins to lean up. Her head slightly bouncing up and down, as she brought a hand to rub it at the side of her temple. She looks around noticing her place in south of the town. She tried to stand up, but quickly fell back on her rear end. "TCH TK TSK TCH!" Her voice stammered over and over, as her arms reached behind her back. "OOWW! All my muscles...their so sore!" She excalimed beginning to rub her own arms now, hoping it would somehow help dull the pain.* - Mon Nov 23 21:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked extremely worried as she was begged to stay with her. Chikyu's eyes looked a little sunken, as she reached her arms around Rias. "R-iass?" She let her name come out of her lips, before she gave her a light hug too tired to give her a full squeeze. "I'm here with you, always." * - Mon Nov 23 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) wiped off the trail of the tear from her face. Chikyu then give her a smile, and squeezed her as tight as she could while exuasted. A hand patting Rias on her armored back. "Everything going to just fine...just fine." <Whats going on here...>* - Mon Nov 23 22:19:18 2015

She then gave a few movements up and down. She then took a breathe, and then....smashed her fist on the top of his head hoping it knock him out. "YOU IDIOT! GET SOME COMMON SENSE!" This was far harder then any chop before.* - Mon Nov 23 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gripped another first, as he responded for trying to protect his loved ones and the awkward kiss on her head. She grabbed him, her eyes glowing with anger to the point that it looked she was possessed. Her face nothing but a terrible anger. "IF YOUR SO WORRIED ABOUT YOUR DAMN LOVED ONES, FUCKING LEARN HOW THEY FEEEEELLLL-ARRRRRRAAAA!" She then punched him again this time in the stomach. "ALSO KEEP YOU DAMN LIPS ON YOURSELF!" She then combo into a hit in the face. 

She then stand behind as he would be sent flying, from the attack. Clapping her hands together. Once she was done. She then goes and falls back into Rias's lap for now. She was tired, she was sick of this this all. * - Mon Nov 23 22:40:38 2015
