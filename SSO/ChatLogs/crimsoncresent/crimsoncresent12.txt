<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) goes back to the usual training grounds. Sword in hand already preparing herself to start the morning training. Hands wrapping her fingers in a tight bond with her sword. She then lifted the sword above her head, beginning her start with her blade. Taking a step forward, foot stomping into the loose sand brushing it aside with all her weight. Her sword following itself with a heavy slam downwards until it crashed into the soft earth. A line embedded where her sword had hit.

Her hands then switched positions, quicker then ever before. Smoothly sliding to the underside of the handle. A twist of her body signaled her whole body to follow it. The upwards pull of her turn, lifting the blade quickly in motion. Her sword takes flight off the ground arcing in a complete semi-circular cut. One that would easily divide a person in two if they weren't careful of the range of her blade. She continued to pull until the sword went completely over her head, where her hands changed position once again. 

Again in a swift change, the girl was already in her starting stance. She took another step forward to bring down the blade with an intense force. Pushing her attack as fast she can. The blade going downwards with an intense speed, only to be suddenly stopped with the shift of her hands. The motion all too similiar, as she stops the blade before turning. Swinging her blade with a powerful tug, the dispersing air lifting off the sand in front of the chunk of steel.

The rhythmic heaves of sword continued the blade being thrown up and down. After each swing, she slowly moved back to her original spot doing it over again. The blade being fanned up and down with little ease from the kunochi. Her body feeling all the more ready to burn the calories. Though, her focus was more on the switching of her hands. The speed which both switches could be performed.

Her hands aiming to switch faster and faster, a mere second couldn't be wasted on the battlefield. Her father was very focused upon that fact. One must always work hard, and prepare themselves. That way without hesistation, one would be able to cut down their foe. The girl continuing to work her body, naturally following the flow of the  her strikes. Pushing past the strain in her arms tired of waving the chunk of steel.

She continued pushing her body father. However, she couldn't handle anymore follow up attacks. Focusing on her weaker attack, and working on her upward swing. Chikyau's pauses between upswings became longer and longer. The blade being thrown up, only to be slowly rested back down. Her body taking several breathes to recover her energy and oxygen. Once, she gathered enough strength she let out another swing. She continued till she let out one last roar of defience against her own stamina, and then dropping the blade to the ground. Letting out several tired pants.* - Sat Oct 31 11:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) doesn't really have a spot to place the scrolls thanks to her lack of appropriate garments. She slides as many as she can into the leather straps that holds the tassets on her hips. Managing to get the four in there. Able to hold the last one in her hands, if she was given anymore she would just have to force another part to place them. She decided she might as well learn one quickly to hand it back.

She then pulls out the throat strike scroll. Rolling it out to full length for herself to read. Her face immediatly striking one of distaste. She was not one for analytical thought. Her red eyes flowing down the instructions of the throat strike. She chuckled inside of her own mind, as she learned that this was about attacking an enemies throat. She thought that was something that was obvious, and didn't know it was something that had to be learned. Though since it was a gift, she continued to read into it out of respect.* - Sat Oct 31 12:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued to read into the scroll, noticing a small diagram of the weak point being aimed on to the throat. Her small tan hand reaching up to grab the underside of her throat. Placing her fingers where it stated on the scroll, then giving herself a tight squeeze which leads to the genin coughing and gaging before she lets go. Her tongue sticks out, as she lets go of her own throat. Gagging for a moment "Eh... that..Ack is more effective then usual!" 

She is then given a back pouch, and looks at it. "Why all the gifts? I mean I appreciate the favor and all. But, I don't like being in debt." * - Sat Oct 31 12:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Got it, it is the job of a shinobi to be strong enough to protect the village." She says happily, as she puts on the back pouch. However, doesn't seem to get the point of putting the scrolls in the pouch. She continues cluelessly reading the scroll, before she holds it a side for a moment. "Hmm... I think it goes something like this." she says to herself, as she holds away the scroll with one hand. The other arm curls back, building up energy like a spring. She then lets it go shooting out the arm fully extend, fingers held together hitting an imaginary opponent.

Pulling back her hand, seemingly already gotten a good hang of the techinique. She curled her fingers back and forth. "Hmm...I guess I got to work a lot more on that one. I don't think I would've hit deep enough."* - Sat Oct 31 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began reading the next scroll, pulling it out of the strap around her waist and replacing it with the previous throat strike scroll. She began reading about the basic misdirection, noting this was a lot different then she was used to. She was normally focused on a brutal offense and less focused on a flowing defense. Still, she took to reading it. Looking at first thebasic overview of extending one's arm using it to deflect attacks at one self. Interupting movement, then shifting the force away from the user. * - Sat Oct 31 13:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins going into the deeper terms and physics of the defensive move. Her eyes slightly squinting at reading it. A notable frown went across her face, as she had to use her upmost concentration to understand what the scroll was getting at. Holding out one hand, and just slowly with a bit of lifelessness rotating her hand back and forth. Trying to understand, how this move would be able to deflect more powerful blows. Her eyes pausing every so often to take notes on how to deflect certain attacks at various angles with a few drawn examples. Those probably being the most helpful for Chikyu to learn the jutsu.* - Sat Oct 31 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began grinding her teeth, as she tried to take in the information. This one being far more complicated then a simple throat grab. She then stood up groaning, as she couldn't really get it through reading alone. She grabbed the sword on her back, and pulled it out before shoving the tip of the two-hander sword into the dirt. The kunochi then stood back. Holding out her right arm near the handle of the massive blade, that  was now standing straight up in the air. She then pull back her arm, and smacked the handle. The sword came out of the dirt, spinning several time sbefore Chikyu went and grabbed it mid spin. 

"Gah! I don't even know if that was right!" She shouts, chewing herself out. Her mind fuming after reading so much, which she had little patience for. She then began stomping away, wondering where she was going to stuff away all these scrolls.* - Sat Oct 31 13:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began reading the next scroll. Letting out a tiny sigh, as she takes to reading again. Prefering a much hands on approach then to reading through long list of words. She continues though reading the basic overview of the technique called the 'Leaf Whirlwind'. She thought it was completely strange that such a techinique would be named and used in a place filled with sand. She shook the thought, continuing to go through the techinique that boiled down to a series of kicks.

She began to breakdown the long sentences to their most basic of essence. Getting into her mind, that the techinque was a series of kicks. A high feint to a true low strike. That way, one will be guranteed to land. Which did peak her interest, though it wasn't like she fought often without her sword. However, the purpose wasn't left to waste. She immeaditly wondered if she could do this with a sword.

Her focus peaked for a moment. He eyes darting through the information to get a better understanding of the techinique. The scroll noting the height of the high kick. Pointing the best place to raise the kick is at the level of the opponents eyes. That way, the foot will block the sight of the opponent. Which then leads to the set up of the low kick to be disguised. A drop of sweat comes down from the side of Chikyu's cheek. Realizing, she herself would probably have fallen for this techinique.* - Sat Oct 31 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sorry, Have to find a certain someone. - Sat Oct 31 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued reading through the scroll, head tilted. Her eyes actually consuming the information. The detail in her brain was slightly beginning to hurt with all the extra information. Still, she continued to read the attacks and how they were formed. The balance that was found in doing two attacks at different heights. Which was complicated in itself, to make the human body follow such motions. One needed to really match up, or else they risk making a complete fool of themselves in battle.

Lifting up her thumb, and chewing down on it. She thought for a moment, before standing up. Laying her sword down for the moment. She then stood up holding the stance that was in the scrolls. She the continued to burn away several minutes. Swinging her legs in the air, her white boots kicking up sands as she tried to mimic the techinique out of the scrolls. She let out several "Omphs! Rah!" as she continued to trip and fall on her rear. However, her dedication continued. Testing her own self control, as she continued until finally. She managed to pull off the Leaf Whirlwind, with a flurish of two kicks. The top feint, sliding out in front of her. Hands pressing the dirt to support her body, her other leg sliding across the surface of the earth into a powerful hit. She then stood up, clenching her fists in victory.* - Sat Oct 31 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took to her second to last scroll. Raising it up in front of her. Reading through the scroll quickly to get the basics of it. Her mind slightly more awake for this scroll. Eyes sparking with imagination about turning these into her swords work. Her mind reading into the rather actual simple techinique, something she appreciated greatly. Where one would simply launch themselves at their opponent, directing their power to a kick.

The hardest part mentioned by the scroll was balance. One needed enough balance to not only not miss their target or the power of their hit. Even more then that, the user of this techinique needed to keep this up in the air. Which was quite difficult for anyone that hadn't done body training. All the while sending once self flying fast enough not to get caught by the enemy. "Ergh... it feels kind of reckless." 

Shaking her head, about the actual fighting potential of such a techinique. She continued to read into it. Looking at a diagram of the pose, and even managing to read the entire description of it in the scrolls. Those, this did lead her to letting out a little "Blegh." of disgust when she finished reading it all. Still, it was helpful information to actually perform it. leaning her head back, where it hit the rock wall. She let out a little steam, pausing her sel to take a few breathes before going onwards.

After her break, she continued completely. Giving it one more painfully long read over. Making sure she had all the information to the jutsu. There was a few more bits at the bottom. Possible ways of using the move as a surprise attack. Another one was using a shuriken or other ranged weapon, and following in path with that attack. That way, one could get the jump on their enemy lowering the danger of being countered.

She let out a relived sigh, as she stood up. Her hands going down to pat down her pants relieving it free of the staining sand. She then prepared herself. She took a fast sprint. Her feet shooting up dust, as she kicked off to a rush start. Suddenly, she took flight with a long jump. Her body mimicing the pose from the scroll. Her attack flew until, her foot collided with the rock walls that surrounded the entire training grounds. She then jumped back, landing with a smile before turning around and picking up her sword.* - Sat Oct 31 18:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) bowed her head gratefully, before taking the water. Taking a sip of it down, she then looked over bending her head to the side. "What do you mean?" She says blinking in confusion.* - Sat Oct 31 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) takes another drink of the water, before letting out a happy "Pahhh~" from the satsifaction of something filling her dry throat.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) once again thanked for being given their food. She then brought one of the chop sticks to a piece of sushi. Grabbing and lfiting it to her mouth, the swordswoman took a bite out of it. Letting out a loud "Mmmph! This is delicious." She lets out, mouth still stuffed with food.* - Sat Oct 31 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) rather began to speed through her food, taking it down piece by piece without digression. Until her plate was wiped clean, the girl holding the last bite of her chopsticks with a long satsfied chomp. When she pulled out, and swallowed the last bit of cold fish she looked over to Yu. "This is just what I needed after studying all day. Something to reward myself."* - Sat Oct 31 23:04:57 2015

She the holds out her hands in front of her, her hands curving down in the noticable shape of a very womanly figure. "He was worried I turn out gay, so he taught me how to appreciate women. It took me forever to stop answer to she and calling myself a girl!"* - Sat Oct 31 23:35:40 2015

She pauses looking at him seriously, with a very intesne stare. "Theres no way I'm going to take interest in guys." She the raises her hands, her fingers waving and curling rather eerily. "I mean, how can you ignore girls with a good chest and rear!" Steam coming out of her nose, as she blushes intensely. * - Sat Oct 31 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Huh this?" she says grabbing her own chest, ignoring the two that just entered. "Its not much. It was flat for the longest time to make my father guess I was a boy." She then looked to him, shakign her head. "Its sad that most of the girls in the village like to cover up. Its hard to check them out. Though, a lot of their faces look so cute." She lets out a happy sigh, as she folds her hands under her cheek with elbows resting on the table. * - Sat Oct 31 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) leans over punching Yu in the shoulder. "I'm sure you can get a good girl for yourself. I'll be your wing-man... wing-girl."* - Sun Nov  1 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shakes her fist. "Don't give up like that. If you give up you'll never get one. Now is the time to strike!" She begins to get louder. "And, as you good friend. I won't let you give up."* - Sun Nov  1 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) jumped over to his side. "Sure whatever you dummy." She said head locking him, and shoving him into her chest. A hand coming up to suddenly begin, rubbing into his air. Clearly not the kind of hug he might of wanted, but he might prefer it this way. * - Sun Nov  1 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) finally stops at some point, though probably not before his head goes red from being rubbed so hard. She then smacks him on the back. "If you ever need a confident booster, just come to me. I'm always free to talk to one of my bros." * - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took home in an open place for herself, noting the training grounds were already filled with a group of people. The swordswoman was unwilling to let herself rest without getting some last minute work on her sword techinique. She had already put so much focus in learning taijutsu techiniques, it was just good she could get some good hard practice in. Her hand reaching up over her shoulder, and easily sliding out a sword with one quick motion. 

She rests her sword on the ground. Getting prepared to wave it for a moment. Her chest taking a few breathes, as she concentrates on the edge of her blade. She then gave a few teasing pulls on her blade pulling it up off the ground. She then got a good feeling for the motion, before she turned twisting her body upwards. The blade flying up in a large arc, to the point that Chikyu let it follow through letting the blade go wave over head. Turning to the side, her arms following the motion until the blade landed on the opposite side of her.

She smiled at the force she was able to generate, but she needed just a bit more control then that. She flipped her arms and blade back to the proper side. Hands cusping the handle lightly, before tightening a grip. She raises and lowers the blade again, testing it for a moment. She then did her techinique once more throwing the blade up off the ground. The blade glinting into the little moon light it captures, sending it back to where it came from as it moves upward. She barely manages to catche the blade just before it flies behind her shoulder.

Dropping the sword back on to the earth. She prepares her self again, feet stomping side to side. She had a good feeling for this next one. She didn't hesistae for a second to start her move. The blade was brought up in that usual swift motion, slincing the air in front of it. Cutting down a straight line upwards, without one flicker of deviation. The sword traveled up to its peak, standing straight over Chikyu's head. This is where her hands caught the blade, stopping its motion. She then pulled it behind her head, already prepared to follow it up with another brutal attack...if this was a real fight of course.* - Sun Nov  1 01:47:05 2015

She lets out a loud yawn, she seemed pretty exhausted by all the work she did today. She pulls out her last scroll, and stretches it out reading the title of it to herself. "Guess... I gotta find a weapon store tomorrow."* - Sun Nov  1 01:51:21 2015

Counting the amount to herself on her path; however sadly for her, she had looked up from the money spotting several people gathered together. However, the first thing struck her was...a giant black beast though nobody seemed to mind his existance. Beyond that was something even more hideous to witness.

The stranger with arms lost, with spikes going out of his body. The genin covered her mouth with her other hand. Holding back the sick feeling coming from her decency as a human being. Only to then witness, Hassan even wreck the poor man even harder. The female swordsman looking away at this time, missing out on the impaling rocks. * - Sun Nov  1 10:32:44 2015
