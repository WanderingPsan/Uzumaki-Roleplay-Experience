<br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) grabbed her sword, as she responded the best she could for the situation. She then swung at the two regenerated tentacles that struck first. Cutting them both in half, she then grabbed one sliced pieces of the tentacles holding it for a moment. She then waited just before the other three attack throwing the tentacle at the beast. She tried to block the first tentacle that came after, and after that she had no ability to dodge the rest.

As the tentacles with spikes came out, they peirced her body severals times. Only for the illusion to break, her body disappearing in a cloud of smoke with cut off tentacle she had just thrown taking her place. She appeared by the side of the creature. Where, she quickly cut through its body with a diagonal slash.

However, she had seen the creature's regenerative abilities. She wouldn't be satsfied with just that. So, when she landed after her diagonal cut. Being nearly four feet plust the reach of her arms and the length of her sword. She lances the tip of her sword into the cumbling ceiling just above the monster with enough strength it could destroy a new ceiling let alone this broken mess.

She then backs away as quickly as she could, to avoid being caught in the blase.. Her leg still burning in pain, and not helped bye the sewage that had flooded the place. * - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) didn't expect the creature to be this resistant to attacks. The body still oozing its way out of her best attempt to seal it. However, it began right away healing even if it was at a slower rate. The girl then saw it begin to come at her.

She was starting to feel exhausted, as her breathe begin to extend out. She had already fought for so long, and the wound on her leg was beginning to sink even more into her skin. She took one breathe, as the creature came at her again.

She took one step in the sludge covering the floor, a splash as her foot splashed into the liquid.  She had her sword raised abover her head. "VON GIEN!"  Her voice booming as she brings the blade down on to the slime beast coming at her aiming to split it in two. 

However, she doesn't end there as she turns herself to whatever remained of the creature or if she failed to cut through all of it. She then twisted her waist, and brought up the sword that had just crashed into the ground. "GAN RIZE!" She shouted, as she brought the blade up scraping what used to be a ceiling of the sewer.

She with one last flair, she then brought down her blade one more time. Another, Von gien coming down on the remains of the beast hopefully the thick dense center that it sheltered at the center. The girl's blade would crash and stay to the floor. The girl hunched over breathing, after fighting for this long against this creature while pulling out attack after attack.* - Fri Nov 27 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly gets grasped by the sewer water, that grabs and takes her in. She takes one heavy breathe, before falling eyes closed and nose shut into the sinking pile of human wastes.  The girls leg taken in under the surface. She leaned over trying to ignore the rancid, vile filth around her body. Her eyes watering even while shut.

She reached down grabbing at the two tentacles that had latched on to her. Chikyu tried to use pure strength to pull each one off.* - Fri Nov 27 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) crawls herself out of the sewage, flicking as much of the waste she could. She then began to tear down the way for the citizens, before leaving herself. She wouldn't say a single word as she managed herself out of the disgusting depths of the sewers. She then went straight for home, as she went to take a long...very long shower using all of her shampoo's and conditioners for then ext hour. * - Fri Nov 27 05:54:33 2015

She then flicked her head over to Lera, who began to respond with something that was usual from her. The noticable buried tip in the ground plus the need to use the block at an angle, pointed to Chikyu that Lera was concerned with her oppoennts abilities. She also note that with the spars shes down with Lera and Paines practice swings both were on the same level.

She snickered silently to herself looking over to Paine. <And, she said she was just a light ethusiast with the blade.> She then looked over to Lera's blade. <However, working with something like that, must have been harsh. I wonder if its really okay to presume they both put in the same ammount of time in their swordsmanship when one has to carry around that monster.>* - Fri Nov 27 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked at the two fighters a smile forming across her face, as the both of them were clearly having fun. The blades spinning around to connect with one anothers blows, as the clash of steel rippled through the training grounds. Paine's speed was something to be frightened of, on the other hand Lera's stactic defensive style seemed to be doing her fine at the moment.

She did notice the sudden jump of Samehada. A flash of her remember poking the blade becoming something to worry about. She shook her noting that the two clashed blades once more, Lera this time iniating the counter attack. She wondered how each one of them would try to get the upper hand in their exchanging blades. Though, she wondered if they would even go all out or just enjoy rubbing their steel together.* - Fri Nov 27 14:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched the two begin to start showing off more of their techiniques then simple slashes and blocks. She was smiling bigger, now that Paine was adding in with her own natural taijutsu styles it was becoming much more greater. Lera on the other hand began to use her jutsus, covering her skin in iron and using the effects of her sword to her advantage which was a smart tactical ploy. Even though, Paine just moved far quicker then the slower Domu Lera could keep up with.

She then watched with open eyes, as Lera took the hit. She then watched her begin to spray mud outwards. She paused in thought, a hand clenching the bottom of her chin. Lera clearly had a plan, but was this set up for a new jutsu or maybe to set a hazard for the light footed Paine.* - Fri Nov 27 15:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched the two continuing to fight, the swarm of clones in coming on Paine. Only for Paine to respond with a beautiful twirling kick. The attacks clearing a heavy portion of the clones in a second. However, the clones kept coming in and though she got out another powerful attack on her. She still subcumbed to the ragings waters beneath her. Though, it wasn't something anyone could really be shameful of.

Chiky seeing the fight had finish ran off to her blade that was tossed into the air. She pick it up with one hand waving it. "Mirosen! You're really okay!" she said, as she then slipped it back on to her back.* - Fri Nov 27 16:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began charging her chakra trying to build it up as much as she could. She paused remembering a similiar thing she did to do her chakra flow. She took a deep breathe emptying herself. Her body became still without motion, her consciousness resting in her minds darkness. She ceased all thought but that of moving her chakra. Her chakra glowing faint blue light, as she began bringing it down to their legs. The energy slowly traveling into her legs, and then she stopped. 

"HUUUUUHHHFFF!" She suddenly took in a load of air. A hand on her chest ashe began to huff out. "Whheewww! I forgot to breathe their for a second." She said out loudly, asthe energy dispersed from her legs. * - Sat Nov 28 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to do it once more. Her energy building up, as she sent the energy back to her legs. This time, opening her mind just a bit more so she actually remembers to take in breathes. She then slowly began to gather up until the energy encompassed her entire foot. She then began to compress it until the energy laid flat on the soles of her feet. She then walked up to the wall, and then held up one leg. "My first step! I got this!" She said with excitement.

Her eyes then glowed with confidence and assurance in her abilities. She then shoved her foot with all her strength on the wall. That was then when a loud "BBOOOM!" could be heard, as Chikyu had just made a hole in the wall where her foot was stuck in. She lost her concentration and began pulling her own leg  until with a pop. She managed to pull it out, and then fall on her own rump.* - Sat Nov 28 05:20:00 2015
