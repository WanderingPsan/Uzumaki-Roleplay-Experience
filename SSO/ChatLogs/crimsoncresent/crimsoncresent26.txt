She doesn't even cut them, as she pulls one off at a time eating it whole. She swallowed one and paused, as she thought about it. "I just always imagined becoming more like my dad, and being as strong as him or protecting people I care about. Just simple things like that. Sometimes, if something was going on like I was having trouble doing a move or more like if I had a recent crush on a girl.

She then felt the girl hug, and returned it quickly squeezing and lifting the person off the ground then putting her back down. "HAHHA! You're pretty energetic Chiyu! Rias would love to meet you, same with Rias."

She waved off for a moment the fact she felt something weird along her spine, and instead looked up and down the new girl before noticing the light blue markings. She raised up her hand, and looked at it for a moment. "Whoa cool! You have tattoos?"* - Mon Nov 23 00:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nods. "Yeah, I'll take you there if you don't know where it is. Just give me a second." She then turns to wave to Momura. "Going to go spar with Chiyu over here!" She then turns wanting to say hi to Rias, but notices shes already surrounded by Hiroshi.  She just gives her a wave hoping she notices it.

She then turns to Hanesegawa. "So, lets go! On the way to the training grounds!"* - Mon Nov 23 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls out her sword with one hand, and waves it across in front of her a few times. "Here we are, seems a lot of people are here. But still enough space for us." she then looks over to her opponent, and nods answering her question. "Sure, go ahead! I'll give it my all...while trying not to hurt each other. Hahha!" She laughed at the rather ironic echo of that statement.* - Mon Nov 23 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked forward, as she watches the girl suddenly clap her hands together.The girl gasped at the moment, as her tatoos began to expand off of her body. <Woah! She really wasn't kidding when she said they were special.> She thought to herself, as she dug her feet in the ground prepared to react to whatever she was doing. Her hands gripping tighter on the leather handle.

When the girl's charge finally finished, and the blast of blue came out of her arms and shot forward. Chikyu immeaditly sprung to action side stepping the attack. The girl trying to do her best to ignore the strange and otherwordly attack. 

She takes off running, sand being kicked up behind her as she makes her way to Chi. She stops, once she gets to her side. The explosion from behind as the orb finally hits the back of the wall making her shake for a moment, before she swings her blade with wide flat side (as to not cut her opponent) horozontally.* - Mon Nov 23 01:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stops her attack, as she notes the girl suddenly pass out. She blinks blankely turning too Rias with a worried expression. "Uhhhh... what did I do!" She then pauses realizing that Rias was licking her lips, and showing her usual... *cough* interest in new things.* - Mon Nov 23 01:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) closes her eyes as well, and can't even notice Chikuryunaki with her sensing. She leans down, helping the girl stand up on her own two feet. "Oh! Guess you got some training ahead of you then. Though, that was pretty neat what you did!"* - Mon Nov 23 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I think you should sit down Chi. - Mon Nov 23 01:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) caught the girl easily before began to fall back, and held her back up with an arm around her waist. "If Rias says you shouldn't fight, you should trust her." She nods. "If your family wants you to fight, I'm sure they want you to get stronger. Not kill youself in a spar."* - Mon Nov 23 01:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gets back into her spot, looking behind her where the first chakra blast hit the wall behind her. <Welp, I know what to watch out for now.> She said preparing her sword once again, and standing ready for her opponent to make the first move.* - Mon Nov 23 02:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to stand still, as she held ehr sword out keeping it steady. She notices the first clone that appeared in her spot, her eyes raising as she notices this new discovery. She held her sword knowing the girl had stuff she never seen before. She takes a swing at all three of them practically spinning, as Chi quickly sweeps her off her feet. The girl tumbles falling in to the dirt.* - Mon Nov 23 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: well i am. - Mon Nov 23 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) holds out her sword, as she sees Chikuryunaki prepare  for her bomb. The girl holds up, her massive sword like a shield. It takes the hit directly absorbing some of the concussive force, but the girl easily manges to shrug off the rest of the attack. She then quickly rolls on to her feet and leaps up herself, reaching out a hand to grab one of Chi's legs. She then would try to fling her back to the earth.* - Mon Nov 23 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) smiles as she looks over here. "You'll find many people here that won't get beat by any of your moves. So, your training becomes how many times can you throw yourself at an unstoppable wall." She smiles to the girl knowing how shes feeling. She then holds out a finger. "If you can hit me one more time, I'll call you the winner. How does that sound?" She says giving her a smile.* - Mon Nov 23 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "You're really trick you know that." She planted the sword in front of her. "I'm not used to fighting people like you." She said, as she took a step back behind the blade. She then closed her eyes focusing on the blue orb being made, as she began to make a series of four hand seals. * - Mon Nov 23 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Because Im happy, why shouldnt I show affection?  - Mon Nov 23 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to run over to Chikuryunaki. She didn't like seeing a girl cry, but this was a spar. She wouldn't hold back, because she was sure her opponent wouldn't like it that way. She then came without her sword running at full speed with her right arm pulled back.
