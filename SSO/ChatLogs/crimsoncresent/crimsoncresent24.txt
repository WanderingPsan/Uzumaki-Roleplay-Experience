<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) takes a seat at the closest table, scooting out the chair on the bumpy surface of the floor. She leans back in the chair, as she asks the passing waitress for water, and takes a quick order of bacon and eggs. Her eyes then close, and she beguns to hum under her breathe ready to wait for their meal.* - Fri Nov 20 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) tapped her maroon breast plate. "Well isn't it obvious, what color I like the most." She says, nodding to herself with a smile. "You're the second person to ask that."* - Fri Nov 20 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nodded "Yep, Greed is my favorite.... though blue coming up. After that mission with Mitsunara to Kirigakure, even though that horrible event happened there... It was a beautiful place."

She then listened to his second question, and then frowned. "Nope.. though I wish I had someone. Though, I mean all the girls in the village are cute. I guess, I'll just sit back for now and watch all my other friends in their relationships. They all look so happy now!'

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Please, I'm your friend aren't I?" She says, as the plate hits the top of the table, the girl immediatly grabs a fork. When, Akira looks back up from cutting his eggs and bacon. Chikyu has the plated lifted up, and is basically scooping the whole plate into her mouth. The sounds of her chomping, was similiar to a chain saw tearing through the trunk of a tree. She finished in seconds dropping it down in front of her. "Mhhmmm.... but you don't suck talking to people, and only you can introduce yourself to others. Friends just get to show you off to other friends."* - Fri Nov 20 17:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, most are agressive because they have a dream or a goal to obtain. Which means you can rely on them. - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) slides off the sword placing it on the ground. She then flips one of her arms over, as she unlocks the blue metallic bands that keep it hung around her arms. They unlock with a click, and thump on to the ground. She does this for the other arm, before slipping off the metal pauldrons hanging around her hips.

Shes now left armor less, besides the breastplates around her chest.* - Sat Nov 21 05:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stretched out her free arms, a notable shift of color was around her wrists after she had taken off the armguard. The skin was notably darker then anywhere else on her exposed body. She looked over to Kuro shaking her head. "Nope, just here to hang out with Momura."

She then cracks her neck left and right, a hand holding the opposite side stiff. "Always feels good to take off that load, sorry it makes such a mess." She said looking behind at the stack of metal that was there now.* - Sat Nov 21 05:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Kuro. "Well, if I had anyone to compare to me, Mitsunara is a close fit. She wields the blade about as good as I am. I've trained most my life on it. However, I'm still a novice compared to my dad." She said ,as she took a whiff of the scent of the tea leaves.* - Sat Nov 21 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I ask, why the sword? - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) also poked Momura back, on the shoudler as she looked away.* - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, I ask about the sword because I've grown an interest in it. - Sat Nov 21 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Momura, and pokes her on the cheek as well. "I have to disagree Momura... Swords are the best!"* - Sat Nov 21 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I'm no good at teaching. And, I don't think my dad would teach you anything. If you want any basic info, I can tell  you anything you want. - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've seen rather graceful and composed moves from swordsmen.  They don't allow their emotions to sway their judgement.  - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Hahaha... Well I think you might like seeing my father. He tries to hide it, but hes a big baby on the inside."  She says laughing, before awkwardly being poked in the cheek again.

She then turns to Momura, and pokes Momura but this time she begins to lightly rub it into her. "Nah, I think fists are way better then bullets. "* - Sat Nov 21 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued to rub her finger, but this time used her other hands finger. Leaning over Momura, she began to poke the other cheek.* - Sat Nov 21 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't plan to learn the sword for combat reasons, rather for meditative reasons.  My training with Yukio has been quite difficult, and I've been convinced that by taking up the sword I may be able to concentrate more and build up on my physical attributes. - Sat Nov 21 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stopped poking, and basically pressed her hands flattly against Momura's cheeks. The swordswoman basically lightly squeezing the other fourteen year old's cheeks together. 

She turned around to answer, but her voice sounded funny thanks to the two fingers rubbing on her cheeks. "W-well.. I-ff..you-u want-t som-uma basic prac-tices- I c-can sh-show of a few o-f-f tho-s-ses."* - Sat Nov 21 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) snickered looking at Fish-faced Momura. She began to let out a bubbling voice "Blub Blub blub!" The girl forcing her eyes to go cross to make the impression even more fish like. * - Sat Nov 21 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: This is pretty funny. - Sat Nov 21 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) started laughing even harder. The girl fell to the side pulling away from the hands squeezing her cheeks. She lays down across Momura's laps. Her legs kicking up in the air over the arm rests of the couch. The tan girl holding her stomach with both hands, keeping in the even heavier set of laughter sitting inside her ab covered abdomen. 

"Hahaha! Thats too good! Hahaha!"* - Sat Nov 21 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued for just a bit longer after hearing Momura's high pitched soft laughter. She pulled herself up, wiping a tear of joy away from her eye. She then reached for her own cup of Green Tea. She then held it for a moment, before reaching into her sack. She then pulled out a single leaf. She then began to crush it, grinding it down with her own fingers. She then dropped the remains into the cup.

She then slowly stir it up by a simple shake of her wrist a few times. She then leaned back holding the cup very properly which was a far cry from the usual Chikyu eating style. She then began to sip the cup lightly. "Mmhm... You are good at making some delightful tea. Kuro."* - Sat Nov 21 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you.  I used to make it all the time at the temple. - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're welcome. - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Temple? - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took another drink from the cup, as she felt herself bounce with the new weight being distributed across the couch. "You don't look like much of a monk. Hahahah! Though, I guess I don't look much of a ninja either." She smiled, taking another taste of her cup.* - Sat Nov 21 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't? I thought I did.  - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nope! - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: So, what temple did you become a monk? - Sat Nov 21 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The Lightning Temple near Kumogakure. - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Thats pretty far away right? - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why did you come all the way here then? - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I used to live in Kumogakure, until a dear friend and mentor of mine died... - Sat Nov 21 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, to give you the simple answer, to explore the world. - Sat Nov 21 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The real answer is a journey to find an answer to an age old question. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hmm..? - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The question? Well, how to obtain peace.  I thought my initial views from when I was in the temple would suffice, but I've seen hardships and not everyone is willing to share my views. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Well easiest w-way to peace.. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Tea...a good r-restaurant..family o-owned.. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's no easy way. It's a long and challenging task.  I can find ways to obtain peace, but none will stick. I want a peace that will last for a life time, one that will never break. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Watermelon? - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmm... that sounds all pretty complicated. I'll just keep on protecting those who I care about. - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everyone believes that they can obtain peace by cutting down their opponents, but that's not true peace. That just leads to an eternal linegae of bloodshed and agony. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, I'm not chasing peace. I'm chasing to protect what I can while I'm alive. - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You take the life of one, you're robbing others.  It's a large domino effect. - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're willing to take a life to protect what's yours? - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shakes Momura on the shoulder. "Watermelons make a great peace too, can't fight while you eat something so good."

She then turns to Kuro." If its what I must do. My dad already told me all you can about the weight of a sword."* - Sat Nov 21 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pats the top of the red headed Momura, ashe lays against Chikyu.* - Sat Nov 21 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Even if taking said life will rob another of the ability to protect what's theres? What if someone comes for revenge? Will you keep taking lives after lives until you have nothing left? - Sat Nov 21 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the world I wish to create, you won't have to worry about such a problem.  Everyone will be able to coexist together and not have to fight for resources, and protection.  - Sat Nov 21 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-That's a basic human p-problem. - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Taking a life is never a good deed, no matter how you justify it. However, is not sitting back just as wrong. When you can help someone to the best of your ability. I'm here to be a good person to my friends, and thats all I can offer in my life thats of value. Other then that, I'll selfishly protect those around me. I'm not good at creating peace or anything like that. But, if you can do that I'll be really happy. Because, I won't have to fight anymore. - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: T-This got really d-deep.. - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Why d-do I stutter in my m-mind? - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: W-What is t-this!? - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Why do you stutter in here... and why does your mind have a watermelon wallpaper? - Sat Nov 21 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: W-Who knows! - Sat Nov 21 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uhm.. - Sat Nov 21 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: R-Right? - Sat Nov 21 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want to bust it open, and take a few bites for ourselves? - Sat Nov 21 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want some Kuro? - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No thank you. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you for offering though. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) bumped her elbow into Momura. "More for us then!" She says giggling, grabbing her half before she began to chew through the whole things. This time showing her more barberic behavior. Soon, she had completely hollowed out the watermelon... but one issue laid for afterwards.

She turned to Momura, her cheeks flooded with seeds. "Mhurh Murhrm Unhd mnhhddd!" <What do I do with the seeds!>* - Sat Nov 21 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You should at least aim for the garbage can. - Sat Nov 21 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'll clean it up.. - Sat Nov 21 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was about to begin spitting them up agains the wall until Kuro mentions it, and not wanting to be a both though. She looks for the garbage can, and lets down a pour of seeds that make an almost black waterfall from her mouth. She then comes over and takes her seat back on the couch.* - Sat Nov 21 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You have to teach me though, how you shot them out like that! - Sat Nov 21 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: That was super cool! - Sat Nov 21 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I can't. - Sat Nov 21 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Super special secret j-jutsu. - Sat Nov 21 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh, of course if you don't want to then thats fine. I can understand! - Sat Nov 21 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its pretty cool, so best not share it with anyone. - Sat Nov 21 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: rwhat jutsu - Sat Nov 21 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) smashes another water melon, carves it out then pokes two holes in it. Then places it as a helmet on top of Momura's head. She pauses, after placing the watermelon helmet, which had two perfect eye holes for Momura to see through, to look voer to Kuro.

"Nothing much ... I wanted to go train on something... which I got a little, but I had to take a seat to heal up. I have a test from my father coming up. So, I just have to wing it. "* - Sat Nov 21 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah that's right, you're still healing. How is it going with that? - Sat Nov 21 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: I'm sure I didn't put anything else in the tea..Unless they put something in when I had my back turned. - Sat Nov 21 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) clearly crushed a strange leaf into her own cup. Posted that way back when she first got it, and she wasn't hiding it.

"Hahaha! Don't wear it too long, or you'll start smelling like one too."* - Sat Nov 21 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You two are quite energetic. - Sat Nov 21 07:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls out another one from her bag. "Oh this? My dad makes tea all the time, but I can't stand the stuff unless its really sweet. So, he got this plant...its something called Stevia. Squeeze to a powder, liquify, or boil it and it makes it sweet like sugar. Its also good for your digestive system apparently."* - Sat Nov 21 07:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begin to pet the top of the melon wearing Momura.  "Want me to stay the night?"* - Sat Nov 21 07:25:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Hahaha! I don't see myself much as a female. But, I guess I am your first female friend. Mind getting out of my lap, so I can get my pajamas on then. If I'm going to stay night migh as well get comfortable." She says patting Momura on the head.* - Sat Nov 21 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Where will she sleep? - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hm.. - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) reached behind her to grab at a brown sack that hung from her hip. She then pulled out a pink white-stripped set of Pajama tops and pants. She then took off her sack, and immeaditly in front of the two unhooked her chest band dropping into the ground leaving her top completely exposed.

She then turned around, still compelty uncovered. "Oh I don't mind sleeping on the floor. Hahaha, I've slepted outside on the ground before!"* - Sat Nov 21 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Sleep here! - Sat Nov 21 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) already pulling down her pants revealing tight bicycle shorts underneath. She then looked over to Momura, as she slipped off her top and bra. The girl stares at Momura for a moment...a long...long paused moment. Her hair practically spikes, as she sees the girl exposed watermelons. A small trail of blood bleeding down her nose. 

 She quickly runs over to Kuro shoving his face into her chest so he can't look at Momura, and looks away though still having hot flashes in her cheeks. "Momura! What are you doing, you can't get naked in front of a guy and a girl like me!" She kept her eyes pinched closed. * - Sat Nov 21 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Huh? - Sat Nov 21 07:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) breaks away from Kuro the moment she does so, without a word signalling thatt Momura had even put it back on. Her nosebleed slightly bigger, after peeking at  Momura try and stuff her figure into her bra. She then coughed, before letting out a sigh. "Much better!" She said, as she pulled on the bottom of her pajamas and then put on her top covering the two small mounds of brown flesh resting on her chest. "All covered up now," She says stretching. "And ready to sleep!* - Sat Nov 21 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..I don't have p-pjs.. - Sat Nov 21 07:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Momura, slapped her cheeks a few times. She then jumped backwards into the fluffy air filled bed. The matress shaking up and down from the vibrations of her sudden crash into it. "Woo-ah this is different then usual bed!"* - Sat Nov 21 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) shrugged. "I've never done this before. Do you like cuddling?" She asked turning over to Momura.* - Sat Nov 21 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yeaaa! - Sat Nov 21 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) craddled Momura in a embrace under the sheets, pressing the girl into her chest. Chikyu certainly didn't have mountians like Momura. But, they could be felt providing a nice cushion for Momura to rest against. "Does this feel right?" Chikyu innocently asked, shaking her hips a little underneath the sheets. She didn't mind Kuro in her chest, but with Momura, Chikyu did feel a little hot under the collar.* - Sat Nov 21 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Huh? I-It's comfty. - Sat Nov 21 08:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) squeezed back against Momura, before the question was asked. She lifted her head up. "Well... I mean, their softness..their personalities...their curves." Chikyu, began to stop as she started to blush a bright red. "I just think they look absolutely lovely is all!"* - Sat Nov 21 08:05:07 2015

"My father has trained me, and even he won't teach me if he feels I'm unworthy. A master looks for not only pontential in their student, but a responsiblity to make sure they are up to the task. Once, one swings a thousand times, they can do it to ten thousand, and then go up to a hundred and so on and on. That way, when the one swing that means life and death counts... they'll be able to make it!"

She then turns to Kinami, still doing her practice swings. "If you find this tedious, then you'll find your obvious natural talent stalling. To build up one's base, is to build up your future.

"However, I learned most of my lessons not by listening to my dad but watching him."

She looks over to the girl. "My dads a master, someone I look wishing I could become someone on their level. And yet, I didn't notice that he woke up earlier then me. He continued to do the same swings that he told me to do. Just simple strikes, simple steps. You think he would've given that all up, and start focusing other things." She looks over to her. "Is your base really the best it can be? I think theres always room of improvement. A real master might not just be who the strongest is, but the one who is wise enough to recognize their mistakes. If you think a teacher is simply someone who hands out new techiniques for you. Then, you best just ask for scrolls then a person."* - Sat Nov 21 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Well how about this, let us spar and see which one of us is better. If I lose, I'll keep doing this little punches that I've been doing since I was three. - Sat Nov 21 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the girl. "Huh?" She tilted her head. "Well, I guess I'm up for a spar now. Though, its up to your master. I wouldn't want to interupt her training of you."* - Sat Nov 21 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Kinami. "My you're rude to someone willing to teach you. If they didn't care they wouldn't ask you to do anything but leave. A person whose training you, is giving you techiniques to kill and harm others. Those same techiniques can easily be turned against themselves. You should be respectful to them."

She began to wonder why Paine was teaching her. The girl did certainly have a notable physique and prowess, but is that all it took. She let out an inner sigh, as she held up her blade. <This is the first spar, I don't feel fond of. Just seems like its just to let go of aggression.> * - Sat Nov 21 17:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stood her ground as the other woman moved closer to her. She paused for a moment, thinking to herself as Kinami got into the range of her sword. <Man...how tough is she... Oh I don't know I should've asked. I guess, I could just do that, she thought to herself.> Chikyu nodding herself to the usual plan with people she didn't know how strong they were.

When, the girl pulled back her arm. Chikyu kept watch on the moving hand, as it was swung forward. The girl let go of the sword with her left, and leaving to holding the blade all to her right hand. She then used her left hand to deflect the punch, rotating her arm to the side to deflect the punch.

She then brought up her right hand clenching the handle of the sword. She then jabbed at her opponent with the handle. Attempting to slam the pommel into her opponent's throat in an attempt to stun her. If she succeeded she quickly follow up with a shoulder ram to knock her opponent on the ground.* - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched as the girl avoid her attack, knowing instantly that another was coming. She had to go full out at the moment, though she was much slower then her opponent. She atleast guess what she had in store a counter attack, using at least that knowledge she quickly switched the angle of her blade. The moment she saw her thigh begin to movee to do the kick. 

Chikyu brought her pommel down to stop the movement of the leg matching Kinami's strength with her own. However, Chikyu knew there was no way for her to hit her target who had this kind of speed. She quickly backed off taking several steps. Her sword held up in front of her like a shield if her oppoonent tried to attack Chikyu in her retreat.* - Sat Nov 21 18:30:36 2015
