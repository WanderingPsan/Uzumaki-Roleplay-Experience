Her left hand that had been holding the side of the table, begins to crack under the pressure of the hand squeezing on it.

The fibers making her dress can't seem to handle it. The entire curves shown as the material stretches to work with the mass of her breasts. When, she sees Ari looking slowly gaining some effort, she lurches back. "YOU HAVE THIS!" Then with a snap, her shirt goes all the way up revealing her two tanned breasts including her pink flesh center nubs. Lasting long enough to get a perfect view of the two orbs, before the shirt comes back down like the curtain signalling the end of an amazing show.* - Sun Nov 22 03:07:44 2015
