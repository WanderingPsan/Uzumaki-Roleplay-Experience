<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks away from the fight, really not wanting to watch it at the moment. Just focusing himself on Kida, showing him the tiger seal. "Well over all its simple. Build up chakra inside of you, and depending from how you are you can do this jutsu several ways. If you're strong enough and physically able, you can just use your chakra to push you were you want to go. If you're more like me, I coat myself in chakra to protect from the forces, and then I put the rest of the chakra in my legs. The press forward as fast, as I can. The Chakra at my legs being the driving force of my speed. " He then demonstated for the genin telling him to watch closesly.

He builds up the energy, ripples coming out of the water he stood on. The ripples almost at a rhythm to them coming in seperate beats as he built up the chakra he needed. He then vanished disappearing on to the land past the two spectators watching the fight behind them. "I suggest you do this on land... less you sink to the bottom of the lake while those two monsters fight."* - Mon Sep 14 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: .... What type of chakra...? - Mon Sep 14 23:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yep... but more importantly for now. Just make the destination obtainable... and prepare your gut. - Mon Sep 14 23:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) nods. "Build your chakra up, locate your destination, and then activate the chakra to move you forward. Three very easy steps."* - Mon Sep 14 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm...Guess I'll have another training sesson tomorrow. - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watched carefully there wasn't much to say and do besides nodding his head yes whenver the genin explained the process back to him. He then watched carefully as the genin, began to seem to get a quick grasp on the jutsu. However, when he saw him take a sudden turn for the worst. He only held out a hand of worry trying to catch someone who was already far out of his reach, as the chuunin watch the genin tumble far out. He then turned the other way, as he saw that green puffed face of ill omens coming from Kida. Hearing the unsavory expulsion of the contents of his stomach.

"Try agian... This time hole your body steady. You need to be able to support your movement physically. You also need to visualize your destination better, it will help you find balance and lean in the right direction... Instead of trying to force a change in the middle of a Shunshin."* - Tue Sep 15 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..>Any Genin here lookin to train? - Tue Sep 15 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) heard the clash of water, even finding himself turned to looking over to the fight as Koeki was now cloaked in such an intense chakra. He gasped under his breathe, <How in the world could someone have chakra that visible...it reminds me of that guy.> He said taking a quick look over to Fuji. He turned back pretty much in a trance at watching the two fight, as Tethys didn't even shake as he went to attack her. 

He didn't even break free, as Kida hit the tree until he yelled out his failure. Snapping out of it, Jin turned his head to Kida slightly flustered. "Uh yeah... just try it one more time... aim for the open field. I'm su..I'm sure you'll get it."* - Tue Sep 15 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to his new shunshin pupil, watching him as he finally got a handle on using the jutsu. His chakra flow seemed just fine for someone new to the jutsu. His energy usage could've been approved, but he looked away as he tried to physically capture himself with his bare ankles alone. Looking back to the genin cheering his victory at doing the jutsu. He then waited for just a moment, before he watched Kida fal down to the floor.

He then walked over patting him on the back. "You're now welcome to the club of the many men, that have fallen to this jutsu. And it will happen far past your mastery of it, and if you want to use it in battle... Well simple mastery isn't going to be enough." He states helping back on his legs if he accepts a offered hand. "Now... I'm going to go watch this fight." He said pointing behind him. His frown sliding downwards, as he turned.

He looked over to Tethys for a moment focusing on him for a moment. He then let out a "Hmph..." He then paused quietly, eyes darting between the combatants.* - Tue Sep 15 00:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watched the blow back of Koeki crashing into the water fall. The debris's shooting out close to a group of watchers. Doing five quick handseals as fast, as he could he leaned back chest filling with air as much as he could manage. He then blew outwards, his chakra forcing a spin on the wind coming out of his mouth. A blast of wind coming out of him to blow away as much of the debris as he could manage with his weak focus in ninjutsu. Hoping that keep as much of the people over there safe.

He then turned around slightly out of breathe, looking over to Koeki and Tethys. "This has gone too far you two! You can't be doing this in the middle of the village!" He shouted over to the sidelines, most likely to be ignored.* - Tue Sep 15 01:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a step back, arm crossing his chest as Koeki yelled back at him, just after the wind blast from her mouth just wiped out the existing clones. His chakra suimen acting on his feet in almost a reflex, feeling like he be blown away by her with ease. He cowered for a moment from the pressure, before laying his hand back to the side. A sweat dripping down his cheek, as he felt how miniscule he was once more. "Damnit, those idiots. They'll destroy the place, why worry about Zetsumo..."* - Tue Sep 15 01:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks over to exhausted Koeki. "..." he then began a quick run on the battlefield, stepping on to the water. Going out to help support Koeki.* - Tue Sep 15 01:28:32 2015

And, are you going to drop her to lead the village in the middle of battle? This isn't the time to be deciding it like this, unless you're already given up with thought of making it past this!" He shouts, the chuunin clearly frustrated with Tethys. "Beating the shit out of each other.... Making a mess and sending dangerous debris out where someone can get hurt! LOOK!" He says pointing to all the stuff he blew away into the wall. "Were you not thinking, or were you too busy worrying about when you die."* - Tue Sep 15 01:40:28 2015

He squeezed on the grey vest that was clung on his body. "If I die, then Koeki moves up, and from there is a new empty spots in the middle ranks. I need some pawn to replace it!" He shoutted. "Look at Koeki, shes completely exhausted!" Pointing her body laying on the earth. "I don't mind her taking your spot, when you get old or are unable to go on. But, you don't even seem to know your limits, and she clearly hasn't learns hers either! You Just.. YOU JUST Tried to shove it on her! With no thought about what that means, or what position to you put her in.....You come to us near death over and over! Is that the way its always been? Or is just because now, you have a replacement.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) tried to voice something, his lips parting from his mouth. But, only a dry rasp escaped from him. He couldnt' even look Tethys in the eyes. He just saw something he didn't want to see. He just looked at the dirt, before letting out a sigh. "Yeah... I get it. I guess I'm still just an emotional kid. I still think I know what I'm getting into whenever, I joined this. But each time, I'm just reminded of how little I underestimate what that means. War... battles like that." He says peaking over to the waterfall. "Still haven't broken into my thick skull."

He walks by, Tethys and his group. "I still can't just go out and say that dumb motto, of yours. Just make sure to teach my next Kage, doesn't come back to me bruised and broken every day. If you don't mind... I'm taking a break for the rest of day." He stated just keeping his head low. He didn't know really what to say anymore. If there even was anything else to say, Tethys won this hands down. 

He pulled out his radio. "Tethys and Koeki need checking up, send the usual. Near the waterfall." He said, before silencing it. When he reached the tree behind Tethys and the group. He stopped, and gave it a suimen chakra infused kick. The chakra boiling up at the bottom of his foot until the outer most layer of bark snapped. He then continued walking.* - Tue Sep 15 02:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a moment to shake his shoulders throwing off the stress from the other day. He was rathe silent, letting the cold ocean breeze flowing over him. He opens his mouth shoulders lifting up, as he opens up his chest to bring in the air inside his lungs. Feeling the breathe try to reverse its motion, the chuunin seals his lips together. Weaving several handsigns to himself, letting the chakra seek its way to the stored current of wind inside him. He then unleashes it in a spiraling typhoon of blasting wind from outside his gullet. Letting fly up in the sky pushing away the empty space until disperses losing energy from traveling too far.

Took in more air like a balloon, already holding back the air from escaping his lips. He felt the inside pressure of his body feel like it was about to pop. Preparred already to manipulate the air in his chest. He sends the chakra through the empty space, fueling the wind to move violently inside. He then unleashes the wave of wind outisde his mouth. Chakra causing it to spiral in a center that lead into a violent storm of emotions. Breaking out of his chest, and leaving out an echoing roar.

Taking in a deep long breathe, the chuuning was already weaving the seals for his next one. Chakra spiking from his abdomen into his chest. Wind whirling inside of him, pressing outwards against his body trying to find a way free. Giving it only one route of escape, the air immeaditly comes out reaching for freedom as fast as it could. Rotating in a powerful force of rejecting wind that traveled forward in a large burst.

Jin continued not feeling tired in the least bit, actually he felt completely relieved. Bringing in his chakra to push inside his body to where it needed to go. He then sucks in air chest expanding. He then pushes himself forward, air coming out in a spinning wind that spread out of the water. Taking moment to just break, letting himself question out why he was doing this. Only to shake it off.

Took a foot step back, as he put a foot down behind him. His breathe would pulling into his body the air that needed for the gust.  Handseals switching pushing his chakra to fuel the power of the air, and begins driving the speeds of the wind inside of his lungs. Cheeks inflating as the air rushes towards his mouth, and then opens up his mouth pushing outwards into the atmosphere. His body slightly jumping up and down with recovering breathes.* - Tue Sep 15 08:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) jumbled up a series of handseals feeling himself begin to feel real down. Letting his training take the place of facing his emotions. Building up chakra inside of his stomach, as he begins preparing to letting out the air of his stomach. Once he felt it was the needed amount. He then let out the blast of air, wind crashing over the waves as it pushed forward.

Pulling back his body for a moment, he filled up the chakra in his lungs. He then gave the air to give life to the jutsu that needed. Letting them mix inside of him, as he did several handseals. Each seal making a tempo to the bounding chakra inside. He then begins pursing his lips, before letting out a large wind full of tempest that thrashed across the surfaces it touched.

Giving one last infusion of wind and chakra. The chuunin pulled back, letting his chakra soak into the mixture of outside fuel and inner. Wind swirling into a thicket of uncontrollable energy. He continues until his chest expands and nothing else would seep into his nostrils. He then flips through the series of handseals. he then let go of the air and blowing across the landscape with brutal force.* - Tue Sep 15 09:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) driving the wind inside pulling in the life of the wind, and brings the atmosphere to the bottom of his lungs. His feet shuffle to the side, as he digs into the grass. Chakra boiling from the bottom of his stomach, begins to seep through the light transparent layer, with the energy seeping in. Feeding the wind what he needed to fuel itself. The genin pushing the air outside, after fufilling the needed seals. The wind breaking across the blue calm ocean, forcing to create wakes in its travel.* - Tue Sep 15 09:40:54 2015

This won't be the last time, we might face something like this...... Those two probably do know a lot more then us,..  I just get shaken up too easily.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) seperates his feet, pulling them apart and bending them slightly. He then held up a handseal outwards connecting together. "So first, you build up you chakra." He says charging the energy inside his abdomen more and more. Letting itself press into an orb, that was expanding outwards the more the strength it gains.

 "Now the way you get caught up in genjutsu, is that they enemy influences your chakra flow to your nervous system. So, by expanding the chakra you built up and sending it in a large wave through the chakra in your network. You reset the system, and clear it of any influence. So, you have to make sure its a strong pulse that can go through out your system. If you can't, you may still be locked in their genjutsu. So take a moment, and then unleashe the chakra out in one blast through your body." He says tensing up for a moment, before performing the techinique himself. The chakra traveling through his body sparks every neuron it comes in contact. The signals of his body flashing in warning, as the energy continues until it makes one complete circuit. "And, thats it. All you can hope is the jutsu saves you from there on."* - Tue Sep 15 20:40:32 2015

If she even tried to benefit from that, but otherwise it seemed that Jin had said his piece to her. Letting her handle on finding the rest out on her own, as she struggled to get even the basics right. Once she properly did the form, and seemingly did it correctly he nodded his head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continues his scribbles across the paper, as Tethys speaks. Thumb placed in the middle of the papers, holding it still for his stedy pen to continue writing on it. He waits for a moment since Tethys just seems to be getting interuptted all day, before speaking. "Well... Know where I can acquire a large sword like that to train with? The only weaponshop in Kiri, I know sells only Gezo tantos. "* - Tue Sep 15 21:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks slightly shocked, as the black blade comes out. "You sur-..." He caught himself. Tethys wasn't one for second guessing. He then looks down at the blade. "Well, still don't know how in the world to move these things." He says wrapping his two hands around it, not even kidding himself for trying it solo. He takes a moment to wrap his hands around the bar that was the handel. Fingers fidgetting autonomously. Each trying to adjust themselves, seeking to find some magical spot that be the key to unlocking the secret of wielding these massive weapons. He then attempted to pull on it again. Only for it, to not move at all.

"As to be expected." He states not out of frustration, as the curiousity showed on his face. Looking at the sword no longer as heavy block, but a curious puzzle.* - Tue Sep 15 21:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) bends his knees, feet digging the impression of his sole into the dirt. His back bends forward at first, but he changes his stance real quick going back to straightening his back and relying on his knees. His fingers reaffirm their grip on the large Zanbatou. Taking a few quick breathes, giving his body some energy. The chuunin pulls upwards trying to take himself into a standing position. His feet clamped into place, as his thigh quiver trying to change place. He leans back down failing once more. 

However, he gives it another quick attempt. Straightening himself again, and begins pulling on it again. This time however to try something new, he digs his heels into the dirt. His legs pushing diagonally backwards and up, as his hands and arms tried to just not snap while being what attached him to the blade. The chuunin continuing until the burst of energy he tried to pull out, sizzled out.* - Tue Sep 15 21:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) takes a deep breathe hanging over the blade, his shadow was barely noticed on the dark blade. Chest expanding and decreasing in a thumping rhythm as he recovers his strength. He then straights both of his legs for a moment raising himself. He then lowers himself, the bottom of his upper leg squeezing down across the muscles of his lower legs. He then begins to raise himself like he was on a crank. Upper leg jerking up till he felt he was at the right height, he then beant his body backwards behind him until his abdodmen barely hung over his bent knees. He then pulled upwards, teeth gritting as he tried to move the blade once more.* - Tue Sep 15 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) lift the blade upwards barely an inch up before his fingers slipped, letting go of the blade the moment they felt too much weight on themselves. The sting of the stretched muscles inside the extensions of his hands ached and stung. Jin waving his hand lifeless, as he tried to just wave of the pain. He then clapped his hands together trying to prepare them for the fact he was going to go at it again. 

Already crouched before the blade again. The chuunin took his hands to each side of the handel, grasping it with a firm grip. His wavered inside his sandals, as he tried to grip on to the bottom of his own shoes. He then did another pull, as he snapped his knees into action. Stressing the weight of the blade just under his torso near where his pelvis connected with both of his hips. He then angled his pull trying to drag that center of weight lower on his body. The more he raised up the more of the weight went closer to his legs. Soon the blade lifted off the earth just a hair's breadth, before he found a pause mid lift. Misplacing the weight loosening the foundation of his lever, his knees. Dropping the blade once more. * - Tue Sep 15 22:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) bent down his knees one more time, as the chuunin giving it his last shot noticing the burning in his legs. Lactic acid building up from the metabolic combustion that powered his muscles. Pulling his body back once more until he had put all the stress on his knees. Jin grabs the blade again, as it laid flat on the earth. He then began to stand up. His fingers knotting up, as they once again took all their strength wrapping around the handel. His bones clacking as he began another pull that tested their connective strength. He felt the weight o n his waist. Pulling that focus of pressure downwards, he led it down his femur as he began his lift. Body gently raising as he took his time, making sure his leverage was perfect. Raising the back of the blade up off the ground a hair's breadth. 

He paused in his hold making sure he wasn't going to let it drop again. He then drove entire weight to his knees. Which pulled upwards, their weight beiring strength coming from their stable hold on the earth. The boy continued to lift it, his eyes raising slightly as he managed to get the tip of the blade off the ground even if it was by a mere centimeters. Finding himself the ability to continue, the chuunin made a fatal mistake again. Trying to force his lift higher and without focusing on his knees. He on managed to lift it properly till the blade laid out on a plane equal to his knees. Then, passing that the boy felt the weight all on his muscles again dropping the blade once more with a very heavy "Thud" of the pure metal hitting the ground again.* - Tue Sep 15 22:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) comes over to the crushed debris of the waterfall that laid against the north wall. The rocks ranged from minuscule to enormous, though tha suited Jin just fine with what he had planned to do.  He then went about to searching through the stack of rubble. He then found the perfect one. A flat slab that was probably breaking already, and Koeki's flying body was the breaking straw.  It was about four inches thick, and was wide about his chest. Bending down on his knees, he slipped and grab the stone picking it up and holding it up to his chest.

Focusing on holding his form, he keeps his knees locked. Learning to lift various weights with the proper figure. Tried his best not to bend his arms, using purely the muscles from his legs. Bringing the minor weight of the rock on his knees. Not that it was actually difficult, but the true purpose of starting off with a light object was lifting the rock above his head. He held it there pulling the point of weight back to his knees, and then swung the rock forward. His body naturally following the  flow, while keeping his lower still the point of where his balance and hold lied. Stopping the rock swing by purely clenching on his lower body to stop any more movement .Before, lifting the rock back to the same height he would hold a sword.

He then continues trying to swing the rock over and over, taking his body into understanding the changing pressures placed on his body. His swings begins to slow down, each one gives him some chance to understand this swing. His legs bending each time at different angles trying to find which motion of his body was best for him. Learning how to concentrate the entire forces that each heavy attack would be inflicted on him. Gaining information on how to manage those forces, and take them in the best way that he possibly could. 

Continues his swipes forward, his body leaning back when he raised the rock. Hips resting on his femurs that lean on his tightened knees. He then pulls forward, his torso following with the weight. His knees flexing along with the movement stopping only short to hitting the ground. It felt good, his swings were feeling natural. The brown slade in his hand was starting to feel like it was just a pebble. Feeling completely comfortable with this amount of weight. He gave one more swing, letting go of the rock and letting it smash into the ground. The rock breaking apart into several small pieces, as Jin goes looking through the rest of stack of broken stone.

Jin shifting the rubble, finding the next step up in size of his practices. He then grabbed a near boulder like cut of rock. It was nearly double if not tripple the height of the previous slab, though keeping  the previous one's width.  Now hulking something that was the bulk of his own chest. This time though, he took pause slipping his fingers under the mass of solid earth. The chuunin just took his time, thinking on how to handle the lump of weight. Finding  the proper spot for his knees, imaginning himself as a massive leaver to be able to lift the rock.

Find his hands and the rest of himself ready to take on the rock. He begins to pull back on the rock, with his knees leaning back. His body leaning back with force, as his knees act as a fulcrum to put all the pressure of the weight. His hands and arms acting nothing more then a connection for the entire device. The energy use sufficiently to pull at the rock, however as he manages to make the rock slightly quiver. He mis-steps moving his hips too far and losing the center of his balance towards the rock. Dropping his control over it, and making him feel the complete stress of his force on his back.

Jin pulls backwards, a hands rubbing his lower back trying to ease the pain. Giving himself some time to get the feeling in his back to return. He then leaned over the miniature boulder, and lowers his knees. He attempts once more to try and move the hefty object. His body taking in deep breathes of oxygen as he finds a slight serrenity to himself. He then goes through with his lift. Watching his legs as they begin to stutter correcting them so once more he doesn't through off the delicate balance. he then manages to lift it off the ground. Just barely able to levitate it off the earth, its shadow casting over the grass as it blocks the sun. He holds it the rock slowly beginning to sway, before the chuunin can't handle much more dropping and leaving it in place for now. Sure, he can put in more work tomorrow to his form.* - Wed Sep 16 09:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watched the show of the two begin fighting, taking a sit knowing just exactly where Lera would go for a spar. He had nothing better to do, and his muscles weren't exactly in a state to be fighting with at full performance. So, he sat down cross legged watching the show. He then watched the two both summon those earth clones that everyone seemed to love <I'm already sick of them... they be a pain to deal with for myself.>, immeaditly recognizing these since hes seen both fight before. 

He turned his head watching Lera would then quickly attempted to destroy both of their works. He couldn't disagree with the descion, since the other person made five clones to her three so she might have won getting a chakra advantage out of it. However, he wondered in his head if there was some better way to have done.  Like, possibly just having one clone back off, before the rest of the clones could react to the earth flash.* - Wed Sep 16 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began watching this fight, his eyes furrowing into massive lumps of scorn and disgrace at the sight of Yan leaping trying to ride his clones for cover of the girl floating beneath the surface. On the other hand, he wanted to look at Lera who was currently fleeting underground wanting to point out she had the chance to take out his two sources of an attack with a well placed lightning jutsu. And, he also wanted to give her silent signals to not lose to Yan at any cost.

Still, he waited hoping that Lera had a plan to overcome her opponent. He then watched her reveal herself sending out two kunai with explosive tags to what he had to remind himself was a spar. He then watched her perform the jutsu he easily recognized as the great breakthrough to send out her attack. While Jin himself didn't think of it til just now, she could've thrown the tags before doing seals and when they exploded to use Great Breakthrough to compliment the fire and power of the explosion through the use of nature element properties.* - Wed Sep 16 13:24:54 2015

Well, want to go back to the main courtyard, I'm pretty sure you're tired as well for how long that battle lasted." He said leaning over to attempt to lift up Lera on to his back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) grabbing the same rock he had yesterday, the same boulder that took up more space then his chest.  Sepearted from the rest of the pile being rested in a spot all on its own. Standing behind it, he kneeled over bending down before pulling back with his body. The weight of the boulder were pressed on his knees, as he pulled back slowly raising the boulder off the ground. The dirt and dust lying on the bottom of the rock, began to fall down in a rain of brown. 

Raising his body in behind movement, he continue to lift the boulder higher. Taking his time to make sure the weight was properly weight forced into his legs. The lift gave height to the boulder until it was held to his  waist. He took a few moments, resting in his stance suspending the stone in the air as his arms still clung to it. Jin's chest took deep breathes, as he continued to hold the rock with most of his exhaustion coming from concentration. Preparing his body to hold such large swords with the form that Tethys spoke about was difficult, especially changing how he usually lifted such hefty objects. 

Jin after his pause continued raising the roughed stone orb. He had no intentions to lift it over his head like he did the other, if he dropped it he surely be dead. And the chances of that happening were far too high, so he only continued working his body slowly cranking up the rock inch by inch. Soon his arms were held up in front of him. The orb of stone was now held out in front of his chest. His hips holding straight, femure pressed on to his knee which trembled as it carried most of the massive weight. The chuunin continued to raise the heavy weight until his arms were held at an higher angle before swinging down the chunk of earth. Attempting to put it in a swing, only to have his hands slip mid way and releasing the weight until it crashed into the earth.

Bending over his new training tool, the chuunin once again began raising it. Bending his knees, and letting the weight travel down his spine to his legs. Bending himself backwards, he rose the stone off the sunken flat it made when it impacted the earth. The skins of his fingers bruising and callusing as it rubbed up again the uncut stone. Raising back to diagonally upwards in front of him. Arms curling to hold the object more firmly, he then swung downwards a breeze coming out of the object pushing aside the air itself.

Continued bringing the rock up with a slow pace, making sure his body was bending just the way it needed to. His entire body trying to accomodate such a large mass, and then force that mass to do its bidding. Bringing it up in front of him again, he gave it another rough throw downwards stopping its movement just barely it crushed his fingers. He then took to raising it back to the position it started in. Doing this several times the chuunin continued until finally not having the strenght to make it anymore, gave one more swing and unleashing the stone to slam into the ground again.* - Thu Sep 17 07:52:32 2015
