<br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls out three shuriken holding two in between his fingers in one hand, and on the other he holds one. He takes a few moment to take his chakra, and push it down the slope of his arms into his hands. Trapping spiritual energies into his outer extremities. He moved it towards the cold steel, fingers leaking the energy of the chakra into the three blades. He then pulled back both of his hands, and flung the shuriken. The two in his right hand go flying off straight, as the other begins to cover. The wind chakra successfully trapped inside flows with in pushing the steel to ride along a chakra blast of winder. Sending it curving into one large arc turning completely in the opposite direction it was flown until it embedded itself into the bark of a tree.* - Sun Aug 30 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) tugging the shuriken out of the wood, and running over to pick up the other two that landed sideways on the dirt. Placing them back into their original holds in his hands, he concentrates chakra once more into the lines of steel. Trying his best attempt to successfuly use the weapons as containers for his energies. However, dividing his chakra into each and trying to control them all at once was a difficult issue, as he threw them all out once more. All of them went flying, and even curving as a burst of wind chakra blew up to their side pushing them to the right. However, the energy each three were too small to do anything more then a long curve to the side. No matter how many attempts he did to activate more of the chakra. All of them then sank lower and lower as the kinetic energy was no longer enough to make them travel.* - Sun Aug 30 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) retrieving his lost shuriken once again, the genin began to inject his energy into the projectiles once more. Sending them off with a buzz as they slicing the air as they spun. Holding out his hand, and pointing with two of his fingers. Her directed them to go towards the tree. One shuriken quickly shown it had no control at all, as it flew off forwards. The other two began to move. However, the wind chakra inside both was hard to direct. Causing them to waver greatly losing power and momentum. The genin tried to find them a balance, as wind blasted up and down from them to find the perfect amount to get them going straight. Only to run out of chakra inside both, causing them to slam down on the grass.* - Sun Aug 30 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) let out a few exhausted breathes, he began to remember the work of using so much chakra consistantly. His injuries after the chuunin exams had put him in the hospital for quite some time, and even in the exams he never expanded much chakra. Now to go back to it was difficult but something he wouldn't let eat into him. He needed to get stronger and force himself to get better as proven by his loss in the exam. Now even being reminded of that made, the genin whip his out to throw his shuriken outwards. His chakra bursting out through each of them sending them off course, and in unpredicatable directions like shrapnel from a explosion. He had to abandon them unable to see any of them in the distance.* - Sun Aug 30 18:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a misstep, as more of energy was pulled outside of his body. The outburst wasn't nesscary and only wasted more chakra then it should've used. Pulling himself up and calming down after that sudden expression of his turbullent emotion. Getting three brand new shuriken out of his pack, as he took holding him them once more attempting to fuel his planned movements for them with chakra. Noticing they been too little. He tried to overload each of the shuriken with more chakra, taking longer to make sure more of his chakra efficiently traveled inside and kept stay inside of it. When he felt that they couldn't contain any more, he let all the shuriken flying. This time two of them actually kept their path and moved with little more then teh whim's of their owners. However, the third once still seemed to be issue as it fluttered and only felt the push of the wind lightly until it destablized and hit nothing once again.* - Sun Aug 30 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continues his training, draining more energy out of his body as he prepares the next set of shuriken. The wind chakra swirling inside of each could be felt, as they shifted up against his fingers digging into the skin between the spots they were held. Now sure he was fully prepared to control all of them at once. He chucked them one followed by the other two. Each shuriken began zipping around gyroscoping as the wind took helm of their control. Trying to use them for simple turns, he once again made them go in arc at the trees. They went on command flying towards it. One thunk could be heard as the other two zipped past their target embedding into the sand and bouncing off rocks.* - Sun Aug 30 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) wiping off the sand, and letting out a sigh at his chipped shurriken that hit a rock that was just too tough. He picks up the shuriken once more, wielding all three. Once more letting them begin to flutter like a paper in the wind, before letting them all loose. He tries to coordinate each of them back towards the tree hes been aiming for this entire time. However, they all come dangerous close to each other, and as the winds powering them collide they get thrown off course requiring more energy to set them back in flight. However, this weakened the speed of the shuriken making them all bounce off the bark unable to even leave a scratch.* - Sun Aug 30 20:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) grabbing the pile of lifeless shuriken. Jin already began feeding them more of his energy filling them with his chakra, until they began to show sparks of life with juttering movements as the power of wind escaped from the natural energy inside. He then let them zoom in the air, getting more control with them by letting them fly in place this time. Pushing them all towards one direction at once, before changing to the opposite direction. Getting to control them in a group, to be perfect synch before individuall controlling them.* - Sun Aug 30 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) can't see the small girl, and her cardboard poster since its behind a big statue.* - Sun Aug 30 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) now can see.* - Sun Aug 30 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) sits on top of the mountain that rose behind the Mizukage's mansion. He looked around noticing even it was surrounded all around by the walls of the  village, trapped and confined. Letting out a sigh, at the sudden revelation he turned his head to focus on his current work continuing his training he had left yesterday. 

Pulling his three shurikken out the same chipped and dull edged ones he had used the other day. He began doing the handseals to gather chakra before placing  his hands on each, letting his energy diffuse into the steel that carried none on its own. Soon each of the three iron stars began to lift themselves up on command. Chakra channeling the wind beneath them to raise upwards. Until they flew about chest level for the sitting genin. He then began ordering them to move, trying to make each travel by command. At first making them go forwards, until they reach the edge of the mountain top and pulling them back to himself which he did slowly so he didn't accidently hit himself. Each of them wavered in their task, taking variations as natural wind changed their course. Readjusting one while keeping the other three straight was extremely difficult resulting in all of them being pushed off the path they should've taken until the jutsu effects died out.* - Tue Sep 01 02:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) moving the shuriken back into positions, he repeated the jutsu preperations sending them buzzing off in the air. He could feel his control slightly improve, but controlling three different objects in the air was a balancing act fit more for a circus then battle. One would dip out to the right, which means it had to manifest a rising draft. All while not accidently starting off the others wind chakra, or sending to far up that it crash. The others would face wind or debris that blow along slowing them down or quickening them up. Timing becoming an issue as each landed in front of him at different times. This wasn't even the most difficult part of the training as to when he would have to send them out on their own tasks at once.* - Tue Sep 01 02:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) chakra storage draining ooutwards once more out of his body. The out of body energy is sealing the energy into the chakra. The ninja tools began to rise lightly, as he comanded them to pull themselves upwards. The invisible strings of wind taking hold, and taking them across the stage of Jin's training. Using both his hands, he began to orchestrate the movement and dance of the blades. Having them this time go outwards and spin in circles. He tried to keep them up at the same height, going at the same speed, and on the same rhythm of their bobing up and down. Of course, this wasn't as easy as it was explain with each facing their own troubles. Still, the genin atleast managed to keep up with the troublesome task bringing them back to his lap.* - Tue Sep 01 04:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Tethys as he announced the sudden battle that was going to happen with a large amount of shinobi at the front. He wondered how it was possible he didn't hear about it now. But, his other passing thought was what happens is Kirigakure loses. How much power in force will they lose, and does this mean their might be enemy forces that may bound for here after Suna.* - Wed Sep 02 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) travelled back to his training spot on top of the mountain just behind the kage's mansion. He had just heard the news about the sudden reinforcement of the Suna forces by Kiri troops. It was rather troubling for the genin, who was still moping after his own loss in the chuunin exams. He only went to do what he knew he could do. Placing the three metal weapons in front of him, he began practicing his rotating shuriken jutsu. 

He wasn't one for discussion, even though right now he feel like he scald anyone who dare come close. His chakra flow was uneasy no smooth transistion from his own his own body to the metal. The genin took much longer to prepare the shuriken for the jutsu, his mental state making him slip the memories of previous experience. Once they were finished, he tried to make them lift off which they did. But, it looked like they suffered the same heavy weight resting on Jin's mind as well. Slowly dipping closer and closer till they fell to the ground.* - Wed Sep 02 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) grunts grabbing the shurikens and forcing his chakra forcefully down into them. <How many days has it been since I started working on these jutsus... Damnit... Its taking too long.> His chakra pressuring itself through his arms gripped. Muscles clenching on the vessels that the chakra flows through, before it comes out of a hiss into the shuriken. <And no jounin to teach me... God damnit! I should've asked the old man to do help me!> In a clap of his hands, as they formed a seal. The shurikens bursted off the ground, his anger causing an volatile blast air out of the shuriken. Each blasting off in different directions, one actually piercing the genin in the upper arm as the others embedd themselves into the earth.

The genin fouled his mouth with a long list of curses out of his breathe. Hand grabbing the shuriken. Pulling it back and forth the blade only stinging his nerves to a high pitch call into his mind. When, he finally pulled out the weapon. The boy let out a loud howl of pain as his own blood dripped from one of the points of the shuriken and down the length of his wounded limb. "FUCK!" He shouted throwing the blade on to the earth that let out a metallic ding as it hit.* - Wed Sep 02 22:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulled off the headband and wrapped it around his bleeding wound to give it some protection for the moment. He then continued slightly careful on cutting himself again, as he gathered up the shuriken including the bloody one. He then pressed his hands on each of the shuriken filling them with chakra. Trying to hold back his emotions, but the stinging pain of the small would felt like an inferno to the already charged kid. It wasn't a surprised that his personality once again led the shuriken breaking from his control... or lack of it. Outwards though with less chakra they were much less dangerous. Giving light cuts to his hands and cheek as they passed by.* - Wed Sep 02 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) gave the shuriken another taste of his chakra, his breathing sounding more like angry huffs. The stinging red lines that broke the white of his skin now calmed down more then the wound. Both came from his foolishness, and he still didn't feel fit to continue training. However, his own nagging pride told him to continue. He formed a seal levitating the shuriken off the ground finally taking to spinning in the air. He closed one eye while keeping the other open, each shuriken danced as if on a thin pole. Trying to balance themselves to stay up. Each burst of wind in attempt to keep them up, was radical and too strong sending the shuriken too far off. Thus like a line of falling dominos each burst of wind required another to fix it only for it to need another to balance it. Soon each shuriken lost their chakra quickly falling lifeless.* - Wed Sep 02 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a few breathes to recover himself with fresh air in his chest. Already feeling the exhaustion from his energetic outbursts. His arms extended his headband still tied over his arm being stained lightly stained with a red spot. Ignoring the searing of his own wound. The boy sent the shuriken flying once again, surprisingly keeping them more aerodynamically sound. However, his control over them was still flawed, as he found it difficult to even send them in circles with the burning fumes left in his mind. Realizing hes probably stunted himself with his own irrationality he decided to put to rest the training for today. The shurikens spinning slower and slower until they wobble out of the air.* - Wed Sep 02 23:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) noticably flinched when he heard sparring.* - Thu Sep 03 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) placed his hands together, fingers locking together to form a seal. Channeling his chakra into his hands, he concentrates gathering and forming the energy into wind nature. Slidding out the shuriken, while holding them he poured the amount equally into the metal weapons. Curling his wrists back, before snapping them forward the grey stars flying meters ahead until he took control. The projectile blades spinning in place as he held them still. Waving two fingers held together in a curve. He made the blades follow, his fingers going into a figure eight. The shuriken seemed to have steadied along with Jin's mindset. He then eased them at a snail's pace back to himself until he grabbed each out of the air. The results were showing it was best to let himself take a break after yesterday.* - Fri Sep 04 11:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) launching off another set of wind infused shuriken, he send them on his own control. Giving a few runs of them in circles, letting himself get a better grasp. He then took a breathe, attempting to send two off in one direction and the last one in another.  Eyes darted back and forth between the three flying shuriken managing each one's position and chakra flow. Winds pushing out them all in differing ways, as he attempted to fix each one into a straight path. He then gritted his teeth as he mentally attempted to curve each one of them back towards him. However, all three go down at once curving in the wrong direction into the dirt. * - Fri Sep 04 12:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) throws out the shuriken once more, sending them outwards with wind chakra. Their wind powered rotations blowing up the smallest dust, as they are forced to halt in their forward movement. Seperating the three shuriken in two groups. He sends them outwards in opposite directions. Hands and arms spread out in eagle style point towards to one group of shuriken each. His limbs trembled as he tried to keep both groups balanced. Trying to control their movements just making go snail pace forwards and backwards. Keeping debris from throwing each shuriken off course, or letting one lose pace with others. However, just after two and a half laps. Jin's arms folded downards the precise control he had done with his mind was a mental exhaustion. Keeping track with the chakra of not only shuriken but within himself as well.* - Fri Sep 04 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watches as he sends out the buzzing wind powered shuriken again. Body and mind calming, as he takes complete focus on controlling the flying pieces of metal.  Arms and hands outstretched giving more a physical control to the jutsu, as he waves them in the direction he wished for them to go. His chakra draining by the moment, as he gave the commands to drive the shuriken forward in his control, giviing small attempts to curve their movements. Which he instantly noticed the difficulty this would be if he tried this while in a fight or just even barely at higher speeds. Taking most of his concentration not to send them all spirialing to the earth and return back to him.* - Fri Sep 04 18:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) sat down for moment a few deep breathes escaping from the bottom of his lungs. Draining out his chakra into the steel, he throws out the metal stars once again. Quickly taking the reins and dividing them up into two spinning groups. Controlling them from his seated position, he began rotating them around him. Slowly at first, like silver ravens circling a pontential prey to scavenge. Only to fasten their speed with each successful rotation.

Their speed soon comes out a high pitched buzz, as they whiff around Jin. Each crank in speed made loss in control, the genin brow furrowed in concentration. Giving each shuriken more attention in their balance and how they made their turns. Sharpening their movements in each turn, breathes in between the spikes in his brain as thoughts of improving the jutsu glimpse by in his mind. However, once he reached the limits of his speed. The shuriken quickly began much harder to control, as their own air resistance became a difficult venture to fix especially for three shuriken in flight.

Jin did everything thing he could trying to slow them then fix up their speed. Burst of wind to try and balance the downward pull of gravity. However, his skill and slowly draining chakra from the blades wasn't enough. All quickly falling away from their tracks. Being shot off away from the genin, like a asteroid falling out of orbit. Crashing in the far distances at angles that reminded Jin not to do this in public places.* - Fri Sep 04 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) this time instead of sending out all three shuriken. Jin threw out one with the chakra embedded inside of it. He then sent it off side to side, going back and forth at top speed. His eyes watching its movements and how the air effect it. Making mental note of everything he did to control the shuriken even as it faced outward effects of the enviroment. He then began to put on a display show out of his shuriken. Making it do all manners of raising alittude to sudden dives. Spinning it in diffiferent directions, making it do figure eights, and even rotating itself while traveling. His eyes just marked on the shuriken, and his brain wired to completely the control of the metal star. Wearing the jutsu thin until all the chakra was used from the shuriken.* - Fri Sep 04 19:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) leaning down to recover his energy after such a long training session. Jin decided to give his last jutsu to still understanding the movement of a shuriken. Just sitting back playing with his shuriken, just letting it fly while he gained more of a handle on just controlling aerodynamics with one then attempting it with concentrating on two other shuriken. He didn't have any sort of list of movements he wanted, he just did whatever thought passed his mind and commanded the shuriken to follow. It was rather laxing task, letting him sit back and ease just watching the blade then putting too much mental energy into it. Being able to continue until he finally bored playing with the shuriken.* - Fri Sep 04 19:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over as Mizumi moved over to go sit to watch the spar going on behind him. His head then turned back, thinking for a moment if he wished Elon was here. They could do a mission or maybe train as a team with him around. On the other hand, as he rubbed his forearm fingers going over the bump of a bandage  that went tightly around his arm. <I don't feel like hanging out or doing much with the squad. Even if it be a good distraction from training.>* - Sat Sep 05 00:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) hands Mizumi some popcorn to throw at Violet and Kubo for the disappointing show. (omit)* - Sat Sep 05 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) moved over closure to get a better view. He looked over to Tethys, letting out a "hmph." under his breathe. Before, he turned to look over Violet and her weaponry. His handgoing back touching his own blade that hanged on his back.* - Sat Sep 05 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continued to attempt to watch th fight, as Hogo stepped in front of his field of vision in his side step. He then watch the quick tap on her head, and the advice handed to her. Which she was quick to respond to, already making her next movement.<I was hoping to watch something to pick up some moves with swords. But, her dual style is way off from one handing... and besides that. I don't think Tethys is really a good opponent to fight with basic moves. What a waste.>* - Sat Sep 05 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) raised a brow as Tethys finally pulled out his blade. His eyes fell on the blade and the hand holding it. Watching how Tethys controlled his blade and how he stood with it when fighting someone. The genin doubted he get a full list of moves or stances to take off of him. But, still he hoped maybe a more skilled sword user could still give him a few tips just by watching his style.* - Sat Sep 05 02:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watched as Tethys put away his tanto. The moment the smoke cleared and the black blade showed up. Jin collapsed backwards on the ground, with a low groan coming out of his parted lips. He was done watching this fight. Not because there wasn't more to see, or that he thought it was instantly over. Just bad memories came into his mind, killinig any clarity he currently had of trying to learn by watching.* - Sat Sep 05 03:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) taking a break from his shuriken training. The genin began to focus on a training that he had left behind a long time ago. Now bringing it back up feeling ready for it. Gripping his hands together, he holds out the tiger seal with both pointer and middle fingers held up. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke appearing in a few meters in front of him facing the opposite direction. He then does a quick kick, before forming the tiger seal once more. He attempts to quickly charge his chakra for the jutsu again.... Only for himself to barely travel a few feet to the right. Nowhere near where he wished to travel.* - Sat Sep 05 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) charging his chakra for another attempt at Body Flicker. He launched another quick release of his jutsu, body disappearing out of sight with a 'poof'. He then appeared meters forward still facing the same direction. His body was posed on all fours. He then lift up his left leg, attacking straight up in a upwards motion that would hit someone in their chest or chin if small enough. He then quickly placed back his hands in the form of tiger seal. Not only was the issue of quickly attacking, but the physical trauma and precision required for shunshin was difficult to quickly regain. Especailly, difficult to do in the small frame that an opponent leaves themselves open after an attack.

Still the genin tried his best to force out the jutsu, applying the chakra as fast as he could around his body and legs. The genin disappeared in a successful smoke cloud. However, he came out less then successful as he appeared traveling forward on the dirt. Heels digging into the soil trying to slow the momentum that came from his jutsu. His torso shoving itself forward, as he came to a hault. Jin leaned down on his knees, a hand covering his stomach which was suffering the same motion sickness only a novice at shunshin would suffer. Possibly because of the quick succession use of the jutsu.* - Sat Sep 05 18:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulling himself up, his stomach finally calming itself. He decided that the true problem is that hes not able to truly pull out the jutsu in quick and correct fashion. Forming the seal, the genin charged up his chakra concentration on just performing multip shunshins in the row. To keep it simple, he only jumped forward in small amounts. His first poof takes him only a few feet ahead. He then sits waiting as he focuses performing another flicker jutsu letting take as long as he needed to perform it perfectly. As he vanishes and reappears, he marks the time he did so. Nodding to himself, as he formed a seal he now knew what time he had to begin to shave down to start using shunshin perfectly in battle.* - Sat Sep 05 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) disappeared into the smoke, the grass crunching as he dashed off in chakra enchanced speeds. Appearing instantly a few feet in the open grass land, he then quickly clenched that tiger seal. He forced the spread of his chakra out over him, and layer of invisible blue aura cloaking him in a protective force. The moment he felt his chakra set for his next body flicker. Passing under the cover of a cloud, he found himself successful moving forward once more. His time shaved was a mere second. But, it was a sign he could improve his speed at doing this jutsu.* - Sat Sep 05 21:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) charging his chakra once more to his legs and thorugh out his body. The boy disappeared once more with Shunshin. Landing back into his form of holding the tiger seal. The moment he broke of the velocity of the jutsu, and reached to a stop. He was already charging the next jump forward with another body flicker jutsu. His body clenched in on itself, fortifying for the next shock of the sudden movment. His teeth rattling as he clenched, and forced his jutsu to activate. His body would've lurched forward again if he wasn't prepared. The moment he moved, he knew he had activated too soon. Jumping off course, and feeling his mind already groggy from his balance being thrown so far off.* - Sat Sep 05 21:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) starts his training on the Body Flicker jutsu again. Holding the tiger seal, chakra seething around his body and running through his legs thick and viscous as blood. Activating burning through his chakra, he vanishes in a plume of smoke appearing farther in the grass within a blink of an eye. His body coming out in the same form, as he holds on to the tiger seal already refocusing his chakra. In another flash he teleports again. Sliding through the blades, tearing them out of their roots from the soil as he comes to a stop. He leans over cursing out of short breathe "Damn..." His head turning back looking behind him, to the spot he meant to come out. He had traveled to the wrong spot again.* - Sun Sep 06 05:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) was already quick to attempt another disappearence right after he appeared. His own chakra was wavering inside, as he tries to regain control of his own varying chakra. His own body trying to find itself after shifting at such high speeds across the empty space. It wasn't more then a moment's thought, that the genin was tugged along his jutsu. Dragging him diagnolly and definatelly not the direction he wished to go. Noticing where he found himself, he attempted to continue his movement in a hopeless attempt to get used to the pressure of continous instant movement.

Another puff of smoke, had him come out in the opposite direction of his previous movement he comes out. His body lands on all fours, hands clenching the grass and knees imprinting two small cricles into the grass. The boy holds back his gurgling stomach that wanted to remove all its contents that had been hitting his abdominal wall. The boy was curled on the ground, and continued to stay until his mind and stomach found peace after minutes of unending illness.* - Sun Sep 06 06:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) putting back into the pieces of his body and mind. He already lurchs back on his two feet, as he holds up his clenched hands forming the seal. Chakra filling up on his body, as he calmly reclaims his normal timing for the Shunshin jutsu. Taking his time with rhythmic breathes, before he fades in and back out of his high speed state. Then, he takes a pause as he does another successful use of the shunshin not rushing it. Speeding in a flash twenty feet forward. Standing up and taking a few breathes. <I wonder... how else I can shave time. Forcing myself leads me to sickness. Cutting time and energy in my jutsu use, isn't going to get me fast enough that it matters. Well... still training and getting closer to my goal is better then getting close to emptying my stomach by forcing multiple uses.>* - Sun Sep 06 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began a slow acceptance that this would take much longer then he hoped. Even, though he felt confident enough to do it. Physical and Chakra levels weren't going to take away the need to train such a skill. So he let out a compressed sigh, as he formed his seals again. Thinking over each step of using shunshin multiple times. His  body fading away in the debris of smoke that came from using the jutsu, until he appeared behind where he was turned around. He then waited building his chakra to the right levels, marking this point he was ready to do the jutsu. Then, preparing himself as he was launched forward again. Landing in his intended goal on the dot.* - Sun Sep 06 06:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) giving it his last shot feeling his chakra was near depleted. He gives out a last burst of chakra over his body, and disappears going into his flickered state. Appearing ten feet away letting himself once again get his feelings and mental state of such fast movement. Waiting to be prepared again, the genin travels as soon as he could without repricussions comming out with a clenched chest and uneasy stomach just from going a bit too quickly. Still, the genin is able to brush it off unlike the previous knotted stomach and dizzy brain.* - Sun Sep 06 07:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) brows furrow slightly, and his eyes slant clearly displeased about being brought up the Chuunin exams again.* - Sun Sep 06 07:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) if looked closesly, is covered in a bunch of small cuts and a bandage on his shoulder. He also looks a bit green in the face like he was slightly ill.* - Sun Sep 06 07:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) wondered how many dumb wars they were going to get involved in.* - Sun Sep 06 21:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) gave one last look at the Mizukage, as he came back grinning like a fool making a bad joke that only he found funny. His collapse had no effect on Jin, because... honestly he thought this would be the outcome for any time he came back from battle. As the other two girls rushed to the kage's side, he just took his time to watch over his treatment. Doubting that he was really any true threat of dying now that he was found in at least one's medic hands. Though, he did hope they remove him off the dirty ground soon before his wounds got infected. * - Mon Sep 07 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls out a very full bag in the shape of a black dog head, the row of teeth it beared was actually clamped together to form the seal. Opening it up, he put in a large amount of yen, before clamping it back shut. He then smacked the water button on the vending machine several times. Letting them all drop out before bringing them over next to Tethys.* - Mon Sep 07 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) drops ten water bottles.* - Mon Sep 07 00:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks at that crashing sound of some kicking the machine, as he drops his water bottles. He then looks back to see a destroyed vending machine. He thinks to himself <My fucking god this village.>* - Mon Sep 07 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) gripped his forehead taking a moment to just glance over the situation. Taking a look at the rather beaten up Tethys. <Jeez... I sort of don't want to know what hes been through but...> "Mind telling us what happened... to you. Seems things...didn't go well even if you say mission completed." * - Mon Sep 07 01:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) raises a hand lifting up four. "Well that means three are left. Which sounds like we did get a quite the boost in power if they are as strong as you say they are... but still..." he paused thinking about the numbers lost. A frown going across his face, more then the normal lowered corners of his general annoyance. <How many more battles, and how many numbers can you keep throwing at a guy that is Tethys's weakness... Pure luck is the only reasoned he survived.> he thought for a moment.* - Mon Sep 07 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) He then throws three jutsu scrolls, over to Hogo. "For the vault, Shunshin jutsu. I did it yesterday while I was training myself."* - Mon Sep 07 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) begins walking away, waving a hand. "Well since you're not kicking the bucket. I'm gonna go back to training."* - Mon Sep 07 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holding both his hands together, the genin starts off slow remember how forcing his jutsu worked out last time. His stomach gurgling at the mere idea of being thrown around inside of him. Buidling up his chakra, the boy activates his jutsu vanishing in thin air. His body tugged in a tunnel of speed he appears standing already in stance, a circle of dust escaping around his feet after his stop. Releasing a breathe from his chest, he waits for a period to recuperate from the transport. Once he did, the pause quite some time taking almost a full minute. He then vanishes once more sliding to another quick hault as he stops.* - Mon Sep 07 01:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) turning around in his spot, he basically plotted out his course back to where he started from. Tiger seal already building out his storage of chakra inside of his stomach. He then expanded the chakra around his body and then built it inside his legs. He then vanishes in a tunnel of blurring speeds, as he comes out it where he last jumped too. Trying his hardest to pump his chakra faster through his body, attempting to thin the chakra he needed to protect and propel him. However, his concentration on doing something new and untrained took as much time as his previous jumps. Landing back over to the starting point of his training.* - Mon Sep 07 02:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) taking a breathe, he once against casts his shunshin jutsu. His body transporting through the grass the marks of his movmeent nothing more then tracks of trampeled grass. He then once again attempted to modify his transportation to require less prepartion. Taking shortcuts on his own protection and forcing fast a larger amount of chakra in his legs to push him. He then activates the jutsu, shaving seven seconds as he actually successfully managed to land in the right spot. Only feeling some slight discomfort in his abdomen. * - Mon Sep 07 02:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) attempted to do his trick once more properly preparing to do his first Shunshin jutsu. Once more doing the high speed transportation. He clenched his teeth already drawing his own energy to cast the next jutsu. His thin wall of chakra slowly building up around his body, before rushing the charged chakra in his legs. He once more disappeared without a hitch and even managed to make ti across. However, when he finally regained himself from the high speed launch. He keeled over feeling a tight knot in his abdomen. He had shaved more time off of his jump, but also left more of himself exposed to the high speed leaving to  greater injury then just slight discomfort. Walking close to a tree near by, he found this the perfect time to take a quick rest.* - Mon Sep 07 02:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) rested his head on the back of the cool bark, that had been unheated thanks to its cover by the great leafs that spread out over the area. He took a few heavy breathes, as he recovered his chakra. A slight groan from the pain in his muscles aching from the pressure of the incomplete shunshin jutsu. The genin then began to think over his previous attempts. <If I force the jump too quickly, I can't even stand up let alone throw a punch and follow it up. If I lower the amount of chakra and charge time, I get faster but I also suffer side effects if I make a mistake. A even higher grade of mastery just seems the jump point.>

He looks at the leaves above him. Letting the peace of this moment help clearing his thoughts, that began to run in on himself. <Preparing my chakra takes too long... but... maybe. I can pre-prepare it... and I master knowing how to reach the bare needs of the jutsu. The quickest way to accomplish that bare needs. I can shave enough time to do it instantly.> He then stretches up off his place believing he has rested more then enough.* - Mon Sep 07 02:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) <Okay now... how to do this...> He said inside his head to himself. A rather big question, as he begins clamping his tiger seal together. Chakra rising as it sits at the peak of cataclysm, ready to perform the jutsu the moment he wished. He stood for a while, before deciding the closest thing out of his three goals he wished to obtain to complete his flicker training was lowering the needs of the jutsu. The other two, preparing his chakra and understanding how he could reach those bare essantials were secondary. Preparing his chakra he had no clue how to go about, and finding short cuts first needs him to know what amount of chakra he needed for bare needs anyways.

Taking a heavy exhale, the boy then lowered his chakra. Thinning his veil to half the thickness as he usually did, and prepared the chakra in his legs. Before stopping and thinking for a moment, he then estimated the distance he wished to move to. He then cut down the chakra in his legs to just the nesscary amount to travel as far as he wished. He then sat in this state for a moment making sure everything was correct before vanishing. He came out just where he needed feeling his body was almost completely emptied of chakra and not a single ounce of pain.

Pulling out his stores of chakra he once again, tried to reach that divine balanced state of the base resources he need. Cloaking himself in the same level chakra, and pumping his legs only to the amount he thought was needed. Before he vanished once more, this time he came out flying. His legs just missing the needed amount to actually help him stop, as he hit under the mark. He then crashed knees and lower scrapping as it hit the hard ground.* - Mon Sep 07 02:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stumbled back up, he himself noting how low on chakra he was able to pull out just another set. Nails digging into the back of his hands, as he hold up the tiger seal. His skin red by how hard he clamped, blood pulling in small amounts just to be noticed as it cuts off. Letting himself reach his state of lowest rquirements. He then let himself burst off in high speeds coming out once more, and already flowing his chakra into his body. Feeling that he obtained just the right amount he flashed out of existance once more. When he came back into normal human sight, he was on his knees head raised and body sitting straight up. His body gasping for air, and recovering itself from the knotting musclees of his jutsu.* - Mon Sep 07 02:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) comes into the courtyard of the Kirigakure mansion. His body and clothes roughed up with dirt and grass marks going all the way up his pants. His mouth his panting loudly, as he comes back up to the vending machine only to realise that this was same one beaten up by Kubo. "GOD DAMNIT!" He says as he fails to get it to work, smashing his head into the machine until a single bottle of water drops out. <Oh thank god...> he doesn't say the words, as he downs the refreshing H2O.* - Mon Sep 07 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) ccomes back from his own workout with Shunshin jutsu, as he gingerly nibbles on to a bread bun. His other hand quickly holding itself over his lips, as they pucker the lurch from his stomach for taking more then just water was reminding him how troublesome it was to abuse the jutsu. He then looked up noticing Hogo, standing around actually working on his own jutsu. Getting a slight chuckle, as he notices the green effects from the jutsu just by his posture alone.

The genin takes a seat watching how someone else did the jutsu.* - Mon Sep 07 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holds back a slight laugh, as his cheeks inflate holding back his automatic exhale until it came out as a low sigh. He remember those days of getting sick just by doing one, he now got to watch someone else do it. He wondered how long it take the advanced shinobi to master the jutsu. It took him a few days, still whatever time it took for him. Jin was sure he be waking up with a bad headache tomorrow.* - Mon Sep 07 03:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continues to watch finally able to now handle his food, swallowing down the last of the bread. Though, it was still rather uneasy as it hit the bottom of his stomach. Besides that, watching Tethys really displayed their difference in physical abilities and styles. Tethys was much more brute force about his use of the jutsu, while Jin himself especially after recent training has taken it all to efficiency. He also noted how much tenser his body was taking all the forces of the jutsu, with locked joints and taking it straight to the trunk of his abdomen. * - Mon Sep 07 03:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stood up, as he noticed his little stumble, as he recovered from his body flicker. The genin walked over announcing his prescense if Tethys didn't already notice him. "You okay over there?" He calls out, as he gets closer he states "Maybe it was a bad idea to start training, after just fighting off near death." He said, offering to help Tethys steady himself.* - Mon Sep 07 04:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) actually begins to slant, as he feels the extra weight hit him. His dirtied jeans covered in grass and dirt bend in the direction with his knees, as he tries to stabalize him and the Hogo. He remarks as he finally catches himself "Clearly just as well as yours."* - Mon Sep 07 04:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) nodded. "Wait until you try doing it multiple times...in a row." He shivered, before heading back to the Main Square.* - Mon Sep 07 04:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks over and examines the Hiramekarei, and just shakes his head at it silently. <How in the world does anybody use these things?> He says, before glancing over to the Kabutowari with a clear face of absolute disgust for the axe and over sized hammer. * - Mon Sep 07 04:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked up as well. <Teacher? Hmm... another element as well. Jeez, the only wind user is the depressing old man and fellow genin.>* - Mon Sep 07 04:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks at the double handed sword with a questioning gaze. "You sure...? Its pretty huge and I don't know whats the deal with the chained handles." * - Mon Sep 07 05:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) watches Hogo wielding the sword so lightly, and quickly gives that to the fact that Tethys is a physical monster.* - Mon Sep 07 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls out his cpr license . "Class moto was, better off injured then dead."* - Mon Sep 07 06:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) (Well the issue becomes, how much does gates take to train and what it does to the body)* - Mon Sep 07 09:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Remember what we talked about Lera? About relationships.? - Mon Sep 07 12:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stands near people, since he is also a lonely nigga. But unlike Kubo, he deals with it.* - Mon Sep 07 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began to dip chakra into his shuriken filling them with his chakra. Pulling up a seal, he made all rise, as a typhoon of wind slow spun raising them up. The air continued to go through the vortex made by the chakra of the shuriken, swirling downards as it got close until they raised to an appropriate height. There the wind switched to make a level area for them sit on. 

Swinging his hands out he began to manipulate the shuriken to move. He had taken pause in his training for mastering his body flicker. So here, he let himself get back in use to controlling these metal stars. Shurikens leaning to the side, as they sudddenly bursted forward with blasts of air proppelling them forward. Until they drive at high speeds in cricles until he finally lets them rest.* - Mon Sep 07 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) refilled the shuriken blades with more chakra so they could continue under his control. Seperating the shurikens in to two groups. Giving the lone shuriken flying on its own several advanced moves, letting itself corkscrew through the air and climbing up and down. The other two continue on a set track. The gening seperating his mental tasks in capartments to help the two stay a float, while controlling the lone shuriken through tits advance tactics. He kept the act up for just a bit before, already losing stability in his shuriken to the point it collapses to the earth in a big crash.* - Mon Sep 07 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) already set the shuriken back into motion, seperatting them already into groups. Letting the advance tricks of the solo shuriken, letting it give a beautiful air show. This time more concentration being given into it. The other two being forced into just happening without most thought. Letting them become something natural to him like breathing; however, such an accomplishment isn't so easily done. The other two shuriken not given enough attention as the elements knock the two shuriken out of their track.* - Mon Sep 07 18:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) already the genin forced the shuriken to come to life once more, as he gave them the ability to move across the air. The two shuriken go back to flying in circles, as the genin concentrated on the single one that did loop-da-loops in the sky. Wind coming in began to send each shuriken off course, but the genin was quick to react and used to saving the shuriken from the enviroment. He was able to continue hold them up and continuing forward for the long time until his focus finally broke and he lost control of the shuriken from sheer mental exhaustion.* - Mon Sep 07 18:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) once more restarted his training, taking more breathes to recover his mental and physical stamina. He then let his shuriken fly off. Giving them both the same orders as he did before. Refining his shuriken flight paths, preparing each of them for enviroment changes and cuttting wasted movements.  The two shuriken flying in circles were in complete synch, as they cut through the air around the genin. The lone ace shuriken showing off its abilites, flew through the sky without a thought acting as natural as a dragonfly in its airspace.* - Mon Sep 07 18:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) quickly assumes that if Tethys isn't here hes going out nearly killing himself in some war.* - Mon Sep 07 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) wonders why Tethys didn't respond to Elon's reply then.* - Mon Sep 07 19:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) takes the mission, and stares at it for moment. "... Yeah you're right."* - Mon Sep 07 19:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) went inside the building directed to him by the mission scroll. Pulling aside the door, he walked on to the wooden floors. The walls were a pristine but emotionless white that seemed to lack any stain, and the smell was that of almost fresh furniture like things haven't been touched. It was pretty clear this building was kept well cleaned and any messes quickly wiped off. He then wondered his way until he found the meeting room.
The genin had made sure he had taken thirty minutes before the meeting even started. However as he opened the door, he saw every attendant already there sitting at their designated spots. Jin was the last one to make it, which made him question his timing but looking at the clock and the mission scroll confirmed that he was here early. The looks on each of them were grim and their brows already furrowed into an angry scowl. All of which pointed their heads in the direction of the genin, as he entered. This even shook the normally calm Jin as he was suddenly picked out as the solitary foreign object in the meeting.
Jin merely gulped and took a seat made for him in the corner. Picking up his clip board with several papers sinched tightly against the wood and pulling out one of several pens. He took his seat, as he then looked around at everyone here. There were eleven people all people of high standing in the village in economic and governmental practices. Sitting next to one long table that these powerful people now gathered at. None of them looking younger then in their thirties if not far older. Jin quickly got himself mentally ready to note who was who. Looking left there sat the main economy group, two men representing the fishing industry, a ninja weapon manufacter, and a large farmer at the end of the row sat the lonely Local Law enforcement commissioner. On the other side sat governent officials of trade, taxes, legal consouling, transportation, and agriculture. Then sitting at the end of the table all by himself, was clearly the oldest man deaned to refree this grouping of leaders in the village.
Jin then sat for fifteen minutes, their eyes quickly going back to each other. Spending their time in hushed whispers as if they were afraid to be caught speaking. It was only the banging of the Old man at the end of table that created a moment of silence before he spoke. "Since everyone is here we shall start the meeting. Please restate your progress of your goals established in the previous gathering." Jin quickly raised his pencil writing when the council started and the list that quickly followed. Having to quickly jot what changes they did and the process they had to do to get there. All of them quickly pointing out that they did complete their goals no matter how lofty the task was, which only proves that these men and women were notably accomplished from their own work.
Was almost instantly exhausted looking at his own page of notes scribbled on to the paper, scrawled with as much as he could put saving room for more of the talks. However this was only the tip of the iceberg, the true meat of the discussion began. The current battles being fought by the shinobi. The conflicts of Konoha greatly worried and numbed the minds of people in the village, and word was spreading with news that wasn't kind. These people most of all had concerns from selfish greed to outcries of common sense.
 The talks over the fighting, was quickly turning into a rampage of yelling emotions back and forth. Fishing, Transportation, Agriculture, and the Farmer quickly put out their points. The fishing and both agricultral parties voiced that locals needed the little trade their already had to live healthy lives. Transportation quick to point out that the traveling shinobi's and migration of villagers thank to fear of battle have worn the roads and were already looking at needs of repairs and expansions to previous routes. The econmies mainly Taxes, Trade, not surpringsly the weapons factory owner, and the more company based fishing owner pointed out the value of larger quanties of goods needed for the troops and the amount of money fighting can rake in.
Jin was quickly overwhelemed jumping his head back and forth writing what the people had their fill to say which was a lot. He began to notice a few didn't even speak at this time the Local Law Enforcment and Legal Counseling waited silently either having no mind to speak or any authority in the matter. Though this just luckly meant for him two less people to worry bout as he copied the words as close as he could on paper. The only moments his hand could take peace to either catch up or rest from the aching blister from writing was when the Elder Leader came into to order a silence. Though this wasn't given easily, not minding if they yelled enough to shake the room or sling some foul words at the others. As long as the arguements didn't become anything more then personal insults to the others at the table.
If he could take a moment to have peace, he be on the edge of his nerves at the childish behavior he saw. On the other hand, he could also see thats people were steadily pushing their points across. If the only reason they squabbled, is the fact that all of them were in a stand still. With neither side having a true advantage. Even in the two groups for or against wars, the people let out subtle hints of what they really wanted. The more against war local fisher wanted the for war company fisher to be limited out in areas on the sea, something that even the pro wars Trade and Weapons Manufacter wanted to give more space on the open water for trading. On the other hand Trade and Taxes wanted Transportation to get its money to expand the roads and repair for again their own benefits. It drive anyone insane to find solution to where everyone comes out beneficial or getting what they wanted.... actually it was impossible. 
Continued writting until his wrist and entire arm grew sore from the small juttering movements of writting and flipping papers. The clock slowly ticking down until it finally rang in the middle of the meeting, and the judge banged on the table with his gavel announcing the resting period. Which, Jin quickly took for his own physical and mental recovery. However it was no break for those at the table, as they already went back to their little groups of unified goals. All them whispering ways to try and take control of the discussion through deals. But, it was clear none of these would bear much fruit, only because the other groups were working on similair plans.
When break finally ended, and they got back to discussions things were strangely quiet at first. The judge then pointed out the Law Enforcment Leader. "Dicuss your issues, sir. For you chose silence for the first half." Standing up the man was given a room full of attention. He spoke and was recorded all by Jin who was surprised for the attention given. Boiling it down, he called out the attention that any expansions for new paths in the Transportation Leader's favor stretches already worn thin law angents and leads to ponential rise theft and bandits. He then sat speaking his peace. The judge then pointed to the Legal Counseling who stood up and dropped saying they had no view to speak. The judge then decreed free discussion again, as Jin noted mentally it must have been some form of way to let smaller groups or those that weren't worried about the major issue at hands a optional time to speak and get their point across.
Then it was back to the usual chatter of them going back and forth. Pointing out the positives of their viewpoint, only for the other side to immeaditly stand up to shout out the negatives. This continued back and forth as the clock clicked away along with Jin's ability to endure writing any more.  It was almost thirty minutes to the end of the meeting before the Gavel was banged again for peace.  The judge then announced the final ruling. "Let us now speak the goals and distrubution of money to meet by next meeting."

The room went silent, as they all cradle for a moment looking at the budget they all had to spare from the governement with a quick nod. They all handed out a small piece of paper of their wishes which was then read by the judge who then stood up. "The over all goal of this room seems to be in agreement. Our connection to the other Village keeps us from argueing against any conflict, so no plea for peace will be sent to the Mizukage. Transportation will get its money for repairs and enlargement of roads. No new money for new roads will be issued at this time. Fishing and agriculture shall get money and support the enlargement of food in such needy times. And a new tax for traveling on the roads will cover expenses, while adding no new tax to marine trade. Anyone with issues, may speak." There was a cold silence across the room. "This meeting is adjourned."* - Mon Sep 07 22:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Well.... Hmph... for this over a squabble and simple dislikes it is pointless. - Mon Sep 07 22:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) whispers: Indeed. - Mon Sep 07 22:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "Posted?" mutters under his breathe not loud enough to be calling out to Himura. His head hits the back of the bench, and his legs stretch forward for a moment hands stuffed in pockets. "Would they really send genin out there? I doubt it." He says in the low voice again with melancholy.* - Mon Sep 07 22:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) whispers: They are still going on about this. - Mon Sep 07 23:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) hopes purple is still the dummy.* - Mon Sep 07 23:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks at the crater. <Hope someone fixes that up.>* - Tue Sep 08 00:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) sighs.* - Tue Sep 08 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) taking up his tiger seal, the genin took a few meditative breathes to focus his energy inside of him. Engulfing himself in the chakra coat he used to protect himself in the act of shunshin jutsu. He then sent chakra to his legs, and the moment he felt himself prepared. He pushed forward into space itself with his chakra propelling his velocity to intense speeds. His limiting his movement only for the nesscessary chakra to jump to his goal.

Already bringing up his own chakra levels, he began to already start cloaking himself in the most minor of protection he could give hiimself for the jutsu. Until he felt completely sure he had reached his mark. The genin vanished appearing  further over on the beach feet burried into the sand. His body clenched tightly together in muscles cinched together in protection. He then felt tremors travel through his body before he allowed himself to ease up. The shock of sudden movement and stopping was still too intense and something he had to solve today.* - Tue Sep 08 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holding his hands into the form of tiger seal. He began raising his chakra, finding his marked set standards for now using the jutsu as cheap and fast as possible. Filling the conditions met, he then disappeared sent off at high speeds travelling forward until he once again landed farther down on the beach. The genin then bit down on his teeth. Chakra bursting out of the center of his gut lining out of his body and squeezing itself into his legs just being cut off when he got all the energy he needed. In a flash he disappeared just only thirty seconds of charging his jutsu. Finally, breaking through his normal length barrier as he lands across the sand. All his joints locked afraid that the impact of the shift in gears would destroy his body.* - Tue Sep 08 05:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) wasn't stoppping there, as he shifted his feet in the sand to face the opposite direction. Venting his chakra through out his body, he charged the jutsu once more. His body appearing over his original foot steps on the sand, in just a burst of smoke. Not even flinching at this point from the high speed step he was used to the genin pushed his body even further. Vessels clenching as they tried to flood out more chakra through the genin's body. The genin pressed his chakra harder until it finally accumulated into an explosion of speed, as he lands further up the north of the beach. His body once again locked into positioin as he recovers from the shock double flickering so fast.* - Tue Sep 08 06:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) lurched himself forward, he wanted to turn around already and begin a new attempt. However, it was like his body was stiff as stone unwilling to move from place. It took him awhile before his finally gave control back to him. His chest leaning forward as he took in more oxygen to resupply the energy to his body.

Rotating back around he let his tiger seal form once more, chakra raging inside him to find its place before he activated his jutsu. His chakrar pumping faster thanks to adrenaline just like the blood being pressed out of his heart. His body flickering down the beach. Chakra being released in a tense steam out of his body. Recovering the lost energy for another disappearence he disappeared in a moment coming out again. His body once again remaining paralyzed the more and more he came close to closing the delayed gap between Shunshin no Jutsus.* - Tue Sep 08 06:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took several breathes to get the feeling of his lungs moving at their most optimum. His body craving for oxygen, as each double body flicker pushed him to his limits. Each time he came otu of these shunshins so quickly, his entire body became a stone statue. His muscles tensing so hard remaining ignorant to his brain's signals to them. However, the genin could feel the seconds being shaved. So he bit his lip and continued for one last go.

Not even wanting to waste moment turning around like he usually did, the Genin continued down his current path as he activated his jutsu once more. When he came out of the sudden blast of speed, he was already building up as much chakra as quickly as he could. Giving his extremely refined base chakra needs for Body flicker, he vanished one more coming out of the jutsu in tact. However, he was once again paralyzed by his now minor delay in the Body Flicker Techinique. His muscles so tightly clutched after movement, that they wouldn't respond to his bursting nerves. His breathe halted for a moment as he tried to regain control of his body. Even then, the first moment was clutching his forehead as the genin wavered in his stance. "I see... I cut off so much time. My mind... and body are still not used to it. I wasn't preparred enough." He stated finishing his training for the day.* - Tue Sep 08 07:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) walked back into the courtyard with gasping breathes, walking across the cracked earth left by Hassan. The genin desperate for water only to see Violet hunching over the two shinobi. "Gah..Ga -God damnit!" He then ran passed the two and began dumping out more water bottles. "Fucking idiots."

He said heading back to give to Tethys just help the process in anyway he could. "What happened?" He said when he got back over.* - Tue Sep 08 07:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) then looked over to Koeki not sure how serious her wounds, and wondering if any first aid has been applied to her.* - Tue Sep 08 07:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) groans rubbing his head, and goes to lean back on the wall of the Mizukage mansion.* - Tue Sep 08 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Keep my existence a secret, Tethys. - Tue Sep 08 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) respect for Tethys has dropped by five points.* - Tue Sep 08 22:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "Oh and word I have to say about you... Hmmm, I know." He then held his hand in a tiger seal. "You should hurry and catch up on jutsu." He then vanishes with his mastered shunshin.  Heading out to do his own jutsu training. * - Tue Sep 08 22:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) dropped out four shuriken this time for his training. Spreading out his chakra to each one he refined the amount until each one bursted upwards. Wind spiralling out from the center, as they all stood surrounding the genin. He then began to move them outwards, from his center. He then concentrated giving each of them different directions, one raising and then lowering. Another, rotating itself while hovering still. One going around in vertical loops, as the last one does it in horizontal loops. His mind is focused on concentrating so that each doesn't slack off and loose its pace.

He didn't lose it at all until, he heard a familiar voice that made him let out a sigh. He then turned his head over his shoulder looking at the other genin, as the rest of his shuriken come to a complete hault in the air. Wherever they were they just began slowly spinnign as wind chakra kept them a float.

"What do you want?" He shouted over his shoulder.* - Tue Sep 08 22:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stood up his chakra dispersing from the floating shurikens, as they all fall to the ground lifeless. He then looks at Ossa, back with his own glare as Ossa came closer. His feet digging in the sand as he slid for a better foot hold.

He then looked at the open hand at him with quite the amount of suspicion. Before, answering the only way wether it was a trick or not. "Never." He then points to Ossa. "You, you remind me of what I hate most about myself. Looking at you... makes me happy I chose to reject my abilities. But even more then that... more then my self satsification at my own choices."

His eyes grew more intense, his pupils becoming beads only focused on Ossa's entire body, his body giving off the looks of one on the verg fighting. "It makes my blood boil. I hate you, and if this is an honest hand of putting it past us. Know thats is impossible, its best you just leave me alone and I will you."* - Tue Sep 08 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) knew there was no way this asshole would be here to apologize or bring anything behind them. He saw just even one motion of his hand, the genin would slide to the side. However, resting on the sand plus the speed of the attack. He grazed by one bullet only for the other to lodging itself in his thigh. Leaving the genin to take a knee. Teeth gritted trying to nullify the yell of pain he wanted to let go from the bottom of his throat, as he took the attack. Blood dripping out of his new wound.

He then looked over to the genin once the pain was behind him still left stuck on the ground. He then smiling glaring at Baen. "I'll always turn my back away from you. You're nothing to be scared at.... Heh, you're just talented." He said that smile turning into a grin that seemed to mean so much more then just some complement. A cruel joke that only Jin seemed to get, as he chuckled to himself.* - Tue Sep 08 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) attempted to stand shaking for a moment before collapsing, as he looked at his leg still pouring out blood. He took a moment, pulling off the headband from his left leg. Biting on to the steel plate, he then grabbed his kunai and  cut open the wound deeper. His eyes almost bulging out of his sockets from the pain, before he dug deeper and deeper until he popped out the piece of bone... just as the medics arrived.

<Oh great... > "ARRgghh..." <... they're here.>* - Tue Sep 08 22:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) assumes that questioin was for him. "Well... AGHHH...ahh... I didn't... know... someone was... coming... And I couldn't move with something shoved in my leg.  So, I needed to get it out... now before sand clogs in my wound or I... lose too much blood. It be some help to... to..stop it."* - Tue Sep 08 23:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) wasn't aggainst anyone coming to help him, as he leaned back to help her tend to him. His kunain was thrown away and the cuts was only a few slices along side to give enough space to pull out the bone. His hands gripped the sand only to have it flow in between his fingers. His teeth bitting down as she did only the minor fixes to stabalize him. His other leg kicked up and down on the ground, giving him one way to vent the pain from the injury. Which would probably need to be stopped as Koeki prepared to work.* - Tue Sep 08 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) head leaned back, pressed the back of his head back gently into the sand just to not cause a cloud of sand to come up. His fingers still curled up into to tight fists shaking from the pain.  He nodded his head with eyes closed shut. "Yeah... Yeah..." He said wishign the pain would just end soon.* - Tue Sep 08 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) didn't sit up after the procedure taking himself laying down after the still sore leg. His body slightly shivering after taking another forceful attack like that again. He try and whisper out a quick thanks, but if it could be over heard by the grunting and gasps is another thing. His chest was bounding up and down along with his heart, as the blood circulation was restored.* - Tue Sep 08 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) gets up off the bench he was resting on, and walks over to the group.* - Tue Sep 08 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) crosses his arms, and begins tapping readily on his arm with one finger.* - Tue Sep 08 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) grimaced for a moment, before opening up his arms. "Each jutsus builds up from the basics. What becomes a simple shuriken throwing trick leads to one learning how to channel chakra through that shuriken and that leads that to soemthing beyond that. When one masters the basic jutsus it leads to the next steps to the next level of jutsus. Not only does this give you more jutsu, but it also increases the powers of your basic jutsus by mixing them with your advance techiniques."* - Tue Sep 08 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pulls open the scroll stertching it outwards to begin examining the contents. He already seemed to be lost in reading what was locked inside. Pulling out the details of how one disperses chakra through their weapon, similair to how one did it with Rotation Shuriken... However, this process was much different in use then the other jutsu mention. The first discussion over it is purely how the chakra provides the spike of power that is perfect for weapons of a shinobi. It was rather scary what was discussed inside and the capablities of a master with  this jutsu.* - Wed Sep 09 00:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continued to examine the finer details of how one began wrapping the weapon with the chakra. Encompassing the edge from both sides, the two wind chakras begin to refine each other. Grinding agains the others flow until each clash into a tight line made of deadly cutting wind. With this the power of the weapon's cutting increases, and this could just simply used for all ninja tools and even the ninja himself.* - Wed Sep 09 00:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over watching that Koeki was already attempting to use the jutsu. It was no wonder that she be ahead considering that she was his student. He then got to the chapter of how one compresses the chakra around their weapon, and how to force the two to work together instead of canceling each other out. It required a key concentration and the mental ability to forge in one's mind the edge line. The mechanics were clearly stated, but it was harder then what needed to be done.* - Wed Sep 09 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) reaching the bottom of the scroll, the genin began to read the tactical uses of such a shuriken. All of which explained the obvious power of such a jutsu in close combat, but also medium distance combat where the shuriken can keep its power from the chakra flow alone. With this one makes their entire stored weaponry into deadly blades that can cut through the enemies defences. Beyond that it listed a reminder the strength of the wind elemetn, and what it was elementally weak and strong again. Which was something Jin already knew.* - Wed Sep 09 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) didn't even try to do the jutsu after reading through the scroll quickly once. His eyes like a machine automatically returned to the top, delving into its contents once more. Writing in a large space in his mind to store the most important information he can pull out of the scrolls. Going over the basics formation and how many lines it with blade formation with up most seriousness. The rest he only took small snippets from. Not seeing anything else of much use to him.* - Wed Sep 09 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) dropped one hand from his scroll, using it to dig through his back pocket. He then pulled out a shuriken. First he cloaked it in the chakra like he did for the rotation jutsu, he then stared at for a moment keeping it in hand. He then dispersed it, and took his mind back to the basics. Reading it once again, he juggled the shuriken up and down in between his fingers taking in what the text had to say to him.* - Wed Sep 09 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looking back and forth from his scroll to his shuriken. The genin began to work off the basics he already knew from Rotating Shuriken no Jutsu. Coating it with his chakra with ease; however things wern't so easy, as he then stared back at the papers. His chakra fluttered around the shuriken like an aura. This was quickly morphing though, as the genin tried his best follow what was stated in the text thinning the coat more and more closer to just a thin perimeter around the metal star.* - Wed Sep 09 00:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took concentration as the harder the jutsu became. His eyes flicked back and forth to the shuriken and the scroll. He disappaited the energy in the shuriken execpt for a thin line that followed to one pointing limb on the shuriken sticking out from his hand. He then began to try and seperate the chakra... give it distinct lines of the wind nature chakra. Then, pressing those edges together on the outline of the shuriken.* - Wed Sep 09 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked at the results of his first edge of Chakra flow. It looked shoddy at best, the line morphing in front of his eyes. It fluxuated side to side, as each edge fought for control. In all honesty he though he made the shuriken duller with nothing to show but a soft layer of wind chakra going around it. Shaking his head, he let the false edge disperse. Already cloaking his shuriken in chakra to try once again.* - Wed Sep 09 00:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a breathe placing down the scroll for now. He held the shuriken tightly with his finger tips. His nostrils flaring as he exhaled, and pressed down on the chakra he already had lining the shuriken. He then pushed chakra out of his fingers and forced it to travel on opposites of the blade. He then put his concentration at its highest amount. He then lined the two edges of wind nature up. Carefully slidding them, as their teeth like winds let out small sparks of dispersing chakra when they crashed together. Holding it out as much as he could, he finally stopped looking at his result to see the very fine sharpened edge of the shuriken. <Alright!> he thought to himself, with a quick smile.

<Shuriken isn't my goal though.> He said in his mind, as he grabbed the tanto hanging on his back. Clasping his fingers on the thread tied handle, he held it out in front of him for a moment. Pulling out his sharp blade for the first time since the forced training by the village. He then held out in front of him, both hands still holding it together with fingers overlapping at the same point. * - Wed Sep 09 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began to send out chakra from his hand to the handle, which was already far more difficult then shuriken with the lower area one hand to cloak. Here he had to make his chakra tighter around the blade, his first few attempts ending up with falling apart and breaking in the air. Pulling out more chakra from his gut, he began to slowly knit it out around the blade first. Only letting the chakra extend as long as he thought he could support it. It was crawling at a very slow pace, but he was doing it. Taking several long moments, Jin finally managed to complete the circuit of chakra around his blade.* - Wed Sep 09 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) holding out his tanto cloaked in chakra. He began to force the wind nature to come out, sending both sides into a current of winds that rivaled each other in strength. The genin tried to find a balance edge for the two winds to work together. The length of the blade showing the issues of varying sizes, as he had to manage controlling not only the strong chakra but from a distance through the weapon. It was difficult and no matter how much he seemed to force signals from his hands to the chakra at the tip of his blade. Nothing seemed to happen.* - Wed Sep 09 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) bearing his blade outwards, he continued to have to strugle with the chakra flowing around it. Jin battled the winds on his blades trying to get to be equal forces. Though, each time he fed chakra into the weaker one it only overwhelmed the other. He had to take personal control of these forces, but they were all the way down from his body to the blade. The grip on his sword shaking slightly, as he finally noticed his hands have been holding the weight of a sword all this time. 

This raised Jin's brow or just a moment, before he shut off his vision by bringing down his eyelids. He took a breathe, and began to focus his chakra into his hands holind the tanto.. He then began to tear away the barrier that was made between him and the sword. Extending himself to include the blade, by sending out his own energy through it. He then felt the raging wind of the two opposing edges. Settling them down by finally being able to concentrate and manipulate them. When he opened his eyes his blade had finally found its edge in the wind.* - Wed Sep 09 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) dispersed the chakra around his sword noticing his successful attempt at chakra flow. But still, he had to make sure he could do it again. Holding out his sword this time with open eyes. The boy opened his mouth to let out a trailed  "Ahhh..." under his breathe, before sending a river of chakra down his blade. Now knowing the skill to handle the chakra, he began to kneed the chakra into its edge shape finally. 

He then stood up with a blade brimming with chakra, nodding to himself. "I did it." he said, as he was definately using chakra flow. Though, one could easily point out that it was no where near the strength it should have been. It was clear he might be slacking off in his wind training.* - Wed Sep 09 01:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) held his ground for a moment looking over to the sand that had beened dyed a murky black marroon from his blood the other day. He let a loud "Hmph..." from his breathe, as he came to stood still taking up the tiger seal. Chakra cutting through the air, as he rises his chakra until it conforms around him. The spiritual energy also builds in his legs boiling inside like a pot, before it explodes him forward in instand movement.

Curling back from the transportation, the genin already began to work speeding up his chakra going through his body. He rapidly kept the moving chakra, trying to quicken the speed of his chakra getting to where he needed to be. First, letting it go around him and then build up in his legs fastly pumping it to max since it was the biggest area that needed his chakra. He then disappeared until he ended forced forward in a burst of speed.* - Wed Sep 09 08:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) coming out of the speed tunnel, the genin was once again trapped within the limits of his body as he traveled too fast in between his jutsu. His body stuck for a moment in the form of his tiger seal, and one couldn't tell when he got free of this until he had already charged up the chakra to disappear once more in a Body Flicker. Coming out of the jutsu, the genin began to force chakra in through his body. Trying to already find ways and paths for his chakra to travel so he could prepare the jutsu quicker. Forcing out a second off his wait time, as he vanished out of sight in a puff of smoke.* - Wed Sep 09 09:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) gathering his chakra he was already prepared for his next Body Flicker Jutsu, as he appears meters ahead into the grass going out of the sand. He then held, pushing the chakra that rested in the center of his abdomen outwards. The chakra extend its grasp around the genin before helping him disappear. He followed it up once more gathering energy for another jump, pressing and sending the chakra through his body through vessels as fast as he could possible manage.* - Wed Sep 09 10:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continued doing the jutsus shaving off seconds with his fourth set of two shunshins at once. His body flashing from existance with ease from the first jutsu, but chakra pulsing as he sent it out through the roots like web of his chakra network passing into his out body giving his protection coat from the forces of the body flicker. His legs gathering strenght before boosting him forward with a single step to the other end of the beach. He almost had he was sure, not sweating even as the force strained his body to the tense state it was having as he cut down time. He was confident he could get it on his next try.* - Wed Sep 09 10:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took a small break to recover his chakra, before activating the body flicker jutsu. Disappearing and reappaering still in the same state. The gening took only a single breathe, the chakra from his core burned for a moment like a star. The rays of chakra spread out cloaking his body in chakra. His legs clinging to the energy given to him. The genin's eyes quickly dropped focus to his target destination. It was only ten seconds after his first jutsu, but the genin did manage it. Disappearing in a blazing smoke that funneled up into the sky.

Coming out of the jutsu, Jin's body began to fold in on itself. His muscles tensing, clutching hard enough that could feel it crushing his vessels and bones. His own body squeezing itself, as it recoiled from the intense pressure of the movement. The only thing he managed to do out of sheer will, is to curl his fingers into his fist. "Finally... I did it..." he said, body shivering as it goes back under Jin's control.* - Wed Sep 09 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked around, noting that boy wasn't here. Taking a seat, he pulls out the tanto out of its sheathe. Holding it out in front of him, he then began to concentrate chakra into the sword. Pushing the wind nature together against both sides of the blade. Dragging the two natured chakras against each other, grinding them together forcing them to grow more intense. Trying to bring the line as thin as he could, making the edge sharper the smaller and smaller he made it.* - Wed Sep 09 11:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "Don't remind me of yesterday." He said turning his attention to the two shinobi. "Well... Guess you're the one who wouldn't want to think about it the most." He said shutting himself up, as he looked over to Himura. * - Wed Sep 09 11:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continued holding the flow of chakra along his blade for as long as he could. Keeping the energy from breaking apart holding it together through his control. Controlling the fluxuating energy that had no bonds to simply hold it apart. His will the only reason the chakra didn't just disperse in teh air. The two conflicting forces that gave the jutsu power weren't something that had to be fueled. Hands shaking as he could only think of having to try to do this in the middle of battle. Which just proved to Jin he had to work harder to actually put this in to use.* - Wed Sep 09 11:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stood up, pointing his sword in direction of Tethys. "Oh? And a person shooting five bullets into someone else gains what? A slap on the hand?"

He said the chakra still razing itself on the edge of his blade. "I make one comment, and I get one too." His chakra beginning to spike, as it begins to waver on his blade. "Thats just a great ideal." He says, as the two forces begin to conflict rather then work together to form his edge. Instead, it begins to push out until the chakra burts off dispersing the cloak of energy. "Damnit!" he shouted, as the blade shot upwards back into his arm from the force of the chakra.  His one other hand going to rub his sore shoulder.* - Wed Sep 09 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) is confused to say the least.* - Wed Sep 09 12:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) has been confused out of anger, and turns himself around. "What ever, just tell me when I'll be sent out."  He said going back to holding his sword out with both hands channeling chakra through it.* - Wed Sep 09 12:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began recloaking his sword with his chakra energy once more. His finger tips being the exit point of his own energy. His body connecting with the blade treating the sword no different then a limb. His energy connected him with it, as he then began to split the chakra into two halfs. He sent one in a clockwise motion, and sent the other in the opposite. Pushing them two close until their edged teeth clashed. Training himself to get them the perfect distance and timing to get them to form the singular edge of the jutsu.

However, this was completely thrown off as his brow began to bounce to each verbal syllabel that came out of Tethys's mouth. His energy was changed just like that, guess it was the freedom and formlessness of wind nature and Jin's personification of it.  He didn't turn to look around to Tethys just stating while looking forward eyes still closed. "Well, I'm sorry I'm such a big disgrace."* - Wed Sep 09 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) heard Baen's voice. He stood up swinging his sword once in a swiping motion, as the chakra dispersed off in the air.  "I regret changing my training spots. I was right to keep where I was." He said, sliding the sword back in its sheathe. Standing up and moving over to the side. 

He then looked over to Tethys. He clearly was thinking of something, to express what his feelings were. This is where his own anti-social nature was a rather big thorn in his side. He didn't really want to fan the flames of anything more, and just wished they leave him alone. He finally took a breathe.

He then looked over to Tethys. "I don't have allies, not because I find them useless or I have no need for them. Thats not it, you and so many others have no way of knowing what I think I am. I like being alone because I know who I am and thats it. And to make sure you don't mistake me, I see Kirigakure as one of the few things I want to protect, and I wish to do it in the only way I know how to. I'll work with others, I'll train, I'll take orders, and voice my opinions."

He took another quick breathe. "I prefer if you called me a disgrace or a disappointment. Actually no I wish I was one of those. You telling me I have a bunch of paths to follow you can't guide me on. I already chose one, and I hate every step of it."* - Wed Sep 09 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) stared at Tethys, listening. He wasn't slouched or showing any disrespect. He just listened giving Tethys the same attention, that he gave him. He the nodded. "And I picked this path on my own choice." He then raised a hand not to pause the conversation, but to make his next response.

He then looked over to the Ossa. Giving him a quick cold glare, before letting out a sigh then putting on a light smile "Hey Baen, you like calling people weaklings. Have you ever seen a weakling that made you change your opinion of them?"* - Wed Sep 09 13:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked by to Tethys. "I have never seen that once in my life. The weak have always been weak, and the strong have been strong. Those who were weak make excuses. I wasn't born for it, its just not my thing, well clearly they're different. There are those who are strong pride themselves on it. When you look and never see anything different. You begin to question if they really are born into it or not. That anything can just put on the whim of luck."

"I personally would like to be call a weakling, and prove my own strength."* - Wed Sep 09 13:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "I HAVE HAD PLENTY ENOUGH!" began gripping his hand tightly. "Those smiles of teachers and children watching a spectacle are nice at first. But, when you see them to validate your accomplishments, when you look at them seeking some word of praise and get. 'I wonder who his parents are...' 'I can't keep up with you can you slow down a bit...' 'Stop showing off' 'Its clear talent he has..' Whats all the hard work one can accomplish only to be dismissed as nothing more then your birth right."

Takes off his tanto, and waves it "I'll work with blades... I won't focus on my chakra... I'll work on my speed and reflexes... instead of taking their blows they won't touch me.... All to be slapped with 'Another thing hes good at...' 'Its pointless to spar with him.' 'Hes been given a real gift' Even today, I still don't focus good at.I tie my hands back, and I can still beat the person that supposed to be my genin squad leader. I don't pull my sword out and I can still keep up with those who focus in their talents. Its mind numbing, that I just begin to pass up my own accomplishments when faced the other results."* - Wed Sep 09 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) sighs hearing the talk about exercise. "I have work to do..." he then looked over to Baen. "If honestly what you said is true that you started off weak and became strong. Because, I won't be afraid to admit you're insanely strong. Then I'm jealous, if people don't recognize you then its your own attitude that shooting you in the leg." - pun intended- " On the other hand, when you start off like me. Then you begin to wonder if its just fate pulling the strings. I wish I saw you get strong, then maybe I could feel better about myself."

"Now I need to go, and train. I assume thats good enough of a good bye for you, Baen." He said shooting him a look, that this line was clearly about the other day.* - Wed Sep 09 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) "Is that so Tethys, and Baen working to surpass him. Guess it be pretty embarassing for the both of you if I went beyond both of you then." He said, as he then held up his tiger seal. Chakra bursting from his feat creating a dust cloud as he vanished using the obvious body flicker coming out a meters from where her stood. However he came out still in the position of the tiger seal, disappearing in mere moments after the first to the point  her stood on top of the building. 

His body paralyzed, after his second one but he did his best not to give it away. Though the hands hanging by his hips, twitched in pain as he stood. "I'm already training hard to do so, becoming strongest in the village is the first part of my goal anyways."  He said after a moment of silence as he recovered as much energy as he could.* - Wed Sep 09 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) held out his sword and began working back to training it up again. His chakra building itself up from inside the body, then funneled through his hands into his fingertips until it grew on the rest of the sword. Jin felt the pulsing of the chakra, as it clung to the steel. Controlling these pulses, Jin began the fundamentals of the jutsu. Hold the chakra ingnoring keeping a sharp edge on it for now. He just kept it in the cloak of energy for a moment, before raising the sword over his head.

Holding the chakra enchanced sword, Jin began to take several frontal chops with the jutsu. Swinging it forward slicing into the air with a small noticable chill breeze coming off of the swipe. He then closed his eyes feeling the chakra field that covered it, checking it for any instanbilites. Recovering and smoothing the layer of chakra so it didn't disperse. The genin continued giving very slow methodical chops of his blade at nothing. All the while keeping chakra streaming from his hands to the blade.

Moving forward from there, the genin then using various other attacks for practice to see if each had their own unique challanges. The first where just vertical swipes from different directions, something he noted that chops coming from his right area were far stronger then the others just from the natural extension his arm made from inside to out... since he was left handed which made him concentrate more on his chakra during those swings. His horozontal slashes and those from other directions didn't seem to do much disturbance.

Seeing that he was doing so well, the genin began to pick up pace. Swinging the sword faster with each swipe. Controlling and fixing the chakra before had to swing again. Soon, he began trying to manipulate the chakra so it didn't distrub at all. Though his success wasn't very consistant. While he could keep it from breaking up as badly as it did his first swings. His faster swings still needed to be recovered and reformed. And he seemingly could only keep up the closer part of the blade. Often  noticing, a break in the cloak towards the tip growing larger and more problematic the faster the swing was.* - Wed Sep 09 14:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) dispersed the chakra cloak around his blade, and set it up once more. Pulling the energy out of himself around the blade. Taking a few moments to gather enough energy and then push it out evenly across the blade. Holding the fluxations of the energy, by keeping the chakra held tight to the blade. He then  swung it back and forth, starting off as slow as he started off in the first place. He then began to raise the speeds of the swing while keeping the tightness and conformity of the chakra flow.* - Wed Sep 09 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) continued the movements of his arms swinging down on the sword. It was nice that he could be training both a jutsu, and his own sword handling skills at once. Though, he didn't feel like doing anything advance. There wasn't many times he had the oppurtunity to pull out his sword. He could feel his chakra flowing on the surface of the blade, and began to be reminded of something like water now with his chakra on the blade. Each swing rippling the surface, and sending it all in to motion. This would disturb the turrent of movements in its true form, and needed to avoid that happening.* - Wed Sep 09 15:25:39 2015
