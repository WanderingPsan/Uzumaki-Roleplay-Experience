<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Don't seperate, unless theres a big jutsu he lets out... if he even takes us seriously. - Sat Sep 12 07:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I was going to suggest we go in two different directions. Its harder to fight two opponents that way. - Sat Sep 12 07:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: If you wish, its just I don't know how fast he is. But, I can seperate. If you're in trouble I'll get to you quickly, or if I see an oppertunity I'll take it. - Sat Sep 12 07:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) began to form his own handseals, as she laid out her fire across the ground. Lining up a Tiger, Ram, Snake seals in quick succession. The genin pulled back both his hands, and then pushed forward with a blast of intense wind coming out from his palms, catching the fire and hurling itself as a spinning stream of flames at Tethys's position. * - Sat Sep 12 07:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'll get him out! - Sat Sep 12 07:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) head twisted side to side, as he looked for Tethys seeing nothing remaining after the jutsu passed. He was sure that there was no way Tethys had fallen for such an obvious combination. Looking over to see Lera slammning her hands on the earth, Jin pulled in his back pocket pulling out four shuirken. He then held them for a moment, before throwing each out  having them hover in front of the genin.

He kept one hand in the form of a concentration seal, and waited for any movements that he could identify. These shuriken would be their sentinels in case Tethys had really fooled them good. Jin ready to give out commands to attack or move at any moment.* - Sat Sep 12 07:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) the moment he saw, Tethys showed up out of the ground. The genin's eyes instantly focused in on him. As quickly as he could, pointing his fingers at Tethys. He then sent his shuriken flying outwards scattering them to two on each side, and then having the metal stars curve inwards to hit at Tethys's sides as he weaves seals. 

Noticing his seal weaving, whether or not Jin hit with the shuriken he take a jump to the side to avoid the possible jutsu coming their way. Not sure what Tethys was going to pull out, but if he thought he could take head on the lightning flash. He was pretty sure Tethys, was confident in his victory in a jutsu clash. * - Sat Sep 12 07:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Lera, as their attacks once again failed to connect, and she moved closer to him. He took a moment to think about, which Tethys would target. He sighed, having no thoughts on what he could do. <He could focus me... And beat me hand to hand, but Lera atleast has some jutsus to support from a far. Lera is more vulnerable to close combat, and my jutsus can only help mid to short range.> 

Dumping out the contents of his back pouch.He then formed a series of handseals, and took to running besides Lera. Charging chakra through the pack. He let go of it mid run. He then stopped besides Lera ready to jump in against Tethys if he showed up.* - Sat Sep 12 08:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) quickly backed away, as he formed a quick tiger seal. He then disappeared in a puff of smoke that was quickly swallowed up by the mud. Which also took the genin's pack with it which made his pontential switch ruined. 

The point he decided to land was rather obvious, as he appeared right behind Tethys. His body suffering from the jutsu, but as best he can he moved his body in position to attack Tethys the moment he landed. Mainly aiming to give a kick if he could recovered in time.* - Sat Sep 12 08:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked up, as Tethys held out his hand and a group of shuriken came flying out. Watching him grab and charged them with chakra, the genin did the only thing he could doing a quickly as he could perform three seals. He then hold out his hand again, blasting an air current up at the shuriken. Though the lag of his body moving after the shunshin, made it only possible to hit the last two of the shuriken. Thre rest of them slicing at Jin's flesh around his arms and legs trying to disable him.* - Sat Sep 12 08:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) turned his head around to see the black sword being used as nothing more then a paddle. The speed of the swing and the power, left nothing for Jin to do besdies craddle his arms turn to the side and take the blow as best he could. The teenager would be then sent flying off of the battlefield crashing into a lump of useless flesh. Discarded to the way side.* - Sat Sep 12 09:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked up measuring the distance from where his body was... and where he currently is. "I didn't think that was humanly possible." he then managed to get back up on two legs, rubbing his aching arms. "Well at least-" he then paused, and looked up hearing a familiar voice. <Oh fuck... hes back.> He thinks to himself,  <Well Lera is much better then Kiere, so she'll be fine with him.> He then starting looking around wondering if his guards were in sight.* - Sat Sep 12 10:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What...Happened here..? - Sat Sep 12 10:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) let out an exhale of relief, as he rubbed his forehead clear of the sweat from his work out. He then looked over to Himura. "Training with Tethys..." He then paused saying loud enough for Lera to hear. "And, another visit from the Gezo Prince." Turning to look over to the blonde man, as he wiped off the dust and grass clinging to his clothes.* - Sat Sep 12 10:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Training with Tethys huh? - Sat Sep 12 10:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looks over to Seisuke, giving him a rather challanging glare with a frown going across his face. 

"Yep, thats him..." 

He then looked over to Himura, not really knowing what he knew but explaining in a lower voice. "Though, hes just some Gezo representive, prince of their favorite village."* - Sat Sep 12 10:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see, So he isn't actually Gezo. - Sat Sep 12 10:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) straightened up watching Seisuke, crossing his arms across his chest. "Just a simple guest, huh." He said remembering his attitude the last time he was here. "So have you put yourself on the level of us, Mongrels?" He asked out loudly not really concerned with pulling the rug out of Seisuke's act. His head still flashing back to the Prince who was unconcerned with whatever he did against him. * - Sat Sep 12 10:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: ...He's staying here...Everyday there is a new reason for me to leave... - Sat Sep 12 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the prince listening to him return his comments back at him. "I remember the rude one, calling one of my fellow shinobi's a whore. Then telling my superior that he was a failure at his mission. Missions that he is willing to risk his life for, and then calling us Mongrels. If you want to apologize, go bow your head to those two. Because thats the only proper way to do so to your hosts, and then I'll put the past behind me." He gave his final words, before turning away from the Prince.

He then walked behind Lera, stepping in the mud. Sticking his hands inside of it. Trying to find his bag and the supplies he had that got swept up in the mud. <Tethys, you had to make a mess.>* - Sat Sep 12 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh, I can help you with that Jin. - Sat Sep 12 11:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took the mud covered bag, shaking it off of the extra debris. "Thanks, Lera." he said putting back on his person.* - Sat Sep 12 11:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked up to the Prince, as he spoke his words to him. When his whisper hit his ears, barely coasting on the ride of the breeze. Eyes lifting for a moment before going back to a slant. He then looked over to the Prince, before taking a step away splashing further in the mood he then stopped. Turning around to whisper back at him. "I don't care what you have to say to me, but... If you do anything to harm this village or anyone in it. Tethys won't be the person you'll have to worry about."  He was lest hidden, about leaning in to tell him. However, he still kept the hush tone. 

He then continued on his way, too aggrivated to hear what Himura had asked him. Taking a few steps back to the village.* - Sat Sep 12 11:18:36 2015
