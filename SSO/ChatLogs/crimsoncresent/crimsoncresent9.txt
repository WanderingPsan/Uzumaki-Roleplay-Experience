<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the laughing man who could hold back his crackling voice. The snapping of his bones provided only an eerie back drop to his insanity. Him speaking his words though didn't make Jin flinch at all until he pointed to Koeki, were he frowned at his words. 

He then looks over to Erebus. "I have don't anything worth respecting, thats my issue. All I've done is my job and nothing more, what I've seen is praising me for doing such. I just wish to do that which outside my normal limits, and manage to accomplish it. You can laugh at my goals, they're my convictions and they won't change because someone laughs at them or points out their flaws. Because, I know how dumb it is. But, its my choice. A choice that I'm not going to die until I accomplish it."

He takes a breathe. "The only thing I have to say that your wrong about is Koeki. Tethys is the one that chose her to lead, I have complete faith in his judgement. And, I'll continue to do so far past his death. I believe if anyone has the right to lead its her, and if anyone has even the smallest chance of beating Zetsumo. It will be her and the rest of our forces. And, I'll support it all the way."* - Sat Sep 19 01:54:59 2015
