<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took a moment before taking a breathe. It really was nice to sit back, and get a view on the village. She curved her mouth into a wide smile. She truly felt on the inside guilty of worring everyone. On the other hand, she didn't expect so many people to care about her disappearence. It was a warm feeling in the bottom of her heart. She was sure everyone only cared because they were a good person, and wished to repay all of them back someday.

Getting an almost energized feeling from positivity, the girl then looked at her sword. She looked around to make sure none of the people who be concerned would notice as she began to do several hand seals. She then placed her hand on the sword on her lap. Her chakra slowly leaking out across it, into a extended layer of chakra. Using her energy from there, she began to constrict the chakra into the blade. The energy becoming a harden and solidified surface of the sword. She then secretly held it, while she sat. <A little bit of training won't be too bad, right~>* - Wed Nov 18 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Must be karma for trying to attack me earlier. - Wed Nov 18 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the news the Tetsumi, was dead. She had no clue... did it happen while she was captured... what explosion were they talking about?  Questions were running through her head until they all stopped, Tetsumi is gone. The girl cuffed her mouth, as she let out a gasp. However, she couldn't react as badly as little Izanami.

She just put down her hand, placing it on her lap. Her head tilted down, as the little girl's protest and acceptence of her brother's face was announced. Chikyu bit on her own lip. A cold chill ran up her body, that was the first friend she lost. Even if he was asking broody the last time she saw him, she wanted to... at least have a chance to cheer him up again.

She then began to wonder what would've happened if she didn't make it back to the village. Her fingers curled, nails digging into the top of her hand. Her eyes checking the dark spots of her bondage. Her head tilted leaving a shadow over her eyes, bangs blocking most of her view.  The traces of the whip that had hit her was wiped off from the healing. However, the stinging fear they left her as it shaved off the layers of her flesh began to boil itself up again.

<Could... I have helped save him? No... I'm too weak... Were people that could've helped him out saving me? Is it my fault... No...No... its not its just... why did something have to happen now. I just go back to the village... I just wanted to say hi to everyone one more time... I .. I..j-just wanted things to go back to the way they were.. I thought I could go back with a smile...but now I've lost something that I can't get back.>* - Wed Nov 18 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm sorry Chikyu. - Wed Nov 18 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked up, ad gave a clearly fake smile. Shaking her head, "I'm okay. Don't worry about it... just the shock got me. It happens all the time in ninja world." She said leaning up, and taking a breathe to rebuild her persona. It was just... two emotional events already hitting each other one in a row. It was just a bit too much for even the normally optimistic Chikyu.* - Wed Nov 18 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks over to Ai, waving her off. "I'm fine...I promise..."She leans over and whispers. "She'll probably need you more. I wasn't even all that close to Tetsumi." She said, sitting back down in.  Easing up a smile that seemed slightly more natural, though she began to feel queasy in her stomach.* - Wed Nov 18 10:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) takes a seat, and stretches her legs out in front of her. Her arms reaching back behind her, as she lets out a sigh.* - Wed Nov 18 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I wasn't just checking up on you randomly by the way, I noticed you were friends with Rias so I just thought...I dunno, Just wanted to make sure you were ok I guess. - Wed Nov 18 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pauses for a moment, looking at him then going. "Oh!" She then elbows him in the side a few times, with enough strength to be a spike of pain. Her recovery was going well. She then gave him a dark teasing smirk, her eyebrows bouncing up an down. "Got a thing for Rias, Ehh? By getting friendly with me, you were hoping  I would hook you two up?" * - Wed Nov 18 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) leans back laughing. "Aww, she turned you down, buddy? Thats too bad, at least you had the courage to go say something though." She then practically ignores his latter statements of concern for a friend of Rias to just go on about Akira and Rias. "So, what do you like about her? She is pretty smart and friendly! Or, maybe you're a bit more shallow, hahaha!"* - Wed Nov 18 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gives him a thumbs up on the beutiful part. "Ah well, maybe if you spend some time together. You may find she begins to like you, or theres someone better you can chase after. Don't get too single minded on this stuff! One must be vigilant on the hunt for girls, at least... thats what my Dad said anyways. And, He only ever went out with my mom."* - Wed Nov 18 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks over and listens to him, as he talks. "Well, its great to hear that she has a friend from the same village. Most people don't even get to ever see their friends once they move.  And if she doesn't want anyone right now, then that just means she really considerate about her relationships which is great as well." she said.

When he started speaking about the older woman, she began to cross her arms. Her head silently nodding up and down with closed eyes a frown going across her facfe. She then responded "Yeah, their are so many older woman. But, they all look so young and beautiful. Its so cruel, isn't it!"* - Wed Nov 18 17:20:12 2015
