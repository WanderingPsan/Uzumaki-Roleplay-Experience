<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) came back from the unnerving sight of Tribus's carnaged cover body. A sight that made the normally iron gut Chikyu feel queesy. Still, she had her own things to do. Slipping the six shuriken she had got for training this. She really was never of a fan of these small things, and didn't have much of a good throwing one. When she started learning to use them in the academy, she could only manage to lift the sword with two hands meaning that it was impossible to use shurikens along with it. Though, this time things were slightly different.

She then sat down along the lines of the edge of the unbroken training wall. Pulling open the scroll to the shadow shuriken jutsu. She pulled open the scroll, and read the next simple move that was sealed into the scroll. She read the basic overview, and got a pretty good understanding of the techinique. Just simply throwing a shuriken behind another; however, this was a little bit more complicated then that. However, it was the basic understanding she got from it.

Rubbing the side of her head, the genin continued to read in to what she assumed would be some basic techiniques. Those she was rather put out of place by a sudden advanced list of terminology. Velocity, angles, light reflections, and many other mentions of how to actually accomplish this feat. Which required a lot of thinking before one throws their weaponary, and have it avoid detection from their opponent.

The genin scratched her head, reading the information for several times in a row. Chikyu's eyes rolling over the lines several times over. Only pulling bits and pieces of information from her readings. Like gather pieces of a puzzle, she slowly began to fit these bits and bites of the jutsu together. She began to gather a better idea of how to do the jutsu, though it was still difficult how one was supposed to figure this all out in the middle of battle. Guess thats what practice was all about.

The genin took up her hands, rubbing the sides of her temples on her head. She continuied to press the blood flowing into her skull. She felt a little relief in the throbbing mental pain she was suffering at the moment. Pausing, she took a breathe before diving back into the jutsu scroll. Eyes razing down several sentences at a time, as she continued to go through the information. 

Finally, all of what she read was slowly beginning to take a spot in her mind. Her head figuring out how to play it out in her mind. Hidiing the second shuriken, just before she threw the first. The opponent's attention diverted to the most current threat, lets her throw the second shuriken. The second shuriken should be thrown below the first shuriken so its less obvious to the opponents sight. That way, they might dodge the first shuriken but the second can possibly hit with a good predicted strike.* - Sun Nov  1 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) finished reading the scroll sliding it away, as she let out a sigh. Head still slightly pounding, as she felt the pain from focusing so much on all those lists of words. She kind of just wished the woman just taught her.* - Sun Nov  1 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: How does he know everyone's name? I've been around longer than him! - Sun Nov  1 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looks over to Kilm and the sudden talking Racoon that was sitting on his shoulders. She quickly pulled out her giant sword with one hand, her arm waving it up an down wildly. "Ahhh! That beaver knew my name! Can it read my mind!?!" Completely ignoring the fact, the 'beaver' also was talking. Her arm continously waving to detur Kilm and the Racoon to get any closer.* - Sun Nov  1 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) brings down her sword the moment Nina gets in the way. Her weapon dropping, as she raises her free arm behind her head scratching it. She lets out a loud laugh, "Oh is that it! Sorry for the outburst then." She says lifting her head up, and chuckling to her self. The sword still hanging in her grasp, though no longer poised to attack.* - Sun Nov  1 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) doesn't even respond, as the racoon starts scaling up her body. Claws probably digging in to all the bare skin. Oonce, he reaches up to her shoulder a nice place to rest.  She stretches out a hand to the beast, she was yelling at awhile ago. Grabbing one its paws, and shaking it violently. "Nice to meet you, Mister racoon."* - Sun Nov  1 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: See? Isn't that all better? - Sun Nov  1 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly begins to vibrate, as she is clearly out matched by the racoon. Her voice being lost to how fast her body was thrown around, by the racoon's grips. Hand bruising as the paws dig into her.* - Sun Nov  1 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) begins waving off the burning hand that was taken for a trip with his hand shake. Her head nods to his exclamation of her profession, as she happily agrees. "Thats right! My dad has been teaching me since I was very little." She says, feeling completely fine as she rested back on his shoulders. The dandy racoon having a nice place to enjoy his tea and crumpet times. "What about you?"* - Sun Nov  1 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) laughs slightly "Well everyone has their calling Mr. Raccoon. While, its sad we don't share the same practice. It doesn't mean, we can't learn from each other. Most martial arts are ones from immiation, so maybe once and awhile we'll see something in each other we can take into our own person." She says, accepting his invite to be friends.

 The swordsman then turns as Nina comes over slightly recoiling back, as she sticks her tongue out. She frowns for a moment, until she begins to mention the sword and pulls out her own. The tanned girl then waves her sword in front of Nina. "Hehe, mines bigger then yours." She teases sticking out her own tongue, waving the bright clean large steel blade next to Nina's katana.* - Sun Nov  1 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe...I'm sure I'll learn a lot if you are as great of a teacher as you say you are. Whether it be through you, or maybe one of your students. - Sun Nov  1 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Training is always more then just physically building up strength, it includes character as well. - Sun Nov  1 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over shaking her head, as the girl waved around the katana. "Yeah right!"* - Sun Nov  1 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course, earth is a great teacher. Though, it takes some truly special to get lessons out of it. My father told me about many fighting styles based off animals, but watching snakes and lizards fight didn't teach me much. Though, I've never been that good of a learner! - Sun Nov  1 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: Hm, I guess I've been replaced already. Gosh. - Sun Nov  1 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe, thats getting way above my head. Though, I believe you two must be very strong. My hand still stings from your handshake. I'm already glad, you are my friend and not my enemy. - Sun Nov  1 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wow theres a lot of racoons out. - Sun Nov  1 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: When I wanna have fun, they want to talk about training. When I want to train, they want to sit around and talk. Awesome.... - Sun Nov  1 13:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Nina letting out a little puff of air. "I guess, I could take a break from training. I got a lot to do, but I can make room for a single spar." She says waving her sword side to side. <I was just about to actually get to practicing my jutsu, but a good work out wouldn't be too bad at the moment... Besides she looks so sad.>* - Sun Nov  1 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) walked over to Nina kneeling down to eye level, closing her eyes as she smiled. "I said it was fine. Besides, all I did yesterday and today was read a bunch of boring scrolls. A good bit of fun is what I really need."* - Sun Nov  1 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stood back up, as she then waved the giant sword over Nina's head. "I thought you said you wanted a spar! A good clash with swords is always fun..." she then drops it to her side, as she puts a finger on her chin. "Unless, you want to do something else."* - Sun Nov  1 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took her own steps pacing herself away from Nina, as she bows her head for a moment to her sparring partner. She then grabs the large sword, and then actually holds it out in a rather proper stance. A leg extended in front of her with another held pressed against the ground. She gives the sword a few gentle flicks up and down in front of her to test her position, she then nods with satsifaction. 

"Whenever, you're ready." She says, to Nina the grip tightening on her sword.* - Sun Nov  1 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was taught since youth never to underestimate anyone. You treat everyone you meet with a hardy handshake, because that is how a warrior greets. The blade was no game to Chikyu even through her airheaded nature. The moment she agreed to a spar, she would take it as serious as she could. Eyes narrowing on the girl younger then even her. She had learned many tricks, but she would only use those that she truly mastered. So, she wouldn't falter. 

Normally, she was the one would try and act first. However, her grip tensed the moment Nina began to move forward. Chikyu immeaditly ready her weapon, showing her own profciency with the blade as she hit met the blade at angle with the wide sides of her blade, using its weight to push aside the smaller sword. Then, she follow it up by dragging the blade down in an attempt to meet the edge with its opponents shoulder. * - Sun Nov  1 14:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched the girl swiftly dodge under the hefty blade, which followed the path of gravity it was set on until crashed into the earth. The girl having the perfect time to  get a cut at the exposed warriors legs. Which made her grimace for a moment, but it wasn't the first time she bled in a spar before. The sword then was swung sideways, edge scraping a mark across the sandy ground. The large spine of the blade attempting to collide with Nina.* - Sun Nov  1 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watched her blade get stopped at once by the girl using just one of her arms. Which was an impressive enough feat one its own. However, when the girl looked to Chikyu with a grin she be met only by the face of a serious fighter. Eyes focused on to Nina's neck, as one of Chikyu's hands left the handle of her sword. It woudl reer back, Chikyu had no intention on using her recently learned techiniques in a spar but noted she had no way to fight the opponent otherwise. Suddenly, the hand shot out with all fingers held together aiming to strike Nina in the neck with only the intent to stun her.* - Sun Nov  1 14:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) quickly pulls her sword out of the dirt, turning around to go back to facing the opponent. When, she witnessed the tornado being suddenly formed in front of her very eyes. She first stared at it with a bit of worry, taking a jump back as it continued to grow. Then, a thought spiked e in her mind. She then brought her sword up over her shoulder. She looked like in an almost kendo esque stance, with blade curled behind her head and legs in proper stance. However, she then stamped a foot forward pushing her body forward completely.

The massive chunk of steel collided in the ground just between her and the tornado. In attempt to bring up a cloud of sand, to be taken in by the gust hoping it would spread it out in a screen of dust. * - Sun Nov  1 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think I'm going. - Sun Nov  1 15:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later. - Sun Nov  1 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) waited for just a moment for the sand to cloud the tornado up. She waited just before the tornado hit her. Hoping the wall of sand she just brought up covered her next move. Dropping her sword to the side. She then took a step back, and then rushing forward  with a very long jump. If she wasn't taken in by the winds of the tornado, and managed to push her way through it. She come out in the classic Dynamic entry pose attempting to suprise Nina with the jump kick. * - Sun Nov  1 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Wha-wha-wha-whaaaa!" The girl let out, as she was spun round and round in the tornado. Her being then tossed aside to be thrown down in the thankfully soft sand. Her eyes spinning circles over and over, as she tried to find some balance only to be covered in a stunning mud. Where, she was helpless to escape.* - Sun Nov  1 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe, looks like I win.~ - Sun Nov  1 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gets pulled back up thanks to Nina, as she gets up she shakes her head several times trying to throw off the daze. Once she gets her senses back, she looks over to Nina "I surrender, your too strong for me. Hahaha!"* - Sun Nov  1 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hehe. You'll get better. - Sun Nov  1 15:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stands still for a moment, pulling out the information of one of the many attacks she learned the other day. The genin pulling back her arm looked in front of her. Her eyes slanting taking to the power of her mind, bringing for the figure of a fighter in front of her. Her arm tensing for a moment, as she got in the prepared position to strike. Her fingers clenched tightly together to help the width and strength of the hit. She then shot out her hand like that of a snake, flying it forwards under the neck of the shadowy figure in her head.

She pulled back her hand, feeling disastified with her imaginary hit. The kunochi looking at her hand felt it was too slow and the strike far too shallow. She pulled back her own hand, rubbing her own throat. The swordsgirl lifting up her chin, as she began to poke at her vulnerable spot. Fingers tapping along the line of the structure of her throat prodding at her weak spots. She then got a hold of the one she was aiming for, then lowering her chin to a normal position. The space much harder to get to, and folds in her skin giving some slight protection.

She peeled off the finger tips that she had stuck to her own neck. She then held out her arm noting the the length she could comfortably extend it. Her mind then marked off the tips of her fingers, the length she need to proficently jab in to make the hit really dig into the opponent. The kind the words in the scroll really described that could be a powerful stunning blow. Her feet extended, and her legs dug themselves a tight position. She then jutted out her arm several times marking her range.

The girl then began to prepare her hand, clenching tigheter. Her hand forging itself into an iron pike. She then pulled back her hand, eye matching the throat of her makeshift opponent. She then threw her hand out as quickly as she could. Her arm sliding out to attack in a straight motion. She pulled back with a "Tsk!" from being off her target. She held her hand to her side for a moment, before sending out the hand several times over. Each time, she could just feel the slight movements of her opponent that could throw off the move.

A twitch of the neck or move to the side it was hard to hit such an exact spot on someone. She then flashed back to a blurred memor of Nina just out right dodging the attack. Biting her lip as she pouted for a moment "Gah... I really was out matched there..." She then acknowledged the other possiblility of someone just dodging the hit. However, there was little she could do when someone was that quick enough to dodge a close ranged attack like this. It was just something that one couldn't control.

Recoiled her arm quickly for a moment, the girl then shoot it out with a tense force located to a single point out her flat hand. She then once again recoiled the attack, brining her whole arm back to her side. She repeated this several times, her arm shooting out rapid fire as she continued to try and improve her strike. Soon, the moment she had 'cocked' her arm she was already shooting it out in a quick stroke. She continuined over and over until eventually her shoulder began to get sore from being pulled at so much.* - Sun Nov  1 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued the training even with her sore arm and ignoring the new two comers into the training grounds. She stayed focus, teeth bitting down on themselves with frustration. Her arm continuing to grow all the more sore at her joints, and she continuined to throw her hand out with violent force. With each strike, the girl pressed harder on herself to dig deeper. The kunochi trying to turn her hands into the clenching fangs of a wild animal.

She threw out more and more of the strikes. Her hands striking out as far she can. The attacks desperately reaching to hit deeply into the imaginary body she was practicing on. Then, there came an attempt that the kunochi could be proud of. Just as her arm retracted back, she shot out her hand straight like a lance. Her feet digging in, as she leaned her body forward to press in on the attack. She took a pause holding the stance of her held out hand, before taking a step back. Her arm falling to the side resting itself after accomplishing its task.* - Sun Nov  1 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stood in the training grounds, planting her sword in vertically in front of her. Tip buried several inches into the earth. The blade was held firm in its position, as the female ninja faced it like a training pole. Following the basis of the techinique, she extended her right arm. She slowly began to rotate the arm, hitting into the handle with light tap. Then pulling her arm back, where she then striked with her left arm with a quick punch.

She then switched sides with her right arms, hitting the handle from the opposite direction. She then once again followed with another strike from her left arm. The kunochi continued to switch side after side, after each hit knocked against the leather covered grip. Her legs and arms adjusting after each blow, stepping back and forth to adjust distance and draw power from their stance. 

Her arm hitting the handle just below her wrist, pushing against the blade rather then really hitting it. "HHhaaa!" she yelled as she then striked another hit into the air. The girl was completely lost in this simple back and forth. Her right arm moving on its own, as she adjusted how hard and where shoot took her attack. The limb itself quickly noting that the further up the handle she hit the easier it was to shift the handle.

Soon, the motions of flipping her arm back and forth for different sides of deflection became more easier for her. Her mind slowly recognizing the movement to be something of natural use to her. Arms easily generating enough force to shift the sword in the sand, only to be corrected by a gentle push from the other side. The sword then began to waggle back and forth, being knocked around by her directed attacks.

She pulled back, after smacking the leather handle once more. She then grabbed the blade. She tugged on the blade, tilting the blade almost ninty degrees to the right. Her arm then began to attempt to push the blade at the awkward angle. It was easy to push the handle away, from shifting to the left. However, the right which her right arm would be most of the time was extremely difficult. Her arm having a hard time effectively pushing it with enough force to deflect an attack.

The girl gave up even trying to divert from the left, and focused on doing it all from the right. Her arm burning as it was continually rubbing agains the same spot over and over. Her arm attempting to swing at different angles trying to find something that felt appropriate to push it away. Soon, she just gave up getting the understanding that not every attack can be deflected. Chikyu guessed it wasn't the ultimate defensive manuever, and she would need to learn some others to support these uncovered angles.

She then flipped the position of the sword, pulling it to ninenty degrees to the left this time. It was almost laughably easy to push the sword away from her. She could also note if it really was an attack, she could turn into the attack to help avoid it. Though, she quickly gained an easy grasp on this angle. She continued just to ease her arm that was rubbed sore from hitting it on the previous angle so many times.

Gave a last shot, the only angle she thought the techinique could also work with this techinque. She tugged on the sword pulling it out of the earth. She then stabbed it coming towards herself like it was a sort of overhead attack. The angle leaning towards her. The kunochi then spent several minutes hitting the angle, gently pushing it at different sides. Noting it was slightly difficult to push it off an attack like this. But, she could feel it was possible making sure she did enough attempts that she could do ti when the time comes.* - Mon Nov  2 12:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) holds up a finger with a open smile. "That, if he died he couldn't get girlsl! And only those who become strong get girls, so he trained until he became strong enough to get my mother's attention!" * - Mon Nov  2 21:36:12 2015

A nindo..whats that?" her neck leaning to the side, as her eyes stare out in confusion.* - Mon Nov  2 21:40:28 2015

"I love Sunagakure, and so I have to protect it so I became a ninja. And if I'm a ninja, its my responsiblity to get strong and protect the village from danger." She then points to Yan. "Like my dad said, if a farmer doesn't work the crops every day, who will eat?! If a swordsman doesn't train to get strong, who will he protect?!" * - Mon Nov  2 21:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That just means you should try to get stronger. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I couldn't save my best friend or my brother. They are both dead because I wasn't there to protect them. Now I've devoted my life to becoming stronger so that no one else will be killed needlessly. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I suppose so, but even if you get stronger, you can't stop everyone. - Mon Nov  2 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And that's why you have an entire village to help you. Many of us who settled back into Sand have worked tirelessly to create a safe enviroment...We are the most stable village in the entire world at the moment. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, you could train me if you'd like, but I'd rather have a friend to hang out with too. - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its quite rude to try and use training, as an excuse to break a conversation! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Haha well..That is true.. - Mon Nov  2 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) woke up after falling asleep before she actually performed yesterday's training. To make this up, she quickly took to working after she found herself waking up. Walking all the way back out to the training grounds, giving herself a little stretch to get her body ready to rev up. She then took off her sword, and leaned it up against the rocky walls of the training grounds. She then took her stance, poised for her training.

The swordsman hopped for a moment on her space of the grounds, loosening her joints. She then paused for a single second, bringing up her right leg swinging it a high kick. She attempted to bring it up to eye level, but only managed to get it about neck high. She then tried to follow it with the left kick. However, the moment she tried to bring up her left. She lost her balance, her lower body being push into two different directions. Her body being pulled backwards, as she falls down being cushioned by the bespeckled sand.

She slowly pulled herself back on her feet. Her mouth turning into a pout, as she shook her head. The genin quickly took back to her feet, and she quickly stamps a foot forward using it as a place hold for all her weight. She brings up another foot up in the air, going past over his head. The girl then quickly pulled back the leg. She then put that foot on the ground, as she then swiped the dirt with a kick of her left. However, the left swipe was barely strong enough to brush the sand. Her body completely out of whack, as she hops awkwardly on one leg afterwards until she put her left foot back down on the dirt.

Stood still, her eyes and brow furrowed in frustration at the techinique that was getting her so hanged up. She wasn't having any of it though, as she steeled herself for another attempt. She pulled back her right leg, the sole of her white boots dragging a line in the sand. She then kicked up the silicone particles, as she swung the same leg back into the air. She then, as quick as she could, dropped the leg back on to the earth. The left leg of the swordsman then came out, flying low enough to where they would hit an enemy in the ankles. While she did manage to stay upright, she still didn't like the level of power in her attacks.

Biting her own lip, the girl began to grow frustrated. This was a hard techinique for her, she insulted herself for not doing more body training until now. Still, Chikyu wouldn't dare give up on this. She wouldn't give up on anything, especially when she was given this techinique to train with. She slapped off the sand that still clung to her from her first fall. She gave a few punches and kicks outwards, burning some fuel. Her goal to shake herself awake, and give full attention to embedding this techinique into her skull.

Tenses for a moment, her body nerves spiking with electrical signals. She took another high swing with her leg. However, she then pulled this attack back down without following it up with another. The genin then began to do a series of high kicks. The girls right began to shoot up, every so often with an intense burst of movement. Her foot barely touching the ground for only a few seconds at a time, before it was lifted for another kick. 

The girl continued to dig her left foot into the ground, as her body used it as its only support. Her leg striking over and over, as Chikyu gets far more used to supporting her body with that leg. She then switched stances, her right leg supporting her body now. The left leg then begining to swipe in low kicks. Her body adapting to the change in shift of her body's center of gravity.

Chikyu continued to push herself until her right leg began to cramp form holding her up for so long. The girl taking a few steps back to lean against the back wall of the training grounds. Even in the cool twilight before morning, the girl was beginning to feel the heat of her work out. The sweat dripping off ever portion of her exposed body. She leaned forward over her waist, hands pressing  on her knees. Her chest rising up and down, breathing to fill her body back with oxygen. The resting only made her begin to notice the burn of the lactic acid from within her muscles. 

While the stings from inside her muscles told her to stop, the girl simply ignored them. Pushing off of the rock wall, the girl walked back to the stamped ground that she had been training there all this time. She then got back to what she was doing from the start. Her right leg raising up to strike across the air in front of her. Only to quickly pull it back, her weight shifting on to her right leg as she sweeps across  the ground.

The girl could feel herself grasp a hold on the techinique. Her legs becoming swifter at switching back and forth balance so easily. She then pulled back her right leg, swining it high again. This time though, she strikes several time with it. Kick horozontally and then jutting it out once before rearing back. She then comes back in with the normal finisher of a kick down towards the leg region. She then pulls back, stepping away a few feet. Her body utterly exhausted from the extensive training.* - Tue Nov  3 12:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) felt a great sense of relief after her recovering her strength. She felt all the more ready to begin training once again. She went back to claiming her marked spot in the training ground, which was littered with her foot steps. Her body quickly getting back into the groove of training, with her right leg quickly raising up. Her leg then traveling sideways cutting over to the height of her eyes, before she quickly drops it down to her other side. Her left leg then lifting up, twisting her body into the real attack a left round house.

With ease, she was already getting back into her rhythm. Her body doing the motions of the jutsu with little trouble. Though, she kept her eyes peeled to look out for any mistakes. The genin aiming to correct her smallest of errors. Her stance constantly shifting in the sand, as she made these adjustments. Her body itself working on building the muscle and memory for the techinique. Both her legs being pushed to carry the body and attack by just a single limb. 

Her top body was also beginning to slowly work with the techinique. The genin's torso was starting to rock back and forth with the hits. Unknowningly, the girl began to help increase her balance by shifting her abdomen. Her attacks becoming more agile and easily switched. The techinique was based on feints and attacking the opponent least expected it. This was good that she became to pull out more subtle movements, as it means all the more surprise to the attack.

She continued to push her limits, picking up the pace. Her right leg kicking multiple times. Stopping every so often as a feint, she then tried to switch at any moment in her combination of kicks into her left sweep. There were notable awkward pauses, as she tried to change her normal feints. The attacks coming out with awkward pauses and slight shakes of her balance. She still needed to work on it, as it was clear she couldn't be throwing this out in the middle of a battle.

Her body continued to float lightly, her right leg still being lifted into the air to kick into empty space. Her left leg being a still steel holder for the rest of her body. Every so often, her right leg would stop in mid-air. Where she then drop it, switching to using it as her holder. Her left leg kicking out a few several times. She then go back to leaning up on her left leg, and going back to kicking with her right.

The genin's foot prints began to deepen their impression in the sands. Both her feet stomping back and forth on the same spots. Her body beginning to sting once more from exhaustion. The strain of her leg muscles, made it feel as if they were turning into cement blocks. Her kicks increasing in difficulty thanks purely to this. Still, Chikyu was a tough girl biting down her teeth, not letting agony get in her way.

Her body began to let out rough growls and yells, as she began to try pull more out of her body. Her feet beginning to feel nothing more then weights. She still forced forwardi n her training. Still managing, she began to blow up the sand each time she brought her foot down. Foot prints, became small pits in the earth thanks to her repetitious movement. 

Soon, she began to slow down. Her ability to manage her center of gravity slowly lost. Her kicks were being dragged down by gravity. Chikyu still tried to be persistent with her training; however, her next kick nearly made her fall down back on her rear. She stopped dropping any efforts to even stand up. Her butt landing into the sand, as she crossed her legs waiting for her body's energy to recover.* - Tue Nov  3 15:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But made entirely out of spicy materials. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) listens to Ketsuki's laugh, as she tilts her head. Ketsuki's words confuse the swordswoman for a moment. She then gasps "Wait...is he talking about 'that' kind of physical exertion?"* - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Bwah! - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nah. - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a double entendre; when you say something that can be interpreted one of two ways, while meaning one but not the other. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So that people THINK you mean the other one. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a kind of joke - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm so confused! - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Since you're only a genin, how much do you want me to hold back? - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: However much you want to, Sanoke.. And Miss. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's challenging us to a fight. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Then, why don't you just say fighitng in the first place!" She says, losing the fight from the start. Her brain is completely fried.* - Wed Nov  4 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because he was trying to do a play on words. - Wed Nov  4 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm gonna...go take a seat. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seems this will be one on one. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So- you mind if I go all out, then? - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That is- if you're holding back, Sanoke. - Wed Nov  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) seems to wake up enough from her mental break down to look up to the fight. "Oh thank heavens, they finally decided to fight." She whispers to her self, rubbign the side of her forehead. She pauses for a moment, wondering who she should root for in this spar. Then, she realizes she has no clue who Ketsuki was, and decides to root for the other person in the fight. She then cusps her hand around, her mouth to should loudly. "YOU CAN TAKE HER, SANOKE! You just have to get her by surprise, by taking her from behind! Your kunai will definately force her to surrender if you get it in a vulnerable spot!" She then crosses her arms happily enjoying giving advice from the side lines.* - Wed Nov  4 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: WHO NEEDS A SHOW? JUST WIN! - Wed Nov  4 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: SHOW HER WHAT YOUR MADE OF! - Wed Nov  4 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gasps, as she sees the move that Ketsuki uses. "Ah, I know that move! I have the same ne. Whooo, go girl!"* - Wed Nov  4 11:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: THE FUCK?! - Wed Nov  4 11:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Is it over? - Wed Nov  4 11:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: NOT 'TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS IT AIN'T!  - Wed Nov  4 11:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, I don't see many fat women in suna. - Wed Nov  4 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't see many fat women period, they all seem to either be Loli's, or mature and beautiful... - Wed Nov  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Uyahh.. - Wed Nov  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Anyway, I guess with me fully immobilized, you've won huh? - Wed Nov  4 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) runs over towards the battlegrounds of the two. She yells out a happy yell "That was amazing!" She says, with both arms extended over her head. She continues running for laughing as she does so, as she goes by Sanoke. She then stops down to the buried Ketsuki.

She reachs a hand out patting her on top of the head. "Haha! Not many people could keep on fighting with a person that out matches them like that. You did pretty well all things concsidered." She says happily casting a shadow over the girl.* - Wed Nov  4 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) leans down, stretching out a finger that pokes at Ketsuki's forehead. "Yeah, but that just means you have a goal to better yourself! They are always someone better, but you can always then just surpass them. Atleast, that is what my dad says."* - Wed Nov  4 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 'Course- you don't think I'd actually give up because of something like this, do you..?! Now seriously.. - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let me outa here! - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..... - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: WHAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!? - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stands up, as she pulls out the giant sword off her back. "Well that just means one thing~" She then plants it in the dirt several inches away from Ketsuki's face. The buried ninja's reflection showing up in the spine of the sword.* - Wed Nov  4 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oy vey... - Wed Nov  4 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gets blown away from explosions. Landing several feet away, and her sword doing circles in the air until it lands flat on to the ground. She leans up, head boggling up and down. What little there was in her skull, was completely rattled up. "Ah-..ha..Means...to dig...yourself up..." She then lands backwards on to the sand.* - Wed Nov  4 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stands up, hands placed on both sides of her head. She gets up, and nods throwing out a shaky thumbs up. "Feelin...greeaaat!"* - Wed Nov  4 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Neither am I. - Wed Nov  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So she's allowed to stay? - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm only allowed to stay fourty eight hours... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) raises a hand to wave a hello to Ume, before dropping her arm. Her feet taking a few steps back and forth. "Thats...rude..." She says pointing to Ume.* - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... Two days, huh..? I'm hre visiting a very close freind... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still, I'm only here for so long myself. It's nice to meet you, regardless- I'm Ketsuki, you are? - Wed Nov  4 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*glances to Chiyku*> Huh? What's rude? -- Wait. . . I think she means the comment about Hassan. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're a wanderer, then? - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Our...Kazekage is....well... I don't know. I haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm from Kirigakure.... it is not safe there. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So a peasant girl was required to meet him...but his own people haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kiri. . .Yeah. I saw one of my friends dead not too long ago. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah..? What happened...? Are you okay..? For that matter- would you like someone to keep you company while you're here? I know that wandering alone can be really unpleasant. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It would have been nice for him to know how I entered the village....he assumed a broke in and it made for a bad first impression. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Damn. She's really friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wow.... that's messed up. I can see why things might have gone poorly, then. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It happens. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I doubt it would change anything.... - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I suppose he said you could gather supplies and get a change of clothes- thus the two days- then leave, huh? - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. He -really- doesn't like strangers. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Coming to his village. And it makes sense. . .sometimes. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I suppose it is true to say that.. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah.... well... considering he expressed he is from Kiri... it was rather insulting to have me turned away so quickly. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Like one time, there was this Bone guy that would come here and randomly threaten to kill people. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: With the village expecting an attack from Genjikaure soon, he's on a bit of a paranoid edge- still, that kind of thing.. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So wait. What precisely is going on in Kirigakure? - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The Mizukage is dead, there is no leader, and Kiri is a shell of it's former self.... I am fine, but it isn't a home. So I have no home. - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I used to live there too-- - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll talk with one of my friends. She'll give us the scoop.. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know who Edge is. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- So wait. If he turned you away, why are you still here? - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He gave me two days I said. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
