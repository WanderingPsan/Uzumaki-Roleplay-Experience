<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) starts off at the first place she can think of, as she heads out to do the mission she was requested. Pulling out her own wallet, she streches it open pulling out the nesscary funds to buy several trash bags. Her face plastered with a smile that couldn't be taken down, knowing as she took the several plastic containers she was helping the village. Honestly, it was a nice break from training and sparring while still doing something that was good for her body. Which was all more then satsifying enough for the swordswoman.

She hung the plastic containers on the handle of her swords, as she slowly walked over to her designated location to do her trash duty. The area was quite large, and she wasn't really a swift person. This was going to be a long job for her, but she shook off the feeling of momentous effort. She just quickly stopped the moment she took a step into her junk domain. She looked side to side, there certainly was a lot ot pick up. The filth was quickly cluttering the sides of the streets. 

The girl pulled off one of the trash bags. Her thumbs slipping into the bag, spreadding it out and puffing it open by flapping it. The air flooding the bag to full expanse. She then leaned down filling her first bag, by hand picking trash off the ground. Grabbing some crumpled papers without worrying about the filth probably spreading onto her hands. She was sure one could splash in her bathtub would solve any unsanitary issues. 

This was the first street on her list wasn't too bad. It was a rather open space so it wasn't surprising that it was a little better kept then most. Her hands reaching to pick some of the more obvious litter. Her hands quickly sweeping up several newspapers, from those that are crumpled up or pages of ads left to the way side. The other notable things she had to sweep up with her hands since she had no tools was hundreds of burnt weed wraps. <I'll never know why they let these be legal in the village.>


The girl then  began to pick up some of the small trash. Wrappers and broken bottles left from careless people. The genin let out a blow of air from her mouth which flew up her forehead to blow up one of her white bangs, sending out the tideous nature of slowly picking up the trash. Her head shaking at how uncaring some people can be at times with their waste. Her fingers still pinching as she slowly picked up the pieces of plastic and glass.

Soon, her bag slowly began to swell at the bottom. The trash quickly flooding the lower half of the bag. The weight beginning to drag her movement down, but she didn't seem to bothered at all by some extra weights. Her body easily rushing to trash pile to pile. The size of the bag continuing to expand until it almost begins to burst from the brim. Chikyu nodding at the overly inflated bag, and quickly takes it to the nearest dump. She then starts slapping her hands to get them visibly clean.

The girl stretched her arms, now free of the debulitating weight of the bag. She then headed off to a street, that she wasn't sure of where to find. She really hadn't heard of it before, walking the open streets. Head turning back and forth, as she examined the roads until she came across it. Her arm went up to cover her nose, shaking at the smell. The road was more like an alleyway trapped between buildings. The shade blocking view of waste left to build up. 

Look down at the large mess, a hand reaching down with slight disgust to pick up a rotting fruit. Only for her to quickly discard it, throwing it back into the disgusting alley floor. The girl looked around to see ashes and bottles flooding the place, along with numerous food sand broken trash bags. Shaking her head, she quickly left...not to quit the mission of course. Instead, she needed tools for this one, even she could see it.

Came back fully prepared for a war against the dirt, the kunochi carrying a giant broom plus a dust pan. The girl quickly begins scraping what she can, the broom sweeping most of the junk on top of the pan. Though, most of the time the dust pan only poured back most of what was sweeped up. It was far too small to carry most of the load. Still, this was far better then Chikyu picking this stuff by hand.
 
The girl began to tie up one bag, as it was quickly filled to the full  That was merely the second, but she was sure the next bag would be filled as well. Resting her tools for the side for a moment, and using the current bags she had to cover up some old ragged bags that must have fallen out of some dumpster. Dropping them while trying to contain most of their current contents into a new sack. Replacing about three bags with a new sack to keep them from just falling apart.

Stopped her clean up for disposal, her hands grabbing the trash bags shes filled so far. Carrying two bags at a time, the girl went to dispose each in some public dumpsters. Chikyu took several trips back and forth, until she was finally cleared up. The girl then stood over what she had left to clean up the alley, and it was a lot. Still, the quick break of carrying trash gave her a bit of a refresh to get back to sweeping up.

The girl grabbed her broom and stomped on her dust pan with her boot to hold it down. The trash being brushed aside in aisles. The pontential for a clean floor shining under now. Most of what she was getting stuffed in the pan were the burnt remains of weed, as it and their ash took up a lot of space just form the build up. It seemed people didn't realize how bad that these things seemed to build up. The rest of the major filth already taken away from her previous trash run.

Looking over her results of this street, the girl nodded her head in approval. She had one last street to go over. She wandered over, stopping by to take a few more bags for the last street. Stocking up was the best way to win as a warrior. She made her way towards it, glad this was one she was more familiar with. Stopping near the street, and noting that it wasn't as bad as the last to say the least.

The girls arms extended out in front of her, as she took a moment to stretch. She spun the broom in between her fingers. She then stopped it, and quickly began to sweep the numerous litter into the piles. Bringing out the pan, as she then push each one of the piles into the pan. Dumping them into the trash bags. The transulcent bags showing the contents slowly fill up.

The street quickly became sparce with even a single mark. The muscular girl had already wiped off even the marks that were left from people's shoes. She took a moment to tie up the bags, standing up proudly as she clapped at her own work. Several bags in a row completely tied up in a rows. She then became a living dumpster truck once again, carrying all the trash to the dump. She was finished with this long task.* - Fri Nov 13 01:52:12 2015
