But that was all she was willing to do, she then went charging her blade hung over her shoulder just like last time. 

However as she came to a stop, she only swung the blade partially down. She then switched hands. Letting go of the blade with her right hand, and pulling the blade to the other side of her body with just her left hand. Where she then attempted to strike Lera's other side with a sideways horozontal swing with her blade. * - Mon Nov 30 15:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) feeling the strikes at her feet the girl would noticably slow down. Her foot placement being more careful and thought out to keep her just from slipping which slowed her down notably. The girl's attempted attack was quickly blocked by Lera moving into her chest. However, the girl was completely thrown off by this, as she reached out with her free hand. Grabbing the Domu armored Lera by the arm, and then using Lera's own mud. Chikyu slid one of her feet down to kick Lera in the leg while pulling on her with the other arm to throw her off to the side instead of having her land directly on Chikyu.

Chikyu by attempting this move, whether or not she successfully managed to counter attack Lera. Would basically fall down on her back. If she successfully managed to knock Lera away, Chikyu would try and roll away to get back up on her own two feet. If not, she quickly guard with her one free arm to protect herself from whatever Lera had in store.* - Mon Nov 30 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) had to roll to the side anways, the clone easly able to come and reach the girl by the time she had stopped. The girl directly knew what these kind of clones could do to a person. She then pulled on her sword, and then instead of stabbing Lera's clone. The girl used her sword sideways to basically slap most of the mud away knowing that it could either quickly reform or be used to seal her movements. Once she slapped the clone away, she quickly began trying to wipe off whatever mud was left so she could respond to Lera's next attack.* - Mon Nov 30 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stood back up on her feet, and faced lera with her sword. She dug her feet in the earth and nodded. "I'm ready for whatever you got, Lera!" She shouted back, and held her sword out. She wanted to see what Lera had in store for her.* - Mon Nov 30 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) began to charge forward, her feet began to flood with chakra as she began using Suimen to get a better hold of the ground. She then held out the point of the sword, and pressed it back against the water. She then began a full charge attempting to lance her way through the water. Her feet kicking up a large amount of sand, as her suimen carried it with each step.* - Mon Nov 30 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) saw the increasing water pressure, stabbing her sword in the ground plus using suimen. She held her place pushing back on the sword, as she tried to keep her position. Chikyu however knew her opponent and that there would be simply no break or chance oppertunity for her to escape. The girl then wove a few seals using the splashing water on the other side of the swords as cover. In a poof of smoke a clone of Chikyu came out. Chikyu holding an open hand, then gave a boost for the clone to then jump over the rushing water, it held out an open arm threatening to punch lera.* - Mon Nov 30 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls out her sword the moment the water cut off attempting to charge and attack Lera when she was preparing to attack the clone. However, she stopped noticing the sudden wave coming at her. She had no response besides sliding her sword back on her back. She then crossed her arms and decided to take the wave full force unable to manage a way to dodge or minimize the blow.* - Mon Nov 30 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) 's clone quickly disappears in a huff of smoke the moment the water touches it. The girl is drenched in the crash waves, and is quickly washed off until she is pushed back into the water. She then stood up coughing and hacking, once the water was cut off. She then stood up, and let out a few breathes. She didn't  know if Lera was done with the spar or not. Chikyu wouldn't mind going, but on the other hand, didn't think Lera be interested in such outscaled match.* - Mon Nov 30 16:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) made her way towards the park. The mission was contracted by a young mother who had taken her child to go play, and had lost her valuable pearl necklace. Chikyu knew this wasn't really a mission she was suited for, and it was rather a dull one with little chance for action. Still, the girl appreciated to help any of the village out, especially for a task as generous as this. She did her task with a smile.

Chikyu first wondered through the sandy park, only a few patches of green here with some rather dirty brown grass, cacti, and lots of tough shrubbery. The girl's eyes gently falling upon the scenery appreciating some variation to the normal dull browns that made up the palette of Sunagakure's usual nature. She also looked hoping she might fetch her eyes upon the pearls, though even she knew that if the pearls were that easy to spot then anybody would've picked them up by now. 

The girl then took a stop, taking an more open eye as she spotted the playground. Her eyes focusing in on the ground and the equpiment. She began to go around the perimeter of the playground. Her head dipping below looking at the benches and sides where a mom might be standing watching her kid. The girl however had no such luck, and then turned to potentially inside the playground for the missing necklace.

The girl quickly climbed up the slides, and then pressed herself below to looking up and down. She then went through the tubes and monkeys bars that made up the jungle gym. Her body squeezing through the entrances and bars that were made for children much smaller then her. She did one last check looking at the dome which proved to also be empty as well.

The girl shook her head, after starring at the play ground. It was completely useless. The necklace simply wasn't here. However, she wouldn't give up just yet. She smiled and gave a small pump with her arms. This gesture to energerize herself, as she then headed down one of the numerous paths of the park. She had never been here before, but certainly it wouldn't take too long to investigate the whole thing and find the necklace. 

The girl wondered one of the many circling paths. The swordsman would stop every several feet to jump into the shrubbery and grass. Without a worry for pride or embarassment, the girl would get on her hands and knees looking for the necklace. The only thing she seemed concerned with was bumping into the cacti. Her whole body always curling far away from each green stump of needles.

The girl stood up continuing go over the trampled paths of other visitors. The girl's hands and knees covered in patches of stained sand. Her hair and armor had leaves sticking out across her body. She was now left to retrack her own foot prints, as she had no knowledge of the place's geography. The retracing was really the worst, as it made her look over the same areas over and over.

The girl then found herself all the way back to the playground. She looked at the area, and shook her head. She then took a seat on the bench. Her head was lifelessly shoved back over the edge of the top of the bench. Her eyes staring nearly straight up to the sky. She closed her eyes, and let out a sigh. Her mind wondering how else could she find the pearls. 

The girl closed her eyes for just a moment, only to be suddenly shook open by a loud "CAAWWW!". She woke flarring her arms out for a moment, as a crow lept off her shiny pommel of her sword. This open the girls eyes, as she watched chich tree the crow landed in. She then used Suimen, and then walked up the bark of the tree. She shoo'd the crow away, and examined its next. There rested the pearls, snatched by the crow. She quickly took them and fell back down on her feet then ran off to complete the mission. A long and power "YYAAAHHOOO!" came out echoing from her.* - Tue Dec  1 02:25:29 2015
