<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) took his normal training spot near the beach, grabbing a group of shuriken out of his pack. He laid them out in front of them, four shining stars now laying out on the ground. Holding out his hands over each of them, he syphons out his own energy to the shuriken that suddenly buzz as they begin to hover. The wind they produce chopping and pressing the bladed grass below. Without even a thought, he sends them all flying upwards hovering in the sky. His hands give small waves sending signals for how the shuriken should travel, having them begin their show.

Each of the automonous ninja weapons flying around, produce a silver line as they cut across the ray of the suns. Their metal deflecting the rays and cutting them in half with their phsyical forms. His hand continues its motions forcing the shuriken to bend to his will. Each one now going to do even more splendid tricks then just simple flight paths. Cutting small leaves off branches, or passing through trees canopies avoiding being lost in the endless collision of branches.

It did help that each shuriken was infused with wind energy, improving their cutting ability and the ease of controlling them. This helped chopped thorugh the tree's thicket of leaves, and pushing themselves successfully out of it multiple times. Gyroscoping them so they rotated their form to slip through smaller areas. Their turns getting sharper, as he waved his hands getting more reaction out of their chakra. Wind bursting under them to the perfect amounts and directions to follow his commands.

Feeling he was finally done with this flight, he held his hands out sending each of the shuriken flying off in four directions from the tree. He then stopped them in mid-air, before making them raise at an angle. They rose and rose, before hand made a circular motion all of them curving back down back on track to the tree. He then clapped his hands asking for the finale. The several thunks of the blade hitting the trunk of the tree happened almost instant. Which each shuriken now embedded in the organism.* - Sun Sep 13 04:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) pullign out each of the shuriken. The genin once again while holding them in his hand, gave life to them with leaking chakra out of his finger tips. The blades taking the energy greedly, before he leaned back with two in each hand then throwing them out over the ocean waters. At first rotating just over the waters, sometimes cutting through the bobbing pointed waves as they moved. The wind pushing them along shown through the trails of water being pushed back in mini-ripples.

He then turned them to face against the rougher ocean winds, his hand still asking them to take full force. Speedinig along even though they were ignoring the flow provided only managed to slow them down. His mind balancing the chakra in each so they manage to continue to float and not over turn against the wind. Not matter how hard it blew its breeze, the flying shuriken were still being reflected hovering over the Ocean's mirror like surface. 

Begin to have each now spin themselves as they stood stationary, before having them now change their trajectory going horozontal with again restiting being pushed back by the wind. They still managed to charge forward only a minor variation on their flight path, as  the wind blowing behind them bursts out slightly diagnol pointing opposite of the beach's breeze. He then has them do a major turn going back towards Jin.

Giving a few more trickes out of them, making the shuriken loop over and over. Having them come so close they barely touch, and then making them do another several turns. He finally ends it with all of them coming right at him. Holding out both his hands, he quickly snatches up all four as they coming flying only stopping at the last second to end up back where they began.* - Sun Sep 13 05:04:25 2015

He slowly did hte one by one, doing all five in total. He then reminded himself of the Godly Wind From the Mountains, the jutsu that led up into this and how he managed to make that one work. Crouching himself preparing for the jutsu he managed to do the hand signs again.  Tiger, Ox, Dog, Rabbit, and Snake	Tiger before he pulled back taking in air sucking the oxygen to inflate his lungs. He then pulled back blowing it all out, chakra infusing as it travels out of his pursed mouth. The wind blasting small waves off of the surface of the water.

Took blew off his first attempt, already rearing back to trying it again. His mouth already giving off a "Whmhhh-" as he takes in more air. Chakra charged inside of him to help him keep in the increasing amount of air. Then, when he felt he was about to pop like a balloon. He released the large volume of air, as he speeds and increases the flow with chakra outwards. The blast of wind cutting up the beach, by picking up the sand in its high movement. The waves once again splitting as the intense typhoon of air blasts through.

Recoiling back, he pulled out a water bottle taking a few gulps as his throat began to dry out from rubbing up against the wind. Feeling slightly refreshed, the genin took back to performing the jutsu again. Sending out the five handseals as fast as he could. He then realed back gaining the air in his lungs to use for the jutsu. He then released it outwards once again in a single streaming breathe. The violent current of his own made gust shot across the splashing waters once again.

Formed the several hand seals, chakra going from his stomach coating around his lungs. The energy seeping inside, as the genin takes in the air around him. Charging up his chakra as he manipulated the wind in his chest with his handseals. He then unleashed the breeze of air, spraying up the water as it came over its surface. The falling mist coming down leaving a small rainbow as it was left reflecting light in the air.

Took a few breathes for his own benefit exhausted out of his own oxygen supply. Once he recovered he was quick to begin the jutsu once more, as he leaned back filling air for the next jutsu. Chest pumping out as he fills his body expand with air and chakra. He then let out opening his mouth wide, teeth barring out as it escaped out of him. The wind charging across the open place of the ocean. Going until it could no longer travel and dispersing to the natural winds of the world.* - Sun Sep 13 06:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) begins building up the Wind Style of the Great Breakthrough. His hands flickering in front of his chest, as he formed the chakra in the center of his torso. He pull back his body sucking in the air. Cheeks inflated along with his lungs. He then let it all release from his body, the wind infused chakra coming out in one major exhale. Blasting out in full force pushing the air back to a notable distortion in the atmosphere as it pushed all the minor debris in it.

Standing back into in another lungful of air inside his chest, and began whipping the handseals. Chakra infusing inside the wind that soon came out of his mouth. The valve on his chest being released the pressure coming out quickly in one large burst. The full air attack coming out in one quick sweep across the surface of the ocean.

Compressing the air inside of him, the genin begins tightening the hold he had on it. Letting the tension continue to increase, as chakra passes through his lungs into the air. He let the release on this whole pile of energy only to have it come out in one sweeping motion. The pushing wind skating over the clean edge. He watched as it quickly disappated and the jutsus effect disappearing as quickly as it came. 

Brining in the wind inside of him once more, Jin began to let it stay inside until he had enough. He then did the hand signs letting the chakra warp the air inside him. Increasing its pontential outburst, as he lets out a pre-emptivbe hiss of moving air from his lips. He then opened up and sent out the larg wind outside traveling down the shore blowing a sandstorm behind in its wake. 

Felt his head feel light, as letting himself take a moment to recover his lungs. His  lungs were feeling like rubber now, already prepared to expand once again. Taking in the air and mixing the chakra, the volatile mixture escape from his mouth. Ribs squeezing as he pushes out the air towards the ocean. The powerful winds going through the waves.* - Sun Sep 13 09:26:24 2015

The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down.

The only notable trait was his hairs rising on the back of his neck and arms. "You then basically clense yourself with that chakra, let it shock your chakra system.

YOU have to be careful at when you look at them, they might activate a trigger on you.. and without a good Genjutsu disappation... you'll be stuck in it." He sighed rubbing his head. "Just head to center of town."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) keeps his hands hanging to the side, his body posture was stiffly held straight up. His face didn't let his frown escape from him one moment, he wasn't one for speeches in the first place but beyond that. He knew what it was signalling. Even if he prepared him for battle, besides facing Baen down or the Prince. This felt much different, and it was getting into his nerves. His mind sparking on what the battle could contian. The thoughts were consuming him in his entirty. He didn't feel prepared. 

He just tried his best to make sure he didn't let people let on, as much as he could. His scowl was an usual expression so hopefully, nobody would take it as normal him. That was all he could hope for. * - Sun Sep 13 20:22:36 2015
