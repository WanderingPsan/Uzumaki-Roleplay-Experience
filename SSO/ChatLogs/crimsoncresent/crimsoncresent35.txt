<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) punched her hand into the open palm of to other hand. She cracked her neck twice back and forth. Chikyu gave the girl a smile, as she nodded.

"Couldn't be feeling any better. Lets have a good spar."* - Thu Dec  3 09:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) reaches behind the back of her head, as she grabs the blade behind her back. She then pulls cuts the air in front of her, as she has slide off completely in front ofher. She then grips both her hands around the handle, and spreads her feet. She then smiles as she prepares to take on MItsunara. Flashing her opponent a quick smile, Chikyu  quickly says "I'll give you the best fight I can give. So, do you mind if I go first." Her blade rattling as her hands tighten around the the leather wrapped handle.* - Thu Dec  3 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let her finished what ever she had to say, and then quickly took the offer of going first. She dug her feet into the ground, and then took off in a burst. Chikyu's steps quickly padding the soft sand in heavy thunks, as she goes at her full speed toward Mitsunara. She comes in quickly stopping far enough away to quickly jab Mitsunara with the tip of Chikyu's sword. The thrust fast and quick, was then followed up with two steps to Mitsunara's side.

Chikyu wasn't done with her assault yet, as she side stepped pulling her blade with ease as if it was light as a dagger. Her feet easily dancing around her opponent in the sand. The fleet girl then pulled back the giant blade in a single motion up over her shoulder. She then took one breathe to fuel her body for the strike, and then went for a horizontal slash that would hit Mitsunara in the lower back full force. The attack was a long cresent slash, hoping that if her opponent wanted to dodge the first attack she stepped into this one or if she tried to dodge the second she get pushed back.* - Thu Dec  3 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) tried to do her best to minimize the attack. She tucks her chin into her neck, and pulls off one hand from her blade to help guard against the attack. The punch was still pretty painful, pushing the damage through her hand into bruising her jaw anyways. The swords girl was then sent flying up into the air, before she landed on all fours on the side of the wall. The girl then stands up straight on the wall, her body parallel to the ground. Chakra surging at her feet helping her balance on the verticle surface. She flashes a smile to her opponent  below wondering if they learned this trick as well.* - Thu Dec  3 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) waves out her sword out in front of her. She chuckled at her opponents ribbing comments. "Not all of us were born with skin as thick as yours. Though, it seems even that advantage is being lost, eh?" She says looking down at the girl's cut dress and grazes. She gave a lengthy grin to herself knowing before, her opponent would merely have shrugged her attacks off unless she went to her utmost extreme.

The girl then holds out her sword, as she slowly climbs down the walls. Her head tilted up to look at her opponent. However, she simply stops half way across the wall. She leans down for a moment, her legs crouched to their lowest extent. She then turns off the flow of chakra to her legs, and leaps off of the wall with the rock cracking behind her.  

The girl's flies at Mitsunara with her sword held out like a guillotene blade. She aimed to  cut the neck of her opponent, as she landed behind them. Following up that attack, she would dig one hand in the ground to hold her body weight and the sword up after the attack. She then spring off a series of kicks the first one being a false strike to the head as if to follow up her previous attempt. She then aim a second kick at her opponent stomach to push them back and give Chikyu time to recover herself.* - Thu Dec  3 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) held her blade out, as the lump of steel wavered from the clash. Still, it didn't stop her from sending those kicks but she quickly pulled out. When she saw her opponent go for another attack. She uses the strength in her arm to basically pull her forward, Chikyu rolling for a moment before turning back around to face her opponent. 

She slowly looked at her opponent, measuring them for a moment. She nodded to herself. If she wanted to really stop her, she have to keep up the string of attacks. She was glad she had gotten used to handling her blade, she wasn't feeling the attack on her stamina as bad from doing all these attacks. The sweat only now beginning to pop up on the side of her  forhead. 

She held her sword out for a moment, and charged again at her opponent. SHe then stopped forming an all to simular pose. Her right foot stomping forward, as her blade thrown way over her head. Following with her entire body, the swords girl wasn't holding back any of its power. She sent the blade crashing down in a powerful strike that would crush the ground itself if it had missed.* - Thu Dec  3 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) completely breaks through the lightning burst with merely the feeling of a tingling sensation across her body. The girl then watched as her attacked was blocked. Chikyu knowing her opponent wouldn't be hamped by such a thing, quickly reached up clenching on top of the opponents hand that held the blade.  Using it as a pivot point, she then began to push the handle of her blade upwards and to the side. Basically, she began to rotate the blade using like a metal bar, all in attempt to strike and misdirect the stabbing katana in front of her. 

If she manage to actually accomplish breaking the next strike. The girl would simply attempt another kick at their opponent to break away from the deadly close range fight. If she failed however, she be easily stabbed in the side effectively losing this fight.* - Thu Dec  3 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) leans over feeling the brute force ot her head, and wavers a bit. She stands up clunching it at the moment. She quickly pulls down her hand to hold her sword seeing, that her opponent clearly wasn't done yet. She then began a charge forward, her blade held to the side as she ran. She then stopped to take one last swing at Mitsunara.* - Thu Dec  3 11:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulls back her blade, the moment shes her opponent actually stop. The girl quickly slides her blade back on her back. She then come sovr to Mitsunara. A hand over her shoulder. "Are you okay, Mitsu?"* - Thu Dec  3 11:46:08 2015

Recovering, she looked over to Lera with a bit of worry "Whats the occassion for coming to a place like this?"* - Thu Dec  3 18:22:56 2015

She just simply lifted up the menu and began to scan.  She asked for some water and whatever sounded good on the menu. Overall, she still felt rather out of place in this kind of establishment. She was just thankful she was wearing her maid outfit instead of the usual armor and sword. * - Thu Dec  3 18:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) nodded her head at his words. She let the two argue it out over the prices, she didn't have the cash to spend on all this shallow and pointlessly flashy stuff. Though, when asked what a maid cafe was she perked up.

"Oh well, Maids are servants of a group of foreigners...thats why this dress is always the same. Its like a uniform. And, since we're going to serve foreign foods as well. I thought it just be appropriate to have maids be the servers. So, thats why we call it a Maid Cafe, since you'll get food served by the Maids." she nods happily coming up with the idea all by herself. She then let out a sigh. "It was really hard to work out all the details. I'm glad I wrote it all down, or else I would forget it all." She says nodding, agreeing with her own statement.* - Thu Dec  3 18:43:24 2015

She could tell it was some form of noodle dish, but she had trouble ever relating it to anything she ate before. She then sucked in her fear, and began to slowly eat it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) brought out her blade. She held it with hand for a moment, before she began to rotate the massive sword with just one hand on the handle. She then began to juggle it back and forth between bot her hands, before stopping the spin right in front of her in her usual stance.  "She nodded, sure." She said the "Rrrghh!' of her leather of her swords handle being pressed on by the pressure of her hand.

With no pause, Chikyu took to a full charge against Momura. She knew her defenses were a little lower then most, but also wouldn't dare estimate her ability  to counter attack. The swordsgirl came charging in front of Momura, before stopping at meduim range doing a quick horozontal sweep in front of her. However, Chikyu only went half way with her arc showing  it to be merely a feint. She pull the sword back switching the blade to the flat width, and used it to basically swat Momura in the legs if she had attempted to dodge.* - Fri Dec  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) had the sword close to her, as she was waiting for Momura's movement to end. She then saw her chance, as the girl went for another attack. Her attack was almost on par with Chikyu's ability to dodge. So, Chikyu didn't see any chance in dodging. Instead, she decided to let both of them take some damage.

Her arm pulling back with her massive blade, she then swiped it at Momura's loer leg like a paddle. When her attack came out it was at the same time as Chikyu's friend swung her fist. Chikyu's attack was slightly faster if the girl chose not to give up on her assault it be much harder to dodge. Chikyu once again aimed for Momura's legs knowing she had the superior advantage in speed, but at the same if Chikyu could cripple that advantage she be in a far better spot. * - Fri Dec  4 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) felt the hit her square in the head, the blood dripping down her forehead was sign that attack was pretty well done. Though, the girl wasn't just done with that noting her opponent was slightly tougher then she was before. The girl swung her sword out in a quick swipe. "Got ya! I'm not going to hold back."  The smoke bomb was something the girl was already familiar with Momura's normal moveset.

She quickly held up her sword jumping back once, using the sword as a shield for now for any shuriken attacks. All the while, the white haired girl closed her eyes. Her mind searching for Momura's position only to glimpse it under the earth. Which quickly made her begin to jump severals times back until she hit the wall and got out of the smoke. There she hold her position with her sword still up, knowing the thick layer of wall behind them should keep Momura's attack directions limited.* - Fri Dec  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) kept her eyes just above her sword which she held in front of her. When, she saw the kunai all she had to do was simply tilt her sword to harmlessly deflect it. Then, her opponent popped out of the ground. Which Chikyu, simply jumped upwards clinging to the walls with Suimen. However, she merely stayed for an instant by then followed up with a jump downwards, a dive straight for Momura. The swordswoman then aimed to flatten her opponent by slamming the width of the sword on top of Momura. * - Fri Dec  4 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) was quickly tossed around. Chikyu immeaditly noticing the difference of Momura's capabilities all of the sudden. The girl quickly landed on her back, as her blade was tossed aside thanks to the burst of strength. She pulled out two shuriken from her satchel and throwed one directly at Momure. The other flew underneath hiding in the shadow of the other. In hopes, it would catch her in surprise as she fell and was dirstracted with the first. 

The watermelon seeds quickly bashed into her after she had dones this. The attack creating a plume of smoke, as she held both her arms up in a guard. However, she seemed take no damage from this at all. Her body completely immune to the weak ninjutsu.

The girl would then spend the rest of time going and picking up her blade quickly, and holding it out in front of her. She kept her eyes locked on to Momura, and her feet light on the ground. She couldn't take one of Momura's punches head on anymore. She had to keep loose on her feet to dodge or do another trade attack. Where her slightly faster attacks might give her the edge in the conflict.* - Fri Dec  4 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) held back her blade, she knew was going to attack switching her sword to hold it with guard and the blade vertical. She took merely one step back it was all the time she had to do. She then used the range of her sword and her skillful ease at using it to swing out in front of her. Using the full range at its advantage,  she attempted to try to keep Momura to give up her charge or use her enchanced strength to stop the attack.* - Fri Dec  4 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) when her sword hit there was a crack that formed on her blade. The girl had raised her foot aiming to kick Momura way. However, her eyes completley turned away from Momura. Her body's defenses on the lowest point ever. The less punch knocked the wind out of her surely. "MIROSE- ARRGGGHHH!" let out an agonizing scream. Despite the yell of pain, the blow to her sword seemed so much more damaging to the girl then the actual hit on herself. The girl was sent flying away, as the cracked sword. landing not to far in front of her.

The girl coughed up and hacked, as her stomach felt caved in. The girl writhed on the dusty ground for a moment. However whatever strength she recovered that moment went to her sword, the girl raising an arm and pulling herself to it. "No.no..no no..."* - Fri Dec  4 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) pulled herself to the blade, and manage to atleast get on her knees. The pain in her chest made her lean over letting out a gagging gasp of pain. Still, her watering eyes were focused on the blade at hand. She quickly wrapped it in her arms and hands, her upper arms and palms light bleeding as she held it tight. "Oh..no...you can't break...you can't break." She said lifting it up to look at her reflection in the steel only for shards to begin falling out of the crack. "Oh god no.. No! This can happen."* - Fri Dec  4 02:06:17 2015

Her eyes swelling up, as she leans down coughing in pain again. She then looked up to Momura's starring at her with the swollen red eyes. "My...My mom's sword- hff... can't be -hff breaking..right?" her voice being halted with several quick gasps, as she gained breathe for her rapidly pacing heart. The throbbing pain her chest phsyically and mentally was hard for the girl to handle.* - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) started first by packing up two quick meals and several water bottles. Her mission was pretty simple one. It was another easy mission, though she had no issue with that fact. She simply wanted to go and get it done, while she had the chance to. Since, the travel wouldn't be that far. She only prepared the most basic essitials, that wasy she be quick on her feet. This also meant that, Chikyu could get there back and forth rather quickly without worrying about bandits or other shinobi.

The swordswoman had found she had got all her supplies ready. She strapped on another pack, filled with those supplies before taking out a brisk pace out of the village. Passing through the gates with ease, Chikyu flashing her mission front the kage and taking a quick check. The kunochi continued on her path, boots hitting the sand with a happy thud. Her whole body bouncing up and down in glee, as she continued on her own way.

The soles of the girl's boots hit the sand with a hiss, as the heated sand pressed against the cool leather. Looking down, the tanned girl let out a small digusted grun from it. She was glad she didn't run along bare footed. The kunochi shook her head, and kept her eyes piercing forward in an intense look. She had to keep her focus on the mission and not get distracted by such simple observation. She was going to get this mission done and over with, no excuses.

The heat beared down her, but she had no concern about this. Chikyu pulling out one of the numerous water bottles. Slowing her jogging pace slightly, as she slowly enjoyed the refreshing water across her lips then down her dry throat. She then place it on her back pouch for ease of acess. Her hand shotting behind her every so often to drink the water bottle till it was completely emptied only to pull ou the next. The girl pleased at the amount she had brung being just good enough to get her to and from her desitantion then back to Sunagakure.

The ground beneath the female's feet slowly began to morph from the soft collapsing sand to that of the harden Earth hitting this. This clued her in on how far out she was from the village, and how close she was to the village she had to deliver her mission to. She picked up her pace just out of excitement, she wanted to reach there in her burst of energy realizing the proximity of her goal. Her extending legs soon taking her past the barren burnt earth to that of living moist  grass blades.

The girls track on the grass was much easier then on the horrible sand. Her feet being able to really get some traction from each of her steps. The ground not instantly crumbling at the first minor pressure place upon it. Her hands of course reaching behind, and grabbing the last few sips of her second water bottle. She gave a smile, as she looked up the raising walls of the village she came to visit rose in front of her. She then simply ran around the perimeter of these walls till she reached the entrance of the village.

The girl feet rhythmic steps quikly began to go down in tempo. Her feet decelerating, as she finally came upon the entrance. She had no need to come inside the village. She handed the guards the scroll, showing that she was Sunagakure ninja. She then asked to deliver the message to the proper person it was designated for. Chikyu took pause, her mission reaching and interlude while waiting for the news that the message was delivered and whatever response they had for. This gave her plenty of time to sit down and eat one of her meals.

When the men finallycame back, they handed the corresponding message from the village to Sunagakure. She nodded taking the message into her possession before taking a few moments to work her legs. She then took her pace again, going in a more managable pace. Using the much gentler grassland enviroment, to really recover her strength. She then reached the desert keeping up the pace knowing how troublesome it was to overwork oneself. She just kept her mind focused, and knew that no matter how long it take. She was about to safely reach the village with success in her hand.* - Fri Dec  4 10:38:17 2015
