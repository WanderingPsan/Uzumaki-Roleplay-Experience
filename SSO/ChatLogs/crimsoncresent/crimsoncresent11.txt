Taking a sigh, he should've just got rid of this guy from the start. <Playing nice just gets you burned in the end.> He then leaps backwards landing horizontally on the academy's back wall.

Chakra pour out of the bottom of his feet clinging him to the wall even if it defied physics itself. He then looked over to Erebus, remembering him stating something along the lines of not using jutsus.  Using that he just kept himself up the wall, as he pulled out a radio. He then called out among it. "Theres a man with a black coat, and a bright red scythe attacking an official Kirigakure ninja. Repeat, Black coat man attacking Jin, Chuunin Kirigakure ninja. Hes at the academy grounds. Beware hes not mentally stable and seems to use jutsu or something of the sort with wounding himself."* - Sun Sep 20 10:08:38 2015

Dragging that scythe again, already creating that cold cry from metal screeching on cold earth. When he came to a stop, Jin only had the passing thought  of <So Himura calmed him down...> He then blew a thick heavy breathe out of his mouth. He then looked over to Himura.

He then quickly reach trying to grab a hold of Erebus's back with the use of his cloak and shoulder.

Jin just lets out a loud cry, as the three blades of the scythe pierce into his spine. Even passing through to bounce into the ground. That same screech of metal hitting the earth is the last tone heard, besides his own cry. He then lays lifeless on the ground. Blood not even leaving a mark on the already bright crimson blades. Only a pool of his own weakness he lies dead.* - Sun Sep 20 11:30:33 2015

Her hands lift up above her head, fingers interlocking into each other.  Her arms stretching upwards, muscles snapping as they push themselves out of their normal range of motion. "Ahhh! Its nice to get a light walk out and about." She mentions, a sword about the size of her body bumping across her back behind her. 

She then looks up hearing Mizukage, and looking at the blue cloaked and hate figure in front of her. "Is that who that chick is?" * - Sun Oct 18 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) "Oh yeah!" shouting, as she reachs her right hand around her left shoulder pulling out the lump of steel blade behind her. She then swings it left and right, quickly back and forth. Dangerously close to Ryujin, as she continues to fling it back and forth. "I can't wait to test myself out. I haven't had a serious match, since I been stuck in the academy!" She throws up the blade, before burrying the edge tip into the ground leaning on the handle of the blade. "It will be loads of fun."* - Sun Oct 18 02:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stands inside the training grounds, her armored arm reaching up over her shoulder grabbing the handle of her long blade. She then pulls it out over her body, and holds the sword out in front of her. She then raises the hefty steel above her head. She then holds it still for a moment, before bringing it down upon the earth. The blade cutting through the space until it impacts the ground, which lets out a cough of dust. 

She retracts her movement, tanned arms lifting up the blade with ease to rest above her white hair. She then holds the blade remembering how to do the basic sword weilding from the days at the academy. Her fingers snapping, as they clenched in between the grooved weaves of her leather handle. She then stepped her leg forward, using her shoulders as the fulcrum. She then used this balancing weight to bring the sword down, the metal falling down the stroke path.

Chikyu bites down on her teeth, as the blades swing nearly takes her body with her. Until, she slowly lifts her arms upwards raising the several foot long and foot wide sword. The weapon then slowly slumped downwards behind her as she raised it into her striking pose. Her techinques based on using the weight and physics of a swing of such heavy piece of equipment. Making the burden of carrying it, into a powerful force.

Holding herself in position building up her stance, as she shifted her body to their correct positions. She then took a pause, before letting out a loud yell form the bottom of her chest. "RAAGHH!" Her voice escaping mixing in with the howl of the steel falling to the force of gravity and the pull of her arms. The slice of the steel coming down quickly in a smooth shave. The sword then stopped hanging just above the dusty ground the genin barely able to catch it with her body.

Feeling herself ready again, her body curves back forming the shape of a bow. The sword bending to the strength and balance of its user raises back above the head of its wielder. She takes a few breathe, chest pushing out before sucking back in exposing her ribs under the skin. Sweat beeding off her, as she  takes a moment to regain her strength. Oxygen creating a nice cold wave of refreshment through herself. 

She then let out another growl throwing the sword forward. The body of the swordsgirl, jutting forward. The blade falling forward caught in the wave of her movement. The momentum of the steel bringing forth the power into the edge. The momentum of the blade breaking the speeds that most could pull out of the blade. The weight could easily be noted as the mass was suddenly haulted by the genin's arm. Her biceps popping out as they felexed breaking the sword's movement.* - Thu Oct 29 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) brought forth the sword back over herself with another grunt, the tan teen continuing her training without a note to the sudden appearence of another. Seemingly focused on facing forward, her body moving itself again. Feet leaving tracks in the sand as they shifted positions once more looking for that spot that just felt natural for her. She then lifted the foot slaming it down, anchoring herself to the ground. Her sword then come from over her head, doing the same slash shes been performing this entire time. 

It is here, that she took note of the new presence seeing someone to her side. Her eyes peering to the corner to take focus on the giant gourd before the person. She scoffs internally, wondering who would carry something so huge and heavy all the time. Then going back to her training, Chikyu brings her huge and heavy blade back over her head.* - Thu Oct 29 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) wasn't that strong just yet to bring out some powerful winds, but a noticable breeze was coming up to push against her bangs thanks to the sheering force of a blade that sized being swung. She lets out another yell just as Jiki finished his sentence "AAAIII!" Signalling another swing from her stance before jutting it back upwards. She takes a few moments to stop. She looks over her shoulders, and says simply. "Because, I'ma sand nin!" Her head twisting back forward to take in a few breathes from a open mouth.* - Thu Oct 29 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) let out a few more audible breathes, as she took the time to regain some more energy from her body. She then brought up her sword one more time over her head. Her arms slightly bent to support the weight of the blade. She then brought them out full extended the blade making a perfect arc that it naturally followed through the movement. The blade this time not stopping as it hit the ground with a metallic thud bruising the earth. 

Lifting up the blade from the impacted sight, Chikyu threw the blade back over her shoulders, a leather strap holding the blade on her back. She then looked over to Jiki. "Chikyu Kasanari... And you are?"* - Thu Oct 29 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) stretched out her arms, the notable crimson bracers on them shining under the intense sun of Suna. She shakes her head letting out a loud yawn. "I'm tired, and I been swinging all day under the heat. I'm sweatin like a pig." She lowers both her arms to the side. "Besides I didn't even notice ya! ...." She pauses for a moment disturbed not knowing how long hes been watching... and why was he watching. Her eyes slightly squinting and judging Tetsu before blowing it off. Its too late to stop it anyways. "So, I'm going to rest in tha shade."* - Thu Oct 29 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent)  looked over to him shaking her head. "How rude, its not that bad!" She says to his first line with a huff. She then listens for the moment letting him say his stake. Before shrugging her shoulders, and turning to the exit. "Don't know why ya like watchen people train and sweat in the heat. But, whatever... I'm going to go take a break." She says turning her back to him, only for him to see the wall of steel that was her sword. Most of her body covered up by her own blade.* - Thu Oct 29 19:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) just managed to walk into the training grounds all ready to get back to training only to hear some commotion going on. She looks over to Tetsu just as his sand fell off his body returning himself to his normal look. Only to jump slightly as the giant senbon crashed into the earth below. These enlarged senbon planting themselves into a field of iron, forced Chikyu to take off her sword holding it flat side at angle. Hoping that if any came her way, the sword would deflect the senbon.* - Thu Oct 29 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) brought down her guard, bringing the sword back on to her back noting the rain of metal was finally done. She then looked over to Jiki who could've easily killed someone playing around with Trilliam. Trilliam then only responding with a soft submittion of defeat. Chikyu then took a moment to rethink her first impressions of people. Giving a silent thought to herself <Maybe even that weak looking Mizukage is as strong as that...>* - Thu Oct 29 23:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) comes over looking at him intensly, eyebrows furrowed as she walks over to the gourd wielder. She looks at him for a moment, before raising a hand up. She then smacked him on the back at the lower end of his gourd, hitting it several times. "Why do you look so bummed!? Hahaha!" She says laughing to herself, eyes closed ignorant of this mind beaming dread. "Not many people look all frowny, after beating someone!"* - Thu Oct 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) watches as the younger Trilliam runs away. She then raises her hands, "Welp! Back to training." She nonchantlantly says, ignoring the blushing Tetsu. She then reaches behind to grab the handle of the sword pulling it out. Her legs moving through the leftovers of Jiki and Trilliam's fight. She then find a spot reasonably open enough for herself, and her training. 

Raising the sword above her head, and swinging it downwards. A noticable improvement could be seen already. The arc flowing much smoother with little diveation. The weight of the blade seemingly heavier, as the flow empowered its slash. Only to reach a noticable stop, Chikyu catching it just in time. Quickly reversing her movements to pull the sword up and above her. Letting the sharp blade dangle dangerously over her scalp with only her firm grasp preventing a bloody accident.* - Fri Oct 30 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) gave thanks for the quick note on her improvements, though she took it only as  a minor pleasentry. Thinking he was surely saying it out of obligation then actually being a compliment. Her blade shining under the rays of the sun being completely unobscured. Then that same ray was chopped, the silver sword blurring as it was brought further upwards. The sword then descending downwards in an arc of a shooting star crashing towards the ground.

Catching herself at end swing, her hands took a noticable rotation in position. Her grasp making a quick variation that helped pull her sword up quicker then before. Sword back to the desired position, where the genin once again switched her hands back to their original hold. She then brought down the sword once again in similair fashion to all the previosu swings.

Soon, she began to pick up a almost rythmic pace with her movements. Her hands flaring at the beginning and the end of the swing. Using each stance to pull the blade up an down to her will. The flow of this pattern was rather robotic at forth, with a noted awkward pause to make sure her hands were held correctly only to smooth her motions the more numerous times she accomplished her task. 

Continued to do the back forth, her head completely able to filter out the tedious nature of it. Her body was doing the work, focusing on her own movements and her mind doing on the natural adjustments it could through her nervous system. It wasn't long thanks to both her hard work and the heat, she once agian drained her self of her own stamina. Her body also nearing a dry thirst. This was a big sign that she needed to take a break.* - Fri Oct 30 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) walks out into the commons of Sunagakure. Hands stretched behind her head, clasped together as her elbows pointing forward. The genin's large sword slowly  bouncing up and down thanks to the loose straps that held it in place. Though, she didn't seem to mind the weight of the sword resting on her back at all times. Her white hair waved back and forth following the twists of her neck. "Hmm... A lot more people out in the early morn then I expected! Most people woulda still been nappin."* - Fri Oct 30 11:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to Sanoke and smirked to herself revealing her teeth. A hand reaching behind her to grab the sword, pulling it out and pointing upwards to the sky. "Well, thats true of course! Like my father had always said, 'People have to do their jobs with dedication. Farmers wake early to prepare their crops to grow. A swordsman must wake early to prepare their bodies to grow.' Thats how life is afta' all. If people don't do their parts everything goes crashin down!"

She then brough up the sword, and stances her self for a moment. Hands gripping onto the handle with an iron tight grip. Her arms raising above her head, before swinging the mass of the blade downwards. The power of the blade pressed against the bottom edge. A cool breeze coming off the blades movement, sent a bit of goose bumps up the genin's skin. At the end of the swing, she stop the blade with ease before it dirtied itself by touching th earth. Then with a heave, the girl had pulled the sword all the way back over her head.* - Fri Oct 30 11:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) holds the sword lifted just above her white hair. Her arms building in a bow-like tension ready to fire off the weight they held on to. Then with a snap, she brought down the mass of steel towards the earth before catching it near the endo f the swing. "Hahaha, I like a good spar in the afternoon. But for some reason, all the genin in the academy didn't want to fight with me for some reason. Only my father would spar!" She shouts, hands doing a noticable switch in position quickly before lifting the sword back up over her head. The almost person tall weapon once again holding itself over her head. "I mean, I could never guess why!"* - Fri Oct 30 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) says: It's not like fighting the real person. - Fri Oct 30 11:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) continued throwing the blade up and down like always. A stomping foot starting each her of swinds, which retracts back as she pulls back her swing. "I know right! I really don't know what it was." She continues to hack into the air with her swings, with ease. She looks past her blade for a moment looking over to the fight going on in front of her. She smiles "Well, now I get to do training and watch a show." She whistles noting once the smoke clears that Angetsu had moved so far in a blink of an eye. "Hes pretty fast."* - Fri Oct 30 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) took another swing in the moment that was that a wall of flame had bursted up around Marrisa. This even gave stop to the genin's training, as her eyes focused in on the flames for a moment. How they roared around the shinobi with a bright intensity. She then lifted her sword silently for a moment, pausing in hesistation. Then brought down her sword in front of her, "Haha... never heard of setting yourself on fire to be a techinque!" She laughs about the strange jutsu wondering if was really hot inside it. 

She then turned over to Sanoke nodding "Sure, I be up for some rough housing once I finish my morning training, of course!" She then brings down her sword once more before resting the blade down on the dirt. She took a breathe, then switched over her hands. Her grip tightening on the handle of the blade. She took pause for a moment, before with a quick twist of her abdomen to the side. The blade lifted upwards into a clean cleaving motion upwards. The blade now restin back over her head, was then slowly droppped back towards the earth to a resting position. * - Fri Oct 30 11:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) looked over to the fight, as she prepared her swing once again. Posed ready for the momement, only stopping to look over to the fight which seemed completely one sided by everyone watching the match including Chikyu herself. She then took her concentration off of the fight, thinking it was clearly done. The genin then looked down at her own body. Hands holding the blade before doing another upwards slash. The weight of the blade charging against the flow of gravity. Chikyu cutting with the sword from the ground to above her shoulders until it rested over her back. * - Fri Oct 30 12:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) holding the blade downwards, pressing just slightly into the sand. The edge of the triangle end of the sword resting at an angle. The genin's grip switching to support the movement her blade was going to take. Her arms slightly tensing, as she focused on her hands with the rest of her body. She then rotated her hips and abdoment to the right. Her extended arms following in turn, giving them the burst of energy they needed. This in turn lifted the blade which followed the motion of its users arm. Then like the club of the golfer, the blade sliced itself across the ground flying upwards over Chikyu's upper body.

The heavy movement movement of the blade stopped, as the girls arms couldn't stretch any further behind her. Her arms bouncing softly as they collided with the collar of her shoulders. She then brought the blade off her arms, and laying it back down on the groundi n the proper position that this move was started at. Normally, it should be after a strike; however, right now was just training it to be in proper form no need to work on actual use.

Getting her grip right, she wiggled her hips back and forth. Body stretching itself in preparation for the movement of the strike. She took a deep breathe, the swordsman then took a moment of hesistation. Chikyu then twisted the snap of her quick movement. The massive two-handed blade lifted off the ground, breaking the dirt into the air. The sand following in a trail of dust following the path of the blade. The particles dispering as the wind picks them up.

Pulling the blades wegiht off her shoulders, she lowered it back on to the earth with a small thud. Her hands still stuck in the position for the techinique. She then once more turns her whole body. A clockwork esque motion, as her bones act like gears. Clacking together as the sword is brought swiftly upwards in another cutting motion. Slicing the air in fornt of the kunochi.

Holding the blade over her shoulders she moved her hands into position for Von Gien. Right palm pushing down on the handle, as her left kept the blade in balance. Then with a swift stomp, her arms straight bringing down the blade with as much force as she could pull out. The blade hitting the sand with a explosive burst of sand plooming upwards. She then paused for a moment as her hands switch. Right and left cradling the underside of the handle. Her hips twisting sideways pulling the rest of her body backwards. The sword then coming up with a heavy swipe nearly as quickly as it fell.

She then took a break, slamming the blade downwards into the sand. Letting it hold itself up as she took a breathe. She then looked up only to notice a wall of earth climb up and down several times underneath the body of some boy. She paused thinking what kind of training that was for... body training was her best guess.* - Fri Oct 30 16:20:03 2015
