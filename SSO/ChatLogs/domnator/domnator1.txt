Tired and exuasted from all that training, hands are sore of that sand punching and have a burning sensacion in them from the sand being in the wounds, my legs a re bloddy hand have  dirt and small stones in them and the pain hurts. I need to keep training so this pain will no longer affect me. but let me wait until my wounds scab over and then I can begin this training agian, and rinse and repat it all over agian but first let me take a break. im real tired and exuasted from this.
