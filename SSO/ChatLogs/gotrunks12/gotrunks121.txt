<br><font color=yellow>*Koriama(Gotrunks12) would hesitate as he was training his Gentle Fist technique with his dad,his heart was beating quickly as he punched the log."Dad,when will I get the chakra right?!"He then sighed and bent over to breathe.."Argh,this is intense.."He wiped the sweat of his face,furthermore,he looked up and said"I'm not giving up.."He then rotated his hands and ran up to his dad"Son,take it easy!"He swang his hands about 5 times and attempted to hit his dad"Aaargh!"

Koriama's heart would beat even quicker then normal,and soon began to beat faster and faster!"Dad,I will acomplish this goal!"He stopped swining his arms and bent over to rest...His dad smiled"Son,you're getting the hang of it..."Koriama sudennly acted all manly and laughed"Aw,come on this is..Err,easy!"what Koriama had said wasn't true,infact he was actually hesitating to even lift up his hands when the were filled with chakra!

Koriama would then look at his dad and then back at his hands,"I can do this,Of course I can do this!"He then straightened his back and shouted"Gentle Fist!"He would run up to his dad and attempt to strike him with a shock covered blow!"Take this!"He landed a hit on his dad and sent his dad flying about 5metres into the sky!

"Heheh,I guess I over did it,you think?"He then scratched his hair and awaited his dad to stand up"Hehe,son you're getting older and stronger..."He wiped the blood off his mouth and offered him to go get some ramen!*
