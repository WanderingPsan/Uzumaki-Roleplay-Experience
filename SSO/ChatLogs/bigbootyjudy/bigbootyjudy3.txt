<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) 's eyes were struck as she came to Kumogakure after her long visit away. She smiled gently as her eyes took upon Ortho. Her face grew warm as she came closer to him, shy about the event that happened last time and unsure that is was at a complete whim, she hoped it was not that. She'd look up to him and smiled with her face pinkish.

"H-Hi. . .Ortho. . ."

She seemed to be very innocent at this moment and just seeked for his love and affection.* - Thu Oct  8 22:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) was shocked as Misa's arrows pierced through her. She shook her head gently as she smiled happily. Misa had to deal with her now. . .Yet Reisen was not very happy at her attempts. She'd look up as she moved away to the side with papers pierced to the ground. Physically the papers were weak but Reisen's papers were not of just fraility, they were appart of her chakra too and were a medium which her body was currently made of. She'd look up to Misa with a sigh, her current tactics wouldn't work on her.* - Thu Oct  8 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sighed gently as the woman came from the dust speading at Misa.
