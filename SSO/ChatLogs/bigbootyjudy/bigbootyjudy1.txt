<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) going out she began to pick up the senbon once more, keeping it within her tongue she began to curl around it with her tongue getting a feel for it and such within her mouth, She'd place it on her tongue and moved it up into her gums then quickly took it in her tongue moving it back and forth in order to understand what exactly she had to with it and under control compared to before. Traing her mouth to move faster with skills of Fukumi would help increase how fast she can preform the skill under pressure. Yet it would take control of her mouth and actions along with that, blood still filled her mouth as when she messed up with the movement her mouth would slice with senbon movements. Easily making her wince yet over time her body began to ignore that small pain

 leaned her head to the side, she'd release the bloody senbon into her hand and began to spit out blood from her mouth. It reached onto the grass bellow her with faint wincing as she moved her tongue to wash the blood out from the insides of her small mouth. She'd wipe off the senbon on her crimson skirt and then cracked her neck as she moved it back into her mouth and began to curling practice with the senbon once more. Her mouth was sore from it but being a shinobi was not easy. You would have to endure pain to reach your end goals and creating genjutsus required a lot of consintration from any party. Her mouth began moving with ease, the senbon not injuring her as much anymore. Once again she'd attempt to shoot out the senbon yet it didn't go very far. She could notice it was still cutting short, yet that would require training something else.

nodded her head as she once again journeyed to go pick up the senbon. Holding it in her hand, she'd take notice of the aerodynamic shape that it had and shook her head. She'd sit down in the grass beginning to whistle, Her mouth took on the same shape as when she shot out the senbon. Her lips puckered lightly as she began with a low yet smooth noise. Melody of it rang to those who could hear as her mouth began to push out more air faster. Her tongue curling around as if she was grabbing the senbon and pushing it to place within her mouth as pretend she could multitask. Her mouth repeating the process whistling once everytime she moved her tongue from the gums to the center and right place. Her whistling seemed to get louder as she pushed out more and more air everytime.

shook her head. "I think if I move onto something else, I'll forget my current training. . ." She'd pull out her sewing needles once more and dove back into the crimson fabric in her bag while she was still sitting on the ground. She began to hum gently as her face grew happy with the current creation she was working on, Her hands contributed a lot of work as her mind began to clear and focus on the task at hand. She was a smart girl and doing such things could clear up many of the things bothering her currently. It was much of nothing but pure enjoyment as she continued to work on her progress on the crimson fabric. She began to ignore most of her surroundings and old focus on her work with the fabric, continueing on with the current blanket stitch around the sides before she went into a different once in order to make the ends look better.

She released the chakram out and began to move it with her hands guiding it to move around within the air.

The paper began to fold around Marrisa's body making her immobile and restricted if she did not react fast enough to it.
