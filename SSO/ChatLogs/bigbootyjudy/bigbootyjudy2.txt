<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sat down on the ground as her papers expanded out and started to change their shape into weapons. She had to prepare for any circumstances that came up. Her hand would extend into her bag as she pulled out ink and a brush and began to paint onto the papers strange seals onto it. It was pretty much basic ones that any Fuuinjutsu users could recognize but Reisen was working on her abilities to use them. Her hand would continue to create the black sealing marks for future uses if she had any.* - Mon Oct  5 21:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Right.. Mm. I have one on hand at the moment. - Mon Oct  5 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) 's hands would continue to outline and completely over and over completely working on how the seal works in numerous ways. Practice overall makes perfect and Reisen could not let herself get behind Suitengu even further. He was strong but Reisen still wanted to protect the boy in some way. She'd look up and smile to him. "Suitengu. . ." She'd gently mutter her name and see if he would turn around and respond to the girl.* - Mon Oct  5 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) nodded her head as she took a break from the current seal she was working on. "I've decided to take upon myself to learn Fuuinjutsu. . ." She'd turn her head down and continued with her brush. She'd pull away and dip the brush once more into the black ink and then continued on putting seals onto her body of papers. Her apparent concentration onto the seals were great and she knew she had to make numerous ones to seal so many different things into her papers. Her hands kept going as they drew down the different shapes and lines and such onto them.* - Mon Oct  5 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) would continue on with her efforts of continueing on with the seals she was preforming on the papers. She needed to practice overall on what she could do with her seals and just drawing them in general. Her hands extended out all over the place, drawing the seals left and right onto the papers. She needed to keep trying to perfect her seal drawing in order to start her mastery onto this topic.* - Mon Oct  5 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) walks over to the man with a smile on her face. She'd lightly raise her hand in a manner of hello to him. With that she'd nod her head. "Hey, want to get something to eat?" She'd ask without really even saying nothing other than that. Everyone has to eat. . .* - Mon Oct  5 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) nodded as she led the man to the hospital. There wasn't much places to sit besides here and as such this would fit the best for them to go.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sighed gently. "We're all allies here. Getting to know each other has its benifits and as such it helps us. . .grow as people. Emotional bonds exist for that reason." She'd pass over a cup to Ortho.* - Mon Oct  5 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) laughs gently as she pulled out the rest of the bottle of sake and poured herself a cup. "We do not have to care about others outside of ourselves, no?"* - Mon Oct  5 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) chuckled gently and then scratched the back of her head. "I'm just here to make sure Suitengu is fine. . .anyone who crosses him. . .I will personally take care of. . ."* - Mon Oct  5 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sighed gently. "I can really relate to him in a way you know. . .He didnt really have parents and it was quite saddening for myself. . .I want to make sure he has a mother I guess. . ." She'd pour herself another cup of sake then held up the bottle ready to pour Ortho's cup too if he was ready himself. . .* - Mon Oct  5 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sighs gently once and sets her sake down. "I just want to make sure he doesnt grow. . .to end up completely alone in this world." She'd look up at the ceiling with a small smile on her face. She was overall a kind person and as such didn't want anyone to be sad.* - Mon Oct  5 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) sighs gently. "Yet everyone gets hurt, no? I can atleast do something good and die for a good reason. . ." She'd begin to stand up and brush herself off. "I can do something with meaning to myself this way. . ." She'd offer out her hand to Ortho, Reisen was overall someone you'd not expect from this group of people. "Shall we go back with the rest of them?"* - Mon Oct  5 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) smiled gently as he said that and started to briskly walk out of the building. "Don't worry. . .everyone deals with pain. . ." She'd look back at the man but her eyes. . .seemed different instead of showing kindness to the man the eyes she had showed nothing but the lack of emotions this time. She'd look foreward and finished her current cup before starting to head outside.* - Mon Oct  5 23:39:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) nodded her head, she'd quickly take her normal spot next to Suitengu before letting out a gentle smile. From her sleeve, she'd pull out a cook and handed it to him. "I'll be changing in a bit, okay?"* - Tue Oct  6 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Okay. - Tue Oct  6 04:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) nodded her head as she bowed down from her work on the ground. Numerous seals can be seen writen on papers but it seemed to retract into herself after she bowed. She'd start to get up onto her feet as she offered a smile to him, overall Reisen could be seen as a friendly person to others.

"Reisen. . .my name is Reisen."* - Tue Oct  6 19:35:28 2015

She would sit back down to the ground as from the sleeves of her kimono more sheets of  paper would drop down onto the ground. She'd pull them close to herself and seemed to go back to focus and work on her seal drawing practice. Reisen only was a beginner at this stuff and focusing on it was very important to herself. She'd lightly dip her brush into the ink a few times then slightly cleaned it slightly from the extra ink on it.* - Tue Oct  6 19:51:40 2015
