<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) After hearing the sad news about his brother, the news he didn't want to believe in the beginning, he slowly was dropped on the ground, he lost his only brother, he lost his family in one go, he lost the brother he looked up to be like and the brother that he lived with, soon after remembering his brother sad life and his own sad life, tears started to fall off his eyes, he was crying on the ground all alone without a helping hand, without anyone to help him anymore. He lost the only hand that helped him to train, to live, and to have fun. It was like losing his only purpose of living.

He couldn't stop crying, he was trying very hard not to cry, but tears were just falling like a river from his eyes, his eyes were filled with tears, tears of sadness and agony, why did he have to lose his brother, the brother that he couldn't live with him in his parents house, he couldn't even live with him in his own house, why did he have to lose Kilm right after meeting with him, it didnt even pass one year and he was dead, then he stood up and started to wipe off the tears off his face, then he started to remember all the happy times he had with his brother, when he grabbed him when he talked to the Kazekage in a bad way, or when he chose girls over training, and started to cry once again, tears just came down on their own.

Hatred and sadness started to emerge, the old funny and talkative Zole started to change from happy to sad from a loving person to a hating person. The two names that were in his head, the names of the two people that killed his brother, he wasn't sure of it, but he didn't care, they were the only names mentioned that killed him, his hatred toward these two people started to increase, He was still crying at the death of his brother, as he was consumed in his anger and hatred he started to think of revenge to avenge his brother " I swear . . I will train harder and harder . . .to kill these two people to avenge you brother . . .you didn't have to die YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE ! " He said to him self as tears rolling down his face, then he took of the Academy grounds, heading to the training grounds to master the two justus that he was taught by his brother.* - Thu Nov  5 18:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) grabs the scroll " Okaay "* - Thu Nov  5 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) As he grabbed the scroll, he opened it, as he then finds out its the lightning jutsu Trilliam just did " Oh, I see. Amazing " He said, then he started to looked at the scroll. Zole was a hardworker, he even liked reading scrolls and learning the jutsus from them, for him learning from a scroll was way more easier than learning it from someone, anyway he started to read the scroll and but ever line he finish, he gets more information about the jutsu " I see " He said once again, as he was reading the scroll line after line to get all the important stuff he needs to preform the jutsu, at first he learned the needed handseals for the jutsu.* - Thu Nov  5 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) Ofcourse he didn't learn all about the jutsu from his first time reading the scroll, all he knew about the jutsu is that its a low ranked jutsu that can be strong enough if trained well, and he also learned its handseals, but that isn't enough to preform and excute a jutsu. He started to read the scroll further, to understand more about the jutsu nature and the lightning element nature aswell, this jutsu was his first lightning jutsu after all, so reading this scroll while concentrating was all he can do, after further reading, he was able to know what kind of chakra he needs to preform that jutsu, and the amount of chakra used not to fuck up the jutsu.* - Thu Nov  5 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) Even though he loved reading, and having a reason to train even harder than before, he didn't know how to preform that jutsu just yet, knowing the chakra needed or the amount needed to preform the jutsu wasn't the only key to preform a jutsu, not even the handseals, he had some little experience with jutsus after all so learning that jutsu wasn't that easy for him, beside this lightning jutsu is his first lightning jutsu ever, anyway he focused back on reading the scroll focusing all his senses on the scroll " Okay . . I am getting it now " He said in a low voice not to break his concentration, from his reading to the scroll he got more information about the jutsu that is needed to preform the jutsu.* - Thu Nov  5 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Okay. - Thu Nov  5 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He put the scroll aside him on the ground, as he nods to Trilliam, he was going to try preforming the jutsu, he learned some stuff about the jutsu from the scroll, so he was going to put his reading and his experience into a small test to see if he can preform the jutsu or even create a small lightning ball, he took his hands and preformed the needed handseals for the jutsu then he put his left hand infront of him concentrating the chakra into that hand, the lightning chakra that he had was concentrated in that arm, a small lightning ball was formed on that arm few seconds later that ball started to fade away " Shit .. .. I was about to do it ! " He said to him self, then he gave a high sigh as he grabbed the scroll and started to read it once again.* - Thu Nov  5 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) After failing at preforming and excuting the jutsu at first, he grabbed the scroll once again, and started to re-read it all-over, he started to read it again to make sure he didn't miss any part of the jutsu, he already knew the handseals, and the chakra type needed, the chakra amount needed, he only missed in fusing his chakra and concentrating his chakra for more, he didnt stop reading the scroll, he kept reading it till he finally finished the scroll " Okay . . lets try this again " he said to himself, he got up off the ground cleaning the dust of his pants " Okay " he said, then he took his training pose, then he preformed the handseals needed to preform the jutsu " okay for the hard part " He puts out his left hand once again forward, ifront of his body concentrating his lightning chakra in that arm, creating a small lightning chakra ball " okay okay . . keep calm and focus you chakra " he said to him self, as he focuses his chakra more and more making the chakra ball even bigger " okay I am doing well " he said to him self, then he looked at the mountain and rushed toward it with his left hand forward " Lightning ball JUTSU ! " He shouted, as the lighting ball made contact with the mountain, it instantly exploded " YES ! . .  I did it ! I will show Trilliam " he said, then he took off to Trilliam Shop.* - Thu Nov  5 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He entered the shop, with the scroll in his hand, then he looked at Trilliam " Okay . . I learned that jutsu and preformed it . . I even broke a part of the mountain just like you did " he said with a low tone, then he sat down and waited for Trilliam to talk.* - Thu Nov  5 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He took the scroll and tookoff leaving the house, to train the jutsu outside, learning this jutsu was hard and easy in the same time as he wasn't showed the jutsu or what it do, so he had to read the scroll without missing any word or sign, and it was easy becuase, he liked reading ofcourse. He started to read the scroll as he started to learn about the jutsu nature and what it does,it was just a D-Rank lightning jutsu, that surge chakra with a handseal that numbs people around the user for a bit more like stunning them.* - Thu Nov  5 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) After learning the basics of the jutsu and the usage of the jutsu, he started to read and learn how to preform the jutsu and the needed handseals for that jutsu, he started to remember his dead brother which actually broke his concentration on reading the scroll " Its not time for that . . I gotta train to become stronger for him ! " he said to himself, then he wiped the tears off his face, then he continued reading the scroll, from his further reading he learned the needed handseals for the jutsu " okay I kinda got it now " he said to him self as he continued reading the scroll.* - Thu Nov  5 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He stood up and started to read the scroll further, with doing nothing but focusing on the words wrriten on the scroll, and the signs drawn on it aswell, He was learning more about the jutsu, he learned the needed hand seals for the jutsu " Okay I got this part, I fully understand it " He said to himself, as he also learns the chakra type needed for the jutsu, ofcourse it was lightning chakra ~Duuh. He also learned the chakra amount he needs to spent to make the jutsu stable and not to fuck it up and fucks up himself, after learning and studying all the stuff needed to preform the jutsu, he puts the scroll aside of him to try and preform the jutsu " Okay . . I will do it for you KILM ! " he shouted, then he preformed the needed handseal while concentrating on his lightning chakra " okay lets go " after preforming the handseal and excuting the jutsu the enviroment around him was starting to spark with lightning.* - Thu Nov  5 21:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) After taking the mission from the kazekage, he would rush outside the door heading to the gates to gaurd em.* - Fri Nov  6 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) After receiving the mission, he quickly rushed toward the gates to fulfill his mission, ofcourse gaurding the gate wasn't of an easy task, after all this was his first mission from the kazekage, anyway he had to fulfil the mission to get rewarded, he headed to the gate, as the gaurds that were standing there started to move toward him asking him question about why is he here, if he is leaving the village, or anything else, the security was so high, that Zole didn't know why he was given this mission if the first place if they got these many gaurds gaurding this spot.


He didn't know what to do in the beginning, the gaurds were all around him which made him rather confused and not feeling comfortable, then he remembered he was given a scroll with the details of the mission, he took out the Mission-Scroll and gave it to the gaurds, to show him what was the purpose of him coming here, and that he only came here to fulfil a mission that was given to him by the kazekage. The gaurds noded to him in a postive way, giving him back the scroll.


He took the Mission scroll back again, and sat on the ground infront of the gate, then the gaurds went to him and told him not to sit down and pay more attention to the mission given to him, they ordered him to stand infront of the gate and not sitdown as if he was on a vacation, He nodded as he was ordered to stand and to be ready to fight if anything were to happen. He waited in his place without moving, ofcourse there was nothing happening, the place was very boring, but it was his mission and its his rule as a shinobi to fulfil it.


Hours were passing and he was just standing there in his place doing nothing, not even training, or talking with the other gaurds. An idea came on his mind, as he turn around looking at the gaurds around him " What do yo usually do to have fun ? Because none of you is talking or even eating, What with you guys " He asked in an amazed tone waiting for an answer, but then the gaurds started to laugh at him for asking them these stupid questions. Ofcourse he was surprised by the outcome.


He stood there in amazement as the gaurds laugh " Did I say something funny ? " He said in a rather pissed tone, the gaurds stopped their laughing at turned to him, to face him, and then one of them started speaking " Ofcourse, We can't have fun we are on gaurd, we talk to each other from time to time and ofcourse we eat . . we are humans after all " Then he stopped talking and went back to his post to gaurd the gate once again. He was amazed by the answer, ofcourse he wasn't used to this life, as his life was nothing but sitting in a house.

Hours were passing, and Zole stomach was empty, he wanted to eat, since he didnt have his breakfast he was just focused on getting a mission, He had a bag with him, that he had some sandwiches in it with a tea container and some cups, he looked at the gaurds and offered them some of his sandwiches and a cup of tea, they gladly accepeted it as it was no harm for them for himself, Zole took his time eating the sandwiches and filling his stomach with the hot and good tea.

While they were all eating the stuff that was given to them by Zole, a strange traveller came with a cart, they didn't know what it was filled with, so they had to check it up incase he is hiding weapons or some ninjas to attack the village from the inside out, Since Zole was given a mission to protect the gate, he had to take part in checking the cart up, he started to search it from the inside to look if there was anything strange, but he only found fruits and vegetables, maybe he came to sell his stuff.

Zole looked at the gaurds, and started to question them if they would allow him to enter, since him and the gaurds saw no danger from the man, they allowed him in and gave him a premission to enter the village, ofcourse if anything went wrong it would be there responsibility that they allowed him inside, then Zole followed him and showed him the way inside the village and told him where he could find people to sell his stuff to. Then after showing the guy the place where to go, he went back to his post and to gaurd the fuckin gate once more.

Hours were passing and Zole was getting bored already, He just wanted to go back and to complete the mission " Okay . . I think thats it " He said to himself, then he looked at the scroll next to him on the ground, then he grabbed it and started to move leaving the gate, he looked at the gaurds and waved to them with his hands as he was leaving the gaurd, since his mission was fulfilled, he slowly started to move away from the gate till they couldn't see him.* - Fri Nov  6 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He had the scroll in his backpack, he was moving in the village, to reach the kazekage mansion to finish the mission, the kazekage's mansion was at the sight of his eyes, he was near the mansion already, so he decided to take a rest before going to the mansion to complete the mission and get rewarded, few minutes passed, then he got up off the ground cleanning the dust off his pants " time to fininsh this mission " he said to him self, then he quickly rushed toward the mansion to see the kazekage.* - Fri Nov  6 10:30:36 2015
