<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll give you a water technique. - Wed Oct 28 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's called Syrup Trap. - Wed Oct 28 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Use your chakra to create sticky water using these hand-seals. - Wed Oct 28 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Okay . . I guess. - Wed Oct 28 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) He saw his brother doing the jutsus, he only preformed two hand-seals the " Ram " Handseal then he preformed the " Tiger " Handseal. Then he looked at his brother " That jusu it seems easy ! " He said. then he started to focus his chakra as he preformed the hand-seals " Water Jutsu: Syrup Trap " He said as he shoots normal water from his mouth on the ground, obviously it was failure. He looked at his brother with a smile and started to talk " What did you say about luck ? Because I will need that " He said as he started to play with the back of his head.


Then he started to remember his brother as he was preforming the jutsus. He stood up and started to preform the jutsu once again " Okay I will do it this time ! " He said, then he started to preform the handseals once again the Ram-Handseal then the Tiger-Handseal but this time he used much more chakra than last time, he thought he needed to put more chakra to preform the jutsu correctly but he failed again as he only spit normal water. Then he kicked the ground under his leg and he started to yell loudly " Why can't I do it ! "


He wasted lots of chakra in his previous tries, so he needed to take some rest to refill the chakra he lost preforming that jutsus these two times. He sat on the ground looking in the sky trying figure it out, he closed his eyes and started to imagine the world around him, he knew his chakra control wasn't the best but it was good enough to preform the jutsu, he was disappointed that he couldn't preform the jutsu that his brother preformed with ease. He stood up and started to clean his pants from the dust and sand and then he looked at his brother " I Will try again now ! " He yelled as he started to focus his chakra once again.


From his previous failures, he noticed that he only spit out normal water from his mouth, and it wasn't because he used a small amount of chakra or using huge amount of chakra since both attempts failed. He remembered that the jutsu was used to stick the oppoenet to the ground and not making him able to move by using sticky water as shown by his brother, so he started to focus his chakra, expelling high-viscosity Chakra infused with the water he was going to make, as he preformed the two handseals again as he spits out a very small amount of water some of it was sticky and some of it was just normal water. Then he looked at his brother with a smile " Look ! I am getting the hang of it " He yelled as he jumped in the air with his left arm high in the sky.


He was exhausted from the continuous use of his chakra, so he fell on the ground on the water he created, then he closed his eyes once again to take another rest, he fixed his sitting pose on the water and started to enter in the meditating pose as he close his eyes to focus on refilling his chakra. After few minutes of meditating he opened his eyes, while looking at his brother " This time . . I will preform it correctly ! " He was exicted about preforming this jutsu, so he was ready to give it his best ! he cracked his fingers as he was ready to give it another try.


He was ready to give it another try, he closed his eyes and started to focus his chakra once again to preform the jutsu he knew what he was missing to preform the jutsus, it wasn't chakra and it wasn't how much chakra he spend, it was the way he wasy using his chakra, he had to form his chakra to sticky substance and fuse it with water to create the syrup of sticky water, the only problem that he faced, that he didn't know how to do it prefectly to preform the jutsu correctly.


Then he opened his eyes once again after focusing his chakra preforming the needed handseals for the jutsu he looks at the sky before excuting the jutsu " I will do it this time ! " He yelled with a smile that hopefully will shine his attempt. He preformed the jutsu as he started to spit out water from his mouth, half of the water was sticky and the other half was just normal water, he jumped in the air and started to laugh " Yes, I am doing it right ! I got it all now ! " He yelled, and by this attempt he knew what he was missing and what made his jutsu wrong and incomplete.


This time, he knew what he was missing, he knew what was wrong with his jutsu that made it in-complete. The problem was him not balancing between the chakra he used to make the water sticky and with the chakra he fused with the water to make it all one big sticky water syrup, by knowing his mistakes he finally got the hang of the jutsu and maybe is able to preform the jutsu correctly for once to use it in his future fights. He stood up and shouted while looking at his brother " I got it bro ! I will do it this time . . Just you stand there and watch "


He stood up and closed his eyes focusing on his chakra once again, focusing on his chakra to make it sticky and ready to fuse with the water chakra of his, then he started to preform the needed handseals for the jutsu, then with a smile he excuted the jutsu while balancing between the chakras not to consume so much chakra with no need and not to break the jutsu, then he started to spit water, but this time the whole water was sticky liquid not just normal water, he did a 3x3 syrup trap fromed from sticky water. then he stopped using the jutsu because he know it that well to keep using it and consume lots of chakra, he didnt want to tire him-self up.


After preforming the jutsu correctly he looked at his brother, then he rushed toward him and poked his arm " See ! I told you I will do it this time " He said, then he jumped in the air with his both hands high in the sky " I DID IT ! " He yelled with excitement, then he looked at the field of sticky water he created, and with a chidlish smile he rushed toward that field and started to move over it till one point his legs stuck in the ground, and for once his jutsu was a success, then he looked at his brother with a smile " How to get off this now ? " He said while playing with the back of his head.* - Wed Oct 28 13:07:12 2015
