<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) scratches his nose.

"I believe I just did my call. . ." He says, giving a glare towards Amai. Was she hard of hearing?

"Mmm. So you all have done nothing? Not even in celebration of our recent victory? I have killed Hogo Tethys. .. The Mizukage. This is one of the few times I am expectant of excitement. . " He says, kicking at the ground. Zetsumo was more than just a little irk'd of the nonchalance. This was by far his biggest victory.* - Fri Sep 18 18:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grabbed the bottle as it's flying.

"What in the world are you doing?-- And I see. . .It doesn't appear as if you all had too much fun. And here I thought I was the stick in the mud. . "

He replies. The bottle of ink is pocketed, and he turns to the sake. ". . Why not. Give it here."* - Fri Sep 18 18:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) . . .

He takes a step ahead, and kicks the ferret. The rodent goes flying, as if it were a football being punt by a premiere football player.

"What in the world is a ferret going to do for me?" He brings the sake to his lips-- though doesn't drink. He's just smelling it.* - Fri Sep 18 18:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: You know, that's probably the most fucked up thing I've ever seen you do. - Fri Sep 18 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) holds the sake ahead towards Zenaki.

"You take a sip first."

Victory was all too close. He couldn't afford to succumb to poison by this point. Paranoid? Perhaps. As that's said, Zetsumo's glance flicks back on over to Amai.

"Oh my. . . Perhaps I've been getting soft. If -that's- the worse you've seen me do. Isn't that right. . .Zen, Katsune," he says, gesturing for the two girls to vouch for him.* - Fri Sep 18 18:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He stares. . . ahead towards the purple haired girl, and flicks her hard on the ear. "I believe I was talking to you. . "

Right after, his gaze falls back onto Amai.

An arm extends, and before long, his hand rockets forward. With surprising speed, that appendage wraps about Amai's neck, and gives a decent choke. "YOu now. . . You talk a lot. . ." He says, while simultaneously taking the bottle from Zenaki and having a sip.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. He stared blankly at Amai.

"I fear you lack what it takes to get through this one. It doesn't appear much can effect her. . ." Zetsumo murmured with a drawl. His voice hinted irritation, and on the inside, his soul wreaked with malicious intent. Amai was getting to him -- and now he just wanted to hear her scream, just to show the blonde just how weak and feeble she actually was.

Before long, she's taken and forced onto the ground. Assuming success, Zetsumo holds her there by a boot.

". . .The sarcasm is dully noted. ." He ponders, wondering whether or not to strike the girl. Of course, in the end. . .He's just in too much of a good mood due to his hard-earned victory the other day.* - Fri Sep 18 18:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Hrm. . . Do they. . Know my pain. . ? - Fri Sep 18 18:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sips tea.* - Fri Sep 18 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

That was settled. He presses harder, and uses chakra flow to bolster strength. "And stay there. . .Eating dirt--" Cue a single seal. Mud spawns along the ground, running about Amai's face, hopefully forcing her mouth to take in the odd creation of earth.

"In anycase. . .Yes. You all put forth suggestion. . .I am still suffering heavily from mental fatigue. ." He replies, referencing something that was calming that could be done. The war was really wearing him out, particularly because he had to practically carry Amegakure to victory himself, made all the battle plans, and constantly multi-tasked in each major battle to ensure that every makes it out okay.* - Fri Sep 18 18:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) cants his eyes on over.

"--ALright. What the fuck is wrong with you?" He says, taking note of Katsune's random shift in personality. 

Meanwhile, his feet does it's thing, now pressing at Amai's face. Certainly, she'd be able to breath, but she was going to get a face full of thick, slimey and disgusting mud.* - Fri Sep 18 18:50:01 2015

He sends a harsh whip from his threads, striking the woman on the bum. It'd leave a mark, and nearly breaks skin. That was going to hurt.

"Clearly. There is -something- wrong. Speak, we just had a chat earlier about you leaving out information. . " He says with an increasingly aggitated or animated tone of voice.* - Fri Sep 18 18:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts view from Amai and Katsune.

Oh how different the two girl's were. He shows clears bemusement at Amai's apparent enjoyment. It was beginning to look like there was only one thing that could adequately effect the girl -- death. Once more, he whips, this time attacking her waistline. Maybe that would learn her.

". . .Oi. Are we just going to do this again, Katsune?" He says, alluding to another occasion where she had refused to tell him what was on her mind. By now, Katsune should know better. . .He was obsessive in his controlling nature, and honestly. . .Zetsumo -relished- prying information from his targets.

More tendrils linger from his body, and wiggles about in the air. Familiar? Perhaps she'd recall the restaurant.* - Fri Sep 18 19:00:16 2015

"But I am just. . . Starting to gain some excitement. And you're now seeing the outcome of your act," he says. Funny enough, it wasn't even Amai being rude persay. It was her entire disregard of the scenario. She behaved as she was just in timeout, or at pre-school, rather than with legitimate criminals.

And that honestly irked him. Another whip is given, and again it avoids piercing skin. This one is geared to the ribs.

Eventually, Katsune finally spills the beans, much to Zetsumo's dismay. "Aw. . .I would have greatly enjoyed prying it from her," he thinks to himself.

"I see. Dizzy or not. . I still require entertainment."A quick glance is given to Zenaki, she was as big as a stick in the mud as the others. Thus, his vision falls back onto Katsune. "List off entertaining things in this shitty village. I believe. . .There is a fighting arena? Or so I'm told."* - Fri Sep 18 19:11:21 2015

He was certain it was about those seals now -- considering the lack of body movement. "Ah. So it is the seals. Hrm. .. I wonder what involvement the Gezo had then. . .Or what Noriko has restricted you from saying," he replies. Finally, Amai is releaed, although still muddied and bruised. His foot falls back onto the floor.

After waiting for Katsune to speak, he addresses Shin briefly.

"The Gezo is the 'World Government.' They rule over everything. . .They simply allow us to behave as if we have any true power. Watching us war. . .is akin to a parent watching their children play in the playground." Cue fist clenching in angst. Gezo must die.* - Fri Sep 18 19:32:41 2015

"I fear nothing . . . No. . .That is a lie. I fear only Death himself. My father spoke truth to me long ago. If I want to continue living and clawing up the food chain, I must have the fear of death lingering in my soul. It's that sensation that helps my drive," he says honestly.

"Anywho. I'm bored. Katsune, Amai," he gestures them over. His hands are in pockets. . .and admist a war, he's just going to lounge around. 

Before heading out,Zetsumo turns to Shin, and prepares to offer an invitation. -- Although he pauses upon hearing the genjutsu specialist's commentary. After some deliberatiion, the brute speaks up.

"Shin too, if you feel up to it."* - Fri Sep 18 20:16:12 2015

They head off, eventually landing in the heart of the bustling city of Amegakure.

In this plaza, there are various places to indulge in leisurely activity. To the north? The local bar that doubled as a restaurant. 

South? THe fighting arena. It's where locals moved to tussle in order to either get out their aggression, or simply for bragging rights. The arena in particularly had a load of different environments.

Eastward held the local spa. One filled with luxurious devices -- y'know, the whole nine yards. Hot springs, massaging areas, mud baths, and the list goes on. "Hrm. . . Not often that I come here. I'm sure you three have frequent this area, however. What do you all usually do?"* - Fri Sep 18 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Never been here. - Fri Sep 18 21:09:58 2015

His eyes wondered down the area.

He looks first to the battle arena, and wore a smile.  "Katsune. Are you still suffering from the alcohol? I might be willing to have you and Amai battle now," he says with a grin. It would be entertaining to see a good cat fight-- especially as it was going to be for Zetsumo's own entertainment.

Eventually, Ushinawa apparently came onto the scene.

"Oi. The deed is done, by the way. I managed to end him. Have whatever resources you can be delivered to assist in the war efforts."* - Fri Sep 18 21:24:28 2015

Silence. . .

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAAAAAHHHHH!" He breaks out in sudden, unrestrained laughter. The scroll, it brought legitimate tear to his eye. 

"And how did that work out for them. So then, at least we have a good estimate of their numbers. Ten thousand strong,"he says inbetween breaths.* - Fri Sep 18 21:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure how I feel about that though. - Fri Sep 18 21:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods along.

He hears Katsune's commentary and shrugs. "That works as well. It has been quite a bit of time since I've unwind. Should serve me well also, considering I'm about to go and end this war. Perhaps on the next day. Kirigakure is weak -- and I won't let them try and launch a surprise attack," Zetsumo muses.

He motions for the purple-haired lass to lead the way.* - Fri Sep 18 21:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Fri Sep 18 21:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He doesn't pay a dime.

Amegakure owes his greatly for the service-- as it is the 'God of War' that is honestly making sure his monikor is being earned. After all, by this point, he was single handily keeping the Kenryoku/Amegakure join within the fight, and perhaps even winning it for them.

"I'll take whatever deal she has."

Meanwhile, he tendrils are shapened like a collar and rope. He's practically dragging Amai around. 

"You sounded irritated of my comment about the 'Snake Charmer.' Had I not known better, I would assume that to be jealousy," of course, the 'hmph' comment could be taken many ways. More than likely, it was simply irritation or just Katsune way of suggesting distaste towards the Snake Lycan.* - Fri Sep 18 21:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Fri Sep 18 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just not sure how to feel about her. - Fri Sep 18 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Should just..uhm..Kill her now. - Fri Sep 18 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: It'd make things muchhh easier.. - Fri Sep 18 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Cough* - Fri Sep 18 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not jealousy, though. - Fri Sep 18 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) flicks Amai in the forehead.

"Quiet. She's been far more useful than you have."

With that, he leads them off into a hallway that breaks off into different sections. The zombie's presence garners more than a few glances along the way.

His eyes scan around. "Right. . .I am unsure which to choose first."* - Fri Sep 18 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"A spa, woman. Pay attention," he says with a grunt.

Eventually, after some thought, he heads towards the right most hallway. Where? The hotsprings of course. There were many other luxuries that could be utilized, but considering no one else had opened their mouth, he was going with the obvious choice.

After a minute, Zetsumo would be upon the room. Immediately upon entry, there's a stark increase in temperature. In the center of the room, there's a large mass of bubbling water. Likewise, steam is in abudance, forming a fog -- although not so much that vision was completely obscured. 

"I suppose this works. . .You come here often?" The question is geared to Katsune as he had overheard some of the staff mentioning Kats' frequent visits for whatever reason.* - Fri Sep 18 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Sep 18 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Not a fan of this. - Fri Sep 18 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm usually roped into it. - Fri Sep 18 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Once by the tanned doctor.... - Fri Sep 18 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Once my Kilm's stupidity. - Fri Sep 18 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Whore. - Fri Sep 18 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: And nowwwww. . . - Fri Sep 18 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...I'm never naked though. - Fri Sep 18 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If that's what you're wondering. - Fri Sep 18 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Fri Sep 18 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Ah. Two times. . .That isn't  too often."

He kneels, eying the water strangely. It's clear that Zetsumo was foreign to relaxing to this extent. "And quit your complaining."

After a glance, he can see the clear changing rooms. "I suppose we are to use those," the lad states, before canting his eyes to the apparent 'Spa Expert' that was Katsune. He makes no commentary about those that apparently had 'forced' her into coming either-- at least not just yet.* - Fri Sep 18 22:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Bathing suits are optional, but I'm not gonna say that to tentacle monster zombie over there. - Fri Sep 18 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have allowed Amai to go of course.* - Fri Sep 18 22:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Meanwhile, as they move to get changing, he continues kneeling.

He has underclothes on, after all. It would be no issue to get into the water.* - Fri Sep 18 22:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: One day there will once again be more to my social life than getting drunk and shaking my butt at spas. - Fri Sep 18 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He continued kneeling. 

His hands dip in, feeling the warming sensation that came with the heated pools. It honestly placed Zetsumo's soul at ease, for one reason or another.

Eventually, he's growing impatient, and turning towards the female changing area. Anyone that knew the Zombie-man knew he'd have no qualm in violating the proper procedure and would casually head in. But for now? That scenario is avoided.

"Hurry up in there. I grow bored." The volume is moderate. Not too low, but not too loud either. It's likely enough to barely be heard -- if you're paying attention. Chances are they wouldn't hear it, however.* - Fri Sep 18 22:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He had tapped his fingers restlessly along the edges of the hot springs.

The bubbling water continues to roar, assaulting his flesh and again placing him in a somewhat soothing fashion. Paranoia, however, dictates that Zetsumo remains as alert as always.

"So this is what normal people do to relax. . . It's coming back to me. My mother would frequent areas like this. . .Although, I very rarely stayed around to observe," he says with a sigh, his tone softer than usual, and his voice suggests that he's feeling exceptional nostalgic at the moment. A slight frown comes and goes.

Shifting the subject, Zetsumo looks on to Hanabi -- one of his favored people. SImply because she's as big of a monster as he is. "And more come out the woodwork. What brings you here?"* - Fri Sep 18 23:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
His gaze, despite the soften tone, is as unsettling and creepy as always. 

Each of the women that enter are given a thorough examination. It's as if he's systematically undressing or violating them with his eyes. First beginning with Amai -- as she's the closest, and subsequently falling onto Katsune and HAnabi respectively. 

Of course, it was just that -- a gaze.

He makes not a movement, nor any physical reactions that suggests interests.* - Fri Sep 18 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) scratches his nose while continuing to fidget. His body was descending a bit lower into the hot springs, making the scene appear all to similar to a lobster being cooked alive.

At the sight of Katsune's fading grin, Zetsumo -- on the otherhand -- gains a slight smirk instead.

"I see. I didn't take you for the type to find these things interest. Although I suppose. . . that was a foolish perception, considering how 'social' you are. .. " He falls silent upon hearing Hanabi's second comment in regards to Amai.  His eyes rock from left to right, as their visage interchangeably moves inbetween Amai and Hanabi.

When would the rivalry end? Hopefully never.

"Never. . . say never.." Of course, he merely thinks such, as speaking it aloud would give the impression that he was some sort of predatory. Which wasn't exactly false, mind you.* - Fri Sep 18 23:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) does nothing to stop the rage.

In fact, he moves back, to give Amai some room should she potentially see it fit to rush over and assault Hanabi. Once more, Zetsumo is eating metaphorical popcorn.

"Talk is cheap, Amai," the fiend taunts, hoping to incite more conflict. A hand literally presses against the blonde's back, and pushes her forward. Was she really about that life?* - Sat Sep 19 00:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: gh - Sat Sep 19 00:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) watches as Amai eventually settles down.

He frowns, as a big fight was really being anticipated. "You lack versatility. Those snakes won't be able to help you in every scenario," he comments. "As for why I'm here. . Simple. I was bored, and thus I thought it fit to have my servants entertain me. They were too tired to fight for my enjoyment, thus we came here."

He says 'servants' but really means 'minions.'* - Sat Sep 19 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well snakes are all I have at the moment so I will make do with what I have Alpah~ - Sat Sep 19 00:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yes. - Sat Sep 19 00:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Unfortunate. Regardless. . .Katon is my strongest offensive element. Perhaps I'll be willing to assist in time. - Sat Sep 19 01:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pulls a hand out of the water.

"I said perhaps. Don't get your hopes up."* - Sat Sep 19 01:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 19 01:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) scoffed.

"Please.. . " Clearly, he didn't believe there to be anyone that rivalled him in sheer destructive force.

"And who might that be?"* - Sat Sep 19 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The white snake sage. - Sat Sep 19 01:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Sounds like a fairytale. Where is this 'Snake Sage'? I'd love to see him," Zetsumo declares, his voice suggesting skepticism over Hanabi's claim.* - Sat Sep 19 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Mmm. . .Although, I doubt he is more powerful than me. Your story holds some validity. Most summoning pacts tend to have some type of hierarchy -- one similar to how you explain. Although, that isn't the case for all," the arrogant elementalist declared.

He looks around. . . And honestly, there weren't many people sticking about considering the fact that both he and Hanabi looked like they were pulled out of a horror novel. After some thought, the shinobi sighs, there weren't many others about that he could torment -- although he considers the 'Snake Charmer' for a moment. 

"Nope. She's odd. .. Would have no effect on her."

After some thought, Zetsumo speaks up again. "So tell me. WHy exactly did you leave Kumogakure again? That's where Amai tells me you hail. I presume it was due to Niklaus being. . . a complete idiot?"* - Sat Sep 19 01:48:09 2015

He looks on boredly.

"Strange tattoo. Although. . . It means little, I suppose. Unless this assaults your dignity," the shinobi mutters. He yawns again, and debates what to do next. Take the fight to Kirigakure? COnsidering how often they've come here.

Turn him back, and let him know I have no desire to deal with another one of these. . .'Jashin Lovers' unless actual proof of these deity's might can be given. . .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) casts aglance to Ushinawa. He figured the elder Uchiha would have taken Hideki under his wings.

"I would teach you an additional technique, but I fear they're a bit too unorthodox to jump in  immediately--" Then Hanabi came. "Oh right, you tag along."

That said, he moves a few paces downward, ending on the field just beyond the wooden fences.* - Sat Sep 19 20:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: -....Fuck my life. - Sat Sep 19 20:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: That clone jutsu is becoming an issue. - Sat Sep 19 20:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: We'll resume our attack in the next day. - Sat Sep 19 20:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed- Understood. - Sat Sep 19 20:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) casts a glance briefly to Mariana.

"Oh. Do you wish to learn the Fireball technique as well?" He questions, unaware that Mariana was a Fire Elementalist. Of course, Zetsumo doesn't flinch once with the sudden destruction of the fence. THere may be some debris slamming against his body, but it's widely ignored.* - Sat Sep 19 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: No, just watching. - Sat Sep 19 20:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"I see. For a second, I believed you to be a Katon elementalist," he notes with a shrug. His lips flap once more, but hesistates, as he wasn't quite sure of whether or not to offer more advanced tutoring had Mariana been at a high enough level.

Regardless, attention soon after falls back onto Hideki and Hanabi -- both novices or rookies in regards to the infamous 'Fire Release.' "Considering you both have expressed the ability to use lower leveled Katon techniques, I won't harrass you showing competency. I'm just going to guide you in the sequence. . . step by step. Watch my hands slowly, so I won't be constantly repeating the needed handseals."

Considering their low levels, he takes the long way about. On six seperate occasions, Zetsumo's hand comes together, forming six different or unique hand signs -- each important to moulding your chakra in specific manners. Eventually, on the sixth, Katon chakra is boiling over, and churning in his stomach as the innate temperature was on a stark incline. "The first step is simple. You built up a condensed mass of Katon-based energy. Make sure your stomach is filled with a concentrated source, enough to make it feel as if your inside is just one big, organic stove."

Those with sensing easily can read the process, and tell he's doing precisely as what was being told. 

"Like with most Katon Release techniques, the fire you produce usually goes from the oxygen inside your body. Meaning, breathing control is very important. Inhale oxygen into your lungs or diaphragm and make sure it sits there. The Katon chakra from your stomach should then transfer, moving towards your chest and sit there. Make the two substances -- the Katon chakra and oxygen -- mesh into one. After saturating the Katon chakra and oxygen. . " He goes through the process again.

In a cartoonish process, Zetsumo's chest expands as it's filled to the brink of popping with oxygen. As depicted, his vast chakra reservoirs pools over, and mixes in. Without another word, the elemental master takes a step forward, and shoots a fire ball inbetween Hanabi and Hideki.

THankfully, it's only released once pass the two individuals as the flaming sphere is massive. The mass is enough to dwarf a small squadron of shinobi, and it sails harmlessly into the skies. Even being close would heed minor burns, or at least the sensation of heat as the energy waves cascaded from the inferno's burns. 

". . .The last process is just using shape manipulation to form the fire into a sphere. Alternatively, you can avoid that portion and just send the fire out in a form of a stream.  Of course, the most important part is mixing the chakra with your the oxygen in your chest. Try this again and again. Eventually, you'll be able to produce a decent, offensive Katon technique."* - Sat Sep 19 21:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sits indian style as he awaits the duo to get to work. 

His eyes drift on over to Mariana. "If you also wish for some tutelage in Katon release. . .Fear not to ask. The mate of my comrade is an ally as well."* - Sat Sep 19 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Yessir, I prefer to watch for now. - Sat Sep 19 21:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Sigh* - Sat Sep 19 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. It was pitiful -- the attempt that is.

"Horrible. Regardless, I said I would teach you. Not hold your hand. You've gotten the instructions, now the rest is up to you and your talent to complete," he says lazily.* - Sat Sep 19 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ushinawa. - Sat Sep 19 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: A word. - Sat Sep 19 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Sat Sep 19 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sure. - Sat Sep 19 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't seem phased by the change. He's seen much worse transformations during his previous stay with the Huevo.

"And that's that. I'll leave you to work on the technique on your own time."

Meanwhile, he turns, looking towards the gathering of underlings that had huddled up along the wall. "Zen, I trust you've been working on the poisons. . .And. . " Cue gaze falling onto Katsune.

"You and I need to speak."* - Sat Sep 19 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I made them, brother. - Sat Sep 19 21:49:39 2015

Didn't seem annoyed nor upset.

He takes silent paces, and stops once within a few inches. After pausing for a few moments, the behemoth leans over, and begins to whisper due to noticing the very clear changes in Katsune's demeanor. * - Sat Sep 19 21:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Right. . .So what the fuck is up with you? I've noticed you've become reclusive and far more .. . aggressive. - Sat Sep 19 21:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Aggression towards me. . Sure. But it's spreading. - Sat Sep 19 22:00:44 2015

His index finger flicks again and again. They aren't too harsh, but aim to strike the girl in the forehead to gain attention and response.

Of course, it remains to be seen just how long he could remain this patient.* - Sat Sep 19 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was just a finger flick.

As she steps to the side, Zetsumo grows more aggressive. Tiny strings are pushing through his flesh. They aim to lash again against the girl's forehead. The strength is held back mightily, making the pain reminiscient of a rubberband.* - Sat Sep 19 22:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I just needed a distraction, after the battle in Konoha. - Sat Sep 19 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I never got one. - Sat Sep 19 22:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He remained stationary as the girl was finally beginning to crack. The subtle body movements -- be it the scowl or brow twitch-- mildly amuses him, although that fact isn't shown.

At last, the lashes of the threads ceases, although only for a moment.* - Sat Sep 19 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: 'Distraction' how? - Sat Sep 19 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Likewise. I'll trust that you are being factual. Unless you want to eventually feel the wrath of my. . .More unorthodox methods of extracting information. - Sat Sep 19 22:14:24 2015

He is unsure what to make of the bodily reaction. Although, by now, his paranoia almost always made him think Katsune was lying or hiding some of the truth. 

"Mmm. Well then, elaborate more of 'distractions'," the fiend whispers. He had every intent on ensuring that the young elementalist re-obtained her previous attitude or personality. After all, he'd still require Katsune's strength in what could be the final battle.* - Sat Sep 19 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 19 22:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) apparently wasn't headbutted.

He looks back down to Katsune and wears a smile. "Maybe, maybe not. If you don't want that to happen, you could just speak up right now," he replies with a shrug.* - Sat Sep 19 23:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: ...Not talking about this right here. - Sat Sep 19 23:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow. It seemed Katsune would never tire of this never-ending battle. When would she realize Zetsumo was the one that ran the show?

Quickly, a hand snaps ahead, to grab the girl by her hair. Assuming success, she'd grab her, and toss the woman's small frame over his body. Hopefully there would be no need for threads to capture her.

"I will return shortly. Sabo -- I hope you've been working on your Great Breakthough. As for Amai, I'll return soon to discuss some terms. You may just be getting your ink."

With that said, the shinobi moves south with Katsune in tow.* - Sat Sep 19 23:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have continued to drag her along before coming towards a familiar area.

There's a debate, whether or not to just slam her body through the wall -- But that thankfully is decided against. Since that would probably leave her heavily damaged, if not hospitalized.

Once by the house, the door is kicked open. He steps through, and using his Domu form again, the girl is pressed and pinned against the wall.

"SOmetimes. I get the feeling that you subconscious enjoy being abused. . . Anyway, speak up. I don't have all day."* - Sat Sep 19 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm asked me to date him. I had to tell him no. Had to be extremely mean, too. - Sat Sep 19 23:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rolls his eyes.

Teenaged drama. If only he actually had a normal life as a teenager.

"Elaborate."* - Sat Sep 19 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because I knew, if I said yes, and we dated.... - Sat Sep 19 23:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Gruffly, he chortles at the comment. 

"Mmm. ." His voice is whimiscal.  "You are correct in that regards, dear." Immediately, the tone deepers, breaching 'demonic' territory, and even echoes along the cramped room. A doton-covered hand moves, stroking through the woman's locks.

"And is that what's been chewing you up so badly. . . The fact that you belong to me? That in the end, forming a romantic bond with anyone is futile as in the end, you are essentially property. A plaything I can choose to use whenever I am in need of entertainment. . ." Zetsumo says with an exceptionally long drawl. His lips pressed together, and eventually part to reveal a smile.

The smile itself continued to stretch, revealing cloth-like strings that run along his cheeks, lips, and even are visible if you look down his throat. 

"Y'know. . .You remind me much of Mukade -- even if that is one of your nemesis. It's amusing how you don't see the correlation."* - Sat Sep 19 23:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
For reference, his hand isn't carrying her by the hair.

He's pinning her to the wall by clinging onto the cloth by her torso/chest, and pushing her ahead.* - Sat Sep 19 23:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The simper from before grows only wider at the response.

"And how would you know that? You're hardly with me," he replies. The parallels between Katsune and Mukade only grew more evident -- she too had a similar conversation.

"Not to say that I would ever consider just 'settling' down. . . Relationships are for the weak."* - Sat Sep 19 23:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 19 23:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wouldn't want a relationship anyway. Especially with you. - Sat Sep 19 23:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued to sport that creepy, doll-like grin.

"Is that so? Then why bring up your suspicion? I am appreciative of the fact that you would not desire such relations. . .But your comment still make me skeptical. . ." His eyes shift to the right for a bit in thought, before they're directed right back to Katsune.

There was some offense to the comment.

"Although. . You speak as if it wouldn't be an honor to even be considered as a potential mate by a -god.- You should be grateful that I even keep you around as a  potential plaything."* - Sat Sep 19 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 19 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If...I'm not the only one you use...then I'm just meat. - Sat Sep 19 23:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) briefly grinned once more.

"And what if you were the only one?" He says passively. It's unclear if he's legitimately questioning or taunting the girl.* - Sat Sep 19 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 19 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then.... - Sat Sep 19 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd still hate you. - Sat Sep 19 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) actually lets out a hearty laugh.

"Now that was a good one. . " His grip is moved seconds after, and grasps about the girl's neck-- although doesn't choke.

"Although rude. I dislike rudeness. . .Although, I do take pleasure in dealing with people as hard-headed as you. If it didn't matter, why do you bring up the potential for there to be 'others'?"Using his now herculean strength, the girl is being lifted a bit upward, high enough that she'd have to look down to stare Zetsumo in the eye.* - Sat Sep 19 23:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Discolored, and lifeless eyes stare ahead. As best as he could, he aimed to establish eye contact.

". . .Speak," he demands simply.

The visuals, as usual, are a source of great amusement as he watched Katsune feebly aim to get into a comfortable condition.* - Sun Sep 20 00:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He allows the girl to descend once more, and holds her at eye level.

"Is that so? As much as I would 'love' to patch up our relationship. To do so would give the illusion that you are more than just my thrall. That gives potential for weakness -- as you know, emotion can hold back your true power. .. "

Having given the explanation, his hand swat down, aiming to throw Katsune off with a slant. She'd likely slam into the wall assuming her cat-like reflexes hadn't kicked in.

Zetsumo still chuckles here and then, finding the entire situation. "And that's it. . Hrm? Good to know, however. Continue to rebuff Kilm's advances. You belong to me. Understood?"* - Sun Sep 20 00:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now leave. You're making my house smell. - Sun Sep 20 00:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
--Had been prepared to leave.

In fact, he turning around. . .Then Katsune had to open her mouth. His nostril flares, and like a raging bull, Zetsumo turns about face. ". . .Hrm. . ." There's a visible twitch on his eyebrow that seems to be on repeat. A vein even pops out of his forehead.* - Sun Sep 20 00:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

It was as if she -wanted- to invoke his wrath. Although, subconsciously these were the minions that Zetsumo enjoyed the most. Simply because forcing them to be docile felt rewarding and earned.

Immediately, he takes a step forward, and hand stretches out quickly -- and as usual is held together by strange, life-like threads. The mitt eventually falls back onto her head of hair.

"So I smell. . . Swell. Although, leaving won't solve the issue. . . After all, in our next interaction, you will simply have to endure my strench against. No?"* - Sun Sep 20 00:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means no rape. - Sun Sep 20 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
His fingers wiggled about, petting the top of Katsune's head like she was a damn puppy.

"Oh? Don't start battles you aren't prepared to lose, 'Kat.' And here I was ready to offer you the opportunity to rid me of this stench," he says, putting emphasis on 'offer' and 'opportunity.' An emphasis that implies that it wasn't gonig to be an offer at all, but rather a demand.

However, at Katsune's behest, he'd allow her chance to rest-- though likely intends to start up once more. The hand from before grips at her neck, and she's forcibly dragged into the air, soon slamming into her mattress.* - Sun Sep 20 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
It's the back of the neck, mind you.* - Sun Sep 20 00:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Close your eyes, rapeface. - Sun Sep 20 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) leans against the wall.

His eyes are wide open, and he isn't blinking at all. ". .. You fail to realize I take commands from no one."* - Sun Sep 20 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Although, I suppose that is the difference between you and Mukade. You are a bit more developed," his says as his eyes clearly wander about Katsune's features.

As she went to slumber? He continued to lean against the wall for a while in thought.* - Sun Sep 20 00:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Nice day huh sir? - Sun Sep 20 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glances around.

Who. . . In the hell. . . were these people? ". .Evening. I don't recall seeing around here. Nor. . .you," he turns towards the woman with a gourd. As they were unknown, he's automatically on alert.

"Speak your names."* - Sun Sep 20 16:35:12 2015

Has a clone take the messenger bird. 

It rights a response.* - Sun Sep 20 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) frowned.

He disliked the message that had been delivered clearly. Spiritedly, the warrior is jotting down a response, before sending it flying towards Kirigakure via a duck summoning.

". . .The spineless jackasses. WHen they have the advantage, they're trying to annihilate us. Now that they're backed into a corner, they want to negotiate peace. . ."* - Sun Sep 20 17:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was -really- worked up.

"Mmm. . .Bastards from Kirigakure. All of a sudden, this is 'senseless' bloodshed. The cowards. . .I'm going to annihilate them all. . "* - Sun Sep 20 17:08:28 2015
