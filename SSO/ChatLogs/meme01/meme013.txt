". . .He got quite the bit of tech, But this won't be enough to stop me. Ducks utilize Suiton and Fuuton. . . Both of which are great components in elemental techniques-combinations rather. " In no time, lightning is being developed, and slung along the water.  The added power enforces a swift taken down of the shield, which quickly is discharged.  The light illuminated from the defensive constructs begins to flicker before it dies.

"Wooah! Shit, this is bad! Time to fire my laser again!" Marco roared, although he doesn't seem too distressed, despite the tone of voice. The same cannon used in previous rounds are put to work again. It fires a vibrant, purple-colored beam of pure death. The goal? To evaporate both Zetsumo and Dorja. 

"Dorja. Dodge!"  He says in a pokemon-styled fashion. Of course she'd know to avoid herself. Suimen is employed, allowing Zetsumo to clamp down. In response to the beam, Dorja's body spunt, and narrowly evaded the incoming strike. She was pretty fast herself. "Good! Let's finish this, while his shield is down!" 

Thankfully, Marco isn't too reflexive. The only reason he had managed to evade elemental attacks to this point was due to how high the man could get into the air. Now that Dorja was hot on his trail? That was no longer an issue. Quickly, he wings flap, allowing sharpened strips of wind to be developed. Each particle of oxygen moves with eagerness, and aim to rip this pesky warrior to shreds. On impact, his body is cut up fiercely, exposing bone, and making liters of blood gush out.

No doubt, by now, Marco's death is a forgone conclusion. But. . .  Being the petty guy that he is, Zetsumo seeks to have the last word. "May you rot in hell, you shit bag!" Katon spews from his lips shortly afterward, and absolutely drenches the male's body. The attack itself is so hot, that simply looking on would expose vast quantities of heatwaves speeding from the inferno's figure. As the attack scorches Marco's frame. . .

The tech-user doesn't even scream. Rather, he unleashes a jester-like chortle, that ominously wave through the area. Un-phased, the Zombie Elementalist remains perched on the Duck Summoning. They fly off, prepared to take on the next challenge. Although by now, his stamina and chakra reservoirs were reaching a concerning level.  At this rate, it was clear that full power was going to be needed.

Then comes the next series of battles. With a powerful summoning now in use, and four Earth Grudge Creatures on demand, the incoming attacks are all handled effectively. He isn't required to use as much chakra, due to Dorja's amazing strength. Likewise, the Earth Grudge Creatures pose a great threat, even with physical might. Thus, even more spiritual energy is saved.

Eight more battles are effortlessly taken, albeit forces the use of his 'Full Transformation.' In this state, Zetsumo has a far more potent pool of chakra, and can battle for prolonged period of times. In addition to this fact, his elemental prowess  were leagues above their normal state, allowing for him to completely and easily overwhelm most conventional enemies.  It's this ability that allows him to make it pass eight more opponents effectively, while also dispatch of two additional foes shortly after.

Albeit, the last two took moderate force, and assistance from his personal summoning. Again and again, they were laying waste to opponents, each with different skillsets to force him to use every bit of strategy that could be thought of. It was for this that Zetsumo should be fortunate - of all the skills he held in his arsenal. It allows him to essentially be ready for any. . . and -everything-. Two more opponents in the end are defeated, and he advances to foe numero twenty-two.

By this point, he's seen it all. From genjutsu users, taijutsu specialists, and even powerful elementalists. Nevermind the tech-guy that was defeated. Certainly, the Gezo Empire was host to a slew of very powerful, and versatile subordinates. Yet by now, it was becoming evident that no one could quite compare to the strength that was held within the God of War's body. He seemed to be on an entirely different level of power, perhaps rivalling some of the best Gezo had to offer. Certainly, he'd be worthy of the title sergeant.
On the twenty-fifth trial, an absolute joker is about. His name, Jake? He claims to be from 'State Farm.' Lazily, the male seemed to take out Khakis, and whip them around in lively pace. Although, this is only done with the use  of chakra. Effortlessly, Zetsumo of course manages to do away with the opponent, likely forcing him into retirement, if he even manages to survive the fatal impalements. "Tch. . . What a joke. Clothes ninjutsu? That will never be useful." Angrily, he's moving ahead, and entering through the next opening.

There's a grimace being worn on his face through all of this. For the next four battles, Zetsumo wore a scowl, while sluggishly taking on whatever opponent had been offered. It's a repetitive process, but is one he's willing to take on.  After all, the perks of being deemed Sergeant certainly would be worth it. . .No? It's by this point he's entering the 30th and final door. The gate creeks open and the warrior steps in.
For the next few minutes, there seemed to be no opponent. Again, his foe was hiding, much to the chagrin and annoyance of a man that honestly was just here to kick ass and take names. Eyes scan around the area eagerly, and his hands are pressed against the ground to sense for any opponents or traps that could be on the ground. Yet there was nothing. Was this another 'non-person'. This being a person with a ludicrous level of stealth.  "Hrm. . . Why. . . Why?!"

"Why are they making me jump through hoops? I'd expect them to give up by now, and just hand me the damn rank. No one can beat me!" complained the Kenryoku leader to his personal companion as they moved onto the twenty-third arena.  He was being pretty vocal of his displeasure, and thus his commentary is overheard by the next opponent.  She snickers, seemingly amused or entertained by the childish complains.

"My, my~. . .  Aren't you just an arrogant one? Y'know. . . I like my men egotistical. Tell ya what. . . Quit this game, and just come with me? I think I'd enjoy you," said the seductive, feminine voice. The casual talking allows her location to be spotted easily, although she was hardly hiding. The woman goes by the name of 'Ivy', despite how cliché that may be. Her flesh is partially green for reason currently unknown, and there seems to almost always be an intrigued simper being worn.
"As fun as that may be. I think I'm going to decline," rebutted Zetsumo with sarcasm. "I will, however, grant you the opportunity. Quit - or be put down. I have no qualms with bring harm to a woman, no matter how she looks," the male declares bluntly. Seductive or not, he had one goal in mind - to become sergeant .This woman was in his way, thus she had to be eliminated, whether she liked it or not. 

"Awww! You're no fuunnnnnnn! But whatever, I'll just beat you up, then take you captive? I wonder what the world will think when the God of War was absolutely creamed by some dainty-looking chick, hehe," Ivy replies. Her hands come together, forming the Bird Seal. As a note, the area around had sparse vegetation lingering  around. Y'know, things like grass, bushes, and so forth. It was hardly anything of concern.

Then the technique is enacted. Reacting to Ivy's chakra, the plant-life grew more lively. They'd dance around, before suddenly enlarging. From all about, the landmass was being shifted. The ground croaked, as roots from underneath forces the earth to literally split. And suddenly, a small forest was birthed out of nowhere, and Ivy's location was hidden. "Oi. . . So a plant manipulator? Now that's new." 

By now, each of Zetsumo's Earth Grudge Creatures are out, and stalking the area, as this was likely going to be the last significant battle of the entire exam. If he could win this? Then the Sergeant Rank was his. Sadly, he had to be able to actual locate the victim. And in a forest this thick that was going to be a difficult task to accomplish, sure enough. "Well then. . . I'll just break the forest down. The Katon and Fuuton heart will remain with me. In addition to this, I'll send Lightning and Water around, to locate the potential location of this wench."

As they usually did, the Fire and Wind brothers linked up together, and without another moment, unleashed a massive torrent of fire. It's absolutely massive, and threatens to incinerate anyone in the path in an instant. The forest - at least the one in the current direction of the 'Hellstorm - is set ablaze. Darken smog releases itself into the atmosphere,  and the plant life is being reduced to ashes. Sadly, it seemed that Ivy wasn't particularly in that area.

From his rear, sharpened leaves are being sent forward, with about five actually managing to penetrate and piece through skin. It doesn't stop until exitting the opposite end of the body. With a grunt, the male almost doubles over in pain, yet he's too surprised to actually be focused on that sensation for too long. "How the fuck did she get over -there- of all places?!" It was clear something was up, as the woman had essentially teleported into an entirely different area. Yes, she could have ran. . . But logically, based on the distance, there was no way she could have gotten that far in such a short time.

". . Get 'em." Yet despite the woman's stealthy tactics, the strike revealed the location. And from out of nowhere, the lightning -affinity'd Earth Grudge Creature leaps from behind a tree. Electricity coils, and speeds on out, intent on sending her body into shock, and perhaps just ending the battle right then and there. Yet, casually, she slips into a nearby vine - Which is subsequently destroyed. (Of course, the Vine was thick, enough to rival a human's body.)

As the vegetation is absolutely ravished, Ivy still remained nowhere to be seen. Unknown to the battling Jiongu Thread monster, it seemed that the woman held a strange ability. Much like Zetsu (naruto) she could travel along plant life, and thus move along at an accelerated rate. It was this speed that made her able to easily spy on an opponent while also speeding out of harm's way - so long as there existed a plant-like object to bind with. She'd grin, again displacing herself further along the  forest while surveying.

"So he can control each of those creatures at will. It's going to make fighting him head on too difficult. I got a plan. . ."Ivy thought with a devilish smirk. For the next few minutes, Zetsumo is searching for Ivy, yet seems unable to find the ever-elusive manipulator of plants. Then there's a noticeably crunch. It sounds like leaves, dried ones, being crushed. "Yoo hooo~! Over here, hun!" She calls out, getting the fiend's attention. Her hand flicks out, and mimicking Zetsumo's constant usage of Jiongu Threads, a jagged vine is sent out.

It aims to whip ahead, and impale the body.  While primarily an elementalist, that didn't mean he lacked any physical ability. Dexterously, his body sways out, and he's speeding ahead. That means little, however, as the girl is focused on continuously whipping at his body, and due to her impressive chakra capabilities, it does move fast.  Considering the thickness of the forest, he opts to give the Earth Grudge Creatures some rest, and allow them to serve only as support. 

In response to the constantly pressuring vine whips, one handsign is done, encasing his body a  protective covering. It's very much apparent that his skin is essentially stone, which defends him from the attack with little difficulties. Going further, shunshin is applied, giving a sudden boost in speed. Rocketing forward, his fist juts ahead, all with the intention of hammering the girl right in the face! . . Then the most obvious naruto trope is employed.

Plume!
It was all a clone. The flesh reverts back to plant-like material. But ontop of this, with the clones disperse, a strange gas is released. It's toxic, and inadvertently is ingested by Lord Zetsumo himself. Seconds later, the toxic pathogens are rushing away  and attacking his body cells. It was as if someone had suddenly taken out thousands of microscopic pin-needles, and systematically began to poke and prod at each individual cells.

The pain was overwhelming, and even with the male's penchant for taking harm, even this was uncomfortable. Sadly, this wasn't the most significant of the poison's effects. Indeed, from this came a sudden depletion of the meager chakra and stamina left in his body. Dangerously, the cells were seemingly being stripped from stake on the energy reserves. 

"Shit. . .Got me!" the adult curses under his voice. With the curse, a whimsical tone roams through the forest-like landscape. It is of course. . . Ivy. "Hehehe! You shoulda quit when I gave you the chance, hun. Now I have to kill you. Especially for burning down my precious children," she says, referencing the plants that had been burned down. The fire itself still goes through, releasing blackened smoke. . ."Smoke. I get the idea now. . "
Yep. As this was a building, the smog from before was likely clouding up the area, and making the room unbreath-able. Having a small amount of chakra left, Zetsumo quickly slips underground, feigning as if he was fleeing. "Hahaha! You cannot escape me, hun. Your energy is going to reach a critical level. Soon enough, you won't even be able to walk due to how tired you'll be~!" And she was right. At the rate this was going. He was fixing to die.
Then came the Fire Earth Grudge. Through this all, he had been discreetly releasing it's 'Burning Ash' technique. Due to the appearance, said ash was more than capable of blending in with the poor smog. Which didn't seem to be negatively effecting Ivy for whatever reason. Not that he was complaining. Seconds turned into minutes, and by now. . . Zetsumo's chakra reservoirs was nearing uselessness.
Then the grand plan is enacted. As the area was completely lathered in the smoke, several tags are released into the floor. It ignites, and unleashes a massive explosion of death. It completely annihilates the plants and presumably Ivy herself. Once the chaos had subsided, the warrior crawls back up. He's unable to even stand on two feet. . .Yet the Sergeant Exams had been won. He had been the victor.
A Gezo Empire representative comes from out of nowhere. It's a brown-haired  gent. He seems kingly, as if he's a member of some royal family. "Ah. . . So you actually did it? I'll admit. I was skeptical when I heard they essentially handed you the Private Rank. Yet your skill in today's battles, it was something to be praised. Your name will be written into the database, and I will have you transported back home."
An emblem is set onto Zetsumo's cloak, to denote him as a certified sergeant. Calmly, with the very minor amount of energy, Dorja is again brought back - after he had the opportunity to recover a smidget of energy. The antidote for the previous poison had been administered beforehand. Having settled that, the Duck takes him and settles the gent onto her back. Once let out, they're flying through the skies, and heading back home to Konohagakure. 
If able, he'd purchase the required scrolls, involving various medical techniques, and perhaps even some elemental skills. Nonetheless, he's in route to the motherland. It would be a few day's travel for sure. "Hah. . . Hah. Finally Sergeant. Now to go get some rest." His body still is banged up, clearly, and the threads are having trouble in repairing his body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Caaww!-- Wait no. Quack!" Dorja roars along the skies. She's speeding through the skies. Her massive size, roughly the mass of a small house begins to descend forward. It's enough length to momentarily blot out the sun, or rather, cast a shadow onto those on the ground.

With swiftness, Zetsumo finally lands. You can tell, he's still tired, even if the exams had been done days ago.

In tatters, the shinobi looks ahead. "What a pain in the ass. . ."* - Sat Sep 05 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives a nod to Maya. It seemed she hadn't stayed true to her words, which was honestly delightful.

Soon after, Zetsumo shifts his gaze to Amu.

"Ah. Our discussion last time ended prematurely. I am often a very fatigued individual. I trust no one has been unnecessarily hostile, yes? People here tend to get a bit. . . antsy when they see a new face."

The brute spoke lazily, while still trying to shake off the awkward feeling in his body. * - Sat Sep 05 16:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his eyes. Something about her was annoying him.

"Speak with confidence, woman. Motion sensor explosive tags sound nice, however you speak as if you're unsure of how useful they'll be. Likewise. . . i am told you also are good with weapon making? I am also in need of chakra conductive weapons -- not a lot. But I need them, nevertheless."* - Sat Sep 05 16:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) moves ahead. He casually strokes. . .Maya's bum as he converses with the perhaps the most intelligent woman in Konoha.

THere's a stoic expression worn all the same. It's like he isn't even doing anything at all. "As for you. . . Medic. I have three scrolls in delivery. All high-leveled medical techniques."* - Sat Sep 05 16:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods in response to Maya.

"Right. Glad this has appeased you. Two of the techniques provided are particularly offensive, you may take a liking to it," he says in response to the ambitious medical shinobi. His gaze falls back onto Amu.

"In anycase. We can work out the specifics later, we'll meet in my office. In the meantime, tell me. You are aware of my. . . recent assault on Sunagakure, correct? Hrm. . " He stifles a grin. It remains unclear whether or he's amused at her expensive. The eyes worn suggest one thing -- he is seriously curious.

"I took out a number of shinobi in my attack. I wonder. How do you feel about such a thing? I'd assume either saddened. . . or happy. After all, your comrades never once came to your aid."* - Sat Sep 05 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) peered closer. He can tell, she was placing a facade. Either that, or her time in AMegakure had completely stripped her of any bit of humanity. Regardless, Zetsumo was engaged.

"Then tell me. What is your opinion on the matter?" He speaks again. The tone suggests he isn't asking, but rather commanding that she comply. Although, his body language is completely non-threatening as the strokes of Maya's bum continues. * - Sat Sep 05 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow.

"So you do know him?"* - Sat Sep 05 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) did that on purpose.* - Sat Sep 05 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grins.

"How silly of me. I meant was. He died in combat," the male says with a shrug. An eye trains in, wondering if the woman would even flinch at the news.* - Sat Sep 05 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"I see through your attempts. I can tell, you seek to strip yourself of human emotion just as I've done. Mmm, but I can tell. You lack what it takes, give up the act," he says with condescent, each word carrying a bit of harshness.

After some pause, the mercenary leader continues.

"Tell me. What was your relation to this man? You realize. . . He was a huge thorn in my side. And a general baffoon."* - Sat Sep 05 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And thus the reports are given in.

"Hng. . . " He looks ahead to the Amegakure shinobi, speaking  in a short-breathed fashion. "An attack. Mmm, see if they hold any relevant information. If not? Have them killed. I'm going to go look at the gates, and maybe check around in the forest. Any sensors in the immediate area?"* - Sat Sep 05 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a wicked grin. His heart was racing, not out of fear, but adrenaline. It seems his body count could be seeing an increase -- hopefully.

"Right. Maya, Amu. I want you all to go take shelter. Neither of you are fighters, I will have men placed in your holding areas to serve as protection."

Meanwhile, he's barking out orders. Entire squadrons of sensors are sent out, to investigate the area, in order to sense out any hidden enemies or traps.* - Sat Sep 05 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Would have guards come escorted Amu and Maya away. Of course, each had their own rooms, and likely were in different buildings -- unless asked otherwise.* - Sat Sep 05 17:34:30 2015

There were already shinobi on the wall. 

In response to the massive flock dropping off their tags, the guarding shinobi act quickly. Any with repelling techniques fire all, hopping to stave off the falling pellets of death. 

Across the village, a PA system blares, warning all citizens to move indoors, and to lock their houses down.* - Sat Sep 05 18:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) quickly string through a small set of seals. 

In no time, a massive gale of wind flies ahead, forcing the toxic gas to be directed upward. Due to the strength of the current, a large chunk of the smog likely is dissipated.* - Sat Sep 05 18:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts. This was a pain. The village was falling short on supplies, and soon they'd need food. Nevertheless, he remain calmed. After all, even with the small supplies. . .The Kenryoku was a priority and would eat -- ahead of the other shinobi.

Calmly, a letter is written and sent off. It's  carried by one of his duck summons.* - Sat Sep 05 18:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts.

He looks ahead towards the west and frowns. "It's time then. . . Then I step into the offensive." His body convulses, and from his body, two specimens are formed. One holds the Fire Kanji, the other holds the Fuuton Kanji. "Kitora. Osamu, I want you all to take these two creatures, and go see if the eastern portion of the village. If nothing is wrong, report here, and protect our entrance."

He turns, giving a glance to Beth. "Use your mind body switch. Take towards the skies, then report to me whatever you see. i'll have guards protect you as handle that."

No time is wasted. With a single motion, Zetsumo disappears into a plume of smoke, and begins to move towards the west.* - Sat Sep 05 18:34:14 2015

Quickly, the shinobi would have made a call. H

However, on such short notice, only one-hundred-fifty Amegakure shinobi would have been able to immediately respond. And honestly? In all of his arrogance, Zetsumo deemed that to be enough. Alongside Kilm, the brute was ready to go to work.

"Douse them in water."

It wasn't long before the male had called onto his Earth Grudge Creatures in timely fashion -- these made using only the Water and Lightning hearts in his possession. Having unleashed the destructive duo, Zetsumo performs one final method of preparation. Internally, each inch of the threads left lingering in his body proceeded to shift. They would all be loosened, and grants the mercenary a larger sum of chakra reservoirs, and in addition to this, increased spiritual force.

In no time at all, massive streams of water are being poured out, in hopes of dousing the massive ensemble of opposing troops. Each one caught likely suffers from immense concussive force, perhaps rendering them conciously.

Simultaneously with the act, Zetsumo forms the 'Snake' handsign, forcing large pillars to entrap some of the opposing troops in thick slabs of earth.ALthough, the frontal region would be left open partially in the form of a hole -- only so that they were still opened to further punishment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Assuming Kilm complies, he ceases his conversing. Quickly, the Zetsumo's Water Earth Grudge continues to drop massive streams of water onto the area. And why? As a simple set up.

Once a large radius had been thoroughly saturated in water, the Lightning Earth Grudge kreeps into the scene. Linking up, the duo performs an impressive combination, which utilizes a combination of Earth Flash, in addition to the generic 'Raging Wave.' The combo seeks to amplify the electricity, up until it ran along the floor and electrocutes all of the opposing troops that main be in the area.

Of course, the goal was to avoid harming Amegakure shinobi, thus the attack is geared towards where there is only cluster of Suna-nins. The risk of friendly firing remained evident.

That settled, Zetsumo, still in the distance moves to press his mitts along the floor. On impact, the ground shifts and four large pillars of Earth are erected. Speedily, they move upward, and impaling and reducing the once proud shinobi into Shish Kabobs.* - Sat Sep 05 19:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

He had no intention on allowing any of these shinobi to escape -- if it could be helped. As they make the evasive measures, Zetsumo is still aiming to cause havoc. Starting off the chain, a single handsign is produced, shifting the ground to the mud. The water spawned before only serves as a stimulate to the generic, Mud River technique.

Waves of mud speeds out, aiming to crash against shinobi. Although honestly, this was just to set up for the next act.

Now that mud had been produced in abundance, the shinobi strings through three seals. Quickly, a Dragon Head spawned from the ground. From it's mouth, dozens of cannon-sized spheres of mud were being launched, aiming to attack the Sunagakure shinobi in bulk. 

Meanwhile, the EArth Grudge Creatures continue to wreak havoc. This time in more controlled fashions. The Lightning Mask shot out Raiton Balls while the Suiton Mask continued with the simplistic, yet highly powered water streams.* - Sat Sep 05 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And another one bites the dust.

His Lightning Mask is killed by some random stroke of luck. Nevertheless, Zetsumo is still adamant in his pursuit. Beth, by now, is moved to a safer place by some random NPC, since he can't risk chasing with her being carried around while unconscious. 

Still hot in pursuit, shinobi continues with his endeavors, sending additional rounds of speedy mud bullets as they gave chase.

In the distance, the Katon and Wind masks would be hastily rushing along, to not only reach but to attack the Sunagakure shinobi. Previously, they would have been with Kitora and Osamu, near the village's entrance. Assuming the ability to reach the fleeing Sunagakure Shinobi in a timely fashion, a stream of fire would run along the ground, forming massive, semi-cricles of fire. The goal? To be an obstacle.

Following that shortly after is a Divine Wind.  Due to nature of the affinities, the wind mixes in with the flames, prompting a massive onslaught of fire to be released, creating essentially a 'Fire Tornado.' It scorches the area and hopefully takes out additional, fleeing men.* - Sat Sep 05 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had returned in a plume of smoke. All the hearts, save for one, are back where they belong.

"Hrm. . . That was refreshing. You claim the Kumogakure shinobi were 'Suna-Nin's?"* - Sat Sep 05 19:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead to the recently arrived Maya.

"How was it?" He says, questioning if the woman had been comfortable when in protective custody.* - Sat Sep 05 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) collects the money.

He pockets it. "I'm up one-fifty. Hrm. . . I must manage my money carefully."* - Sat Sep 05 21:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Genjutsu Binding
Vaccum Spheres
Doton Wall* - Sat Sep 05 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) meanwhile. He has one of his assistants rush to deliver the orders. 

It's a message sent to the Gezo, along with the money required.* - Sat Sep 05 22:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) also gets handed a scroll.

It's the scroll on 'Chakra No Mesu'. Or chakra scalpels. The male whistles, and beckons Maya over admist the game.* - Sat Sep 05 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) hands over the scroll.

"You can see fatigue in his eyes. We may hang later, i'm going to nap."* - Sat Sep 05 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) goes to chill at the crib.* - Sat Sep 05 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have awakened.

"You still up, Maya?"* - Sun Sep 06 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Not really much on my agenda either. If you would like, I can have my assistants cook up something for you," He replies casually. He looks down, and his hand moves,clearly prepared to rest on her bum, yet it stops. After all, she's sitting.* - Sun Sep 06 05:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow. He was a bit relieved at the information given. Now there was a way to pacify the woman -- without violence.

"Good. Maybe I can give you sometime. Although. . . I don't think i'd much of a massuess. The previous offer still stands," the lad replies.* - Sun Sep 06 05:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Just ask I'd suppose."* - Sun Sep 06 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Fine. I won't have my summoning hold back, mind you," Zetsumo states casually., He gives a nod to the arriving duo of Kilm and Katsune. Abruptly, the shinobi heads out, and movges to the west of the mansion.* - Sun Sep 06 10:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He bites on his thumb, drawing some blood. Now that the blood sacrifice had been reached, the shinobi moves through five short handsigns. A mitt presses against the ground, and unleashes a sealing formula onto the flooring. As it reaches it's climax, the formula spotaneously combusts, allowing for a magnificient Space-Time technique to be enacted. From some strange point in the world, a massive duck had been called forth. It's the size of a general house, and certainly appears to hold great strength. Already, it's levitating, or rather. . . Flying.

"Dorja. I want you to go put this girl in her place. Commence battle."* - Sun Sep 06 11:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawned.

"You get a high leveled technique, and that's all you use for combat," he notes, scolding the girl for her growing reliance on the Earth Dragon technique. Meanwhile, Dorja still hovers above. No commands are given from Zetsumo, sadly enough, leaving the duck on her own.

Quickly, she'd soar a bit out of range. From her tush, eggs seemingly were being pushed out from her body -- three in specific. They move down, clattering against the ground and well. .  combusts! From it, sudden streams of wind are unleashed, dealing solely concussive damage. But even that was enough to leave a mark. Just how would Kitora deal with the threat?* - Sun Sep 06 11:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The second Kitora moved, Dorja went back on the offensive. The exploding eggs of winds, despite the Nara moving, still would prove to be a legitimate obstacle. Torrents of breezes are unleashed, as if those eggs were used as a storage for moderate storm winds. 

Seconds later, the duck had descended just a tad. One mighty flick of her wings are done. As the flap was infused with chakra, just as a common Fan-Spec would do, currents are spontaneously produced. Yet it went further than just a simple current. Nay, the winds held sharpened edges. In actual battle, it could prove to be deadly, lethal even. Thankfully for Kitora, this would just prove to be a spar. Thus, if struck, she'd suffer minor cuts along her clothes and even weaker ones along the flesh. Obviously, the concussive aspect holds enough to send her flying back.

"She's strong. . "* - Sun Sep 06 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"You had the necessary tools. You just used them incorrectly. Take a rest." He turns towards the others that had gathered.* - Sun Sep 06 11:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He takes out two scrolls. One is on the Doton technique, the other depicts information revolving around Shunshin. "Don't even open these scrolls until the mission is done. I want you all to head south of Konoha -- and proceed with caution. The goal is to help in relief efforts, help clean out the contamination."

Likewise, a sheet of paper is handed out.

"And poor your chakra into this. So I know your element." The male states to Shin. Once done, he notes the nature type, and sends both parties off.* - Sun Sep 06 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't have any B-ranked lightning.* - Sun Sep 06 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Good. Although, there will be more relief efforts to clean up our water supplies. I'll give you all payment for the mission completion. In the meantime, you may focus on your own developments."

He hands them a nice wad of cash.* - Sun Sep 06 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts.

"Kumogakure forces are approaching Konoha's borders. I'm going to have traps set up to serve as protection."* - Sun Sep 06 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) summons a small duck.

"Beth. Take over this one, and fly overhead. I want to keep an eye on Kumogakure as they make their approach. Immediately once you find anything significant,relay the information back."

Additional duck summons are called forth, and they move to give a personal scan of the general area. Perhaps they'd be able to find any clues or secret attacks in the works.* - Sun Sep 06 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) allows it.

"Good. We may be needing medical procedures done in a bit. The jutsu will be a great help."* - Sun Sep 06 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Good. You'll receive payment for it at a later date. Also, your Chakra Blades are still on the way. Hopefully they can be retrieved before we head out," Zetsumo replies. 

As a note, Maya sits on his lap.* - Sun Sep 06 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"What she wants. . . And will happen are two entirely different things," Zetsumo notes. He huffs, putting every bit of effort into maintaining composure as Maya purposely begins to shift in his lap. While not evident to the observing parties, arousal was growing. ". . .I can tell just by your facial expression. You really are nearing completion," he comments, now confident that the medic could quickly enough to learn the jutsu in a week's time.

Then in came Suitengu. Just the boy he had wanted to see.

It had been some weeks since the boy had last been seen. Indeed, in his infinite wisdom, Zetsumo had quite literally taken Suitengu and dropped off his son within the wilderness. No supplies -- absolutely nothing -- were given. Thus, survival training had been issued. Much like Piccolo training Gohan. With some surprise, the male looks ahead, wondering just how the boy had managed to cling to life. Perhaps. . . Suitengu actually -was- worth his time?

". . .Oh. You survived, good. . . Good. I suppose. . . You may just be worth my time. Perhaps," he speaks in a skeptical tone. There was a part of Zetsumo that still questioned if the youth held any actual potential. Yet the other half simply spoke this way purposely, to ingrain the feeling of desire within Suitengu. The feeling of being wanted. . . to serve as sufficient motivation.

"How did it go?"* - Sun Sep 06 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a grin. His eyes were discriminate, and took in every specific detail of Suitengu's facial expression -- which seemed neutral, or detached. Precisely as it had been intended. It was apart of Zetsumo's philosophy, to know true power, one had to be able to detach themselves from their humanity. With that done, they could then transcend into a higher realm of power -- much like he himself had done. Well, at least from his own twisted perspective.

"Good. Good. . . Yet simply surviving for the alloted time does not warrant any praise. -- Kitora," He turns, facing the mother.

"Tell me. Has he yet grasped the concept of chakra? I grow impatient, and I wish to begin showing him how to utilize elemental ninjutsu," he says, nevermind the mention of taijutsu skills being honed. Even if Zetsumo was a nuker, he still had decent hand-to-hand ability.

As that answer is waited for, a glance shifts to Zenaki. He motions for his younger sibling to take a seat. "Zenaki. Good to see you again. . .You've been relatively elusive. Nevertheless... A medical ninjutsu scroll has been delivered. I have another on the way, one you will love."* - Sun Sep 06 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Good then. I will commence with his elemental training shortly. Starting with Katon," He declares. Of course, it wasn't going to be as simple as him guiding. No, Zetsumo had every bit of intent on being as overbearing as possible. But first. . 

"Zenaki. What's wrong? You haven't said a peep," he says, shifting attention back to the white-haired medic.* - Sun Sep 06 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his gaze.

"You'd do well to just tell me if something is wrong, Zenaki. I have my ways of getting information," he comments casually. There seems to be no malice in his voice.* - Sun Sep 06 16:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps his fingers restlessly. THat was something to be solved, yet he doesn't stop her. "See me after I'm done with the young one. We're going to talk," he says, this time with annoyance in his voice.* - Sun Sep 06 16:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps Maya's hip.

He motions for her to slide off. "So I can check what's bugging you." His gaze shift to Beth. "I give you that option since I'm going to train my son. If you wish, have fun sitting raound." He shrugs.* - Sun Sep 06 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sends out tendrils. He wraps them around Suitengu's waist.* - Sun Sep 06 16:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
After a brisk walk, he'd arrive at the local training grounds. Suitengu is subsequently let go and settled onto the sandy floor.

"Good. . . Today i'll begin with your training. We're going to work over your mastery of the Katon affinity. And yes, I care little for your age. Six or Six-teen, I don't think how old you are is relevant. You will learn at least the bare essentials of the Katon Affinity, whether you like it or not," Zetsumo begins. He has a scroll in hand, and slides it over. Of course, it's noted that reading isn't necessary, and that the information was just granted so that he could read on his own time.

Instead, the tendrils before before begin to carve along the ground in conjunction with his verbal explanation.

"Katon. . .Is another word for 'Fire'. It's one of the five basic elemental affinities. To do this requires a certain thresh hold, in terms of chakra control. The creation of the element begins in the stomach. Your chakra must be super heated," he explains, while drawing up an illustration. A doodle of a shinobi forming the 'Tiger' hand sign. The focal point is in the belly, where chakra seems to be churned, and grinded along one another.

As this goes on, Zetsumo's own hand comes out. "The energy has to be clumped together, and spawn great friction. This will give an increase of temperature,and leave it in a good enough condition to be able to spawn fire. In order to honestly make fire. . ? Your Katon energy is to be flowed out, infusing with the air molecules themselves. It is commonly done via the air in your lungs. . . Yet that isn't necessary. For example. . . Watch as I flow Katon from my hand."

A leaf is taken. Visibly, due to the handsign formed before, Katon energy is crafted in abundance. The flow of energy seeps along his arms, allowing an azure-hued aura to take over his arm. The energy clearly shifts, leaping into the atmosphere, and forms flames. However, the flames are kept nearby, and ignite teh leaf itself, eventually reducing it to ashes. 

"Do you follow?"* - Sun Sep 06 16:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Good then. Begin working on the task. You start one step at a time, building up Katon-natured chakra. You will when you're ready once you feel an overwhelming, warm sensation in your belly. As a note, I am giving you a time limit. You have two weeks to be able to burn a leaf," Zetsumo comments.

His arms fold, and he looks on, wishing to supervise the boy with the beginnings of his training.* - Sun Sep 06 17:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arm as the male is observed.

While not a powerful sensor, there were still words that could be spoken in order to guide the youth in the right direction. It could only imagined just howdifficult this was, particularly as this was a simple kid. Barely over the age of six. Yet here Zetsumo was, pushing him to learn something as difficult as elemental ninjutsu.

"Recall. Chakra embodies both your physical and spiritual energies. Thus, it is a product of your mind's consciousness. Clear out any distracting thoughts or emotion, and with this state of clarity, keen in on your energy indepedently. On top of this, start with juist a small portion. Work on sufficiently heating just a smidget of energy, before moving on to tackling a larger quantity. Only then can you guide the chakra elsewhere to spawn fire," Zetsumo declare, this time with a far more civil tone.

His eyes never leave the youth. "Maya. Are you positive you don't wish for even the most basic of elemental training? I am proficient in all five nature types."* - Sun Sep 06 17:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
No words could be offered. He simply looked and on, while simultaneously providing information. After several minutes, with arms folded, Zetsumo finally speaks up, breaking the silence and likely Suitengu's concentration. "You've been placed on the right path. I want you to show me what you can do now. Try to turn that leaf into ash, so that I may have a benchmark of your progress," he demands. After all, he wasn't just going to sit around and watch the boy try to build up his chakra all day. Calmly, the male takes a step forward, and hands over a single leaf.

A neutral gaze falls downward. Despite the neutrality, there was an eery sensation coming from his persona. It was clearly the 'calm before the storm.' A saying that expressed just to depict how someone who seemed to be in complete control. . . Could just snap.

"Come so Ican give my critique. Then I must go check on my sibling." Zetsumo speaks again, seeming as demanding as ever. There's a brief nod granted to the arriving Nara, but other than that, he doesn't go further to acknowledge Kitora's presence.* - Sun Sep 06 18:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Mmm. . "

He hums, watching as the chakra sped on over to the leafy structure of the vegetation, and begins lose it's rich coloration. Before long, the greeness had been stripped from the plant's surface entirely. Yet this was simply a sign of significant and prolonged heat. There were no real flames being done, likewise, the leaf wasn't reduced to ash. Thus marking this exercise as a failure. "Good. . . For now. In the meantime, you may take recess. Recall, you ionly have two weeks to properly before the fire release transformation entirely."

With that, the shinobi takes a step back.* - Sun Sep 06 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Good then. All is settled. At the very least, this is proof that you're on the right path."* - Sun Sep 06 18:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow. 


"Evening. In anycase, Suintegu. Practice in the meantime, I must prepare to go leave for my batt'e." He turns, and heads off, presumably with Maya in tow as his medic.

"Also, Maya. Keep that scroll safe for me, and pass it onto Zenaki when you have the chance."* - Sun Sep 06 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pats her rear before standing. "It is time we depart. In the event of my death, I will have some yen transported." He'd wait briefly for an attack before disappearing in a plum of smoke.* - Sun Sep 06 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had no damn intention of letting them group up.

Immediately, after the village had been fortified with traps, and call for additional forces to fortify Konoha's defense. . . Zetsumo heads off. He moves along with the Kenryoku, supported by a small group of six hundred.

The goal? To ambush and interfere with the approaching Kumogakure shinobi's ploy. Instictively, Zetsumo relies on usage of his summoning technique, Dorja. Each member of the Kenryoku in this party would be allowed to get atop of the Avian, and thus be able to view all the ongoings from the skies. They're moving quickly, all with the intent on reaching the Kumogakure shinobi in a timely fashion.* - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . Oh. I am fucking tickled pink. It's time. . . I will hold true to my monikor. As the 'God of War'. . . This battle has already been won!" The group is still flying overhead. 

"Beth. As usual, use your sensory skill to keep track of any incoming projectiles. Likewise, be on stand-by, just incase I may require additional energy. Dorja. ..  Let's move ahead. We're going to attack the army directly. Kitora, Sabo. If you want to get off early, so say now. You may have trouble gettign onto the ground by this point."

He'd pause momentarily, giving the duo a small opportunity. Assuming they complied? Two of his Earth Grudge Creatures are shot out. They come crashing onto into the ground, and are momentarily in the epic centre of the gargantuan mass of shinobi -- Amegakure aligned shinobi. Hopefully Kitora and Sabo made great use of them. That said, Dorja and Zetsumo are speeding on ahead. Once overhead the massive  opposing forces, the threads within the Zombie's body proceeds to act.

THey speed out, and grant full access to each remaining heart -- the Fire, Doton, and Raiton. On cue, Dorja's bum is wiggling, and three massive eggs are cascading onto the floor. Assuming the ability to get even close to the enemy, the overbearing elementalist weaves through three short seals, two times in a row. Massive spheres of inferno are dished forward. They react positively with the eggs, and staying true to the grenade-like effect, massive explosions of fire suddenly spawn, all with the intent on scorching the shinobi that dare serve as opposition.* - Sun Sep 06 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: (I hear a wild Katsune whispering) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The Doton Mask did it's thing in two simple ways. One? Crushing opponents with brutish strength. Additionally, upon contact with the ground, numerous spikes would be conjured, hoping to impale Sunagakure shinobi en masse.

"Beth. Grant me some sensory ability. I'm going to leave you on the duck for your ownm protection. Send out genjutsu from the front, assuming anyone is foolish enough to look at you. And keep meposted on whatever information you can gather with your sensory."

Of course, by now. . ? He took off! Going into the air and descending down. Then. . . Boom! An abundance of threads shoot downward, allowing his frame to anchor into the ground. A glance is given to the surrounding area, and before long, more of his Earth Grudge Creatures are dished out. Once more, it seems to be the famed duo, the Katon and Fuuton brothers. Conjoining immediately, they perform a typical combo. At once, the 'GreatBreakthough' technique, along with  a fully powered version of the Goukakyuu is unleashed. This gives life to a massive wave of flame, they move to wash over enemies force.

To make this even more silly? Dorja flaps her wings, further amplifying the deadly nature of the attack, in hopes of destroying more hordes of opposing troops. Meanwhile, the actual Zetsumo simply sends along an 'Earth Flash'. Cackling electricity that run along the ground, and seek to shock the other warriors within other areas.

". . .You all will burn."* - Sun Sep 06 21:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Of course, the rest of the shinobi that had been stationed around are in a frenzy, desperately seeking to contain the threat of the invading forces. Yet. . . They seem to hold great issue in doing such. 

Regardless, Zetsumo doesn't regard it too much. His focus was ensuring that the Kenryoku survived. All that could be done was completely annihilate the current forces.* - Sun Sep 06 21:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: (Well my traps did not get set off:c) - Sun Sep 06 21:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) descends, landing onto his Water Mask. 

The Earth suddenly balls up, leaping back into his chest. In exchange, the Lightning heart is placed onto the field.

The shinobi quickly speeds over, after calling for Dorja and flying back to the gate. "I'll leave my men here. They should be able to take on the rest. A few hundreds will come with me, to help deal with the treat to the west. Come."

He orders everyone off. Quickly, Zetsumo flies ahead eager to face the threat. "Keep your senses peeled, Beth."* - Sun Sep 06 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Let's not forget that we 'can' climb trees. I don't wanna see everyone letting themselves get cornered. - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
as a note. Zetsumo would also be coming in flying.* - Sun Sep 06 21:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
One thing is clear.

Only fools charge wrecklessly into battle. And Zetsumo? Was no fool. He leads the charge on the ground front, by sending an Earth Grudge Creature up ahead. The second the Katon Mask is in distance, it's mask is secreting, sickly, dark-gray gas pours into the atmosphere. The point? To utterly shroud the opposing troops in reactive ash. The goal is to shroud the shinobi from their advance, and give his group of mercenaries some cover.

". . .No one wrecklessly charge forward! These shinobi are prone to using underground tactics!" With the orders barked, Zetsumo is still well within the air. . . His eyes setting on Amai herself.

Before going to attack her, the Earth Grudge Creatures continue with their assault of the land. Two remained at the back, serving as protection against potential flank. Yet once again, the Fire and Wind brothers were seeking to wreck havoc. Hopefully  being far away enough, they link, unleashing another massive gale of pure, unadultured destruction. On impact, the entire landscape was gearing to be shifted.

Maybe those damn bugs killed to? Oh yeah. And Sunagakure is in risk of getting decimated. 

And then, it was time for Amai to engage the God of War. Without warning, Dorja flaps her wings, releasing a giant gale, with ability to legitimately cut through solid wood. It aims to get rid of that damn Ink Bird, while also dealing damage to the girl herself. Quickly, Zetsumo's thread shoots out shortly after, intent on wrapping about the girl's neck and constricting -- if not avoided.* - Sun Sep 06 22:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And the explosion goes off without a hitch. 

It would spread fast, and covered a wide area. Even the speedy Orakuru would find evasion almost damn near impossible. And no matter Chiyari's sensing techniques, the male's physical and reflexive prowess paled in comparison to the overbearing might that could be conjured from the God of War's chakra reservoirs.

At best, those caught in the crossfire would be enabled to avoid an immediately impact. Assuming they only caught the end of the explosion, they'd suffered moderate, second-degree burns, and certainly their overall battle capabilities would take a dip -- with the decline in health. ". . .Mmm. When will they learn? Fighting me in a massive group serves little purpose. I excel in attacking multiple opponents at once, " the warrior muttered while riding ontop of his summoning creature. <@Everyone within the initial assault. Fire aint no joke.>
---------------------
Quickly, assuming Niza still came in with injuries, the Wind Heart reacted quickly. On cue, chakra is being funneled from it's mask, and at once, a massive gale sweeps the area. It intends to not only repel Niza, but quite literally send his body sailing into the ground, and hopefully ending him as a threat. Simultaneous with the blow, it takes steps back, to distance itself from the giant ensemble. <@Niza>
-----------------------------
Meanwhile, the Lightning Mask rushes ahead. It sends a simple Earth Flash about the area, intent on bringing the simple Earth Golem down to it's knees. <@Orakuru>
-------------------------------
Then came the lovely Amai. He ploy was genuinely intelligent, yet it mattered little. She would begin freefalling, yet thanks to his sensing companion, her location is easily found. At once, Dorja heads in the proper direction, and once within a good enough distance, Zetsumo's threads again ring about her neck, and proceed with the choking. He wanted to reduce her into a state of unconsciousness. 

"Mmm. I'm going to go a bit harder. Be prepared to supply me with moer chakra."* - Sun Sep 06 23:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And out went Niza.

Quickly, he's speeding ahead with Dorja. Sadly, more education would need to be had. In war, you did not group up and just leave yourself open -- at least not against an enemy as powerful and versatile as the most wanted man in the world. 

Assuming Beth did her damn job, noticing the Golem would prove to be a trivial task. Before the creature could attack, the Suiton Mask took off. From it's maw, a bursting stream of water comes, assaulting the Flaming Golem, and of course seeking to topple it. Meanwhile, Dorja continues to speed away, while dropping a trio of combustive eggs along the way. They all fall onto the floor, presumably, admist a cluster of NPC Shinobi. ". . .Good work Dorja. This should take care of a large chunk."

And then they blow. As the water comes spiralling out, likely sending many of the fodders flying up, the Raiton Mask releases a Jibashi. Electricity comes coursing through the area, and runs through the mixture of liquid that certainly would be contacted. Thus, it gives life to an additional, area of effect technique, shocking all of those within range.

Assuming capability in closing distance with Chiyari. The warrior closes in, sending a thick gathering of threads towards the Kage's neck -- just as done against Amai. Who snuggly was sleeping on the bird.* - Sun Sep 06 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Of course. The flame creature combos with Kitora. Making her mud bullets flaming mud bullets.* - Sun Sep 06 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Quickly, as the threads are swatted, Dorja flaps her wings. Sharpened blades of wind are unleashed, forming a 'net', and covering a vast radius. On cue, the giant Dog would be forced to endure the might of Duck's variation of the Great Sickle Weasal.

Nevertheless, as the flames come about, Dorja proceeds to contort in the air, evading numerous of the projectiles, although many of the strikes manage to sing the avian's creation. Rather than just continue to give chase? THe male opts to go up, and head back.

The rapid increase in height enable him to be out of range for the earth-based projectile. Quickly, he's just heading back to the main crowd. "I'll just kill the others first. I don't care if he can destroy my mansion." Sadly, the duck is wheezing, and clearly requires some rest. Perhaps it was time to desummoning her?* - Mon Sep 07 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
As for the army.

The Amegakure forces do the best they can to deal with the onslaught. Assuming not -all- the shinobi were literally in one spot, then this was a lot more manageable.

Try as they might, however. Konoha is outgunned. Much of the force is migitated, yet a good chunk of the army suffers from injuries. Some fatal, other on the verge of being at that level. Meanwhile, the gatherings of Sunagakure shinobi likely still have to deal with the previous combo of Water Grenades along with Electrical Circuits.

He likely remains ignorant of Tetsumi, yet continues to remind Beth to keep her eyes peeled. Assuming no immediately interference, Dorja lands, and lets Zetsumo gets off. She quickly is desummoned, returning back to her home land to recover from the burns.* - Mon Sep 07 00:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Fuck that. Amai is taken away by some fodder. Hopefully she can be restrained and have her items taken. Assuming no intereference, she's a war prisoner, unless someone can save her.* - Mon Sep 07 00:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Likely hostile. SHall we displace our location? - Mon Sep 07 00:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) whispers: Just keep a clsoe eye out. I'll try to figure out whats this chakra im sensing is all about..Wont take me long at all. - Mon Sep 07 00:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Let's move, Beth. Time we end this! Lend me your strength,"

Using his threads as a spring, he quickly leaves the area, closing in on the battle below at an alarming rate. Of course, he has his partner in crime, Beth, in tow. THe second Zetsumo crashes into the ground, his chakra activates, unleashing thick pillars. They're merciless, and aim to pierce right through the trees.

Assuming he's actually given sensing as instructed? The accuracy is pin-point. He is playing no games, and quite literally is aiming to pierce through both Yuan and Orakuru's body.* - Mon Sep 07 00:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
After the wind heart moved to attack Kuro. It's comes to it's not knowledge that well. . . Sungakure is gathering up AGAIN. Once more making it a bit easy for them to attack en masses.

Quickly, it speeds ahead, meeting with the Fire Heart just to the north. They combine again, releasing two combinations. The first? Fire Run and Divine Wind. It unleashes a great inferno that certainly kills shinobi by the dozen. The next? Goukakyuu and Wind Release: Greatbreakthough. They'd serve as the distraction, and hoped to take out as many shinobi out as humanly possible.

(Lightning and Suiton are sitll nearby and are on standby. I'm still gonig to RP to you, Tetsu. Gotta wait for Yuan's RP tho. Same with Orukrus)* - Mon Sep 07 01:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Likewise. The several hundred SMART AMegakure shinobi come from behind.

They flank the attacking forces, devestating most likely. Since, y'know. Back turned.* - Mon Sep 07 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And once the encircling began? It was about time to go. With a single seal, slabs of Earth shoot up, forming a perfect dome. One could question. . .What in the world a single dome do against a slew of projectiles?

Well it was simple. The attacks were not concentrated, and likely would be split inbetween the various NPC warriors running about. The attacks that truthfully came to theKEnryoku would have to attack different portions of the dome, all with it's own set of durability. Hopefully this would be enough time to defend against the Iron-Sand projectiles, as well as the onslaughter. 

The Fire Mask remains on the outside, and continues to go ballistic, serving as the main distraction for the dome of shinobi. Relentless, Katon spews from it's mouth, scorching the opposition.  Meanwhile? HE's had enough of Orakuru, and seeks to end the nuisance before he can become more of an issue. Quickly, threads speed out, piercing the boy through the throat, and hopefully going to end his life.

Once in protective custody, and the dome suffering damage. The next course of action is quite easy. The Suiton heart is stored in his body, and the Doton creature comes through. The Gargantuan size is enough to form a sizeable hole, and lead for a great escape underneath the ground. --THis occuring before the explosive tags were being layerd, since Zetsumo had never gotten the opportunity to Roleplay.

Nevertheless, all Kenryoku members are encouraged to follow through.  The arm and Orakuru's corpse is taken. 

Lastly, the Lightning Mask grabs ahold of Amu and proceeds to sprint. She had to be protected, even at the cost of his own life.* - Mon Sep 07 01:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The hole is still being dug, even as the Earth Dome is being destroyed. Thankfully, several of his shinobi held the ability to slip into Earth themselves. He had no worries for Katsune, and trusted the young girl could handle herself. 

As the ground is shifted, explosions continue to go on, of course giving moderate damage along the way. Yet, as everyone knew, it took a lot more to kill the God of War, especially more than petty explosive tags. Each of the remaining creatures by now had sunk back into his body.

And those that were unable to move. Like Kitora and Yumiko? Are grabbed by speedy threads. Tunnels away. They sink and sink, eager to get out of a losing battle. As strong as he may be, Zetsumo was no 3rd Raikage. Fighting thousands of shinobi was not in his agenda.* - Mon Sep 07 02:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The lightning heart valiantly would proceed to fight off Tetsumi and the rest of the army. Yet all the same, it would succumb, yet serve as a distraction. After a lengthy battle, it would likely fail and Amu would finally be relinquished.* - Mon Sep 07 02:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs. He's beatened and bruised up.

Kitora's bloodied body is set down. He exams her, with the arm already being severed. "Kitora. . Stay with me," Zetsumo speaks, his voice demanding, as if a simple utterance could deter death from doing what nature dictated must occur.

Possessively, his threads shoot out, stitching together the various cells in her body. "C'mon. . . You're a figher. You can live."* - Mon Sep 07 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The two had been through a lot.

It was like just yesterday that Kitora was a naive, fan-girl, following around an odd,  insect wielder. Then she had met Zetsumo. . . And from that point, her world, her entire life was destined to turned upside down. He was first cruel to the woman, assaulting her on a physical, spiritual and even mental level. Yet. . . Despite her consistent ability to aggravate him, there was an innate fondness.

After all, this was the mother of his children. Inspite of the beast's insistence that he lacked any humanly emotion, there was an innate bond to the Nara.

". . Kitora. I. . .I'm sorry. I. . " He speaks in a hushed tone, losing every bit of bravado, or whatever other grandiose fashion normally spoken in. THis was a tone of not vengence nor anger. Nay, the emotion was clear, it was sorrow. Briefly, using that grip, he brings her body close, giving a gentle hug to the dying figure. His head pressed against her's, as Zetsumo continously whispered sweet nothings, constantly insisting that she would make it through it. But it was clear. . . Kitora was too far gone. No matter how badly the brute had said she wasn't, the true reality of the situation was that nature bent it rules for no man. 

Water continued to pool in his eyes, yet he would much rather die than actually have tears fllow down his cheeks. Staring right into her hazel's eyes, it was as if Zetsumo held proper visage of her soul. And like an old light, it was flickering, wavering. There was no fight to be had here any longer.

In the next few seconds, that dim light had faded, and every motion of Kitora's body had abruptly come to an end. "Kitora. . " Light sniffles are heard, as the Kenryoku leader looked downward. His hair fell over, shielding any actual features, yet judging from the redness on his face, and the slight moisture on the flesh. It was clear, the male was a freaking mess.

Quickly, he stands, lifting her body and carrying it bridal style after summoning his Avian. "Get on. . . We're leaving everyone." Lingering sorrow traced along his voice, but soon after, he falls back into emotionlessness.* - Mon Sep 07 03:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
After a day of traveling, the duck finally moves to descend. Zetsumo is visibly tired as he carries the carcass of both Orakuru and  Kitora. They would be his replacements.

"We're finally here. . Amegakure. Unload everyone. . . settle down in the meantime. We will simply recover from our losses. The defeat-- However, is not the end. It simply re-affirms my belief. Governing parties are the true evil of the world, as it allows weaklings. . . To otherwise impose their wills in ways they should be able to. You all go take a rest, it is time we recover. Changes will be made in the Kenryoku, and I'll speak with representatives to discuss the next course of action."

He sits down, brooding now. His eyes occasionally trace back to Kitora. You never knew how much you'd miss someone until they were gone.* - Mon Sep 07 04:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) takes a seat. He'slooking ahead, eying the fresh corpses pensively.

". . .That was too close of a call. That Earth dome really saved your asses. . ." Of course, he speaks this way as it was clear, Zetsumo wasn't in any significant danger. He merely put himself on the line to protect the others that may hold difficulties.* - Mon Sep 07 05:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks towards Kitora's carcass as he says this.

"And you can be accredited with the death of Orakuru. One of the biggest thorns in myside. Even with Konoha captured, I see this as a victory. We slayed a higher quantity from what I can gather."* - Mon Sep 07 05:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods slowly.

"Of course. . . You are beginning to understand human nature. They are. . . fickle beasts, you understand this, yes," the warrior said in his same, emotionlessly tone. He's still reeling from the lost of his baby momma.* - Mon Sep 07 05:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) can't bring himself to smirk. But's clear that he takes pride in the comment.

"Mmm. 'Cruel' is such a strong word. I am simply an individual that has seen the word for what it is. I refuse to pretend. . . that following the 'moral' -- when convenient, as so many others do -- will get me anywhere. I still. . . don't understand that man. He claims to have morals, yet mercilessly, he's slain in my name. Several times. He is so selfish that he would allow thousands to be sacrificed, just to fail at taking down one man -- me."

He says this with a drawl. Without a doubt, Zetsumo seems to be legitimately buying into his own philosophy. Was the tyrant truly evil? After all, he certainly hadn't committed as many atroscities as various other, prominent village personnels. Likewise, in the end, the male deemed himself to be much like the opposition. They both were willing to murder to make the world in their imagery, or to impose their world view.

The difference? They were on opposite ends, fighting.* - Mon Sep 07 05:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) aimed to read her emotion. But fails miserably.

"You are hard to read at the moment. I can't tell if you're angry or sad. Or well, any other emotion inbetween while we're at it," he replies. Calmly, the shinobi turns north, motioning Katsune forward.* - Mon Sep 07 05:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) comes to a stop.

"You are. .. familiar with my Earth and Bamboo technique, correct? It is a particularly useful ability as it only requires that you press your hands against the ground. However, that is also one of the weakness, you have to be on the ground to actually use it.Regardless, it uses moderate nature manipulation ability. The difficult part is really just shape manipulation," Zetsumo says quietly.

He can momentarily place his feelings to back and focus on the task at hand.

"After building up your Doton chakra, you release it intot he surface. Take four different bodies of earth, condensing it into harden rock. Sadly, you can't just condense it in a mindless fashion. Admist the process, make the creation either cylindical (If that's a word), or triangular. Each with a sharpened edged. On cue, the last part is just using your spiritual force to push the earth forward. If it holds sufficient strength, it'll thrust from the ground and high into the sky. I don't expect you to make one on par with mine. But for now, work on sending a single pillar, or spear-shaped object ahead. Use the tree as the target," he demands.

Soon after, Zetsumo sits indian style, observing the girl in her work.* - Mon Sep 07 06:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) disappears in a plume of smoke seconds after. "I'l return shortly."* - Mon Sep 07 10:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Despite the losses, Konohagakure hasn't emerged completely defeated. War prisoners, but the dozens, all settled in their own camp. Admist this, Amai too is taken captive. The young girl is stripped of all her clothes, weapons, and perhaps dignity. She's bond in chains, tethered to the ground by the arms, and ankles, and even by her neck. Significant movement is difficult to say the least.

Angrily, the Kenryoku leader stepped in, his disgruntled facial expression essentially telling the story.

". . .Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right now? Kumogakure has really. . ..  REALLY. . . fucked up. They're going to regret it."* - Mon Sep 07 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a solemn, disgusted facial expression.

Quickly, his hands whip through the skies, unleashing a vicious smack to Amai's face. The collision is force, enough to leave a stinging, red-bruise, all in the shape of his hand. ". . Watch. . . How the fuck. . . You're talking to me. I am in the driver's seat. . . So you have best to change your tone. I am not in any moods for people that think they're badass. Lose that venom in your voice, and grow subserviant, you wench."

He looked to the south, and orders his Amegakure guard to go in search of their resident genjutsu specialist. She oughta be here shortly.

"Start singing. Give me any useful information you may have on Kumogakure. For example, what was the true motivation of the attack? I have reason to believe that this. . . Orakuru fellow had ulterior motives? Mayhaps he is the one that led the strike."* - Mon Sep 07 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze on over to Kilm.

"Try your hand, if you wish. I will simply have Beth supervise, then. If your abilities prove inadequate, she will step in," he says, motioning the male to step forward.* - Mon Sep 07 11:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms.

"Do you have any additional information in regards to the purpose of the attack? Things such as ulterior motives, follow-up plans, contigency efforts, and the list goes on," he re-iterates. Now that the genjutsu was in fact, getting absolutely truthful knowledge was certain.

'"And you may ask your personal question, Kilm."* - Mon Sep 07 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He taps his foot restlessly while in the cold, cave area. His eyes trace over, and you can tell aggitation is running rampant. 

". . .And thus, your usefulness is on a steady decline. Tell me, what other use do you have? There is little information you may provide.. . ." He speaks in an eerily reserved manner. Blackened threads seep, and hiss through the air, surrounding his body as if he was apart of the Gorgon clan. 

". . .Speak with haste. I am growing restless. Tell of your usefulness or be eliminated."* - Mon Sep 07 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . .You are doing little to convince. Speak of what you have to offer. . . and BEG for forgiveness. You've comitted crimes against my people just my associattion those baffoons you called an alley. . .I -- Kitora. . . " He says with a lost gaze, the lost of his child's mother still cut deep, and served as the perfect motivator. Kumogakure and Sunagakure. . . They should have known not to kick a sleeping dog.

The threads move, slithering around Amai's neck, and gently clamping down. It isn't with excessive force -- but is simply to serve as a warning. What he wanted was not a dignified response. No, what was required was for every bit of dignity to be stripped from Amai's flesh. He wanted her to know her place in this world. That she was on the lower portion o the food chain, with the God of War perched on the top, looking down at the less significant entities in this world. Menacingly, his demonic eyes pierced through, looking straight into Amai's own gaze.

"Speak quickly, Kilm." He allows the male to speak.* - Mon Sep 07 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked dully at the group.

". . .Huh. I hope you all haven't gotten complacent. Even with Konohagakure lost -- I still expect work to be done. Be it via progression of one's skill, or simply unwinding after doing various contracts. Realize this, being in Konohagakure was always a temporary thing. We are a mercenary group, we go from place to place. Sticking around in one village was only the objective to push AMegakure's agenda. Which is subsequently relevant to my own," Zetsumo declares. He wore a strange smile, and by now, his lost hearts had been replaced. Kitora and Orakuru were now a part of him.

The smile likely wouldn't be odd to the surrounding parties. After all, they hadn't a clue what roamed through is mind.* - Tue Sep 08 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks ahead.

"I must consider the state of the rest of my ensemble. You all may suffer from mental fatigue, unlike myself."* - Tue Sep 08 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) remained looking ahead.

"And. . who the hell are you? I don't just teach any random that comes up the street, asking for help," he says harshly, belittling Hideki's advances. He turns, and gives a nod back to the rest of the ensemble. "I'll speak with representatives for the next course of action. In the meantime, you all do as I say. Rest up, enjoy yourselves, but also develop your skills. I'll have assignments to give in a few day's time. Logically, you can see why you've yet to get any after Konoha's assault," Zetsumo declares.

He falls silent shortly after.* - Tue Sep 08 01:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze to Katsune. He wore a look of disappointment.

"Have you done anything today? I don't expect you all to grow. . . complacent in my absences," the male notes, recognizing that he was pretty elusive today.* - Tue Sep 08 01:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"What other reason do you need? They're the enemy. And no useful information has been pried out of them," he replies.* - Tue Sep 08 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Right then."

He kicks off the ground, and proceeds towards the east. His strides are slow, and leisurely. Before long, they'd be close to the holding cells. The door cracks open. Inside the building? It was criminally cold. Enough to make you shiver on reflex. Yet Zetsumo seemed undettered.

Casually, the male moved, his feet trudging along the ground, and uncomfortably releasing a chafing sound effect. Those within the cells would easily be able to tell of the brute's approach. Said approach was dreaded, no doubt, as it was evidently clear -- whenmever Zetsumo came, bad things happened. 

Assuming Katsune had kept with him, one of the cells is opened. It holds two individuals, both bond to chain. One a seventeen year-old chunnin male. He sports silver, and spiky hair. His body is muscled, and limber, revealing potential nature as a taijutsu spcialist. Meanwhile the other was a grown woman, blown haired and curve. She sports a Jounin vest.

"Kill these two at your leisure. They've provided no information relevant to my desires, and have been haughty. I no longer wish to see them live." His body leaned against the wall, prepared to observe the endeavors.* - Tue Sep 08 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"A kill is a kill. But nevertheless, whatever you deem to be more interesting," he says with a shrug. Still leaning, the male points towards both of the tied up individuals.

"Which of you seek to die first? -- No, in fact. Katsune, which one do you have the intent on killing first?" Zetsumo says with a drawl. He seemed to anticipate a slaughter too, seeing such would go a long way to pacifying his disgruntled spirit. After all, there were several of his men that had been lost in that conflict. Blood had to be spilt.* - Tue Sep 08 02:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Then that is who you will battle. She is. . . fairly powerful, believe it or not," he says, though makes no mention to the woman's lack of nutrition. It weakens the Jounin for sure, and perhaps puts her on Katsune's level, maybe below.

Wasting no time, he shoots out material that speed through chains, severing their locks. At once, the blond-haired Kunoichi arises, and looks on angrily. Her fists are clenched, and she's seeming in a battle stance. * - Tue Sep 08 02:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
As a kunoichi hailing from Sunagakure, the captive's ability wasn't all too surprising -- she specialized in Fuuton ninjutsu. A glare is provided, not just to Katsune, but Zetsumo himself. Without a second thought, the shinobi presses forward, and claps her hands together. On cue, the currents in the area are beckoned to her will, releasing a straightforward, and fast acting breeze. It blows against Kat' frame, in hopes of toppling her over.

"Hng. . Not as strong as I could be," murmured the captive kunoichi under her breath. 

This was a simple gale palm. Regardless of the results, her hands remain together, clearly prepared to string through seals for a follow up.* - Tue Sep 08 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Once more, the unknown Sunagakure kunoichi ceases her seals, and opts to release yet another gale palm. 

It easily repels the incoming Kunai, as well as moves forward, hopefully toppling Katsune over. Unlike before, this time, the kunoichi is moving in stride with the strike, hopefulyl having the previous gale of wind serve as adequate cover. As a Jounin, she excelled in all facet of being a shinobi. Be it physical condition, for things such as speed, reaction time, or even upper body strength. But also, hand to hand, or close quarter combat.

Obviously, these attributes were hindered, due to being left without food or nutrition for over a week. 

Nevertheless, assuming all went well, she's within distance, and is sending a quick cross-chop to Katsune's ribs, followed by an elbow to the nose. "Die! You cowardly bitch!" Oh yeah, this chick is angry. The taijutsu spec, sitting down, cheers her own. "Go, Asami!"

Meanwhile, Zetsumo just watches. "Hurry up and win.."* - Tue Sep 08 03:09:39 2015

Certainly.

Evasion is simple task for someone as dexterous and speedy as Katsune. Yet it wasn't something that came without consequences. With the evasion, the mercenary is almost certainly having to evacuate the area, as the gust was no small thing by any means. It affords Asami more than enough time to settle, and prepare for defensive measures against the Raiton.

Her head cants to the side, allowing the electrical circuit to miss by a small margin, singing some of her in the process. Asami moved in strides, her feet sliding along the cement as she comes to a skidding stop. Already, the former kunoichi is breathing a bit , a clear sign of less than stellar stamina reservoirs.* - Tue Sep 08 03:22:27 2015

And after some struggle, both of the warriors are dead. He looks ahead with a somewhat entertained expression.

"How amusing. She takes such pride in being able to win. . . It reminds me of myself. Albeit. . . a bit more petty. I suppose that is understandable. Females, at the end of the day, are petty creatures. Entities ruled by their emotions moreso than even their male counterparts," Zetsumo spoke to himself, within his mind.

His eyes traced over Katsune, and he looked onto her as she were mortal -- and he were a deity, observing less intelligent beings. 

Regally, the mercenary claps. "Not bad. Albeit, I had expected this to be ended sooner. Regardless. . . have you blown off some steam?"* - Tue Sep 08 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawned then.

"Then what? You know I hate sitting around doing nothing."

He had no reasons to further train his abilities, after all. They had all been mastered.* - Tue Sep 08 04:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Amegakure was certainly. . . different. The buildings weren't nearly as grandiose than Konoha's. But beyond this, the entire scene was different.

No longer did citizens cower at his presence. Nor did anyone run. Nevertheless, despite the changes, Zetsumo showed no signs of being phased -- even if he did miss the usual acts. After all, it was a huge boost to one's ego. To have the average joe be struck with fear at your simple sight.

Before long, he'd arrive, planting his bum onto a chair, and pulling out one of the menus. "Hng. . " It's clear the sting of defeat is still lingering within his soul, yet no mention of it is made. He just had to wait for Amegakure reps to become apparent.

"Choose whatever you'd want. . . as usual."* - Tue Sep 08 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) orders a similiar treat. Although his is comprise of meats, rather than seafood and veggies. At a casual pace, the waitress would head off. There's a light frown worn on Zetsumo's, stitch-infested mouth. Usually, the employee would have scurried with haste in order to complete the commands.

As she slinks off, his eyes shift over to Katsune.

"The prison war. . . Amai. ANything of relevance to say about her? In my departure that is. I trust that she was well-behaved. Likewise, I assume Zenaki nor any others were too aggressive." There are vague memories to the torture and murder of the poor Kirigakure spy, Smith.* - Tue Sep 08 05:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) his moods quickly lifted. This one was going to be a tough one to crack. . . and that's precisely how he liked it. Crazy talk? Perhaps. But in the end, many of Zetsumo's most loyal minions were once his enemies. Until he systematically and artistically broke them down to be subserviant to him.

By then, the waitress had arrived, and set all of the items down. Along with contemplemary sake. He takes a sip, immediately allowing his nerves to be calmed.

"Sounds fun. . . I will enjoy meeting her again. Mmm, things have gotten bad. I've considered taking the Kenryoku underground. I certainly have the resources to make this happen."* - Tue Sep 08 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Underground labs. I want to construct secret bases in developing countries. So that I may have shelter in times of need, and can continue to accumulate power. Where they will be? Only time will tell," he says with some secrecy. He was going to keep this tight-lipped, so no one would know -where- he was aiming to go should Amegakure attack goes south.

By no means had he any intent on giving up, however. One battle was not everything. Numbers certainly meant little to him as well.

He continues to chew, eating in a more savage fashion then usual. The contents of the bowl is quickly being depleted.* - Tue Sep 08 05:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glances.

". . .And what was that?" Odd that no response was given.* - Tue Sep 08 05:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's controlling nature begins to spill out. It mattered little if what was going on was trivia or not. He just had to know -- he had to be in control of over facet of his shinobi's life.

"Speak. I have ways of making you talk, you know.."* - Tue Sep 08 05:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) proceeds with the countdown.

"Ten.."* - Tue Sep 08 05:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow, though still continues with the countdown.

By now, he's counted three seconds."Seven. . " Controlling by nature, the threads that made up pretty much his entire body proceed to seep out. As usual, they wiggle while clumped together, being all too similar to strange snakes or worms.

". . . Six. . ." He seems to care little that they're in public.* - Tue Sep 08 05:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues with his counting.

Three more seconds are shaved off, and it's clear he'sgrowing more aggitated with the continued unwillingness to listen. ". . .Four. . . Three." A higher quantity slips out, casting a shadow over the general vicinity.* - Tue Sep 08 06:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's threads speed out.

They aim to latch around each of the for significant limbs. Both the arms and the legs. Assuming success, some go to wrap about Katsune's waist, and soon, she's lifted, and held right infront of Zetsumo. The teen is levitating over the desk, completely held in bondage.

". . .Ready to speak now?"* - Tue Sep 08 06:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ponders on the thought.

To brutalize Katsune. . . at this point, would be futile and disadvantagous. After all, he'd need her for continued battles, thus giving her leverage. Ontop of this, as Zetsumo continued to ponder, senseless violence against her did little to garner positive results, and in fact just pushed her away.

"Mmm. . .I suppose then. "

Looking around. The restaurant seemed sparsely populated, considering the time of night. Yet this did little to deter the next action. In his observation, Katsune was a proud woman, thus she would need to be humiliated, in order to grant humility. With a flick of a hand, more strings speed out, lashing with viciousness. ". . .Then suffer." 

For the moment, if you hadn't known better, you would think they were going just to pierce through her heart. Yet it stops short. Rather than piercing, it slashes downward, cutting at the chest area and potentially revealing cleavage. It moves up until it had slashed mid-driff. Assuming success, Zetsumo now holds Katsune forward, revealing her to the crowd, as if she were a prized trophy.

Most of the others eating nearby are well. . . shocked. Some angry. Yet there are a few gawkers, shamelessly examining the woman's features.* - Tue Sep 08 06:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) squints. That was precisely the action he had sought.

Taking a moment's rest, the male ceases in the destruction of Katsune's close. Yet the threads forces her body to shake subtly, to of course make her bosom jiggle a tad bit more.

"Are you willing to speak now?"

Additional strings move, gathering just below her neck, and preparing to slide down her chest, to make the situation as uncomfortable as possible.* - Tue Sep 08 06:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. 

"It is as if you wish for the continuation. Calling me names won't prompt me to stop out of guilt," Zetsumo declares. By now, a few of the citizens step out, disgusted at the crude act. Though a good number simply continuing looking out in shock.

His threads resume working. A portion sliding across her bosom, and creepily rubbing about her body. Another gathering of strings move to continuing grasping her cloth and ripping it apart. No mercy. By now, her lower body is being exposed, though only on the front. He's yet to work on the back.* - Tue Sep 08 06:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Others walking in would bring me pleasure. . . Believe me. You should count your blessings. . . You would dread this in private far worse,"He notes, in an almost rape-y tone. 

Considered the continued insubordination, the public indecency continues. Without relent, more of his strings slide down, while still being clung together thickly. They slither down, and get dangerously close to the pelvis.

Quickly, those left over eventually move to the back, ripping off whatever clothes remained in that origin. It reveals her bum, and lower region completely. Thus, the only things left on now are her underwears -- if wearing. Along with whatever accessories were worn on her legs and feet.* - Tue Sep 08 06:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a grin. This honestly amused him, and certainly beat idle chit-chat. 

It appealed to bully that Zetsumo had grown to be over the years. "Is that all? You. . . went through all of this just to hide that information?" Her body is descending, though he still has a firm grasp about each of her limbs. And they're strong, for obvious reason.

"No. . . THis can't be it. Tell me the truth." He remains in denial, solely so that he can continue this game. Through this all, the strings did their best impression of a snake, slithering in slow, yet irregular motions. And yes, they would creep towards the more sensitive areas of the body, be it her crotch, her bum, or even bosom.

You can tell its on purpose.* - Tue Sep 08 07:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued to grin, although it's more in a mischevious fashion, than legitimate joy. His eyes scan her features, as they continue to lewdly sway. Yet she's still being descended.

"Mmm. . .Let's see how she reacts," the male mutters. Rather than being settled onto a chair, she's placed onto his lap. There is an elevation for obvious reasons, along with subtle twitching.

"My. Something so trivial. ..  Yet you made me go through such extremities to get an answer. I dislike people who are difficult. . Or rather, it irks me," he's lying through is teeth. The difficult ones are the best, as they give him reason to be cruel. Be it physical torture -- which wasn't a smart idea right now. Or assaults that targeted the mind or spirit.

His hips occasionally move, making the positioning even more uncomfortable. "Certainly. You will take responsibility." He gives a lifeless stare, and his voice equally lacks any tone or emotion.* - Tue Sep 08 07:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow.

"You think so? I may still do as I please. So long as it is with the correct personnel," he states. Clearly, he'd be able to harm citizens at his leisure. But non-citizens? That was an entirely different story.

There's another low chuckle as the girl continued to fidget with futility. "I take it that means you decline with taking responsibility?"* - Tue Sep 08 07:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose.

"Then what if it's an order?" He speaks casually, and a hand now rests on her side.* - Tue Sep 08 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He looks on incredulously.

". . .You speak. . as if you are my commander. Why do you do so?" He says with a drawl. Assuming Katsune isn't making a ruckus, the a good number of the gawkers have turned back to eating their food. Though some still occasionally shake their head.* - Tue Sep 08 07:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked to the rip clothes. 

The quietness eventually prompts the others to look away. "With what? Your clothes are history."* - Tue Sep 08 07:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a glare.

". . .My. Insults will get you nowhere. . Nevertheless, there is still the little problem at hand," he says, referencing arousal. "And I suppose this will save you from the public eyes," Zetsumo continues. He'd shift her body below, allowing her small frame to be shielded by the table. A spoon would have dropped, along with a cup of sake to serve as 'cover' or as an explanation for why the young Katsune would be going down there.

A poor cover? Perhaps.

Nevertheless, she would find herself positioned inbetween Zetsumo's leg, and the latex Jounin suit was being stretched a tad, for clear reasons. He pushes forward, allowing his pelvis to get closer.* - Tue Sep 08 07:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's grin has extended full-force. 

"Quite combative. .. " And he loved it. Of course, Katsune had little choice in the matter. The threads kept their grip, and moved to subtly pull her downward. Each second of resistance was just further entices him.

"Are you really that proud. . . that you feel capable of throwing insults? I've killed people for less."* - Tue Sep 08 07:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . . .We will see. I am more certain they will be laughing at you. Likewise. . . I doubt there will be many who has the gall to dare belittle the God of War," Zetsumo states. He found humor in how she sought to turn this on him. This was to be her humiliation, after all.

By now, the threads actually release themselves. And a hand rests on her head, gently guiding her forward. It still remained to be seen. Did Zetsumo actually intend to go through with it?* - Tue Sep 08 07:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued with his act.

By now, her face was likely mere centimeters away from his crouch, and an outline is clear. He is no small man by any means. Yet her words bring some curiosity to his mind. On top of this, the lack of resistence both pleases him -- as it shows someone slowly becoming docile-- and also irritates him. What fun was it to pry at someone's spirit if they hadn one to begin with? Such a dilemma.

"And what makes you say this?" He hadn't smelled to bad. Yet it had been over a day since he's last showered.* - Tue Sep 08 07:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged.

"Now then. Let's make this as swift as possible. I don't have all day," the male replies with impatience. He speaks as if this is business as usual, and perhaps suggest it isn't the first time the brute has defiled anyway.* - Tue Sep 08 07:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Leaving will take too long. Now hurry along, I don't have all day." he speaks with impatience. Judging by the tone, it isn't a secret, he's used or has gotten acclimated to defiling people as a form of punishment.

Considering he's in a jump suit, a hand comes out, and sharpened threads  cut a slit along his pelvis area to grant access. The grip along Katsune's head only tightens, making it clear now -- he was serious.* - Tue Sep 08 07:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Had no qualms with the continued defiance. His own fingers dip in, snaking out his length, and slipping it right through. It goes, smacking against the youthful mercenary's face. The appearance was irregular. Unlike conventional sex organs, Zetsumo's member mimicked his body. The skin was scarred, and riddled with stitches just as his other body parts were. It was as if someone had taken a tattered doll, and literally sewed it up.

Yet. . . the organ functioned properly. Erect as could be, and occasionally twitching in anticipation. There is a slight musk, considering Zetsumo rarely stopped working, and thus lacked time to shower himself. 

Casually, his hand moves along the base, giving repeated, yet gentle smacks onto her face. "You should go, before someone gets curious with my hand movements and come to look. This can get more shameful for you. . " spoke the fiend gently.* - Tue Sep 08 07:58:04 2015
