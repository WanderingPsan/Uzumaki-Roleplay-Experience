He looks down. "You all remain vigilant. We're not going to attafck them head on. With the bridge taken out, they will have to travel via water. And this? This is out advantage. I will have my Raiton and Suiton specialists launch assault on whatever vehicles they may have. They'll almost certainly have to come to us as well. After all. . . Resources only can last for so long," Zetsumo barks out to those below.

The message is dispatched among the massive gatherings of shinobi -- each with their own assigned leaders. These leaders make sure everyone is on the same page.* - Sun Sep 13 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
What's that. . . A bird. . . A plane? Nope. A simple Kenshin.

Communication unit is scrambling, alerting everyone of the arrival for the infamous 'Speed Star.' And it's at this point? The contingency plan is employed. "Suiton. . . Raiton. Go!"

Hundreds are about the coast, and with a string of hand signs, the water is bent  to their will. Massive waves are conjured, each working in unison with one another. The purpose? To form psuedo-Tsunami that goes rushing to hopefully overwhelm the incoming speed-forced using warrior. As the wave goes onward, it continues to build, now gaining strength from the sheer momentum of the hundreds of warriors working in unison.

As that goes? Lightning is finally added to the mix. The sparks of electricity cackle about menacing, and illuminate the area. It seeks to force the poison-riddled oceanic body to deal with the threat. Likewise, if all goes well, it can launch a significant blow to the infrastucture of Kirigakure  itself. ALthough, that may be a stretch.* - Sun Sep 13 21:32:35 2015

Kaboom.

The attacks neutralize one another. The exploding mines are more or less rendered useless, as explosions resonate through the area. Ripples are clearly seen along the oceanic body. 

Yet regardless.. . ? Kirigakure had yet to launch a significant counter attack.The focus is shifted -- at least from Zetsumo -- onto the inhuman speed occuring just towards the north. And honestly, what was happening now. . .? Simply could not be tracked. Again and again, his ears flick, hearing the defeaning sound of the sonic booms.

"---This isn't good. Get word to communications. Have them relay what our sensors. See if they can detect any difficulties under the oceans." And this is done swiftly. It worked to have leaders assigned for each location. As the landmines are done and over with, the group exercises caution. From each of the five sections. Three hundred warriors are storm along the warrior.

Meanwhile, one-hundred and fifty are lingering behind, moving at a slower pace -- all to provide relief effort for any potential attacks. (Overall. That's 450 from each. Meaning 2250 are more or less moving on to Kirigakure.)

Likewise. Only a few try to oppose the speed star. With presumed futility, whatever shinobi are nearby sling projectiles, all really just grasping for straws. They purposely attack seperate areas to hopefully make evasion all the more difficult.

Zetsumo and duck rise a bit higher in the air. He's -still- trying to locate Kenshin's rapid movements.* - Sun Sep 13 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Hopefully this doesn't backfire. - Sun Sep 13 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighed.

Was this all they had to offer? On the sight of another tsunami, the forces approaching begin to fall back.

On this occasion, the troops don't even need to be instructed. In unison, once more, another tsunami is conjured. Even the shinobi backtracking are launching attacks, helping in the relief efforts. 

Just to make sure, a slightly higher quantity of troops had joined in the effort, hoping to ensure that Kirigakure never got the upper hand. "It would seem. We will simply have to sweat them out as I've intended before. It is unfortunate, although we have the advantage. All the shinobi in the world has figured it to be a good idea to commune in one area. The food. . .It won't last for long."

Meanwhile, the Amegakure/Bandits up ahead are still hard at work. It's reminiscient of Madara vs Shinobi Alliance. Various, unknown underlings rushed ahead, eager to apprehend the threat. Annoyed, Zetsumo looks downward. "We may just have to go take a break. we'll be here a long time."* - Sun Sep 13 22:18:40 2015

In time. . . It's decided to at least -try- infiltration.

Once more, unity is key. Katon techniques are spewed out by the hundreds, and collide with the ocean. On occasion, actual Suiton is thrown intot he mix, to make sure that the mist that inevitably spawned from the flames also held a degree of chakra to disrupt sensory abilities, and of course doujutsu.

And now . . . There existed the Kenshin issue. 

The communication units are scrambling to give instructions, considering the Speed Star was proving to be the most significant threat from Kirigakure without a doubt. 

Once more, a small group of misfit seek to work in unison upon having information relayed. As they close in on the blur that is Kenshin, seals again are string in. Roughy sixty shinobi work in unison in hope of forming an earthly construct that can spring up and entrap the criminally speedy warrior.

Of course, as they work, the group is evenly split up in four different directions -- meaning in groups of fifteen. Casually, the walls are earth are erected,  hoping to cage the speedy beast. Even the floor was to be coatedi n Doton chakra, hopefully making escape via digging difficult, if not impossible.* - Sun Sep 13 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: o-oh.. - Sun Sep 13 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts. Kenshin was -really- being an issue here.

From this point and on? It was more of the same. Drove of shinobi would come at him. Some launching explosive-tagged laced Kunai, others trying to engage in melee, while the smart people sought to continued with elemental ninjutsu.

Meanwhile, Zetsumo looks ahead, eying a strange, floating object move ahead.

Quickly, a small set of hand signs are woven through, and chakra gushes into the atmosphere. A massive, wide-ranged gale of wind comes, hoping to flush the threat away. Once it's far away, he sends miniture, katon spheres ahead assuming the initial strike hadn't destroyed the threat.* - Sun Sep 13 22:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
It's unlikely any battle hardened warrior is going to listen to conversion at a time like this. Many were as lawless as Zetsumo -- they sought victory. With a major power house out of the way, a whole new market would open up.

Presumably, they attack the man, deeming him a Kirigakure ally?

Regardless of that. . .It's clear not all attention is directed towards Kenshin nor the blond man. Rather, as the wind is being produced by Kirigakure troops, Team Amegakure strikes back. It's an easy counter as well, considering there were a lot of Fire Release shinobi at the forefront.  "FIRE!" In the hundreds, massive waves of inferno are being released to counteract the fuuton release. Moreso, as it holds elemental advantage, the strength is only increased.

For this effort? The God of War himself goes to bolster the strike. "Ushinawa! Sabo! Send your strongest attacks!" Quickly, threads are spewing out of his body, and the chakra from various hearts are fusing with one another. This grants a stark increase in power, making his Katon release all the more deadly. Going further than this, two hearts are momentarily sent out. . . And by now, you know what the deal is.

They link up, releasing Zetsumo's most potent combo. Great Fireball technique in conjunction with Greatbreakthough.  An unreal wave of destruction goes over the area, and fuses with the already potent onslaught of Katon unleashed by the underlings.

To improved, his duck flaps its wings, making the threat all the more impressive.* - Sun Sep 13 23:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on placidly. He had recalled Zenaki's previous complaints. Yet. . . with the girl's constant inactivity, and the war looming, he barely had time to deal with it. Thus? She'd have to wait.

That said, everyone else seemed to be silent. 

"I take the silence as a sign that no one has dared target Amegakure in my absence. Regardless, I will be taking additional shinobi in a few hours. This battle is far from over."

Zetsumo's gaze survey the area some more. All seemed to be in place. From Ushinawa angsting like an Uchiha, to the rest of his ilk loitering about casually. Then his eyes fell on to Aiyana. Unlike everyone else? She stuck out like a sore thumb.

"You there. Who are you?" the fiend speaks, his voice demanding attention as per usual.* - Mon Sep 14 15:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's gaze briefly falls onto Ushinawa. His stare is unwavering as long as the explanation is given.

Once done, Zetsumo quickly looks on over to Aiyana. "Is that so. . .She doesn't appear to be too strong. . ." the brute murmurs casually while scratching the bridge of his nose. Of course, once pointed out, the similarities in appearance was becoming all to clear -- particularly to Misa.

"I am willing to see, however. I presume this is the youngest sister. Come then," he motions to the field just south of the fencing areas. "And grant me your name," the mercenary leader speaks again while moving downward.* - Mon Sep 14 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Crap.. - Mon Sep 14 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) keeps his arms behind his back.

"You may make the first move."* - Mon Sep 14 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on with a somewhat amused expression. Aiyana's statements about Ushinawa greatly mirrored the relationship Zetsumo held himself -- with the numerous underlings that were subserviant to him within the Kenryoku. "Interesting."

"The basic. . .Bunshin technique? Easy to see," the male declares with a now unimpressed facial expression--  was this all the girl had to offer? His eyes had briefly moved over towards the ground, taking note of the lack of shadows, in addition to the fact that these clones could not interact with the environment. 

Rather than go on the offensive and make this a potentially short 'bout, Zetsumo remained in a stationary position. Yet now, his hands had risen and curled into fists. "Perhaps I can use some of my taijutsu in this battle," pondered the zombie-like beast. Nevertheless, that's all he does for the sequence.

* - Mon Sep 14 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's hand extends the second one of the shurikens were being phased through the Bunshin. He moves back simultaneously with the sight.

CHakra flows about his paws, allowing each particle of energy to grow more accustomed with his cellular sttructure. Once in place, Zetsumo shifts the energy into Doton Chakra, granting him the ability to manipulate his own body as if it were earth! Quickly, the tanned flesh darkens, growing all too similiar to a common rock. Flailing, the shurikens collide harshly against his earthly frame.

Clink! Clink! Clank!

Harmlessly, they're smacked out of the way. "You have to try harder than that, dear. Simple tactics such as these won't be able to catch me off guard."* - Mon Sep 14 16:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Is this all a ploy? People only use the basic skills when they have nothing else up their sleeves. - Mon Sep 14 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

Was this all the battle was going to be? Of course, the illiumination spawning from the Raiton draws attention. His threads shoot out at last, swatting the weapon away. As that happens, it moves in stride, beelining right towards Aiyana. Had the girl lacked the reflexive prowess to evade, she'd find that thick strings were being sent about her legs and waist, hoping to constrict or bind her. 

"Mmm. Chakra Flow -- Lightning chakra flow even. Impressive, what other tricks do you have?" Zetsumo says in an unhurried fashion, making it clear not too much effort was being applied. Would that be a mistake?* - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) leapt. He kicks off the fence, and allows his body to propel further south -- away from the Jibashi. "Earth Flash. One of my favorite techniques," mused Zetsumo admist the evasion. 

Considering the electricity ran along the ground, his strings were likely still in hot pursuit. They seemed to be possessive in nature, and were aiming again to constrict movement in order to place this expedition to an end. Judging by the warrior's tone, he was steadily growing more intrigued in the adolescent, who seemed to be waiting for the battle to prolong in order to showcase her actual skills.

"So a Raiton elementalist."* - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's threads are shocked.

Although, that only burns a few. He displaces himself anyway, and repeats the assault. More strings spew out, going for the legs and waist once more. On this occasion? The male forms a seal at last. * - Mon Sep 14 16:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Mmm. You have potential, I suppose. Your skillset can be refined, but you must also train your body. Assuming I deem you trustworthy enough, I may even be willing to teach you a few new techniques. . . THis is your only nature affinity?"

Zetsumo inquires. The strings from before loosen, and grant Aiyana her previous mobility. 

The male still seemed relatively intrigued in the initial Raiton technique. That was something to speak on.* - Mon Sep 14 17:22:08 2015

"Right then. This technique is highly offensive, and defensive. The main advantage is that due to the massive range, it proves difficult to avoid -- although only does concussive damage. It's the same technique I utilized to defeat the Raikage in battle about a month ago," the shinobi boasts.

As always, before beginning with the tutelage, the needed hand signs are first given. Zetsumo slowly moves through each of the differing seals, and even grants a sheet on the matter.

"Six seals in total. Meaning, you'll want quick hands to even be able to pull this off effectively in combat. As of now, I expect you to at least be competent in the usage of Fuuton release. . . But just incase you aren't, I'm going to walk you through this step by step. Chakra is to be built up in thick quantities in your belly, before being released into the atmosphere. Considering the range intended to cover? I want you to spread out the chakra as far as you can manage. Usually, around even or so meters in each direction will suffice.. . "

And of course, he's doing just that. Those with sensory or specialized doujutsu are easily able to take notice of the overwhelming flow of strength being unleashed into the air. 

"Then you shift it to fuuton-natured chakra. Doing so is easy, you simply have to thin out your energy, making ti be on the same level as air molecules, and thus have your chakra bind with it. Doing so will grant the user an innate ability to manipulate the air currents -- and from this, you go to the last step." 

Simultaneously with the explanation, air currents are abrewing. They force the leaves to shiver in fear, the nearby grass sway back in forth, as if welcoming the force of nature currently being built by the 'Warring God.' "Focusing the air currents forward. As the gales are being produced, unleash a steady stream of chakra, to make the flow go on like a continous beam. Of course, based on your skill, you can control just how much range you cover. This is a basic Fuuton technique, so I trust you'll be able to learn it before the week is up."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) flicks away for a brief moment. He pokes Airyana on the shoulder.* - Mon Sep 14 19:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Your training. How has it progressed? <@Yumiko> - Mon Sep 14 20:00:51 2015

"The one utilized first. I can offer you. . . One-hundred thousand yen in exchange. Believe me, empowering me will simply be assistance for your brother," Zetsumo notes.* - Mon Sep 14 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Right then. I'll see about getting his thoughts as well. In the meantime, I will have to make sure that my two underlings are remain productive."

Quickly, the male disperses into another burst of speed again. He falls right nex to Yumiko and Amai.* - Mon Sep 14 20:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: You two. - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glances over to Amai, gauging her decision.* - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, I'd love to team up on you. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Just toss me like three bottles of ink. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or two. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Right then. Restrictions are simple. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: No flying -- I hate flying. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I could tell. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues to neglect Suitengu.

Even if he said nothing, there was a strange feeling that Zetsumo was disappointed. The father casts a glance on over. "Tsk. . . That's it?" With that muttered, he's moving south, to find a mre opened area to battle.* - Mon Sep 14 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Can you pass me those ink bottles real quick? - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tosses on over a small bottle of ink.* - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll let her begin whenever. - Mon Sep 14 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: This should be fun to watch. - Mon Sep 14 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) forms a single seal.

From the ground, a massive slab rocks up, blocking the onslaught of wind. It's rigid, and seems to even serve as a detriment to the wolves themselves. Shortly after, another seal is placed, forcing the rocky wall to be dematerialized, devolving right into mud. It spews ahead like a wave, intent on overwhelming the size tigers, while also flowing and crashing into the girls as well.

Assuming the tigers still lasted, however, Zetsumo's threads went to do the finishing touches. They speed, hopefully drilling and dissipating right through this ink creatures.* - Mon Sep 14 21:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Well that was dumb. - Mon Sep 14 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) simply kicks off to the north. The poison bomb misses it's mark, although the fumes still go off. 

After doing three seals, Zetsumo's chakrai s pumping, and being buillt up. It shifts, being developed entirely into liquid, which subsequently flows on to his mouth. All in one seamless sequence, the male exhales, spitting out a mass of liquid. It comes out with a roar, subsequently doozing, and sending the Lions richocheting. 

Admist the flow of water, Zetsumo's head moves about, hopefully striking the bigger issue -- Amai. It wasi ntent on being a direct hit.

Shortly after, the 'Snake' handsign is again employed. Using the watero n the floor as a base, an additional, more powerful mud wave is unleashed, this one geared to striking Yumiko.

"Come now. . . These are low leveled techniques I'm using."* - Mon Sep 14 21:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

Two attacks at the same time -- and while it was well within his ability to deal with Amai and Yumiko before they could even complete their attack, he wanted to see what they could do. First came the wind. . . Then came the ink. 

His hands possessive come together, again forming the 'Snake' handsign. It forces chakra to fume over each point of his body, and encase its in a second layer of skin. For all intents and purposes, the warrior's skin WAS rock. All the attacks would collide properly against his form, and he's legitimately smashed into the ground. Dust roams over the area, clouding his figure.

Was it over? There's an awkward silence that came over the area. Then. . .

Swoosh! Light, spinning currents of wind come over the region, forcing each of particle of poisonous gas to be soaked up. The tornado is guided away, and he's looking on with a dangerous glare. "My. . .Had I not known any better. I would have assumed. . . You were aiming to catch me offguard with a fatal technique, Amai.  . .Haha. What a killer instict-- cowardly. But killer, nevertheless. . ." His eye itnerchangeably look between Amai and Yumiko, to make sure there no funny business going on.* - Mon Sep 14 21:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was no fool.

"Immortality perhaps is impossible. Yet regardless, I am the man that cannot be killed."

As the bottle of ink comes, he swats it with another layer of threads, in hopes of sending it back to the woman. Meanwhile, he's taking a step back, and allowing the earthly layer of his skin to recede to grant additional movement speed. 

"You are fairly, powerful, however. I will admit. It is a good thing I took care of you immediately in the initial battle. Certainly, you would have been an irritating nuisance," the Jiongu user retorts admist his backpeddling. It was a slight compliment, although the tone spoken remained stoic and lacking in energy -- making the true intent hard to discern.

Once back a bit, his hands suddenly break into a string, and upon taking a breath and exhaling, he releases dozsens of small flames. The temperature is held down to avoid permanently damaging Amai's flesh. Even then, each projectile proved to be swift, and could sing through cloth and attack the body itself.* - Mon Sep 14 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Intelligent."

But it mattered little. Once Amai had gotten close, threads spew from his body. It attacks at the woman's chest and torso, and moves to propel her back. Assuming she hadn't been able to avoid? Then the blonde's frame would be slammed into the grass. Mind you, it wasn't too vicious, so the risk of any bone breakage was minimal at best.

". . .What's this. . .You're going to leave her to fight alone, Yumiko? How disappointed. . How can I even think of depending on you in an actual fighting scenario?" * - Mon Sep 14 22:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He internally pities Amai.

Try. ..  try as she might. Everything dished out proves to be completely and utterly futile. The snakes coil around, slithering as if they were actual, organic creatures.

Then. . . The threads again are placed into action. From each point of his arms, strings are lashing, cutting away at the rapidly reforming snakes. The question remained, could they reform fast enough to keep Zetsumo bound? If so, he does a simple course of action, and sends out the Katon Mask. Once out, it releases a torrent of flame controlled enough to incinerate the ink, while also keeping him body from being damaged.

"Hng. . . Such a pain."* - Mon Sep 14 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Oh. A Kunai slams against his frame. He doesn't seem to mind it, though.* - Mon Sep 14 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
By now, Zetsumo had already been freed. 

He sends a quick kick towards Yumiko's belly, andcoats his leg with Doton chakra along the way. This, of course, eliminates the risk of being stabbed, and thus renders the poison inert -- or so he thinks. 

Assuming success, the strike is more than enough to send her body skidding backwards.* - Mon Sep 14 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: How much fun it would be if I took control of zets. - Mon Sep 14 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
As the wind came, Zetsumo ceases his kick.

Indeed, once that had come to an end, he uses the best feature in his ability. Strings rushes outl, and aim to wrap about Yumiko's frame. Assuming success, this little spar was at last over.

". . .Mmm. I had expected you to be much more power, Yumiko. Is this the true result of your training? How will you be of use to Zenaki in this state. . . Or more importantly, to myself."* - Mon Sep 14 23:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth. . . - Mon Sep 14 23:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Tell me. What will be your punishment? - Mon Sep 14 23:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Tell me. . .Since the day I've saved you from Sunagakure's invading forces. What have you done in term of productivity? - Mon Sep 14 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: M-me? - Mon Sep 14 23:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: I've..tried my best to catch up with you all to be able to support in combat with my newly found poison abilities..And increase my wind tactics..But I've failed to learn worthy wind abilities so I make up for my weakness with my mind to create potent poisons for you all in battle. - Mon Sep 14 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. He could sympathize with the woman. After all, the lack of Fuuton techniques was partially his own fault, considering it was his job to acquire the large quantity of Fuuton techniques for the Kenryoku to develop from. 

Regardless of those feelings, Zetsumo is careful not to showcase it. A hand clutches at Yumiko's chin tightly, and he forces her eyes to make contact with his own, oft lifeless gaze. The calmness is almost surreal, but underneath the passive appearance laid a beast. That much was likely to be clear to the young Sarutobi.

More, hushed whispers are given.* - Mon Sep 14 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Sound like excuses. If you lack Fuuton techniques -- it is your job to devleop them. Although, I do have another technique to offer. - Mon Sep 14 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: It is close-ranged. - Mon Sep 14 23:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: I will master it much like I have the other. - Mon Sep 14 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) remained calmed.

Inside, however, was a different story. Yumiko's reaction -- one filled with trepidation -- brought joy to his soul. In response, the grip only tightens. In a hushed tone again, Zetsumo speaks.* - Mon Sep 14 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: And why should I? I want to see your reasoning. - Mon Sep 14 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: B-because.....My life is yours to use...I become stronger for your benefit, but I've failed in skill...I wish to make up for it. If you'd see worth in a human slave..Lord Zetsumo. - Mon Sep 14 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Hrm. . .Fine. - Mon Sep 14 23:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: But first. - Mon Sep 14 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth.  - Mon Sep 14 23:54:40 2015

Tendrils like threads would come out. They lash against the ground, and the simple impact proves enough to leave a small crater on the floor. "Come. I have much I wish to talk with you. Yumiko, you may remain here, an speak with whoever you deem fit."

Of course, a glance is given to Suitengu. He stares, but says nothing to the adolescent before walking off -- hopefully with Beth following about obediently.* - Mon Sep 14 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, my lord. - Tue Sep 15 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) along the way,  he wraps the threads around Beth's neck, literally dragging her to an isolated cell. 

It's there she's tossed into the wall. "My. . Sister. Honestly, did you expect there to be no repercussion? Now then. . . the question remains. . . 'what.' You are a smart girl, knowing that I wouldn't quite feel up to killing you. Yet retribution is needed. . ' He paces back and forth before stopping ahead of Beth. Beady, demonic eyes pierce through the skies and dully stare forward.* - Tue Sep 15 00:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) resumed his pacing antics.

"Sorry isn't good enough. Thus. . .I will have to seek retribution. I grant you another opportunity, choose a decent punishment. One that can be effective against you," He again offers, falling right infront of Beth once more.

The male's brow twitches in complete and utter irritation. Had dare this wench do such a thing against his own kin?* - Tue Sep 15 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"It is simple. To you. . . Pain is pleasure. Likewise, doing any permanent damage is detrimental -- as I desire to have you on the battle field."

At last, he looks down, and plants a hand deep within that thick wall of hair she called an afro. His fingers clench, tightening about her locks and using that grip to lift Beth's small frame up. Eye to eye, Zetsumo huffs, and unleashes his hot breath along her flesh.

"Tell me then. How would it feel to be as violated as my sister? Hrm? Perhaps in a crowd," threatened the zombie-like fiend. She's pinned to the wall, while still being suspended in the air, and from start to finish, Zetsumo never backs up, allowing his hot breath to continue being unleashed, although in a tamed fashion.* - Tue Sep 15 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The hand that remained free moves to wipe away the girl's tear. The salty droplets are brough to his lips and ingested -- Yes, the creep found the sorrow scrumptious.

"Mmm. . . I think I will. Yes. . . Yes. . . Once I am done, I never want to hear about any of your mental assaults on my dear sister. . . Ever again," the male spoke cryptically, and remained as close as ever. Then he leans back. A single finger is held up, and threads come speeding out, forming a sharpened edge. Using this, he stabs ahead, targetting the chest. Yet it is unable to piece skin and instead works on the cloth.

He's dragging the finger downward, shredding at the strings that held together Beth's outfit, exposing the torture.

"So undeveloped. Is this why you did so? Jealous because your body doesn't sport the wonders of womanhood?" Zetsumo says, taunting the teen even.* - Tue Sep 15 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. "Color me unimpressed. I have such devious thoughts, yet you're built like a child." He sucked his teeth, seemingly disappointed with the eye candy.

The finger moved in stride, eventually cutting through enough fabric to expose not only Beth's chest, but her mid-driff. By then, the strings retract, re-entering Zetsumo's frame as he looks ahead. ".  . .Hrm. " That same hand rises against, and cups at the woman's petite bosom. A light squeeze is given, while she's still suspended in the air, and pinned tightly against the wall.

"Choose now then. Where shall I begin?" those demonic, beady eyes again shoot forward, and stare into the pits of Beth's soul. This was a different side of Zetsumo that she was likely not used too. Yet, it had been the woman's on actions that had brought out the beast. Silently, he awaits the answer, always finding pleasure in forcing his own underlings in deciding their punishment.* - Tue Sep 15 01:14:01 2015
