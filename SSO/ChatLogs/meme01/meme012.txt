"Mmm. Then tell me, if not in the Kenryoku. . . What would you be doing? How would your life go?" That same pensive gaze pierces through the skies. His ears are attentive, as Zetsumo always sought to learn how certain people ticked. This often was true simply for malicious intent, yet the male was legitimately curious.

"It is odd. . . That you've not tried to gain anything out of this. Many of my allies come to me simply because they tired of being victimized. Of being the prey. I take them, and I mould them into predators--" He stops, laughing once more. "You are quite arrogant. . Mmm, it reminds me of myself. Yet your overconfidence isn't warranted.

Being the powerful, crime lord of the village, each time he's entered, the customers and employees all cower in fear. Today? Would be no different. He cushions his tush onto the seat, and sits right across from Katsune.

"Mmm. WHat will you be having? I would offer another drinking competition. But I doubt you have much money to offer," the brute notes. A hand beckons, calling one of the cowardly employees to come at his side.* - Wed Sep 02 06:24:12 2015

"You heard the lass. . .Make it snappy. For me. . . Simply provide a simple round of dumplings. I want an entire tray full."

As the order is delivered, he gives an addenum, of course ensuring that they provided a nice serving of alcohol beverages. This time, many that differed from the simple, yet manly 'Beer.' Once done, Zetsumo turned around, facing the young gal casually.

"Tell me. Your lineage. . . Your friends and family. Do you never once think back to what has become of them? Did you even have an emotional tie to them? I hardly hear you mention a damn thing about 'em. . "* - Wed Sep 02 06:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pitied her deep down.

"It is safe to assume you were in an abusive family. It is a pity, that you did not learn the joy of a traditional family. I, on the otherhand, began with the opposite. A loving family of four. Yet in life, there is no such thing as a sure thing," he replies.  "Anything can be stripped from you. Mind you. . . I say it is a pity not because you were unable to have a happy family. But simply because you lacked the opportunity to suffer the pain of lost. I suppose this is why you lack ambition. For me. . .  The lost is one of my greatest convictions," murmured to the shell of a human in a solemn voice. He's looking at Katsune, but it's obvious that the male is drifting into thought.

What a poor, damaged soul.

Cue headshake. And the food arrive at the opportune time.

"And this is the closest you've had to family. Odd, with how detached you've been. Although, I suppose the former environement plays a part." He goes, chewing violently t the first round of dumplings.* - Wed Sep 02 06:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) points.

"Smart girl. Unlike some other people. . . It's difficult. To contain the rage. Many tend to push my buttons," he replies quickly.  Memories of Kitora flashed in his mind. She made it so difficult. . . But Zetsumo knew, if a tight-lid wasn't kept on his constant anger, he'd be prone to just slaughtering people.

"Eat."* - Wed Sep 02 06:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks on. "What in Hagaromo's name is the matter? Chew. . ." He replies calmly. Three dumplings have been outright devoured. Ont he last, Zetsumo got particularly odd, and sent out parasitic threads from his mouth to rip the meal to shrreads, then guide it down his mouth. Why? Just to test how she'd react to the strangeness.

". . .Mmm. WHat else can be said? About your origin. . . Your personality and so forth," he had to know what make people tick. How else could he mode them into superior persona? To think. Just a few short years ago, even Mukade was an actually respectable person. If she could be changed to Zetsumo's liking, so could Katsune.* - Wed Sep 02 06:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps his fingers restless on the table as she spoke.

". . .Iwagakure. And how the heck does that lead you to Konoha? Odd. And yes, I realize you will. But there are advantages to knowing how my accomplices tick. I've found that when I can uncover that information, it's a lot easier to work with them. Well.. . except for one," He grunts, still irritated by a particular Nara.

By now, his plate is more or less completed, as not a lot of food was ordered. A hand comes, bringing a cup of sake to his mouth for a sip.

He seems a let less tense when on alcohol.* - Wed Sep 02 07:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pats Kilm in the shoulder.

"You realize. . .You are a mercenary, yes?"

He seemed unamused by Kilm's condemnation of death. On the flipside, Zetsumo is pleasantly surprised. He turns, nodding in approval to Katsune. "I under the sensation. Gaining pleasure from such is no oddity. . . To claim such would be the same as giving someone a strange look for being happy that they won a game. . .How many have you killed? I recall my first murder, almost like it was yesterday."

Crazy people, talking about murder as if it was a common occurence.* - Wed Sep 02 07:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms.

The genjutsu, as a result of being told to him, was quite clear. Yet, Zetsumo opted not to just outright dispel the technique. Indeed, observant eyes scan and note each facet of the jutsu. From the way the light was projected, to how the illusion of heat felt.

"Interesting technique. Yet it fails to be effective as I've been told of the jutsu time and time again. You must grow creative, derive your illusions to fit your needs!" And yes, he knew just how difficult it was to make genjutsu your main form of combat, esp;ecially at the lower levels. Yet it was necessary. Arms folded, the fiend of a warrior continued with his speech. 

"For example. Rather than have simple spheres come from the skies. Why not make the illusion depict you sending a massive Goukakyuu? One that honestly is just too large and too fast for your opponent to feasible avoid? It would take some practice. But certainly. . . it is superior than just using the base-version of the genjutsu.

Of course, he releases it right after.* - Wed Sep 02 19:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept both of his arms folded among one another. It was impressive, the sight that he was subjected to. Nevertheless, as the faux-wind currents went about doing their things, Zetsumo stayed put. Even with this clearly being an illusion, his body is forced to react as if there were actual, violent winds. Tendrils shoot, anchoring his body to the ground, then at last. . . enough is enough.

"Very well. A convincing genjutsu. Imagine doing this very thing -- but plaacing a distraction. For example, a plum of smoke to shroud your figure. Then suddenly a storm is brewing. Nevertheless, that is enough. We must head to the square."

His body flicks away to meet with the ensemble called before.* - Wed Sep 02 19:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folds his arms.

"Mmm. A respectable amount. . . And ironically, quite a few of my strongest. This is enough.  ." All around them, Amegakure troops moved in a frenzy. They were like a horde of bumble bees who are hot-blooded with their hive nest being ruptured or attacked. 

Honestly. . .For all intents and purposes, you would clearly believe there to be an influx of soldiers -- and it was true. In his haste, Zetsumo had managed to obtain an additional one-thousand men for the effort, and even went out of his way to hire personal mercenaries.

"Today, ladies and gent. We make history."* - Wed Sep 02 20:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms. He stares ahead. 

"Let's move then. During the travel, never stay in plain sight. The entire group won't be moving in one, thus it can help in avoiding detection as we really don't want to be spotted right off the bat."* - Wed Sep 02 20:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And thus the travel began. The thousands of warriors have split up, with only a few hundreds at the most traveling in the general vicinity of one another. As expected, however. ..  Zetsumo moved with the Kenryoku. He was their leader, and despite his harshness, he had every bit of intent on protecting them, with his life on the line. Adrenaline was already being built up. . . even with battles being day's away. 

To the west, the shinobi continued to move before at last being placed by at ree. He kneels, and performs a short seal-- poof. Spawning a flock. They move overhead, observing the land and seeing if there were anyone on his trail. Likewise, a small chick remained on his shoulder, serving as the counter to his one eye being missed. It would over his blind-spot!

"You all. . . Remain prepared. Be on your toes."* - Wed Sep 02 20:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The movement would resume shortly after. With only a few hours of rest, Zetsumo -- having dished out the messages to other camps as the defacto leader of Amegakure -- proceeds towards the west. His threads are slung out, wrapping about Kitora's waist, and of course pulling the lazy S.O.B along the way. His arms remained folded, and eyes as observant as ever.

Again and again, the warrior summoning technique was used to great effectiveness, scouting from the skies. Assuming they found nothing of note, he'd again take off and move closer and closer to SUnagakure. Adrenaline was ever-present, building up and practically boiling over.

Until at last. . . the desert-y plain had been breached. He looked down, and examined the scenery. A hand pressed against the ground, searching and feeling out for any traps -- yet there were none. "Sunagakure. . .  Soon." Memories flashed. And in all honesty, Zetsumo held a great amount of grief or frustration towards the Sand Village. Their Jinchuuriki had infamously thwarted him.

Likewise, the village hidden in the sand constantly served as an agent for other villages. Them just refusing to give Orakuru was just the icing to the cake. They now had to suffer.* - Wed Sep 02 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And so it began. . .

The Land of Wind was in for a surprise. In the distance. . . A literal cloud of men were approaching in the distance -- fast. They were charging, seemingly heading towards the Sand Village with haste, with wreckless abadon even. 

From the distance, the quantity of men seemed to be unrealistically large. Numbering in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands. But how? How could one army have so many men?!

Nevertheless, after moving a few kilometers, the large gathering split into several different portions. After all, only a fool would attack from one direction. The massive army would spread out, each with different assignments or objective in order to ensure a crushing defeat. Meanwhile. . . The leader of this vicious group took center stage.

". . .Here comes the pain." Zetsumo declared calmly to the ensemble that had arrived along his side. His body convulsed, and before long, endless streams of threads were being gushed out, allowing his frame to rocket high into the skies. This served a second purpose, however. It granted an amazingly high resevoir of chakra energy, and bolstered his strength.

Following shortly after. . . four massive figures were spat out. Earth Grudge Creatures, each juiced up and ready to rumble.* - Wed Sep 02 20:48:38 2015

"I'll lead. . ."

He wastes no time. The beauty of holding this unique ability was that it greatly helped in fighting a large number of enemies. His two favorite creatures -- the Fire and Wind -- are placed to the forefront. With a wicked grin, he controls their might, enforcing that the chakra-based creatures did exactly as he told.

Swiftly, from the Katon-Creature, two massive streams of flames move about. They go up the mountain, and seem to circle around, all with the intent on blocking off any chance for escape. He starts off with a favored combo, once the first technique had been performed. Quickly, the two creatures mentioned link up, allowing their elemental prowess to more or less sink.

"Let's try this now. . . Great Blaze: Hellstorm technique!" It's combo that conjoins a technique from each naturetype. Goukakyuu and Greatbreakthough. Thus, a massive wave of chaoic might is dished, likely with enough strength and length to threaten all of those within his plain of sight. Although, considering it was launched in a straight forward fashion, it's clear the main target for the moment is the famed Kronos.* - Wed Sep 02 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
As for those that came from the back, they would find ar ude awakening. A good number of Amegakure troops moved to engage. Yet they weren't alone. None? THe Lightning and Suiton hearts jumped into the mix. 

Lasting little time, they also proceed to mix their elemental might by linking up.

A massive stream of Suiton is sent from their maws. Yet it isn't the only thing, just as the water is falling down, electricity comes to the mix. Thus, the stream of of water is not boosted with cackling electricity. The Earth-Grudge creature would manuever it's head, allowing the electric-cladded stream to manuever as well, hoopefully devestating the opposing troops.

Meanwhile. . . There are likely Amegakure forces storming from all around the village.* - Wed Sep 02 21:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"You are no titan, boy. . " Zetsumo says with a drawl towards the sand manipulator. The defensive methods on Kronos' behalf were admirable, and had the shinobi nor been proficient in so many different, corresponding nature-types, may have been a partial success. Sadly. . . This was not the case. The flames, empowered by massive gales of wind.

They rip right through is defense, comprised of Sand and even Gold Particles. Inch by inch, the sturdy structure is being deteroriated, and in no time at all, Kronos' body was likely exposed! Things likely did not look good for the gentle, as his body threatened to be engulfed in flames, and likely roasted beyond recognition.

Dravae, while more fortunate than Kronos, no doubt isn't having much luck himself. Due to the brunt of the attack not being geared towards him, he is able to better defend. The block of earth, sadly, still proves to be trivial. Flames clash, and manages to breakthrough. However, it does manage to stave off some of the damage that would have been dished out.  
-----
He's given warning, and told of the Groundhogs. "Katsune! Deal with whatever is underground." And of course, she had already began doing so.

In the knick of time, Zetsumo had manuevered, allowing fo the release of mud to go on without a hitch. It was odd. . .Kitora, was the most insubordinate, yet the duo worked well togethered. He does three seals -- quickly, allowing chakra to take control of the mud. Effortlessly, a giant Dragon -Head is formed. It sends out a ten rounds of mud-bullets. Evenly split between Dravae and the new arrival. As a result of the ease, once the technique is in place, the elementalist is on the move.

Taking advantage of this, the Fire-based Earth Grudge Creature joins in , sending a stream of flames, making the once deadly Mud-Bullets even more powerful. 

"Paine. Join me in this battle." He says this, as he races over, and presses two paws onto the ground. -- On god. From out of nowhere, four pillars proceeded form on the mountain. The edges are sharpened, and they move with quickness, each from a different angle, and in a different motion. THe point? To impale the leader that dare defy him.* - Wed Sep 02 21:57:45 2015

As a note, he moves oddly, using his threads as legs.

Anywho, from this point, it was the other Earth Grudge Creature's time to shine. The Lightning and Water brothers. With unreal quickness, both parties move over, serving as defense to Shin -- who had yet make a move.

Assuming the Golem was out, two Lightning Balls are sent forward, in hopes of cracking and ultimately dealing heavy damage to the summoning creature.* - Wed Sep 02 22:04:35 2015

The two fcreatures commune, intent on taking that damn Golem out. Together, another round of techniques are added to the mix. A raging-wave, along with a lightning ball mixed in. The combined force aims to engulf the Earth-based creature, and reduce it to rubble. 

Hopefully this could be accomplished effectively. That way Shin can be of help.* - Wed Sep 02 23:01:45 2015

"Zetsumo-san!" The chick on his shoulder gawks.

Thus, he made is aware of the incoming sand projectiles. Responding, layers of thread shoot out, aiming to meet the weapons half-way. If not deflecting, perhaps blocking the incoming weapons. 

Assuming that was dealt with, admist Chiyari's hot-blooded range of evasion, Zetsumo went to make his move. Speedily, tendrils are launched out, aiming to wrap themselves about the boy's neck, and squeezed. Hopefully, that would put a stop to the leader's methods.

Regardless. As the hundreds of troops came? Amegakure men simply reacted in part. As the wind and fire goes, they respond, sending Suiton and defensive Doton techniques. After all, he came here with people too, you know.

Then. . . It was time for that Iron-Sand bastard to be dealt with! 

The Katon-natured creature looks on, and from it's maw, blackened gas is spewed out. It travels upward into the skies, and aim to encircle or entrapped the Iron-Sand practitioner from all sides-- making it obvious that he'd need to use the full force of his ability of his sand's defensive ability to take care.

If engulfed, the creature follows suit and brings the fire. Once flame had collided, the unstable substance would react, releasing a massive explosion of inferno destruction. The simple force would beckon gales to be produced, as the force resonates through the area. * - Wed Sep 02 23:32:28 2015

He was forced to the ground by the wind with a thud. The thud triggered a chain reaction that caused his wide range pit fall of 20 feet now to open. He wanted to make it deeper but the fall would prematurely trigger it. The ground would crack away and fall, it captured Zetsumo, the 4 monsters, Beth, and Paine; along with any troops in range.

The bugs were numerous. 

Quickly, Zetsumo employs the usage of his Fuuton Heart. It spews massive currents from the side, intent on catching the bugs in a cyclone. Hopefully a good enough number are dealt with.

Meanwhile. ..  Zetsumo has additional Amegakure shinobi come to his aid. 

"No amount of soldiers can protect you from me. Why. . . Oh why, did you do this to yourself? I had one request, and you denied it. Now Sunagakure must suffer for the sake of one man!" It's clear who he referred to -- the same rogue that sought refuge in this village.  Anywho, Earth Grudge Creatures (Lightning and Water) are by Orakuru. He want these hands?

As usual the chick keeps an eye out. If he had thought Zetsumo's back was left open? Tethys was far mistaken.

. . . THis would not be a repeat of a certain Kazekage. No one was catching him slipping. Quickly, his hand pressed together, forming the 'Snake' handsign, and of course builds up chakra.

Indeed, despite facing the action, he chick alerts him.The second the Hozuki had lept, threads from the warrior's back are richocheting, aiming to pierce right through his belly. Of course, knowing how well the Jounin could excel in combat, there posed the risk of him actually evading and defending well -- in the event that this hadn't been a success. . . 

Assuming not, his neck takes a nasty cut, although is far from beheaded. At the same instant, the ground would have been completely manipulated, a sizeable wave of mud sprouts, aiming to overwhelm and send the Jounin skidding backwards. 

Regardless of the outcome, the Shinobi takes the obvious defensive measures. His Jiongu Threads again shoot down, serving as anchors and keeping him a good distance away. If Tethy's wanted to fight? He'd have to do it from afar.

The two creatures move ahead, after having an extended period of rest. The jutsu used? Is simple. One would again send simple streams of flames run along, filling up the walk-way. 

Assuming no one had stopped this? The Fuuton heart goes to finish the job. Additional, miniture tornadoes are unleashed, and react with the flames. Thus? Massive, inferno explosions roam through the gates. The point was simple, to collapse the very foundation of this particular location of the mountain range. It would hopefully cause an avalanche that could deal with the insignificant NPC warriors that were nearby, and of course block entry.* - Thu Sep 03 01:02:04 2015

Scene:

Landscape is absolutely wrecked. Now two hulking, thread-filled creatures linger behind Katsune, clearly serving as defense about Orakuru.* - Thu Sep 03 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Quickly, as the flames had gone to engulf and enforce a collapse, the Katon Creature would have proceeded to sprint, and sought to lliterally scale the mountain. The point?

To enter the village itself.

Meanwhile, it's Fuuton-brother provided aid. Massive waves or gust of winds came over the area, hoping to send all in sight back in recoil.* - Thu Sep 03 01:36:12 2015

". . .The 'Black Blade. . . ' What a silly name. Send the message back to that tramp you call a wife. She';s interfered with my ploys for far too long. What happened here will be replicated to Kirigakure soon enough," He threatens. 

With a single handsign, Doton chakra again sprouts. On this occasion, it changes the landscape entirely.

Slabs of Earth arise, forming a dome over Chiyari, along with the abundance of soldiers that remained about in the area. If not stopped? They'd be entrappedf within a criminally sturdy dome, and of course grants an avenue for escape. 

Having done that, another gathering of threads soon coil around Paine's body. It eliminates the fact that she had less than desire-able movement speed. Assuming success, the warrior kicks off. It was time to retreat. His body, soon after, is incased in Doton, thus saving him from being bitten by those bugs. With a massive leap, Zetsumo hopes to have displaced himself away from battle.

Then off came the flare, alerting all troops to begin retreating.

His creatures -- Suiton and Lightning, fire off generic bolts, serving as cover for their  master who sought to get the fuck outta there.* - Thu Sep 03 01:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sought to retreat.

For one reason, and one reason only. Fatigue. He hadn't been enabled to kill the man he came here for. Yet. . . Perhaps this would send a clear enough message. In terms of strength, the beast was in a realm all his own. No one. . . Nothing could dare match his might.

Obviously, the creature's hand would swipe down, grabbing ahold of Katsune ala King Kong. Assuming success, it sprints with surprising quickness. Zetsumo doest the same, riding ontop and abusing it's speed to exit the area.

Of course, admist the running, both Water and Lightning released techniques, serving as cover. Massive streams of liquid would rocket through the air, and crash into the ground. Once the floor had been soaked up? Electricity roams, making pursuti unwise. 

Assuming -that- wasn't enough? Then another massive wind gale is delivered for safe measures shortly afterwards.

They finally made it out!

"Mmm. I'd take that as a victory, yes? HAHAHA!  Oh, the rush! The adrenaline, HAHAH! I really need to go unleash my power more often," he says, giving a glance towards Paine, Kitora, then Katsune. 

By now, each of the creatures had balled up, an took refuge within his body once more. He's sitting on the grass, recovering much needed vitality. The troops, likewise, moved in from the distance, eager to return to their wives and children after a clearly successful battle.

"Paine. What happened? I had expected you to make short work of him? Same with you, Katsune. . . You had creatures backing you up. A victory was all but assured."* - Thu Sep 03 02:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) seems to be in the best mood ever. To have such a. . . jovial laugh. It was odd to say the least.

"Kitora. Grand job, by the way. The traitor is finally dead -- Well, one of the traitors. The motto is. .. 'Ride or Die' no? I suppose he chose to die."* - Thu Sep 03 02:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead to Kitora.

By then, the group was again traveling, and exits the desert in record time. Home. . . Konoha, it was growing nearer and nearer. "Kitora. You behave as if this is your first, cold-blooded kill. Don't tell me. . . With all the death threats towards Mukade.You honestly. ..  Lack the heart? Hahaha.  This day just gets funner and funner."

His hand moves, ruffling the girl's hair in a condescending fashion. "I suppose now you are finally a real mercenary. Good work. . . And shake that stupid look off your face. I intend to reward you greatly, yet how poorly you react is turning me in the wrong way," the brute declares. He takes a rest by a nearby tree, and uses the wood as bark. Again, birds fly around, serving as protection.* - Thu Sep 03 02:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rolled his eyes. He still acted with condescending fashion, rubbing Kitora's head of hair, before falling into a pat.

"Right. . . Right. The first step to actually becoming a ruthless mercenary is trying to get in the mindset that you can easily shake off death," he says with a shrug. His tone again belittles the girl, before shifting attention towards the other travelers.

"And yes, that was one of the reason I targetted him. I hope my attack sends a proper message -- I am not to be trifled with. If Sunagakure is intelligent, they will hand over Orakuru and be done with all of the pain. . .He huffs, still seeming fatigued due to exercising the full range of his ability.

"As for you, Kitora. For reward, I will offer yen. Two million -- unless you have another request." The gent continues moving ahead, and probably won't stop until in the village's square.* - Thu Sep 03 03:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perks a brow.

"Think it waste. After all, we cannot linger in this victory for too long. I'm already looking ahead, in all honesty," the habitually busy warrior declared. He steps towards the north, and leans against the fence.* - Thu Sep 03 03:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) carelessly leaned against the fence through this all. Konoha, at this time of day, was a practical ghost town. Most citizens that resided typically opted to stay indoors in the early mornings -- for fear of running into the 'undesireables.'

In a partial daze, Zetsumo looked ahead, only to be interrupted by the recently arriving Katsune. 

His eyes cant towards the size, eying the teen. "Mmm. That was a quick nap," the brute notes. "Tell me. Are you ready for potential backlash? Sunagakure may aim for a counter."* - Thu Sep 03 07:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pats the girl on the shoulder.

"Witness firsthand." Chakra flares about his body, and with a slight pivot, Zetsumo practically teleports to the other end of the plaza.

"It is movement aided by chakra. Although, in battle. . . It takes a high degree of skill and tact to use effectively, for consecutive blows. It's odd. . . How haven't you known? I guess you've never noticed me randomly popping into an area. . ."* - Thu Sep 03 07:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"It's using chakra to enhance your speed.I thought you'd know," he says with a shrug. "But yes, that is a technique I can teach you. It is one Orakuru tends to use to enhance his already formiddable speeds."* - Thu Sep 03 07:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) twirls his body to the north. He begins to move ahead without a word.

Before going too far, a whistle is given to alert that he intended for her to follow -- the sound was a bit too similar to an owner calling for their pup.* - Thu Sep 03 07:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) even snaps his fingers.* - Thu Sep 03 07:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Heh," the male murmured with a hint of mischeviousness.

He says nothing after this. His feet would drag along the floor, releasing that irritating sound of too materials grinding against one another -- chafing even. It's consistent, up until the lush grasses of Konoha's interior forests. 

Zetsumo's motion comes to an end, once by the big tree. "Right then. The jutsu is simple in practice. All it takes is a guiding hand. As you're a beginner, I expect you to hold a handsign. The 'Ram' or 'Tiger' is usually the one that's best fit for Shunshin. As a note, you may suffer nausea once you successfully replicate the technique."* - Thu Sep 03 07:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"To utilize shunshin is a trivia task. With that seal, build up a mass of chakra within your stomach. . " He forms a single seal to assist in the endeavor. Chakra in his belly grow to be rabid, and spirals around in an unruly fashion.

"Once an adequate amount is gather, you simply take it and spread it -evenly- around your body. Have the chi hone in on the significant muscles of the body, particularly in the fast-twitch fiber. The added energy will allow you to have the potential to accelerate -- based on your skill with the jutsu, and overall chakra capabilities."

Once more, he does as stated and causes the chakra to spread out. "Anywho. THat's the hard part. If you can reach that point, just prepare to move your body, and unleash the chakra in sync with the movement. If done properly, you're going to move at a much faster rate of speed. It's all about timing and coordination."* - Thu Sep 03 08:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had taken a seat to watch the show.

He had no doubt, learning at least the basics of Shunshin would be a trivial task. He shows no surprise, especially as Katsune's body would suddenly propel, ascending into a new realm of speed -- a blur if you will. 

Then came the end result. . . 

Vomit or queasiness. "Hah. . . I told you you;'d get a bit disorientated. But to throw up. . How shameful. . . Tsk, tsk," the sensei declares, ridiculing the teen just a tad. Zetsumo moved to lay now, and shoo's her off. "Yes, go clean yourself."* - Thu Sep 03 08:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Those two are still sleeping. Have you come in contact with anyone else of significance?"* - Thu Sep 03 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Upon returning home after what was deemed a succesful battle, Zetsumo takes center stage. The grand news is provided, much to the relief of citizens and warriors alike. Yet he also provides a clear message -- which in turn is meant to be spreaded towards those in Sunagakure.*

'It is a pity. . . In all my time, I had zero intent on unleashing my rage towards the struggling nation, the village 'Hidden in the Sand.' Nevertheless, for those who may take offense to the strike. . . I warn you not to place your blame onto Amegakure, nor the Kenryoku. Rather, turn to your esteemed leader -- the one known as Chiyari. He failed to heed my warning, thus I will give those of Sunagakure another chance.'

'If you wish for the bloodshed to end. Turn in 'Orakuru.' Likewise, if you are feeling particularly generous. . . give me the head of Chiyari as well -- for his insulence. The bounty for the former will still stand. As for the latter. . . the only 'payment' will be me convincing Amegakure tospare you their wrath.'

The offer had been* - Thu Sep 03 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The offer had been given. Would any cash in on it?* - Thu Sep 03 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) poofs.* - Thu Sep 03 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Don't think I haven't forgotten of your punishment. Same with Osamu, a mission failed is a mission failed," he notes, while internally pitying Kitora. Funny enough, he had already held plans to get a weapon of that calibar for her. She just made things easier.* - Thu Sep 03 19:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Mastered two more jutsus for you - Thu Sep 03 20:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would go to take the objects. He turns towards Kitora, whistles and motions down with a gesture of the head* - Thu Sep 03 20:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head and flicks the girl on the forehead. "All fours," he demands. Meanwhile, his mind ponders, what punishment was there to be for Osamu? Likely something involving manual labor.* - Thu Sep 03 20:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would kneel over. The collar is quickly fastened over Kitora's neck, and the leash is attached to the collar. Thus, the brutish leader proceeds towards the north, and yanks at the leash -- forcing the woman to follow suit.

"Come, come." If all goes well, he stops just ahead of the northern fence.* - Thu Sep 03 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. He gains a slight smile.

"I very much enjoyed this. Beth, how may I approve on my current punishment?"* - Thu Sep 03 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilts his head.

"Good idea. I will add those things. . . But later. Order those objects when it is convenient." His hand is held forward, and he motions for Beth to come take the reigns.* - Thu Sep 03 20:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have handed it over.

He gives a moderate kick to Kitora's rear -- as a warning. "Behave. Do not attack, if I hear it. YOu're in deep shit," the warrior declares. He looked ahead to Paine.

"Swell job on the attack yesterday. Although. . . You still have much room for improvement. In a while, you and I will train."* - Thu Sep 03 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"In the meantime. You all enjoy yourselves. You know how badly I hate people that sit around. . . Doing nothing. Kitora, recall, be on your best behavior."

His body flicks away, in a plum of smoke.* - Thu Sep 03 20:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
. . .The wind shifts.

And suddenly, Zetsumo had materialized within the area. Shunshin, such a nifty technique. His eyes are lifeless as always, and in a mechanical fashion, the brute moves over, with both arms folded. 

"Mmm. . . I had heard you returned. But I had to see this for myself. . " There's an arrogant smirk being worn, which suggested he knew that Maya would eventually return. ". . .Humor me. What convinced you to return to my clutches?"* - Thu Sep 03 20:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Indeed. Due to his strange physique, and genetic traits -- Zetsumo quite literally just did not age. His eyes flicker,looking the woman's frame up and down.

He chuckles -- not due to joy, but simply from amusement. He -knew- she'd come back, hence why he never once bothered to pursue. "It is a good thing you did. I had kept tabs, at one point. . . You were in Sunagakure? And boy. . . You would not have wanted to be there as of late. Nevermind the constant attacks from neighboring villages. They suffered a harsh defeat by my hands," Zetsumo notes in a braggadocious fashion. It's clear -- he took great pride in the victory.

Both hands remained folded among one another before the Zombie Shinobi continued. 

"Now that you are back. What do you intend to do now?"* - Thu Sep 03 21:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps his feet.

Maya would note a lot of changes in the last five-years. Particularly in Konoha's population. There wasn't a single Konoha shinobi left . Now, there only existed Amegakure Forces and the Kenryoku. Citizens -- those being simple beings, such as blacksmiths, business men, and so forth -- lived on in fear. 

For good reason. The same man that had come and ransacked the village's forces was the one allowed to roam free. . .To do as he pleased. In the end, no laws applied to Zetsumo. . . as he -was- the law.

Maya's answer brings another amused simper to his maw. ". . .Amusing. I wish to have you rejoin my ranks. It is a simple request -- and one that is advantagous to us both."* - Thu Sep 03 21:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Hrm. . . For the moment, yes. In exchange, what requests do you have?" He says with a drawl.* - Thu Sep 03 21:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) flicks away in a plum of smoke.* - Thu Sep 03 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Suddenly appears.

". . .Mmm. Paine, where did the two knuckleheads go?"* - Thu Sep 03 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms.

"You're lying. Mmm. . . I suspect it's about. . . The sand manipulator? Conner?" Zetsumo states, referencing Kronos -- who he knew to be a former lover. . . to Paine that is.

"--- I will fall silent for now. As I can see you're battling. However, once done, I intend to train your taijutsu personally. And have you become more acquainted with the newest entry to the Kenryoku."

A hand gestures towards Maya.* - Thu Sep 03 22:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged.

"It translates to 'Absolute Power'. . . Which is what I strive for. Power is the root of the group's goal. After all, without it, how can we bring the change I desire?"* - Thu Sep 03 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore no pity on his face. He cared little of Kronos' demise, and honestly -praised- Kitora for the fact.

"Shame. I realize your attachment. . . Although, I don't quite understand it. Your 'lover' was a fool. He was no hero. . . He was -villain-. No matter how badly he sought to be seen that way. The male left your home village. . . which was crucified in his actions. He works for the same people that are responsible for placing Sunagakure in the rut it's in now," Zetsumo scolds, ripping the Sand Manipulator's legacy to death.

"Simply hold rejoice that it was Kitora that struck the blow. I had intended to have him captured. . ." the fiend continued, still speaking in a cold, calculated tone. He held great affection for the taijutsu specialist. . . Dissida Paine. Yet would never approve of her attachment of his enemies.

That was just one less person he had to worry about, and it certainly took away any chance of desertion of Paine's behalf -- Suddenly, the kenryoku leader fell silent. You can tell from the look on his eyes, he's growing intrigue, and certainly recognizes Paine's amazing leaps in strength and ability. To think, this was once the scared kitten that came looking for assistance in obtaining greater strenngth.* - Thu Sep 03 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

He turns, and motions the girl forward with the flick of a hand. "Come."* - Thu Sep 03 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) slid his feet along the road.

He seemed to move at a snail's pace as his body swayed along the area. In about fifteen minutes, Zetsumo -- with Maya in tow -- would arrive at the local restaurant. It was one of the more prominent diners in the restaurant. And the second the lad had stepped in. . .All the customers clear out. Whether out of fear of his volatile nature, or simply unable to look at his odd physiology.

Eventually, the brute moved towards the right, and motions for Maya to take a seat.

"Right then. As I've said. . . the medical ninjutsu will have to wait for a bit. It should take more than a day. . . three at the most, for me to be able to supply you with heaps of differing medical ninjuutsu scrolls. In the meantime, you and I. . . We will chat. Order what you like, anything. ."

He says, snapping a finger at the same time. A shaking employee comes rushing forward, and avoids eye contact. "Get me my usual. And get her whatever she desires." With that order given, the stoic Zombie Warrior shifts his gaze, awaiting a response.* - Thu Sep 03 23:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow the second Maya had began speaking. He had expected anger.. . Frustrations that in all of this time, there had yet been an advancement in medical ninjutsu.

". . .Color me impressed. . ." Zetsumo comments, particularly towards her less combative personality. He actually quite enjoyed the change in personality, as it no longer compromised how his other members would look -- after all, smacking Maya around was futile. She would still be just as haughty and abrasive as before. In fact, doing so just made the kunoichi even more frustrated.

Before long, the waiter scurries off, granting the two some time to chat. 

"You're a lot more calm than before. I suppose with age comes maturity and wisdom. Now then. . . I recall, when we last were near each other, I aimed to get insight on your life. I will do so again. In all this time, have you any significant goals? Things you wish to acheive in life -- as I'll perhaps be able to be of assistance. Everyone who works for me thus far, is gaining something from this. I'd suppose you are too. Lest you really just felt compelled to serve me," the stitch-riddled male said with a shrug.

"That works as well." 

By now, the food is brewing as the employees of the restaurant hurriedly manuever to sate the customers' desires. * - Fri Sep 04 00:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had of course flicked his pupils up and down, allowing his gaze to thoroughly take in all of the significant changes in Maya's form. It was a bit surprising, he hadn't expected her to develop any further.

Nevertheless, Zetsumo had remained quiet, listening in on the girl's delightfully polite tone of voice. "I can't tell. . . If she's just pretending or not. Regardless. . .I'll take what I'm given," the male pondered to himself. The second she established eye contact, his gaze shifted away, as it honestly did feel as if she was peering directly towards his soul.

That damage, ethereal embodiment of his emotions -- and an area he would allow no one to get close. After all, deep behind that hardened carcass or shell he called a body, there actually was a human locked underneath. And that humanity was something Zetsumo had no intention on allowing to be displayed. He huffs, and replies to the agree-able response. "Then I suppose I will aid you in that endeavor. To becoming the greatest medical shinobi in the world -- though you have competition. My sister, as you would know, has been steadily improving. She goes beyond the typical medical skills. . . Such as healing. Nay, Zenaki has gone on to create significant poisons, and pills. You could learn a thing or two from her," the male brags -- though with the intention of belittling the senju. 

Rather, it was just his innate proudness that Zenaki had actually developed into someone worth knowing. On cue, the meal is supplied. Maya's dish is delivered, and Zetsumo's own order is set onto the table. For reference, it's two bowls of ramen, three servings of dumplings, and of course one bottle of sake.

"Right on cue."
* - Fri Sep 04 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) casually, he takes the chopsticks, and proceeds to dip it into his own bowl. Noodles are spunt around, forcing their flexible nature to become coiled around it's frame. 

Eventually, the chopsticks allow the steaming dish to be placed into his mouth. Casually, the shinobi chews, allowing the soften pasta to be easily devoured and swallowed. He hums, looking forward to the beaut with a nod. "Precisely. You are a great asset in that regards, and it's nice to have a personal medic about -- even I can't recover from all damage," the male notes. He looks over to the arriving Paine, and gives a bop of the head.

"Evening. . .Paine. I'd like you to greet an old acquaintance, Maya." Zetsumo's stitch covered hand motions forward, directing his gaze back to the obvious topic of discussion. 

"THat's all I'd ask. I don't expect you to shoulder the load in terms of combat. I simply want you to remain support. Albeit. . . If you have any other directions or responsibilities, it can be discussed." He falls silent, and takes a sip of sake afterwards.* - Fri Sep 04 01:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"Some are a bit fiesty, yes."* - Fri Sep 04 01:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps against the table. He looks on, curiously. 

"And hrm. .. Perhaps I will explain the true nature of my organization," Zetsumo teases. After all, up to this point,. hardly anyone -- not even Beth -- knew precisely why he went through such great length to gather forces. Simple acts of terrorism certainly wasn't his motivation.* - Fri Sep 04 01:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze from Paine and back to Maya. 

He gives an interchangeable glance to each them, repeatily as if in debate. Could they be trusted with the information? Although. . . Even in the case of one of them squealing, would the other villages be able to take advantage of such information? Likely not.

After all, knowing what was intended had no barings on actually stopping the tyrant from enacting his plans. "As you wish. I suppose it -is- about time I gave some insight on my goal. Before i begin. . .I will ask you this. Do you ever tire of the senseless warring between states? The consistent turmoil spawned by politics. . ." began the often troubled soul. He pauses, adding suspense and gauging the reaction from both parties. On the inside, there's still a debate, a cry not to dispel any of the information. . . Yet there is another part of Zetsumo that legitimately wishes to see just how the duo would respond.

"A place devoid of the restraint by those who pretend that they have the best interest for society. . . This is where my ambition comes in. I wish to strip the world of this. . . facade that runs rampant. No one civilization is truly decent or 'just'. THey're all just ran by pigs or slimeballs who piggy-backs off the work of those with lower social status. And certainly. . . I have no problem with those with stronger abilities ruling over the weak. Yet I figure. . . Why not place everyone on equal terms?"

He'd pause every now and then, taking bites out of his deliciously and expertly crafted meal. You can tell, just simply thinking of the words spewing from his mouth left Zetsumo in higher spirits. This was something the brute remained heavily devouted too. And he'd stop at nothing to realize his dream.

". . .To save yourself more of my monolouging. The name of the game is simple. 'Anarchy.' Complete and utter annihilation of all governing parties. Yet even when accomplished. . .I will need to invoke some degree of hypocrsy. . . To continue to ensure that the world does not revert to the current system. It will be the Kenryoku that remains existent to ensure that things remain as I see it fit. We will live lavish lives, and be up-holders of the natural order. . ." Having finally revealed the true intent of the Kenryoku, Zetsumo quiets.

He's leisurely sipping away, wondering just how the two women would react. Hopefully it was something worth while.* - Fri Sep 04 02:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Therei s a plate infront of Paine. .

But it's Zetsumo's.* - Fri Sep 04 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrowed his gaze. 

". . .Mmm. You think I would go to such lengths just to fuel my own ego? I am said to be quite humble," the ego-maniac declares. His gaze shifts on over to the purple-haired teen that saw it fit to help herself to his food. Dumplings to be specific. One is completely consumed, leaving a moist stick behind. Another is half-eatened, three more are untouched.

". . . .And what. . .Are you doing? I don't recall offering you my meal."

Did he care in all honesty? No. But it was always worth while to give people a hardtime.* - Fri Sep 04 02:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tapped his fingers along the table once more as a sign of irritation. "Do you know. . . " Zetsumo's brow furrowed, yet he isn't quite in the mood to lash out.

His gaze manuevers back to Maya.

"Right. Certainly. . . This is a goal you can honestly get behind. . . right? After all. I'msure you would take pleasure in having some sort of power and flexibility in a new world order," he stares on pensively, as if trying to decipher some ulterior motive.

Was all she really wanted was to be the greatest medical shinobi?* - Fri Sep 04 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged.

He hadn't expected Paine to understand the goals. "Not quite. I don't wish for peace. I wish for 'anaracy.' Could it lead to such? Mayhaps. I will simply allow nature to decide," the brute declares while still unhurriedly taking a few bites out of his meal.

"As for the other two. . You are getting exceptionally quiet. Is fatigue setting in?"* - Fri Sep 04 02:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) refers to the 'survival of the fittest.'

"I simply gave her reasons why my actions were necessary to achieve such a state."* - Fri Sep 04 02:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged.

He had expected a more animated response -- from all three of the individuals. Yet so long as there was no discontent, Zetsumo remained in a decent mood. "Glad that we're all on the same page. . . Why are you eating as if you've been starved for days?"

It was a change of pace from how the woman normally ate. * - Fri Sep 04 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilts his head.

"Although Sunagakure did have an intriguing looking interior. I will enjoy going there after conquering the place.."* - Fri Sep 04 03:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) seems irritated.

"Paine. Line up with Katsune. This is going a team effort. It'll be great for actually getting some damn coordination, as well as bettering your abilities with your techniques," he snaps, and points towards the loli of a teenager. 

Assuming compliance, his eyes settle onto both of the warriors, ready to engage both of them.

"To make this fair. I will hold off from the elemental techniques. At least. . . I won't use them with too much power."* - Fri Sep 04 04:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead.

"I give you all the option to make the first move. Once I get going. . .I tend to have some difficulty stopping," he notes. Zetsumo remained standing in an erect fashion, his back up right, and nose held up high as if he were royalty.

"Come now. I don't have all day."* - Fri Sep 04 04:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wasted no time whatsoever.

The second Katsune had flickered ahead, Zetsumo's body was on the move. For someone that could legitimately be seen as well. . . A human-sized nuke, he seemed to be quiet dexterious. His frame danced just out of range for the lightning ball, and seamlessly, the warrior is on the move. 

His target? Katsune herself. As she was the clear weaker opponent in terms of hand to hand combat. 

Assuming success, his right forearm juts ahead. It seems to be on path towards her throat, all with the intent of winding her. ". . .Mmm. Let's see if you're as fragile as you look."* - Fri Sep 04 04:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Interesting. . ." The Male hummed. An exceptional perk to being Zetsumo was that he could often get away with pure wrecklessness. The exploding palm would make contact  with his forearm, forming a combustion that certainy could harm flesh . . .! Hell, against someone of Zetsumo's strange origin, it does even more.

The stretchy fabric from his Jounin suit had been reduced to shreds, and the heated and unstable nature of the explosion rips through flesh, and forces some of the stitches to be undone. Indeed, quite briefly, Katsune would have gotten a glimpse of the man's strange insides. . . WHich was mostly just organic 'cloth.'

"Very interesting indeed! Where has this skill been hiding?!" The male declares. Those threads from the opening react, however, and like parasites shoot from the area. It aims to target both Katsune's mouth and neck, coiling around the later in the event of success. As a note, he still only had one good eye, which made his left side particularly blind -- at least in terms  of peripheral vision. Thus, as this is going on, he's glancing,  to ensure that Paine isn't catching him slipping.* - Fri Sep 04 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Once the clothesline had been completed, he takes a step back.* - Fri Sep 04 07:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. It would seem Katsune passed out from exhaustion?

"How boring. . . I was just getting excited.."* - Fri Sep 04 08:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The leg sweep would have clipped him. But it doesn't  quite do the trick in toppling over. At the last second, he had leapt up, narrowly avoiding a collision.* - Fri Sep 04 08:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . .Hng. Your Taijutsu. . . It's come a long way since we've last battle. No longer are you the rookie. . . the weak Paine that came to me so long ago. It is certain that I must admit, you are my superior in close-ranged combat. No ifs, ands, or buts," Zetsumo notes admist the first combo. Considering the closeness, he's unable to avoid, and thus defends in the only way he knows how --- Domu.

His side hardens, at the expense of chakra depletion. Once Paine's kick had met his frame, she would note little damage is done, even with the application of her refined Taijutsu Technique. "--- But you have to fcome a little harder than that, 'Hun'," declared the fiend. He speaks in a condescending manner as always to invoke the ire of his the opponent, and perhaps grant her with additional motivation. In addition, the kick doesn't even force him to budge.

With three seals, there's a quick burst of wind, to force Paine's body off of him. If stroke, the vortex of course sends her skidding away and grants Zetsumo with room to breath.* - Fri Sep 04 09:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . .!?" He had never seen anything like it. The kick was swift -- so fast the imagery of her leg was a damn near after thought. With the exceptional taijutsu technique, Paine's leg was a literal blur, and could not be tracked. In this moment of desperation, Zetsumo acts on the last second. A single seal is formed, forcing the mud and water around the ground to take form. 

Immediately, the ground shifts and a wave of mud comes, hopping to overtake the woman and send her skidding. Likwsie, assuming success, the warrior is quick to follow up.

Four more handsigns completed later, and another gale sweeps the region, hoping to push the Dissida further back. ". . . My. Color me impressed."* - Fri Sep 04 09:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) smirked. He was growing more and more intrigued. Once Paine had moved in close, three small handsigns are done. Thus, chakra is built up and heated to the brink of being overheated.

Likewise, in conjunction with the chakra built up, oxygen is brought inward. Without a second thought, Zetsumo is exhaling, releasing a series of fireballs, no large r than a simple volleyball. They move with surprising quickness, and are manipulated airbourne. Of course, coonsidering the nature of the attack, bi collision is particularly damagign. The question remained. .  . Could the taijutsu specialist evade?

If not, the build up of repeated damaging coul.d wear her out.* - Fri Sep 04 10:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Dissipating a single flame was remarkable. . . Yet again and again, more miniture spheres sped out, rushing up until they're ready to completely and utterly overwhelm the woman. In the event that Paine sought to simply endure for a chance to strike? Then quite a bit praise was to be delivered. Sadly, even with praise, the beast does not relent.

At once, threads speed over, first aiming to latch around the girl's legs, then waist. If successful, perhaps Zetsumo can stop the momentum before it can even be built up to significance. ASsuming success, the brute wastes little time, an arrogantly begins to boast. "You're good, Paine. But the teacher has yet to surpass the master -- I am still superior!" Declared the Kenryoku leader -- he's legitimately exhausted too. It seemed Paine's rapid increase in skill had forced the superior combatant to expend an unnecesarrily high amount of stamina in response.

Hopefully all went well. "Let's stop. . . I am growing fatigued."* - Fri Sep 04 11:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The threaded nature of his attack seem to have little effect on the girl's wide-array of kicks. "Mmm. . . i should try a little harder. .. " drawled Zetsumo. Instictively, his Jiongu Threads speed ahead, aiming to swat at Paine's waist, and provide just a moment to think. Assuming a direct hit, the shinobi kicks off the ground, and goes speeding towards the west -- away from the exceptionally skilled taijutsu specialist. The floor itself remained layered in mud, and thus granted him the pre-requisite for his latest attack. .. The almighty, Earth Dragon Bomb!

With three short handsigns, the ground ruptures and begins to grow more animiated. Indeed, a dragon-like shape forms from the thick mud, and from it's mouth comes cannon-esque bullets of muddy earth. He fires repeatily, unleashing about seven shots, one after the other, and each time adjust for where ever his target may manuever. As they fire, the warrior is again taking steps back, to further provide distance. . . Fighting in close-quarters was not going to be advantagous, that's for sure.

Meanwhile, two women had crept up. "Glad to see you've both awakened. . . Maya and Kitora. For the latter. . . It is good to see that you've kept your collar on. Fantastic. . .I would have been thoroughly upset otherwise," warned the brute. His focus never leaves Paine, nevertheless.* - Fri Sep 04 11:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Hng. .. I really need -- No.This is good for her development," the male muttered to himself in aggitation. She was certainly making him go the distance with this spar, an d seemed to never run out of creative ideas to continuously come at him. Before he knew it, the mud bullets themselves had proven futile, and without a doubt, she wascoming in. . 'Dynamic entry. . . Really?" He seemed baffled that such a simple technique eventually proved to be significant or useful.

Then again. . .Domu is relied on.

Boom! With a thud, she would find his body being encased in hardened rock, and again resistant to all forms of damage. "Shame. . .You have all the skill and ambition. Yet you lack power. . .My defense seems to be absolute. Thus you must find offense that is even more absolute," the crook says with a devious grin. No time at all is wasted, and threads coil, wrapping around Paine's ankles.

Quickly, she's taken for a spin, and her body literally dragged along the muddied floor. After a few revolution, the threads let go, allowing Dissida's frame to slide along the pavement. Meanwhile. . . female problems.

"Quit all the talk, Kitora. You spawn unnecessary animosity. . .Likewise, it's clear. Like the dog that I've made you, you're all bark, no bite," he said with a shit-eating grin. * - Fri Sep 04 12:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
On this occasion, his arm moved, reaching to block the kick! Indeed, even with the momentum delivered, Zetsumo's body is enabled to endure the power. He grunted, nevertheless and took steps back, still panting due to the exhaustion that existed.

". . .Tired? I can feel it. . You're on your last leg. One more pick, and you're out of gas. . ."

He remained in a defensive position, seeing if the girl really had any more spunk left. Meanwhile, Kitora keeps blabbering, much to his dismay. ". . .I don't see how that contradicts what I've said? You're just agreeing. Quit irritating me, woman. Before I take you for a very uncomfortable walk around the park," the brute threatens. * - Fri Sep 04 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And so that would settle it. 

He looked on, with arms folded, and well aware of the fact that his opponent may have enough vitality for one more strike. ". . .Hrm. You've done well, take a break, Paine. This training session is adjourned," the male replies inbetween pants. It's clear he's feeling the effects of exhaustion just as badly as Paine. 

Each arriving individual is taken note of, and even acknowledged. "Glad for you all to join us. Seems the bulk of the gang is all here -- even Zenaki's toy. Honestly. . . I thought she'd be dead by now."* - Fri Sep 04 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Suddenly, energy is being poured back into his body. 

"Mmm. As useful as ever," Zetsumo notes. Quickly, he loses the obvious symptoms of fatigue. He takes a glance towards Kitora, although he doesn't seem to register has a threat at all. 

"In anycase. My training for today is finished -- have you all done daily training exercises as well?"* - Fri Sep 04 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. 

He turns to face Beth. "What is it? Hope it isn't something that will take a while. I intend to send you all on a mission."* - Fri Sep 04 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"That can wait. I want you all to send a delivery to one of Amegakure's outpost. West of this village. Send a message in regards to an explosion that occured days ago, and let them know the one known as 'Chiyari' or any other Sunagakure's shinobi are responsible. Likewise, collect any evidence that is left behind, the attack. Once done, return back for your reward and payment," Zetsumo speaks calmly. It was a simple mission.

He looks towards a trio. "Beth. . .Kitora, and Yumiko. You three will be tasked with the job."* - Fri Sep 04 14:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. The mission is postponed. . . as each of the proposed travelers had all but exited. 

"Mmmm. I suppose there is a bit more downtime. Likewise. . .Kitora, why does it seem to be you always picking fights with my underlings?" He seemed irk, and motions downward, suggesting that she get back into position.* - Fri Sep 04 15:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"I had intended to send a few of you on missions. Yet it would seem that my group suffers from exhaustion and busy-ness. In the meantime, we will simply linger and enjoy life. Today may very well be our last, I intend to launch another assault. THis time on our neighbors -- Kumogakure. It is time Amegakure begins to make moves. . . I won't allow the forces to waste away any longer," the shinobi mutters.

His motioning for Kitora to get onto all four ceases -- as the girl seems to have gotten some sense in the last few minutes.

". . .Mmm. I am all for violence. But if your only source of entertainment is petty arguing. . . You must re-evaluate your living style. I will grant you two the opportunity as you all are the only ones to remain conscious. WHat is it that you wish to do? It may be anything. . . I am feeling charitable," the male replies in his typically lazy yet charismatic tone of voice.* - Fri Sep 04 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) poofs into the area, as if irritated.

He looks on to the trio that seemed to loiter about lazily. Do they really do nothing when he doesn't order it? "Oi. What's going on here..?" Inquired Zetsumo. He's leaning against tree, and moving his head in a swivel. 

"You all really need to. . . Learn to be productive when i'm not over your shoulder."* - Fri Sep 04 19:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) . . .looked around.

"What does 'Hrm' means. . .?"* - Fri Sep 04 19:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. He motions downward.

"Come. . " THere are no other words stated. Lazily, his feet again drags along the ground as the warrior moves towards the next destination.* - Fri Sep 04 19:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have poofed into the area.

It was a well-kept portion of the interior forested. Trees encircled the region thickly, making intrusion all the more difficult. The water in the center seemed to be coming from some underground fountain of sorts.The liquids itself continued to boil, and were of moderate temperatures, something that Zetsumo could easily change.

"Right. Your new position of life is. . . delightful to say the least. Yet you are bore. . . I dislike bores. Lack of activity makes me restless, and when I get restless, I seek violence to appease my desire for entertainment," he replies casually as they approach the river. THe fencing area has a door constructed, blocking off the path -- although it is easily removable.

Likewise, his hand falls into a seal, building up necessary energy for Katon release.* - Fri Sep 04 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) allows the Katon energy to subside. He exhales, defeated.

The woman was bored. . . Yet she refused to do anything. "Fine. Read," the fiend states, taking a seat and allowing his feet to dangle into the water. His ear flickers, once the Nara had approached the area.

"Oi. How well did the mission go?"* - Fri Sep 04 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) motions towards the water.* - Fri Sep 04 20:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow. He hadn't expected the girl to quite literally strip naked, though says nothing on the matter. 

"Hrm? No..  .Why would I do that? You've yet to irritate me upon coming back from the mission. ." He looks towards the medic at his right, wondering at how bemused she'd be at witnessing the Nara literally just nonchalantly bare her body to the world.

After that brief gander, Zetsumo turns back, releasing Katon might into the small body of water. It forces the liquid to heat up, and gain an all-too-soothing sensation, perhaps placing the body at ease, A make-shift hot tub.* - Fri Sep 04 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Right. . ." Zetsumo states calmly in response to Kitora's apparent happiness. His feet continue to dangle, and for the moment, the male's eyes just trace along the water and occasionally glance towards the nude kunoichi enjoying leisurely time within the artificial hotsprings. 

"I suppose this can also be seen as a reward.For slaying the Sand Menace," Zetsumo referencesKronos -- what a pain that guy was.

"Maya. You haven't said a word. . .I speak not to harrass you, but simply because I don't want you to grow so dis-interested with the ongoings that you grow detached," he murmurs, still taking note that the Senju wasn't really doing anything. Of course she'd be bored. There's even an offer to provide her with the reading material.* - Fri Sep 04 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) hadn't been acting any different.

People change in five years. . .And in these five-years, Zetsumo learned to ease-up over time. Now? He wouldn't be so overbearing. . . Rather, there would only be punishment when you were outright insubordinate. Like Kitora. . . Don't think I forgot.

Then in came Beth.

"Hrm? I don't recall what you refer to, Beth. Speak again. . . Explain what is it you intend to do once more?"* - Fri Sep 04 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked as Beth went off. "She's going to go use a bird or something," he comments before at last standing. 

"Kitora. That's enough, but your clothes on. Let's find Osamu. . . After all, there was still a mission failure. And that invokes punishment," the shinobi states. He begins walking south, while granting Maya the opportunity to follow -- whether she did twas up to her. "I suppose I'll let you get to your reading?" The kunoichi had been pretty lifeless, thus it was a safe assumption she just wanted to relax for a bit.

Assuming no interferance, the shinobi moves away towards the south in search of that damned Uzumaki.* - Fri Sep 04 21:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) hits Kitora up with that wind. To dry off the water.* - Fri Sep 04 22:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Quickly, he opts to just bring Maya along for the ride. His arms move to sweep her off her feet. Assuming no protest, the brute speeds on over to the mansion.* - Fri Sep 04 22:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks on ahead to the arriving duo.

"Right. This is about the failed mission. As I've stated. Failed contracts result in punishment. . . I will grant you all the opportunity, as it brings me great pleasure. Tell me, what do you feel the punishment should be? Joke answers will just make things worse," the Kenryoku leader declares.* - Fri Sep 04 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"The collar. . .Leash, and the dog-ears I'll get for you is for an unrelated punishment. You sitll must pay for the failure of the mission. . .As must Osamu."

On cue, he flicks his eyes towards the Uzumaki, and gains a devious grin.

"It will induce physical pain, yes. .. Tell me, boy. Are you a learned man? If so, I would assume you are familiar with the 'Tale of Sisyphus.' I want you to manually roll a boulder up a hill -- that I will create. Each time you reach the top of the hill. . . You begin anew. Each time you fail to reach the top of the mountain and thus allow the boulder to fall premature, that's ten minutes tacted on. And continue to do so for the next hour or two. . . The time based solely on how entertained I am. . . " He says with a grin. 

A hand calls for Amegakure-born aides, who move to be in place to escort the Fuuinjutsu-minded shinobi to the proper area. Which was just outside the mansion.

Afterwards, his eyes shift on over to Kitora. "As for you, I intend to have you remain an upside down position. It'll be on a monkey-bar set. Your arms will have heavy buckets of water attached to them, thus weighing you down. The goal? To remain in that position for half an hour to an hour. Don't spill a drop or you begin anew." He felt this was a lighter punishment and appropriate considering it was Osamu that had gotten captured, not here.* - Fri Sep 04 22:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Once the punishments had been dealt. 

His eyes flick to the side, andthere's amused grin. "While we're on the case. . . I believe I heard news of you declaring yourself able to defeat me in single combat. . . Maya?" * - Fri Sep 04 22:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's hand rises, and he motions for both Kitora and Osamu to move towards the side. "Step forth and speak. I am certain this has to do with my assault of Sunagakure -- Indeed. . . I have much to say to you as well," Zetsumo muttered.

Of course, despite placing these two on punishment, both were deemed trusted parties, thus he allows them to remain in the room.* - Fri Sep 04 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Not his side nub. TO the side of the wall.* - Fri Sep 04 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He has carefully tucked away the fifty mill in an unreachable bank.* - Fri Sep 04 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) catches the bundle of cash.

Two-millions, it brings a slight smile to his face. Seconds later, that same bundle is pocketed, and Zetsumo's visage quickly focuses back onto the ANBU Agent. 

"Right then. In general. . . I'm sure we will be able to reach an agreement. Sunagakure will be your's for certain. . . Just remain out of Amegakure's and the Kenryoku's affairs. Likewise, me and the rest of my ensemble will have the luxury of traveling to and from Sunagakure at our leisure. From this point in time, till the eventual capture, there may be additions, but these are my main concerns. Likewise. . . speak little of our relation to one another," the shinobi speaks in a calmed, yet articulate manner. 

He pauses, allowing his thoughts to be gathered.

"Other than that. . . Give your demands, in terms of how much aid you need. Considering your stake on the nation's army, I won't need to provide Amegakure forces. Yet. . . I am willing to lend the Kenryoku's power in your endeavors."* - Fri Sep 04 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives a speical pigeon and shit.

"Use this to contact me."* - Fri Sep 04 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) whispers: Tell me about your childhood Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 04 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Hrm. . .? It's a long story. - Fri Sep 04 23:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) whispers: We have nothing but time. - Fri Sep 04 23:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Hrm. . .-- One sec. - Fri Sep 04 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) figures now is an opportune time to speak. In the distance, assistants rushed about, gathering his supplies as Zetsumo was eventually preparing for his Gezo Empire hosted -- Sergeant Exams.

"Mmm. My childhood was simple," noted the oft emotionless entity. 

Already, he was drifting into thought. The nostalgia forces him to romanticize the past out of prue instict, although another reasoning for his embellished was simply because the past held better days. "I grew up in medium-sized family. I had three sisters, one brother. Two loving parents. In my youth, I was. . . A lot different. I was. . .Mmm, more lively and energetic. I was the second oldest out of the children, though most mature. . .So I kinda looked after everyone," the male explains with a shrug.

"Uh. . .To avoid a senselessly long story. I will say that I followed my father's career choice -- and went to be a shinobi. For reference, my mother wasn't a shinobi, but she held medical ability. Regardless. . . With enough time in the business, I suffered losses. This is what made me into the man I am today."

That was an exceptionally brief summary of his life -- as he didn't feel comfortable in giving all the details. Or rather, wasn't willing to get too indepth in the painful memories that had forcibly stripped him of every ounce of humanity that lingered in the soul.* - Fri Sep 04 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) taps his fingers in irritation along the table.

".. . Mmm. Difficult question. I guess not? Although don't take that as you having any sort of leverage over me," he says, perhaps warning Maya. The reason he'd let it be known that all Kenryoku members were expend-able was simply to ensure that none ever grew too cozy or confident.* - Sat Sep 05 00:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) flicks his gaze over. His hand slides over, and aims to make a move onto Maya's rear.

"Perhaps then, I will select a queen." Each word is spoken with little emotion, making it hard to discern his true intent. Was he just gauging a reaction?* - Sat Sep 05 00:32:12 2015

"You likely paid little attention in my --- I have no need for an additional spawn. I have yet to see if my current son is worth my time. . . Hell, if he's even worth living," he replies sharply. His voice seems to be defensive. . .Then it calms.

"Regardless. . . It would be an honor to be my 'Baby Mama'. . .As you would say. I am Zetsumo. . . The 'God of War'. . .The single most terrifying force in all the lands." Arrogance was oozing in abundance.* - Sat Sep 05 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grinned. He had expected such.

"I can smell it. You are disappointed. Although it matters little. . . She has good genes. And my child will prosper from it -- Or die. One or the other. I hope option one is the case, lest I have to reproduce once more."

It's obvious Zetsumo held a very cynical view on reproduction. To him, it was not something made due to a bond. But rather. . . business. To produce stronger humans.* - Sat Sep 05 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) motions towards one of the rooms to the right. 

"You can sleep in one of the rooms there."* - Sat Sep 05 01:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perks a brow.

Where did that come from? He looks ahead, with curious eyes. "And what is eating away at you?"* - Sat Sep 05 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives the go ahead for Maya to go.

The assistants about are still getting the necessary provisions for Zetsumo's Gezo Exam. "When I return in a week. I should come baring gifts -- medical ninjutsu."* - Sat Sep 05 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) holds inside rage-- Oh. Hecalms himself.

"And why is that? And where do you live? I'd like to be able to find or see you when convenient," he notes.* - Sat Sep 05 01:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kicks off the ground. Via shunshin he closes the distance quickly, and rests a hand onto her shoulder.

"I suppose I will come walk you home at least."

Of course, the bird comes and delivers a message. In response, he sends a Suiton Clone out, along with  Doton Earth Grudge creature. They both move on over to the training fields.* - Sat Sep 05 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Indeed. After a short walk, they're in the general neighborhood. He folds his arms, curious.

"Oh. . . Yeah. I can't help but shake the feeling, something is eatin' at you. Just tell mee."* - Sat Sep 05 01:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arm.

Maya, despite being delightfully submissive to this point, still was difficult -- in her own ways.  "Tell me. If it is about the child, simply speak it. Believe me, you are not the only one that has .. . disapproved of the chosen mother," he replies, referencing the other people that had practically condemned him for daring to let Kitora give birth to his spawn.* - Sat Sep 05 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose. He shrugs in defeat.

"As you wish." THere would be no effort to stop her. At the very least, it had been ensured that Maya had returned home safely.* - Sat Sep 05 01:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have poofed into the area by now. He's remained behind the wolves, yet doesn't at all seemed alarm. 

"Hrm. . . Is this the big idea? A bunch of artificial wolves? You always come up with the oddest techniques, that's for sure. And here I was. . .figuring that it was important. . .  I suppose, however. That I -can- play with for just a bit. After all, this won't take much time at all," the shinobi boasts. Rather than simply assault the Mud Wolves in one go, Zetsumo looked on.

Chakra is pumping from all about, and it's clear he's not afraid of exercising his exceptional quantity of energy in order to swiftly place Kitora's grand scheme to rest. Electricity flares from his finger-tips. . The strategy was all too clear.

"On your mark."* - Sat Sep 05 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Quickly, the Suiton clone got into the mix of things.It's hands are swiftly moving through a small seal of seals, and suddenly water is gushing, drenching the muddied area. Once that's been handled, it directs attention, sending another vicious torrent of watery might. COnsidering this was Doton it had been going against. . . THe chances of it completely obliterating the structure was slim. . . But that wasn't the point at all.

Instead, it leads for a follow up.

"Ninja Art. . . Jibashi no Jutsu!" The electricity form before flows out, and cascades about the area. In no time at all, the Riaton chakra mixes in with the Suiton, and forces a more destructive entity. If all goes according to plan, Kitora finds that the massive Earth Dragon is being reduced to rubble and being torn asundered. ". . .You always have nifty techniques. Yet you should know better than to even dare engage me in a elemental showdown. This is my strong suit, and an area that I simply cannot be beaten in."

Assuming the the Earth Dragon had been properly dealt with, Raiton continues to flow, and now runs along the ground. Previously. . . As you were alerted, the flooring itself had been overwhelmed with water, and thus it was now a perfect conduit for the Earth Flash technique. Quickly, lightning ran along and crackled onto the ground -- even destroying the exterior of the floor along the way. Indeed. From this point, a large bulk of the Mud Wolves would be subjected to being electrocuted, perhaps beyond repair.

"If memory serves me right. Raiton neutralizes Doton."* - Sat Sep 05 02:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Stupid move. . . I could end this right," Zetsumo notifies the woman with a grin. It would seem his trip to the Gezo Head Quarters would have to wait. Rather than outright overpowering her, more lightning is produced that move to counteract Kitora's own flow. A perfect counter-balance would be produced.

The clashing energies absolutely rip the ground to shreds,  and dazzles the area, unleashing a beautiful spectable of light-blue illumination. 

With high volumes, the wind literally screeches, and twitches until it at last comes to an end. ". . .If I wanted. I could have simply used your power to my advantage. . .Or are you that completely ignorant to elemental natures and their reactions to one another?" Miliseconds after the comment, he's kicking off, and thrusts a hand ahead. Thick tendrils are screeching out and whip forward, aiming to give a nice strike towards the woman's ribs, and serve as a distraction just so he could close the distance.

At once, assuming no distraction, Zetsumo is upon her. A speedy right-handed chop is delivered, intent on crashing on the girl's ribs.* - Sat Sep 05 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Two could play that game. After forming the Snake handsign,

Quickly, Chakra is pumped throughout his body andflows into his cells. In a single moment, the Doton nature is enacted, allowing his body to take on a rock-like depositioning. It grows sturdy, and becomes practically unmovable. In response to the kick, Kitora would find her body bouncing off for the moment. . . ANd even while the explosive tag is viewed, he pays little attention and doesn't seem to register it as a threat.

Immediately, the brutes meaty hands rams downward, colliding against Kitora's stomach -- and honestly having enough power to break through. It would literally crack away the rock on the Nara's flesh on impact , and provide moderate damage. Along with the rock-shattering force, the momentum certainly holds potential to send Kitora's frame against the ground. Regardless of the outcome, the 'Snake' handsign once more is used as a crutch.

In no time at all, the mud from before is put to use, and aims to sweep the brashful girl away.* - Sat Sep 05 03:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sucked his teeth as Kitora managed to slip under the ground and avoid more of his assault. Patiently, he'd wait for the woman to resurface, and in no time at all she had reappeared. 

"Nice trick. . . " The clon e from before makes it's presence known, and rushes ahead. It's within a few meters before at last, two seals again conjure. The water within it's body is converted and fused with chakra, allowing for the doplleganger's cheek to swell up. It's akin to a frog crooking, or munching on food. Yet unlike the nature amphibians, as the clone releases, a giant, body-sized stream of liquid comes spewing outward, all with the intent on slamming against the woman's body ,and unleashing fierce concussive force.

Hit or miss, the assault beckons water to flood onto the water. . . Just where the mud had been formed before hand. As nature would have it, the two substances correspond, leading into Zetsumo's neck, simple-minded strike. For the umpteenth time, the elementalist formed the 'Snake' handsign, which inevitably gives life to an outburst of Doton energy. That same energy ingrains itself into the soaky, murky muds and forces a wave to sweep over the area. The point? To drench Kitora in additional mud, and of course have her body endure additional concussive damage.

Even with Domu, his ninjutsu prowess would be something to behold -- and definitely remained out of the woman's ability to endure, at least comfortable. "Come. . . Is this all the tricks you've managed to come up with? I'll admit. . . the first two were exciting, new. Yet after this, you've only disappointed."* - Sat Sep 05 03:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Intelligent. . .But wreckless all the same," He compliments then tears down. The evasion against the 'Earth Flash' technique is simple. As the lightning is coming along the ground, Zetsumo hastily kicks off the floor and forces his body to migrate upward. THus, he is at no risk of being eletrocuted. Meanwhile, in the ascent, more handsigns are woven through, which of course gives an opportunity for another Katon technique.

Due to the risk of incinerating her, a less powerful technique is opted to be utilized. 

"Fire Style. . .! Phoenix Flower ninjutsu!" All too quickly, speedy flaming balls of destructions are sent flying from Zetsumo's maw. They move in a large pack, of easily two dozen and continue to devleop from his mouth in a rabid fashion to keep the assaunt consistently and all the more difficult to evade. In the event that Kitora had moved? The shinobi exercised his right to manipulate the projectiles as they're mid-air. This makes evasion all the more difficult, and certainly cements the Zombie's protection. Hopefully at least.

While held back, the attack can certainly leaves light burns, and perhaps scorch through clothes.

* - Sat Sep 05 04:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) simply lands.

He wears a giant smile, and taps onto the ground. Clearly, the vibrations run along the earth, and give a tell-tell signal of all that went on underground. ". . .Hrm. I feel two rocks. . . -- And a Kitora. Although with how hard-headed you are, I suppose you register as a rock anyway?" Clear taunts. 

Demonic grins reverberate around the area, as the once fierce spar descended into a simple fame of cat and mouse.  He doesn't move a muscle. "Here, doggy. Come. . . Hiding isn't fun."* - Sat Sep 05 04:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Mm. . I am just too versatile for you. . " Opting not to do the same, tired old plan, his hands quickly flicker, forming a completely unique set of handsigns. On completion, Zetsumo exhales, secrating thick, black gases into the area. It meets with the approaching Dragon, and of course, like any smart person.. . the shinobi is stepping away. . .! Quickly at that. 

The second the unstable gas is settling in, another three-set of handsigns are completed, each just as fast as the other. Seconds later, flames are being produced, and is spiralling at the gaseous material with a sense of purpose. In no time at all, oncet he flame had been in contact with the burning ash, it combusts, releasing a massive explosion of chaotic fury. The combustion certainly packs quite a bit of power, enough to reduce the Earth Dragon into rubble. 

The sheer strength forces an aftershock, that prompts gusts to develop and perhaps throw people off course.* - Sat Sep 05 04:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whistles. 

He makes his approach. "Are you done? Did better than I had expected."* - Sat Sep 05 04:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Have Zenaki try to craft better ones then. Anyway. Are we done here? Where is your collar?" He whistles, gesturing her forward like a pup.* - Sat Sep 05 05:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stood placid.  It wasn't often that the young shinobi hailing from Amegakure ever spoke to him. "Evenin. ." A short and simple response. Zetsumo's gaze falls onto Sasume. It's an expectant look, did this kid want something?* - Sat Sep 05 05:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
For now. Assume Zetsumo is not here. ICly, he's been out for about a week.* - Sat Sep 05 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The proper measures were being prepared for hours on end. For his endeavors to become a full fledged, Gezo-certified Sergeant, heaps upon heaps of supplies were given. In this effort, a large sum of Amegakure's resourced had been consumed. It was utilized to craft loads of weapons (including explosive tags), ration/soldier pills, and of course scrolls. Each of the scrolls were loaded with different supplies, and were tricked out to be unleashed in particular ways.

"Mmm. . .I suppose it is time that I make my way. An escourt should be here soon to deliver me to the exam's sight. Take care in my time away." No time is wasted, and the somewhat lithe figure has stood. Zetsumo's body swiftly moves ahead, exitting the door and continuing with those quick strides. It isn't long before he's at the front gate, where large, and weaponized caravans are around in abundance.

Hundreds of other denizens were gathered around, with some actually entering the caravans themselves. It seemed not only the defacto Hokage had enough courage to take on the oft deadly and dangerous Private/Sergeant examination. Through this all, the male was in calm spirits. He walked with confidence, and a swagger that -made- others believe in him just due the aura that exuded from his frame. "Mmm. . . So we're at it at last. Today is the day I will be recognized as a certified Gezo Sergeant. Funny enough. . . They likely won't like what I intend to do with the positioning."

With a leap, he;'s moving onto the caravan and taking a seat. His hands dabs at some blood in a vial, and after five seals a summoning technique is invoked. A small, duckling is perched on his shoulder. It's  a male with beady, blue eyes that seem to constantly roam the world. It takes quick ganders around, and serves as Zetsumo's first line of defense. If anyone dared to take advantage of his bad eye? THis little fella would call out the attack. It required little sleep.

And so, the long trip began. Even with the Gezo Empire having some of the most advanced pieces of technology in the world, they didn't seem to be capable of outright teleporting. Thus, Zetsumo boredly remains in the highly weaponized caravan, as it moved along the roads. It was a surreal-ly leisurely ride, with very few bumps on the road being reached. Hell, often times, the other passengers just outright ignored Zetsumo's presence as well, perhaps out of fear what he could do to them. 

The trip goes on for three days, before at last, the Gezo Headquarters had been reached. In this three day's timeframes, things weren't always as peacefulas depicted. Many of the passsengers often in-fighted, leading to a series of deaths before the destination had even been reached. Thankfully, the Psuedu-Hokage hadn't suffered even a single cut.  "Savages. . . I like it." A brief glance is given onto the area, where hundreds of body laid either on the ground, or lifelessly within the traveling caravan.

Finally, the vehicle came to a stop, and with a thud. 'Okay, guys. We are here...! Have fun runnin' to your deaths! I hope y'all managed to get life insurance, 'cause your family is going to need it!' The Caravan driver stated with a hearty, and unnerving chuckle. Indeed, he had likely seen this scene time and time again. Hundreds of arrogant warriors putting their lives on the line in order to achieve the dream of being a certified Gezo Empire Private. . . Or even more, a Sergeant! Many had tried, but most tended to fail in all honesty. THis fact was not at all hidden, as the tdriver continued to taunt.

Through this all, Zetsumo remained stoic. The confidence in his soul never once wavering. ". . . .Shame. I have no fear. . . As I have five lives." The Zombie warrior declared. The same swagger from before again is on display. He moves with zero fear or hesistance, and proceeded out of the caravan. There was sprinkles of blood on his suit by now, as all of the fighting had inadvertantly caused clothes to be become stained. 

Looking ahead, there's a massive, tower-like structure. It seems to stretch endlessly into the skies. On the outside, dozens of certified Sergeants are layered around, serving as the necessary muscle and protection. Some are stereotypically buff, yet other guards seem to be unintimidating. Usually, these secondary guards are small, chibi-esque women. Yet Zetsumo knew all too well, they tended to be the more powerful of opponents. Not just yet, the brute comes to a stop at the base of the mountain-like tower, and gives the infrastructure a brief gander.

'The 'God of War!' Hahaha. Don't let that title get to ya, punk. Just cause you run shit on the outside world don't mean you even worth lickin' up a boot to some of these Gezo Guys. We on an entirely different level!' One of the more buff guards heckles, aiming to get a rise out of the habitually angry Zetsumo. Sumo does not respond, thankfully enough. His eyes are just clsoed for a brief moment, and each of the heckling sounds prove to be drowned out.  Pit-pat, pit-pat. Int he distance, the rest of the group was finally arriving.

In all the excitement, it was apparent that the Jiongu Thread user had moved ahead. In no time, however, the guide was back at the front of the crew, and those that survived the trip remained to his rrear. "Well then! It's a good thing that you all have managed to join us! I wish you all the best. I want you all to break into two groups. Those that wish to take the Private Exams, and those that wish to take the Sergeant Exams!" With a nod, he moves to the east, allowing for the group division to go on without a hitch.

In no time at all, two massive bodies had been developed, and it's an odd sight to see just how easily each of these strangers had cooperated. 'Okay! Now. . . I want you all to break into even more groups. Those who are going to take the written exam. Go to the right -- of your respective group. Those with the intent on taking combat, move to the left," Susie -- the instructor -- directed. There's a bit of murmuring, yet in the end, each of those hopeful warriors had managed to do as instructed. Restless, the demon's eyes look ahead, awaiting further instruction.

THe set-up sequence would go on for about another hour, and those that were weak eventually caved, and surrendered before each of the exams had began. Why? Simply fear-tactics. A method by the Gezo Empire to rid those that honestly had no business being in their presence, and thus saving themselves a lot of time. "Finally. .. " At long last, Zetsumo was entering that damn dome. While the outside of the buildings appeared to be medieval-esque. The inside. . . The waiting room, even, were high-tech and certainly showed off just how advanced the World's government had grown.

Slowly, his feet allowedh is frame to manuever, and take a seat in the waiting room until at last.  After three hours, it was his go. Admist the three-hours wait, Zetsumo could easily see how many had failed -- miserably. Often times, dead bodies were being carted out. And those that didn't die? Suffered mental damage. Dozens of articulate gents returned from the failed outing muttering incohorently, as if someone had reached in and taken out a giant cut of their brain.

Then at last. . . Susie approaches him. "A Mister. . . . Zetsumo? It is your up. Zetsumo. . . Anyone with that--" the white-haired warrior flickered, stopping just behind the loli-esque tour guide. "That will be me. I am ready to unleash my rage at last. . " With a nod, Susie leads him off. They'd move through an elaborate set of stairs, and other contraptions before at last, they'd reach the desolate battle stage. This arena greatly mimicked Sunagakure's. The earth was grainy, and a held a sandy-like consistency. Likewise, the temperatures proved to be hotter than ever.

"Let me explain the --" Susie is quickly cut off by an anxious contestent. "I know the rules. I'm going to go through thirty enemies. Each with a different skillset. Defeating them all will grant me the title I desire. . . Then I will officially be done with this senseless progression. Soon then, my village prosper--" It's at this point that Susie would have poofed away, having o intent on listening to the gent's monologue. Quickly, the bells sound off, and the first opponent is rushing onto the scene.

And predictably. . . It's a gourd user. Spiky-haired, thin, and apparently a teenager. His locks were blackened, and his facial demeanor expressed seriousness at all times. "So this is my opponent? I've heard of ya. . . The infamous 'God Of War.' One of the most feared men in all of the lands --- Well. . . most feared in your lands. This is entirely new ball-park, boy," warned the obvious sand manipulator. Upon sensing more closely, you could feel a faint release of chakra from the sand all over, suggesting that perhaps this warrior -- Mako -- had already rigged the area.

In addition to this, underneath that, the ground was churning suggesting a premature development of ninjutsu. Regardless of this, Zetsumo seemed to mind little -- not that he could even sense this. ". . . Indeed. It would seem that to advance, your life must be forfeit. I hope you have little else you wish too accomplish in your pitiful existence. . ." His hands come together, forming a seal. Swoosh. . . Three hearts are tossed out, each layered in a thick gathering of threads. Eventually, the Jiongu Threads are manuevering, allowing themselves to take on a more humanoid appearance, and of course giving them full reign to function as their own entities.

".  .Because this is the end. You die here. It is necessary for your demise. . . As it will aid in my legacy!" If you thought one fighter was enough, now Zetsumo was surrounded by three of his Earth GRudge Creatures. One of the Lightning affinity, another of the Suiton, and of course, a third of the Wind Affinity. Arms folded, he looked ahead with a sickly grin. There hadn't been a soul in existence that could dare dream of taking him on. . . once these creatures were actually on the outside!

"Cute. . ." Mako drawls. He's still as arrogant as can be. "But this battle. . . Is already over! Ninja art. . . Sand Tsunami!" The build up of chakra from before was a simple preparation. It was clearly that the warrior had intended to end not only Zetsumo, but the rest of his Earth Grudge Creatures in one fell swoop. From the ground, a massive wave of sand particles clump together, and sweep over the area. All with the intention of ramming into the warrior's body, and of course crushing him into insignificance.

That. . . Was not going to be the outcome! In response to this all, the Lightning and Suiton heart came together. The thick, fleshy threads from before leaping onto the corresponding Earth Grudge Creature. Quickly, their bodies pull together, allowing their actions to become one -- and thus granting an additional  boost to power. On a constant pace, the creature's chakra were now apart of one grand chakra-circulatory  system. Thus, two techniques could be used at the same time, and create entirely new techniques -- which served as combinations.

". . Suiton-Raiton art! Great. . . Electromagnetic wave!" It doesn't take long for the technique to be unleashed with surprising effectiveness. A giant torrent of water comes speeding from the Mask(s)'s maw, all of which was now completely comprised of dangerous elecrtricity. It was like an over-sized fire hose, that collided against the Sand Tsunami itself. Each second of collision forces the electricity to deterioate and reduce the grains of sand into a powdery-like state. Likewise, with the simple pivot of the head, the range of the duo-assault could  easily be changed, thus allowing a large bulk of the attack to be rendered inert. 

In the destruction, as Mako attention had certainly been occupied, Zetsumo slips away, hiding intelligently underneath the ground. Meanwhile, the Wind Affinity'd Earth GRduge Creature unleashes a powerful gale of wind. It serves as a distraction, and literally forces Mako to spawn a half-assed same shield to defend. In that moment? The real Zetsumo had resurfaced. Thick threads pierces through the ground, and aim to poke a hole right through the Sand Manipulator's body.

". . .! When did he---! Doton Affinity too?!" The brute declared, now taking note that his opponent had in fact been a manipulator of at least four different nature types. Try as he might, additional sand rushes over to serve as a shield as well. Yet. . . It's all futile. THe strength of Zetsumo's Jiongu Threads prove to be too great, and easily, they manage to pierce through the defenses, pluinging right into Mako's heart. The male's body convulsed, and sadly his heart is ripped right on out. Blood splattered, and occasionally smeared the arriving party. 

Grinning, the male wipes away some of the crimson nectar that had splattered onto his face and wore a giant grin. Was this the extent that the Gezo had to offer? At this pace, Zetsumo only knew that this was going to be a walk in the park. Or at least, that's what he'd hope.  "Hrm. . .Easy. Bring on the next one."

Of course, due to being familiarized with the exam format, it's a known fact that he isn't going to be remaining in the same room. Towards the west the door flicks open, allowing for entry. With the Earth Grudge Monsters in tow, the gent moves on over, easily scalling pass the area and arriving in an entirely new region. This room was a complete and utterly shift in climate, much to his chargin -- and delight. 

Rather than being a desolate wasteland, mimicking the Land of  Wind. It took on a much more moist climate, not unlike that of Kirigakure. There was primarily water on the battle field, yet there also existed several islands-like structures so that he could have just a bit of land to take refuge on.  "Oi. . .This is going to be a pain," declared the behemoth. Quickly, the creatures from before being to quiver. Their insides were being manipulated until. . . !

Each gathering of threads again condensed, and swirled. They ball back up into a balll, and comes shooting back to his body. Each hole left in the male's frame is a 'doorway', allowing the hearts to speed back in, and of course sink back within his vast chakra circulatory system. In addition to the spike-up in chakra, this granted Zetsumo back three of his elemental affinities.  "Mmm. .. Show yourself! I don't have a lot of time for this! I must return to my village in a timely fashion. . . I am needed there!" He's barking, his voice booming around the relatively small room (by Gezo Standards.)

Yet there was no answer. THe room remained as silent as conceiveably possible, enough to the point where echos roamed the land. The water, as it usually does, roamed with tranquility, and served as the perfect cover for this particular enemy. By this point, the would-be Sergeant remains on the center-most landmass. His eye observantly looks around, as if seeking to locate the next opponent. Yet it's all for naught. in the end, the lad relents, and goes to utilize ninjutsu. 

With a single handsign, chakra speeds out, and takes ahold of the watery area. In no time at all, this once lifeless gathering of liquid proceeds to take form. It rises from it's resting point, clumping together up until a body can be formed. Unsurprisingly, the form taken mimicked Zetsumo's own to perfection. Making it apparent, this was a patent Suiton clone. More join the party, eventually making it so that three perfect dopplegangers now were lined around. Arms folded, they form the 'Manji' formation,  and thus cover every blind-spot. Save for the center point of the foursome.

"Come out. . . Come out. . . Where ever you are!" The Psuedo-Hokage continued to taunt, seemingly frustrated with the hiding attempt. Yet it mattered little. Whoever was the threat had no intent on revealing themselves just yet. Thus beginning with the waiting game. He stated put, looking around, and occasionally double-taking. There was instances where he -thought- he say something. Yet it ended up turning out to be a simple fish, or other aquatic lifeform.

Then it happened. "...!" Splash! All too quick, one of the clones had been taken out, and reduced back into a gathering of mud. Quickly, the shinobi is looking ahead, aiming to find just what had done this. . . Yet there wasn't a sign nor clue. ". . .Is this an invisiblility technique?---" SPlatter! A Katana is driven through one of Zetsumo's heart, and now remained layered in his sickly blood. . . .Or so the enemy thought.

Poof! Smoke comes up into the area, and soon enough, Zetsumo's place is shifted. With? One of the clones itself. Instead of landing a critical hit, the would-be opponent simply gets himself wet as the Suiton clone deteriorated. Now? His location was clearly on view. . . And it was a strange one to say the least. The second opponent in the Gezo-hosted exam held blue skin, had shark-like teeths. . . and even gills. "Huh. . . And i thought I looked demonic. You win the prize. Regardless. . . Now that I have you in my grasp. Your life is forfeit."

No time at all is wasted. The two clones rush ahead, aiming to engage in close-ranged combat. Meanwhile, the real thing had descended, and pressed his palms against the little bit of earth that this portion of the exams had allowed. Quickly, four different strips of earth shoots forward, with sharpened edges, all with the purpose of piercing and ending this Hoshigaki's life.  "Die!"

Yet things weren't always so easy. This second opponent proved to be no push over. Effortlessly, as the clones came forward, a single slash of the sword is performed -- all i nthe blink of an eye. Casually, their forms returned now, reverting back to the water that each of the dopplegangers actually proved to be. Due to the haste in which they'd been discarded in, the Hoshigaki -- the one deemed Yamu -- is more prepared to deal with the incoming Earth Pillar-technique. With a degree of dexterity, his body took to the skies.

The first of the pillars miss, and just like that, his body kicks off, activating suimen, and allowing himself to leap right back into the water. The water clearly is an area he excels in, as once within the liquid, Yamu's speed takes a stark incline. "Hrm. . . Is in water. And has gills. . . I suspect that the water is what allows his strength to excel. It'll be difficult  to defend him in this fashion. . . Thankfully I have just the right skillset to do so." Confident, he no longer uses the land as a crutch.

Chakra pumps to his feet, and grants the opportunity to tranverse the watery pathways by simply walking. In no time, Zetsumo had ran on over, moving about and giving chance to the exceptionally speedy shinobi.  Glaring, the two make eye contact, even as Yamu remains underwater, taking refuge in the clear terrain advantage. Two seals later, and the Hoshigaki pumps his own vast resevoirs of energy into the waterways. Much like his opponent, it seemed Yamu was quite versatile himself.

Water behind Zetsumo begins to quiver, before taking sharp in the form of four drills. They spiral around, allowing the added mobility to make the jutsu all the more deadly. COnsidering they came from the back, evasion is an difficult endeavor and is boredly line impossible. Indeed, two threes manage to pierce through the shinobi's knee, and one gets him right in the back. Out of simple luck, it the drilling water technique completely missesstriking any of the hearts.

Blood splatter, and falls into the water. It was like someone had dropped a galloon of red-dye into the sea, as the coloration changed entirely. All too similar to a shark, Yamu is attracted and heads upward. His body slinks from the water, and soon the beast is standing just ahead Zetsumo, who he deemed to be defeated by now. "Oi. . . And this is all the 'God of War' has to offer? I'd say I'm disappointed. . . Yet i had expected this to be the outcome. You seem to be the type of guy that functions solely off of hype. "

The arrogant Hoshigaki continued with a grin, while holding his sword ahead. Instictively, Zetsumo's hand is rising, and it shows desperation. "--But enough chit-chat. I can't have you form a seal." In an instant, his body fcloses in, and the sword plunges into the behemoth's neck! It's over-- Psyche. Just as the comes to an end, the final handsign completes, allowing Raiton chakra to surge to the fore-front. 

". . . What?" As we all knew, this man was practically immortal. Non-fatal hits in the heart had no barings. In no time, the Raiton chakra discharges, flowing into the water nearby, and shocking the fish-like shinobi. Of course, due to the closeness, the caster is caught in some of the crossfire, yet the bulk of the damage clearly befalls onto the opposing fighter. ". . .You failed because you didn't do your homework. You didn't analyze your opponent, as I had done to you."

He pauses, feeling the need to tutor the suiton-user that was still in shock, but figuratively and literally. "You see. Had you been paying attention, once my knees were taken out, you'd notice that my insides were hollowed. Making it clear. . . My body doesn't need what your's does. I opperately solely off of my Jiongu Threads. . .! Now die!" Those threads speed out, piercing through his throat and causing his body to fall limp. This battle was over.

The water begins to drain, and the gate cracks open. It was time to move onto the next foe. The threads also proceed to intertwin between his broken flesh and cells, stitching them back. The healing process is quick, and immediately leaves him in the proper condition to better battle and go through with the exam. He heads through, ready to take on whatever other enemies remained in the area.

. . .Cue a quick acceleration in time. In his haste, Zetusmo absolutely mows through the competition. Battle after battle, he seems to be more or less untouchable. Bodies drop mercilessly. It further leaves his monikor as the 'God of War' all too accurate.

By now, he had finished ten battles. his body is covered in blood, and bruises. And of course, stamina drain is becoming a very real issue. In the eight battles preceding this, there are some opponents that legitiamtely have given Zetsumo trouble. Some even severely limbs, and nearly taking out hearts. Overall, the brute is leaning ahead, breathing like a mad man and wondering what was to come next.

The eleventh battle arena is in a mountainous region. There are various hills, and from the bottom is just. . . air. Falling certainly isn't a desired outcome. "Oi. . .I'm running out of power here. Hopefully this opponent is a push-over.. . ." His nerves were growing. At this point, there was the realization that he could very well -not- be successful in becoming a sergeant.

It's then that the eleventh warrior steps out. He is strapped with strange gear. All seemingly made from his own, bright mind -- technology if you will. THere is a missile-launcher-esque obective on his shoulder, along with a slew of other gadgets. What more, he seemed to possessed the strange ability to fly -- advantagous in these conditions. "Hrm. . .S'up, maggot! You ready to get shellshocked? HAHAH!"

Unamused, there is no response. Just a death stare. Zetsumo leapt, moving from structure to structure, and weaving through a set of seals. Quickly, his handsigns allow for one of the more peculiar Katon-Release techniques. Transparent gas comes over the area, all with the intent on enveloping the male in explosive gas. Just as the male is moving to trigger a follow-up Katon technique -- theDemolition expert responds.

"Name's Marco, runt! You aint neva  eva gonna beat me!" A button on his belt is pressed, allowing a gust of wind to come, completely dissipating the Katon-inspired gas. Once successful, his bodyi s speeding ahead, moving just out of range from the Jiongu Threads. "Ah did mah homework, too! I know jus' how far you can attack with those things!" . . . And suddenly, it is realized.

Just because this guy was a dummy, doesn't mean he lacked the ability to strategize. The Rocket Launcher is applied, releasing a giant cannon-shaped object. Upon closer inspection, you can see various fuuinjutsu glyphs littered around, making it clear. These were. . . These were, explosive-tagged cannons. "Ah shit. . !" The Zombie Warrior moves ahead, speeding onto the next landmass structure. On colliion, the Canon goes crazy, completely oblierately the upper portion of the earthly pillar.

Getting hit by any of those wasn't going to be a pretty thing by any means. "Can't get caught by that. . . Or it's over. What more, It's going to be nearly impossible to attack this game from this range. He's too far up, and leaping at him will only leave me open for more attack or abuse. What the fuck am I going to do?" The male is stressed. But it doesn't' seem as if Marco is going to give him any time to think of react to any of this.

As Zetsumo ponders on what to do, additional canons are released. Boom!  Boom! Just barely, the shinobi is enabled to evade, and doesn't even bother to use his threads to deflect - as they'd simply be blown to smithereens. On occasions, his body catches some of the aftershocks, leaving his fframe littered in burns, and bruises. Clothes are left in tatters. 

Of course, simply being on the run was no good. With each attack, his hands form and do several different formations. Again and again, elemental projectiles pierced through the skies, although at the expensive of further exhausting the Jounin-calibar shinobi's chakra reservoirs.  No, of course, can even come close to striking him. Instead, they'd either dissipate or generally just sail out of harm's way. After all, the distance gave more than enough time for a proper reaction to be performed.
It's a sequence that goes on for  the next half an hour. And with this, each of the pillars had been reduced to dust. It's down to the last one, and Zetsumo knows damn well that evading isn't an option now. Where could he go?  

". . .Let's make this super fun then. I'mma use my giga-canon. Hahaha!" Marco roared with glee. It's like he saw this more as a game then actual fighting. With a clap of a hand, two new weapons are called forward. Eventually, they can merge, and channel energy at the opening. It seems to be a strange fusion of both Katon Release, and Raiton. The cannon seems to channel the power, and builds up to a new, plasma-like energy. It fires forward, having enough size to dwarf the landmass.

Then?  Shunshin. Immediately, his body speeds out of the way, becoming a literally blur. The cannon's energy eventually reduces the landmass to rubble, and forces a loud, thunderous cry to roam about the battle area. Zetsumo, sadly is in freefall, having no other land to rely on. "Shit. . . Shit. . . Shit. . . Shit!" The brute declared in distress.

As he's falling, Marco, in all his infinite wisdom is again charging up his laser. "Oi. I ain't kill ya. . . I'mma try again. Should work this time," the strange man declared. Once more, his energy is being gathered, then subsequently released, this time in the form of a giant sphere. Responding quickly, Zetsumo's frame is repelled, by secreting a release of wind chakra. His body would be quickly sent recoiling back, and just barely out of harm's way. "Hnnng!"

Again! Marco had missed his mark. Frustrated the brute would opt to use that weapon one more god damn time. Knowing that all was lost, Zetsumo is in a frenzy-then it dons upon him. There was still another technique that had yet been tried. "How long has it been since I've called upon Dorja?" Blood is grasped, and slid down his hand. Quickly, five different handsigns are woven through. . .and. . . !

"SUMMONING. . .  JUTSU!" A plume of smoke clouds the area. As it settles, there existed a duck summoning. It was a sight to behold, to say the least. No longer was Zetsumo restricted to calling insignificant beasts. Now? There stood a legitimate titan, one that rivaled the size of average-sized homes. "Dorja? You've been eating. Good. . . I'm glad you've progressed to my liking."

If ducks could blush, she'd certainly would be. Her feathers had a cobalt pigment. They seemed well-kempt, as if this actual duck legitimately went to the groomers on a weekly basis. What more, her eyes were beady, and wings thick with coarse feathers. Finally. . . The biggest trait? The specimen could fly, much to the delight of the summoning.

"T-thank you, Zetsumo-sama. I. . .I remember you explaining how much you wanted a powerful summoning. So I worked really hard, now I can be of use to you. Moreso. . . In combat. No longer will you just have to use me just for scouting. I want to be able to fight for you, Zetsumo-sama!" It seemed the God of War's manipulative schemes wasn't just exclusives to humans. Indeed, his will had been imposed even to the ducks that were tethered to his will.

"Huh? What's this. . . Ya summoned a giant. . Avian? Dammmn. I guess all that shit the boss was tellin' me about ya was true. You got a jutsu for each god damn situation. And you're a lot more versatile then just slingin' ninjutsu. Seems legit," Marco muttered with nonchalance.  Quickly, he's aiming, and ready to fire again - But then things change.

"Dorja! Go!" On command, the blue feathered Duck proceeds to speed ahead. Without even needing to be commanded, her beak opens up channeling chakra inward. Upon the release, a massive stream of water comes over the area, threatening to slam against Marco. Easily, however, he responds in kind. A shield of electrical energy is projected, easily blocking the incoming stream of water.

". . .He got quite the bit of tech, But this won't be enough to stop me. Ducks utilize Suiton and Fuuton. . . Both of which are great components i* - Sat Sep 05 15:48:41 2015
