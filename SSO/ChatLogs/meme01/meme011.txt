<br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

It was a bit early, and thus his big meeting would have to wait. His eyes traces onto the two entities that were casually lounging around in the office. ". . . Oi. It feels like it's been forever since I've walked among you all. . . " Even if canonly, only a short period of time had gone by.

Maybe a week at the most. 

"I've trust you've all been productive? Particularly you, Uzumaki. Your sealing talents are coveted -- and it's imperative that they improve."* - Sun Aug 30 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (If SUitengu doesn't come back. We'll say I sent him to survive on his own to test his strength - Sun Aug 30 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his lifeless gaze towards the increasingly apathetic Kitora. ". . .What? -- That can wait, I suppose," Zetsumo replies in a dull, almost bored tone. Seconds after, attention is again given back towards the Fuuinjutsu specialist. One whom the shinobi had high hopes for. . . Although it was still needed to be seen where his loyalty laid, along with the rest of the brute's rag-tag group of misfits.

"Tell me more. I'm curious. . .What will it do?"* - Sun Aug 30 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nodded then. Having the infamous 'Root Sealing' at his disposal would be a great asset, and it was something Zetsumo desired greatly. 

"Good. Keep it up, there may or may not be a reward if you can properly duplicate the seal," he states calmly. He turns to face Kitora now. ". . As for you. What in the world does 'Meh' means. . .?"* - Sun Aug 30 14:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tapped his fingers along the table. Each repetition is might with greater force, and soon enough he's tapping at a hard enough rate that you could almost swear the table was about to have a hole or two poked in. Kitora was testing Zetsumo's nerves, that was for sure. . . Yet he didn't quite want to act on it, as part of his new vision for the group. Although, with enough persistance, the young Kunoichi would definitely get to see just how nasty the Zombie Shinobi could get if tested.

There's a pause. . . as he contemplates each word carefully.

"Despite the similarity in definition. . .Do not take my concern, curiosity, nor interest as a sign that a care. It is simply my obligation. . . There is no humanly or emotional tie -- if that's what you're getting at. It's a wonder why I have to even explain this to you. You know precisely how I feel. . . precisely how our relation stands."* - Sun Aug 30 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"At the very least, you recall the chain of commands. Yet, contrary to your words, your actions or personality -is- my concern. Or have you forgotten why I've punished you in the past?" For a moment, his voice tone was taking a stark incline, and gained a hitch of venom or animosity. But once again, the habitually grumpy elementalist gained control of his oft volatile temper. He exhales, and continues speaking.

". . . Regardless, that is in the past. You're treading on thin ice, yet I will provide lenience with your attitude. I suppose it is appropriate, considering what I've done to your spawn," he says, referencing Suitengu recent disappearance. Yes, in his desire to mold his son into the ultimate warrior, Zetsumo had sent the tender aged five-year-old into the wild to fend for himself. Piccolo style. One could only imagine how the overprotective mother felt on this.

". .. However, i do feel you will find intrigue and pleasure in my next Public Service Announcements. There will be many changes to be had -- particularly with hierarchy. I'll keep things vague to avoid having to re-iterate myself. But no longer will there be a chain of command. There iwll only be Zetsumo .. .  then those that work under me. Beth. . . Mukade. . . Zenaki, no one will be able to lord over you any longer. Well. . . So long as you don't piss me off again."* - Sun Aug 30 15:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grows impatient out of nowhere.

"My decision stems from one factor -- a recent member going rogue. The man formerly known as Neal. I suppose it is my fault that he even held the opportunity to be a traitor. . . In my inexpeience, I allowed you all the partial freedom to goven yourselves. Yet ontop of this, I gave someone too much power. As you would know. . . my right hand, 'Mukade.' It is my reason to believe that her giving this runt a month to go explore without my consent planted the seeds for insubordiantion. . . And thus, I will no longer leave any room for error. The Kenryoku is solely under my rule. If you all have disputes with one another? SOLVE IT. . " His voice booms, as it's clear this is a matter he's taking very seriously.

His hand clapped down onto the desk, forcing the wooden structure to shake with fear under the might of his heavy hand. By now, Zetsumo was standing, and looking over the trio closely.

"Else. . . I'll have to step in. And you don't want me to have to solve your issues. . ." Tendrils slip from his flesh, wiggling in the skies like parasitic worms. His breathing rate was growing haggard for some reason, and heavy at that. "Like said before, you all are going to be on a strict schedule. Likewise, there will be weekly sanity or loyalty checks. . . Starting now."

His hand motions towards the front, and he commands each of the party to line up. An announcement is given into the intercom, calling forth any mind specialists.* - Sun Aug 30 15:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked casually towards the door, which creaks open?

"Finally here, Beth. I trust you know of the changes. But now, I want you to begin with the interrogation jutsu. Let's start with Kitora. .  Kitora, step to my side."* - Sun Aug 30 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) quickly spoke up.

Out of all the people. . Kilm was perhaps the oneh e was most suspicious of, considering the boy's origin. ". . .What is your relation to Neal and Katsune? I want your opinion and status with them in clear detail."* - Sun Aug 30 16:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilts his head. "Tell me now, then. Where do your loyalties lay? Do you still hold ties to your home village of Kumogakure?"* - Sun Aug 30 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
To save time, Kilm and Kitora are both given the interrogation once more, just to see if they've been in contact with any parties outside the village. If they checked out, he ends the session for now.* - Sun Aug 30 16:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
A lackey comes to provide a single mission to ensure that the daily quota was being met. 

". . .A simple, C graded contract. There's an inhabitant suffering extreme paranoia. She wants to be guarded for the day. We're being paid handsomely, so Lord Zetsumo expects you to do a jog well done."

A map is handed over so that Osamu can easily find the location. (10 RPs)* - Sun Aug 30 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rolls his eyes at the gesture.

"The scarring hardly affect the quality. It is nothing compared to what I've endured. I think you're simply looking to be unhappy. . "* - Sun Aug 30 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glares. "Heed my warning. This won't escalate to senseless battling -- I need each of my allies at tip-top shape. If you have aggression, it will be dealt with by me. After all, I too played a part, no?" Je says casually, though there's a menacing calmness to his tone.* - Sun Aug 30 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Here - Sun Aug 30 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Not much. but its something - Sun Aug 30 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow. He hadn't actually expected her to strip naked, but seemed to hold no squalms with it otherwise. His arms folded, and in no time, he scans her form.

"Mmm," you've grown, Zetsumo comments off handily. "Yet the scarring is nothing to take too personality. You act as if you're entire body is marred. You are a warrior, scars are to be expected. Suit yourself up, in a while I'll have a task or two waiting for you. Perhaps to go check on the status of Suitengu, to see if he's faring well with his training."* - Sun Aug 30 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked  as Kitora seemed to have dozed off. He yawns, before turning towards Paine now -- who seemingly had just awoken from her daze. ". . . Hrm. You doze off a lot, you know. But yes, I've been needing to exercise my might a bit. Mind you, I have no intention on holding back too much. You will very much be fighting me with my techniques on display," the warrior warns. Quickly, he's getting off his butt, and motioning for the young taijutsu specialist to lead the way.

Before she steps away, a scroll is taken and delivered. ""Read this along the way. It's a powerful taijutsu technique, maybe you can learn a thing or two from it and employ it in the spar."

The scroll was governed around a style Paine was admittedly adept with. It was dubbed 'Severe Leaf Hurricane.' Fitting, considering they were basedi n Konohagakure.* - Sun Aug 30 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
It doesn't take long for the duo to arrive a the local training grounds. He's calm, and is eager to fully test the extent of Paine progression. Even with the recent development of various members being traitorous, there was still an innate interest in Paine's own development. After all, she filled a particular niche that needed to be attended too.

Slowly, the shinobi falls into a basic battle stance, and of course forces the threads within his body to seep out. They rip through flesh, and slither in the skies. 

"Come at me. I don't have to have to devolve into using ninjutsu right from the beginning. Hopefully your taijutsu thus far can essentially force me into utilizing my elements -- Hit me with your full power, understand? Nothing held back, as at times. .. It will appear as if I am giving you the same treatment," Zetsumo instructs. Thus, he falls silent, and prepares for what could be a great bout.* - Sun Aug 30 19:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on, greatly anticipating for the battle to at last begin. .  

And it did!

His eyes are observant, watching as the gal swiftly sprinted over. "I've watched you for a while, Paine. You have  great power -- but your speed sorely lacks. I've lectured you on this time and time again. Work on your speed, or you'll never be able to close the distance and engage in proper hand ot hand combat," Zetsumo lectures admist the girl's approach. He stands put, watching as a quick right hander is delivered. Instinctively, his body is on the move, and dips towards the right. The first punch, rather than landing squareo n the chest, it grazes his shoulders.

In response, his right foot goes up, and aims to thrust into Paine's stomach. For once. . . . Zetsumo felt a slight amount of kindness, and didn't exercise the ability to complete and utterly overwhelm an opponent in close-ranged scenario. From his body, the threads that already were sprawled out, one set shoot ahead, whipping at Paine's right shoulder, fully intent on breaking through cloth, and partially cutting at the flesh.

"C'mon! Give me your all, show me why I should continue to associate with the likes of you!"* - Sun Aug 30 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . . .! Quite deterious!" The kick would have have been avoided expertly, although the threads work wonders. At the last second, just as Paine is doing her flip, and spinning while mid-air,. those same cloth-like materials, would coil around the woman's shoulder area.

Using this grip, Zetsumo quickly manipulates it's power, giving a harsh tug. Assuming not avoided or otherwise resisted, the girl would have be flung towards the west, and slammed into the ground. He's quite literally dragging her around the dusty sand area, and leaving her dishoveled. " --- You're pretty good with Taijutsu, and perhaps can even be seen as my equal. Yet. . . This is inadequate. You should be my clear superior, I shouldnt' even be able to contend with you in hand-to-hand combat."

With three short seals, chakra pumps out. It flows into the ground and manipulates the earth as well. The coarse sand that existed soon is shifted, and gains a muddy consistency. At once, a large-ish wave is soon manifested and sent speeding forward. It's meant to lace the ground in the substance, as well as cause concussive damage onto Paine's frame. 

"Try harder. What yo u have no won't cut it."* - Sun Aug 30 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is struck on the shoulder, yet it matters little all the same. He'd grunt, and feel a sharp pain develop. . . But it brings more pleasure than pain. "Yes. . . Yes, that's more of how I like it, Paine. Attack even as you're being assaulted!" 

Nevertheless, his set up would work fine, and leave the area layered in mud. He smiles, legitimately entertained by the kunoichi's effort. "Y'know. . . You do that a lot. . . It's not good for defensive actions, no matter what you think. Let me show you!" With the mud along the area, he moves onto the next technique. Quickly, his hands are stringing through a set of seals, allowing gfor additional earth-based techniques to be employed.

The ground has life breath into it. It rumbles, taking shape and forms a massive dragon head. At once, the muddy head roars, and the mud within is utilized for the main focus of the attack. bullets, cannon-sized bullets are spat out, each barreling towards the spiralling mass of wind. It holds great power, and easily can outdo the power of hte hurricane. If not avoided, Paine would be dealt with bowling-ball sized projectiles, each with enough force to send her skidding back and crashing against the ground.* - Sun Aug 30 21:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues to speak as he battles.

"The newcomer, speak. Explain your origin." Yadanaru can omit his previous statement now that the player knows the backstory. 

"You mean your kinsmen? i haven't a clue. Why do you want her?"* - Sun Aug 30 21:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
His eyes remained trained on Paine, as the girl defended against his onslaught in some shape or fashion. Believe it or not, despite the aggressively and power being applied to his elemental techniques -- this was still the tyrant going easy. His adrenaline was flaring, and his willingness or excitement towards the spar was only growing as the battle prolonged. Zetsumo could only hope that the adrenaline didn't develop into something more, such as Blood Lust. Teeth clenched, both hands again press against one another,  all with the intent on kneading vchakra for additional punishment or damage -- 

"Ping...~..Ping...~ Pong!  Our Unlucky contestants for today...Are...Konoha~!"

A voice echoed across the region from out of nowhere. The reverberations sends chills down the warrior's spine, and immediately work to send him on alert. The bird had been sent, and in a few short hours, the strange organization had already made it's move. From peripheral vision, he catches wind of the incoming projectiles from the skies. 

At once, the handsign forming before is modified,. falling into the 'Bird.' Chakra pumps and secrates from every inch of his body, and unleashes a sizeable gust of wind. While not an offensive threat, it served as the first line of defense against the potential threat. Subsequently after, his tendrils gather around, working moreso as an umbrella, shielding himself from the otherworldly 'rain.' 

"--What in the world. . .! The bastards!" Even with one good eye, the elementalist sees the depressions forming along the ground, as strange creatures are manifesting. His threads quickly slap or defend against the falling beads, while another gathering goes to grab Paine by the waist. (Probably after the kick)


Assuming success, Zetsumo skids around, as he held no intention of being surrounded. "Paine, dont' act so abasively. Know your enemies. . . Don't head in wrecklessly."* - Sun Aug 30 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Explosions. . .Of course, how wreckless!" He roared to himself in frustration. The explosions clearly do a number on him, forcing quite a few threads to be incinerated and rendered useless. Thankfully, within his body, the stange, organic objects were plentiful and certainly was not growing sparse.

Rather, now Zetsumo held two different issues to deal with -- the the incoming rubble, the explosive spheres, and of course the many creatures that now were riddled along the ground and popping up.

". . .Move out of my way!" Ordered the leader. A single seal is formed, prompting slabs of Earth to spontaneously develop. It's large and thick, and form in a semi-circle along the base of the mountain. Due to the range, it's more than capable of shielding them from the onslaught, and the rubble that did make it pass the earthly defense finds itself harmlessly clattering onto the ground -- and that was simply one jutsu.

As the Snake seal came to a stop, Zetsumo is swift to move onto the next subject. In a blurring fashion, five more handsigns are completed. "Wind Release. . . . Great Breakthrough!" At once, from the shinobi's vast chakra resevoirs, a gale of wind is produced. It moves ahead, all in one direction, and of course seems to be continously. Given his immense spiritual power, and experience, the technique covers quite a bit of range.

However. . . the overall girth depended on if the boneheads could move. If Kitora, Osamu, Yadanaru had gotten out of the way as instructed, the wide-ranged attack works to deal with the incoming explosives and perhaps would sweep away the demonic spawns.* - Sun Aug 30 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms as the projectiles came in. For those that were near him, they would find great fortune being granted to thems. Once more, his threads shoout out, blocking the slimey, saliva-residue that spawned from the Demons' maws. As the collision comes, Zetsumo casually severs the threads, allowing the gooey substance to fall onto the ground.

"Mmm. . . A few dozen. I'll try to take as many as I can out in one fell swoop. Yes. . . If that works, I'll leave the others to deal with the rest."

Characteristically, his body gains convlusions and bulges in all different directions of the body. . .Swoosh! Those Earth Grudge Creatures are again on the prowl, and stragetically stand out of the way. Two in general are formed, taking a humanoid-like appearance. One holds the kanji 'Wind.' The other holds the Kanji of 'Fire. You know where this was going.

Heeding Kitora's demands, the Creature makes it move, scorching the mud bullets, and sets them ablaze. Thus now. . .  the creatures now held flaming spheres coming to make their lives a bit more difficult. Yet this isnt' where the fun ended. 

"Now. . .Let me do something I haven't done in forever. . . Ninja Art! Hellstorm Technique!" Zetsumo thought to himself. As the first round of fire went off, the two Earth Grudge Creatures conjoins, allowing their nature types to meld together. At once, two techniques are used simultaneously. It forces a massive stream of fire to overtake the area, all wit hthe intent on laying waste to the largest bulk of demons ---

Which happened to be the ones at the opposite end of the field.* - Sun Aug 30 23:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. He places his hand into pocket. "Huh. . .I killed those a little too easy. I wanted to see how you maggots would've dealt with the bulk -- And of course it wasn't my doing." 

He moves towards the north.* - Mon Aug 31 01:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze to Beth. 

". . .Got a problem? I'd hope not." Of course, he had said 'maggots' initially with nonchalance. Now he was growing aggitated.* - Mon Aug 31 01:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts. He was too uptight to lighten up. He goes, taking a seat, and broods.* - Mon Aug 31 01:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Tons of zombies laid out on the ground.* - Mon Aug 31 01:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folds his arms and leans against the wall.

"Let's make this quick."* - Mon Aug 31 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) listened intently. He interjects briefly.

"Mmm. Have you been in contact with anyone outside of Konoha since your time here? Likewise, were you aware of Neal's -- otherwise known as Orakuru -- proposed treachery?" * - Mon Aug 31 01:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow. Now this? This was surprising. At the ambiguous answering, the brutish elementalist is on his face and closing in. "This isn't time to be an airhead. Answer the question -- have you been in contact with anyone outside of Konoha?" His voice is growing a bit more menacing and his face is gaining a red coloration. Anger. ..  unadulterated anger was developing. It couldn't be that Paine of all people was the traitor. .* - Mon Aug 31 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns back to Paine. He was disappointed. . . The two had known each since childhood, and yet here were the secrets. "Speak, Paine. Has Kronos been -in- Konoha? Likewise, explain what you two been discussing. . ." He taps his feet impatiently and closes the distance between them. Menacing eyes look down, but rather than simple malice lingering in his optics, there was disappointment.

After all he's done for the girl, this is how she repays him?* - Mon Aug 31 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his hand. Instinctively, his hand coats itself in Doton-based chakra and punches. It moves to strike the girl right in the chest, and carries enough force to send her body skidding back in recoil.

"Q-QUIT PLAYING DUMB!" He roars. This would perhaps be the first time in well. . . Ever, that the beast's rage was directed towards the typically sweet and innocent taijutsu specialist. Nevertheless, even with the power, the potential for serious injury was slim, lest the girl proved to be exceptionally frail.

"SEE WHAT YOU MADE ME DO? Tch--- Fuckin' pisses me off."

Every bit of composure that Zetsumo typically displayed was out of the window. If you think he had trust issues before. . . Wait till you see him after this. The scroll is taken, and opened away from his face. He goes as far as to even open it meters away via threads. As the contents are explored, the lad falls into silence. He knew they held an emotional attachment. . . And with that, the rage sudden dimmed.

". . .Yes. . . Yes. I know what to do now."

A twisted, doll-like grin shifts onto his face. "We're going to kill Kronos, soon. Beth, continue with the questioning..  . See if she has any other information."* - Mon Aug 31 02:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"It's simple. I'm going to ask these last set of questions."

He has Beth move over, to keep the Interrogation technique fully blaring. "First. your loyalty. . .Does it or does it not still lay with me? I want a complete and intelligent answer. Anything less will invoke more of my wrath. . " He pauses, allowing the simpleminded taijutsu specialist to register the question before continuing.

"Next. Has this been the only person outside of my group that you've spoken to? Or anyone outside the village for that matter? And lastly. . . You only have two choices. To be my companion or kronos. There is no two options. . . It is either me or him, who do you allign yourself with?"

By now, Zetsumo had come upon Paine. His hand snatches down, and grabs at her collar to press her against the wall. Assuming success, he makes eye contact, as if staring into her soul for the answer. A hand waves Kilm in -- but gestures for him to wait.* - Mon Aug 31 02:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) chortles in response. He had heard enough. . . and was displeased.

"Not a good answer. But. . . You will have a single chance to redeem yourself. Y'see, you're a. . . key to acheiving one of my goals. It is unfortunate to say," he moves, patting the girl on the cheek in a gentle fashion.

"You won't be able to marry Kronos. You. . . Will be the one to murder him. I care little for your ties to your parents, yet this. . . Him? It ends. He's an enemy, and stands starkly against what I dream to acheive." Now, he allows his grip to loosen, and lets Paine's body fall onto the ground. Some would call him a mad man. Others a cruel, sadistic dictator. And honestly? They wouldn't be wrong.  Sadly, in some strange and twisted ways, Zetsumo truly held belief in his own words or logic.

Paine had suddenly been a disappointment, yet now he granted her an opportunity to repent. What more could she want?

"The letter. You will arrange a meeting, south of the village. It be feigned as if you're on an out-of-village mission. Then? We will strike." The scroll he previously held is tossed to the shaky Taijutsu specialist. "Begin writing."* - Mon Aug 31 03:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have guided Paine with the proper way to trick Kronos. Once done, it's to be sent off.* - Mon Aug 31 03:41:13 2015

She drags her feet, along with the rest of her squad members to conduct the mission.* - Mon Aug 31 03:58:17 2015

"Oi. . .I hope I don't have to actually attack Kumo or Kiri to get to him. He is an expert at hiding. In anycase, you and I. We should battle."* - Mon Aug 31 05:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wears a stoic expression. "I have no squalms with taking pain. Pain simply is the body's way of acknowledging that it presently is not able to take the current strife that the natural world has imposed upon it. To take pain is to gain strength. . . 'What doesn't kill you. . . makes you stronger.' Thus, come as if you want to kill me. Since I have no intent on taking it too easy on you either. . ." He speaks in calculated tone before turning on his heel. At once, his body poofs again, granting high speed and essentially giving him the ability to 'teleport.'* - Mon Aug 31 05:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) keeps his hand leisurely behind his back. A taunt, a clear one.

". . .Come now. Also. . . refrain from doing that tired tactic of going underground. It won't work -- and will lead to an easy defeat for me. Get creative. . . in real life and death situations, it will do you little good." He remains standing in place with dull eyes. When was the action going to begin?* - Mon Aug 31 05:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Well this is interesting. . .. She's closing in on me fast, but still has the ball within her hand. I get it. . . With the rate she's coming, she's trying to make sure that the lack of distance will make an evasion more difficult. And even if I do avoid, she can quickly follow-up. A smart ploy. . . Or maybe I'm overthinking this," Zetsumo strategizes calmly. Nevertheless, as he had stated, there was absolutely no intent on letting his be a walk in the park for the ambitious teen. Just as she's doing her second step, the warrior had already wove through three short seals.

On cue, his cheeks puff and swell with water. Like a water hose, liquid pump from his mouth. It's width and size stands true, holding up enough mass to account for the entirety of Katsune's fragile body. 

Booomm! It gushed, roaring like a common river and seeks to ram against the girl's frame. If hit, she'd feel as if she had been struck by liquidified bricks, and her body certainly would be left somewhat in a state of shock. Despite the damage that came, Zetsumo hardly had the intent on ending the battle in one move, and thus the power is held back -- as far cry to what it -could- be. Hit or miss, nevertheless, the floor was going to be drenched, and layered in water. What would the girl do in response?

"I foresee an Earth Flash." It was difficult when your opponent knew all your moves.* - Mon Aug 31 05:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept his arms folded once the attack had went along it's courrse, it crashes into ground and leave it firmly soaked. Just as Zetsumo had anticipated.

"Now comes-- the fun."

Quickly, just as Katsune had managed to evade a direction collision, tendrils speed from his frame, originating from the rib. They shoot, out and race to attack around the teen's waist area. They're speed, moreso than the elemental technique that had been delivered seconds prior -- and greedily try to coil around the girl's waist.

Likewise, just as the Lightning Ball is falling onto the ground, Zetsumo simply does a light leap. One seal later, the ground is shifting, and with the water serving as a source of power, the Mud Silhouette is in full force. You can smell the arrogance, as the shinobi utilizes an -Earth-Based techniquye against it's bitter rival, raiton or electricity. Nevertheless, due to the water being placed before hand, a decent wave of earth comes, covering a few meter radius and being intent on sweeping the girl away.

It seemed the leader wasn't concerned with landing. . . although the mud shot drown out all of the Raiton if he's powerful enough. Assuming success, he's following up, doing three more short seals, and unleashing a Dragon Head that forms from the ground. Barrages of cannon-like mud-balls speed, each with the intent on striking her with the torso and sending her skidding back in a muddied mess.* - Mon Aug 31 06:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Hook. Line. Sinker.

"Great potential, yet for all your speed and reflexive prowess, you lack the ability to cast more techniques quickly. It leaves much to be desired, yet I still eagerly await to see your true potential. We will have much to work on in the future," He lectures. Once more, tfour strings of seals are done. First the ground is drenched in water once more, then a wave of mud again is launched. On this occasion, it's like a common wave you'd see in a natural ocean.

The point? To sweep Katsune away and leave her against the gate.

"This spar is over."* - Mon Aug 31 06:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks to Kilm.

"You may leave her there. She is under my care. What about you battle men ext?"* - Mon Aug 31 06:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"--Leave her. I'll take her home later. Your move."* - Mon Aug 31 06:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) eyed and condescendingly strips the strategy down from start to finish.

"Raiton. In effect against me," the shinobi declares. Five seals later, and he's prepared the perfect counter, although with the rapid manner in which his hands could manuever and form different formations, it often appeared to be less. Quickly, Zetsumo induces the nature transformation, shifting  the chakra and thinning it out to the point where it's consistency was on level with common gas.

As this happens, the chakra molecules literally bond with the air,granting him limited manipulation of wind. 

gushing, he unleashes the might of his strength forward in a single, massive motion. It covers pretty much anything within his plain of sight, and easily destroys the onflow of Raiton that ran along the ground. What more, the momentum certainly serves to send Kilm skidding and perhaps could ram him through the gate. Trees that stood behind him would quiver, and find themselves partially uprooted.* - Mon Aug 31 07:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Hrm? I should have used more power. That gate should have been completely destroyed," Zetsumo replies caasually. His adrenalina was still running high especially due to the last battle he had just participated in. As Kilm runs about, going through seals, so does the elemental guru. Both ands come together, mirroring the budding elemental's own set. . . . 

"Look at us. Same technique. Earth Flash!"

Just as Kilm is pressing his hand against the ground, Zetsumo kneelsas well. Lightning briefly discharges, before cackling along the ground and rushing on over to the would-be assailiant. Thus, the perfect trope is enacted. Due to the super strength, he;s able to not only overpower the raiton technique, but assimilate it into his own,

The end result is a significantly powerful earth flash, that covers an even larger range. Due to the assimilation, power isn't sacrificed with range all too much. "Let's see how you deal with this one then. . ." Internally he grins, realizing that applying water beforehand would have served as the perfect empowerment to his elemental technique. Did Kilm have what it took?* - Mon Aug 31 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Zetsumo kept with the game of mimic. He very much enjoyed this.

Being the quicker executer of ninjutsu, his hands quickly manuever into the required seals. Once readied, the shinobi's cheek puffs, but rather than spew out gathering of simple water, he's sending a syrupy-like substance, but like Kilm. It'd meet the elementalist's attack halfway, and aim to not only neutralize, but overpower and subsequently assimilate it's strength into his own.

Assuming success, Kilm unfortunately now has a giant wave of syrup closing in him. "Hrm. .. You fight too simply. Running around and slinging ninjutsu won't get you far. It takes planning," scolding the leader. He yawns, now not even forming a seal. Rather, utilizing chakra flow, sparks ignited among his hand, and coming behind the wave is a series of miniture fireballs. He tosses them one after the other, in quick succession. On impact, they'd combust.* - Mon Aug 31 07:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) really seemed to enjoy his newfound ability to utilize different technique in successions.

As Kilm dances out of harm's way, Zetsumo's hand again flickers, this time going through yet another set of handsigns. Quickly, Katon chakra is built and released. Unlike the usual sequence, this isn't to unleash a powerful stream of flames, but rather swift and accurate flaming balls. Even as they fly in abundance -- easily over two dozens in just this round --- the shinobi holds the innate ability to manipulate them to hisl iking, making evasion all the more difficult.

Yet the purpose wasn't to damage, but distract. 

Just as Kilm goes to avoid, as I'm sureh e will, the 'Tiger' handsign isformed mid-barrage. Once more, Katon energy is put to use, forming a string of fire. It runs along the ground and goes to encircle the shinobi, hopefully leaving him entrapped within the ring of fire. "That should keep him still. . "* - Mon Aug 31 07:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) hated this tactic. "Why do people always use this against me?"

As the combo goes through, he kneels, unleashing his Doton chakra to reduce the sand into a powdery state. Now that it's softened, his threads pile together and literally stab through the earth. Rigorously, they push through, rupturing the ground and aiming to wrap their grubby hands along Kilm's body as he remained underneath the surface.* - Mon Aug 31 08:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose.

"That really ticks me off. It's like. . . Every Doton's user answer to anything is just slipping underground. Regardless, it would seem that you lose this 'bout. . . " He casually tosses the shinobi to the side and takes a seat on the wet ground. That was a good display of morning exercise at least.* - Mon Aug 31 08:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) snaps his fingers. 'Pay attention."

He seemed at edged, perhaps due to the latest failure in assassinating Kronos. Even battling both of his underlings wasn't enough to stifle the internal rage and angst that Zetsumo was subjected every day of his life. Now by Kilm's side, the shinobi is quickly to put his chakrar resevoirs to use. Energy swivels around, going in a circular fashion, and of course brushing against one another. The collision forces the chakra to react on an internal level and gain innate heat. While not fully fire yet, this was the phenomenon known as building up Katon-released chakra. It was essential in actually producing Katon techniques, and of course instrumental in chakra flow.

"First. .. . As always, you build up energy. Use your stomach as the focal point, and have the chakra that commune grow acquainted with one another. Your stomach is like a stove that's eating sweet dough. Once you heat up your 'dough' or 'chakra' enough, you can move onto the next step. Naturally, your energy must be of sufficient temperature, so that the next parts can go smoothly. Enough talk, however. . . I'll go onto the next portion."

Once the chakra was cooking, Zetsumo imposes his will. Casually, his cognitive prowess forces the chakra to migrate upward. Unlike a rookie, or someone inexperienced in the application of a nature release, or chakra control in general. . .He seemed to be unconcerned or unhurried. Manipulating his energy in such a fashion was a trivial task, and borderline breached 'telepathic' ability. On the outside world, his actions are clear. Due to exceptionally large reserves of strength -- thanks to the assimilations of hearts -- the outpour of energy is clumped to an extent that his flow of chakra forms an actual shroud of energy about his arm. It glows beautifully, and dazzles the air as night approaches. The transulecent nature make it appear as if a latern was being set around the general area.

"See what I do here? I flow the chakra along my hand, and release it from teh teknetsu in my hand. This is easy, considering your hands are the most sensitive area on the body, and hold the most chakra nodes. What comes next is really the most important part of the technique. As the chakra flows, you bind it to the air molecules and ignite the energy. From this, flames are produced. . ." And as usual, Zetsumo was one that led by action, not words. Like a fiercesome blowtorch, fire is produced from out of nowhere. The inferno practically catches onto Kilm's face, but thankfully misses the mark by a few centimeters. For now, this was just a massless form of destruction and held no shape nor control. . . 

That was soon to be changed.

"Y'see? My Katon chakra is being flowed, and while it isn't on level with an actual, detailed elemental technique, it's the building block. What I'm doing here is heating the air just a few centimeters away from my hands. And now. . . I employ the shape manipulation. HNG!" The grunt signifies more than just more effort. It signifies, now, the completion of the jutsu. At once, the yellowish flames take shape, being produced into a simple sphere which is subsequently tossed seconds afterwards.

"It's a different technique, as far as C-ranks go. As it's reliant on detailed chakra manipulation. Of course, due to the small size and relatively weak power -- individually that is. . . PErforming without a single seal is possible. FOr now, I want you to work on the technique step by step. And work on building up the required 'muscle memory' to perform it in succession. You have one week."* - Mon Aug 31 09:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts glance.

"What is it?"* - Mon Aug 31 09:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) watched as Kilm seemed to show proficiency. ". ..Huh. Learned it in just a few minutes. Well. . . learning and mastering at two different things. Keep at it. . ." He turns, and proceeds towards Katsune. His face hides all emotions, masking precisely how he felt. . 

Then some weird grin is spawned.

"You know. I am both annoyed, and amused. Your attachment or friendship to Orakuru is making you grasp at straws. Regardless of what you may say, he is a deadman. Certainly. .  you accept this, yes?" He pauses, waiting for an answer. Zetsumo was no stranger to delivering grim news, and in such a calm tone as if the comments didn't even matter.* - Mon Aug 31 09:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Scrrcchh! Streeetch!

His arm extends quickly. . .! Just to give her a harsh flick to the forehead. "Oi. . .You talk a lot. Your concern is noted, yet I have my reason. You know me to be an intelligent man. Perhaps the most intelligent in the land," Zetsumo boasts. ". . .I would not come down on the boy over an isolated incident. It's repeated clues. . . tips. I was suspicious long ago, but I calmed myself simply because of the funny looks my former right hand was giving me. Your 'love' for him blinds you from the truth. It is reasons like this that I encourage my troops to severe ties to their emotions."

He says with a shrug. "But you've said your piece, I suppose that is all. . .No?"* - Mon Aug 31 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"I take it the discussion is over. Hng. . " He randomly grunts as he grows restless.* - Mon Aug 31 09:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods to Katsune and shifts his gaze to Aiolos.

". . .Who the heck are you?" * - Mon Aug 31 09:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"Then we have a problem. Where are you from?"* - Mon Aug 31 10:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Konoha was once a beauitful and beloved village. The birds chirped sweet songs, and the little boys/girl danced in the sunlight, enjoying their time in the playground!

Then. . . . the Amegakure nation attacked.

The rain village, now employing a group of mercenaries known as known as the Kenryoku quickly made short work of the village and took over. There wasn't a Konohagakure shinobi left in the wake of the damage. Yet. . . many villagers lived on. For the next five years, they were oppressed, ruled with an iron-fist by the Amegakure masters, and of course shaken down by various bored members of the Kenryoku.

Five years have passed and nothing has changed. THe village continues to be shrouded in darkness, and serves as a simple tool to advance one's agenda. (Tl: DR Konoha aint a normal village. )* - Mon Aug 31 10:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. He was getting tired of lingering in the park. In actuality, Zetsumo was on the verge of suggesting that the group do something leisurely or relaxing to pass their time -- then the new guy popped up.

". . .Oi. Why so quick to go? Kind of hurts my feelings. You don't enjoy the company?" He turns, eying Zenaki who had just arrived.

"I don't think this guy likes us." The tone is sarcastic and menacing all the same, it's clear he doesn't particularly care much for Aiolos' opinion. 'And go take a breather, you've worked enough today." Zetsumo says, this time towards Kilm.* - Mon Aug 31 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow. Everyone was being so dull today. Zenaki in particularly, she usually jumped at the chance to harrass a citizen.

"Right. . . Be careful. Try not to have too much fun around here. Would hate to have to see ya on less than friendly terms. . ." Zetsumo says with a yawn. He doesn't bother to go after the apparently harmless citizen. At least not yet.* - Mon Aug 31 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"That's not how i play. Usually it's the highest number win. I prefer that much. ..  I guess it's agreed that fifty-thousand is the wager for the three of us?" He says, holding back the urge to grin ear to ear.

He had trick dice, after all.* - Mon Aug 31 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tosses the die to Katsune.

"Hrm. . . ladies first."* - Mon Aug 31 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head in pity. 

"Oi, you may have already lost. Your go, Kilm."* - Mon Aug 31 11:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose. He goes to take the dice, after witnessing the seven. -- But they fumble about. It would seem that Zetsumo was a clutch. Turning, the shinobi would grab ahold of the dice, while performing the switcharoo. 

The difference? This dice had no ones. (+1 to each roll)* - Mon Aug 31 11:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) takes the loaded dice. . . he goes again, hoping for a high number. On this roll, Zetsumo throws excessively hard. So that they'd continue to move along the pavement.* - Mon Aug 31 11:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) moves to grab the dice. He performs the switcharoo again. . . giving the normal ones out. "Here.."* - Mon Aug 31 11:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns. He forms a seal and sends a torrent of water to Katsune's face.

"My money. . ."* - Mon Aug 31 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze back to Kilm.

"Perhaps not. . . But it amused me. . .We will play once more. What are the stakes?"* - Mon Aug 31 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) does not rig the dice. As any more fumbling would grant suspicion. Once more, he whips the toys ahead. . . eager to see what his value would be.* - Mon Aug 31 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is filthy rich.

He tosses fifty- thousand as it's nothing. After all, he's still at a profit of fifty-thousand.* - Mon Aug 31 11:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) easily catches the dice. He whips the dice ahead, and looks ahead. ..  How could he manipulate them? THen it dons upon him. . . Subtly, chakra churns and releases itself from all points. There's a sudden gust. . . aiming to shift the roll of the second number.

Would anyone notice?* - Mon Aug 31 11:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) seems visibly irked. 

"Alright. Perhaps this wasn't the wisest idea. . . suggest an alternative. I don't want to keep going in circles.."* - Mon Aug 31 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"I typically only played dice games. . . They were the quickest and most effective. I am curious with Kilm's first proposal. Being the selection of two numbers each, and which ever number is landed on determines the winner," Zetsumo explains. Although, there was another.

"One I found to be popular. . . and won me many yen when I was held in captivity was. . . 'House.' Where one person plays as the house, typically with the most money. In this game. . you would choose a single number. . .say '7.' You get three options, decide if it will be over or under. If the option you chose is incorrect, you lose the wager. Alternatively, if itl ands directly on the number, you earn double. "* - Mon Aug 31 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) goes back to cheating. He uses dice with lower numbers. Quickly, the shinobi flicks his wrist. . .allowing the objects to slide across the ground!

(-1 each roll)* - Mon Aug 31 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) he gives the money as it still is very little in the grand scheme of things.

"Same thing for you, seven. Over or under?"* - Mon Aug 31 12:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) hands out another fifty-grand.

". . .Huh."* - Mon Aug 31 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) speaks with slight anger. 

He disliked losing..* - Mon Aug 31 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilts his head. He was always great at taking his alcohol.

"I will accept. Although I intend to make the wager far more significant then what we've been doing."* - Mon Aug 31 12:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks to Katsune. Was she even old enough to drink?

. . .Well, this was Kenryoku.* - Mon Aug 31 12:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was determined to win back his money. Any simpleton could have just beaten the duo up and taken his money by force. . . But pride dictated that he beat them at an actual game. Thus, the zombie man leads the foursome off to the local bar.

Once in, he barks order, forcing each of the customers to clear out. 

". . .Beer. Keep it coming, and don't stop until I say so. . ." At once, the clerks are bringing about carts filled with manly beer, and settling it on the table. They form, with the alcoholic residue sliding down the sleek glass. "First round. . . grab your mugs and drink.."* - Mon Aug 31 12:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) prepares to cheat the system.

". . .To become drunk, one most have the alcohol actually enter their systems. . .I'll just avoid that," the devious drinker thought to himself. Casually, the mug of beer is brought to his lips and chugged down. Indeed, the liquid easily moves down his throat and prepares to head into his stomach. Yet that's where things go differently.

THe threads on the inside of his body contort, and form a circular container. It effective catches the beer just as it's exiting his throat, and thus eliminates the risk of it entering his system.* - Mon Aug 31 12:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts. He didn't like at all that these children were actually holding their alcohol pretty well. Quickly, he goes, downing another another mug, and of course filling the Jiongu Thread-crafted container a bit more. Soon, he might actually have to start taking some alcohol himself.

"Not bad. . .I thought you all would be lightweights."* - Mon Aug 31 12:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on with irritation. Why didn't these people just lose already? Opting to keep his threads unoccupied, Zetsumo actually chugs this mug down. It strikes and warms his belly and oddly places the male at ease.

He should drink more often.* - Mon Aug 31 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. He eyes each of the parties individually as they go for the fourth mug of beer. Both parties seem to at least be succumbing to the effects,much to Zesumo's delight.

"My. . .Your faces speak arrogance. But your body language, it unveils your true thought. In time, when you've seen as many people as I have, you read people based just on how they sit," he replies with a slight hiccup. Once more, another mug is downed in no time. He's feeling slightly dizzy, and perhaps will go back to utilizing the threads to fake as if he's drinking.* - Mon Aug 31 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a grin. He could smell it, the duo were reaching their breaking point. They were now on the fifth mug, and by now, Zetsumo had only cheated twice. Casually, the beer is brought to his head, and shamelessly the warrior begins to chug away at the highly potent beer. 

It again sends chills down his body, and warms every cell that seemed to come in contact.

He hiccups again, and proceeds to lose just a bit of cognitive ability. "Mmm. Too dangerous to go further. I'll start to use my threads now, for sure. . . I'll certainly win now," the Zombie Warrior declared mentally. After all, there was still more than enough space in his typically hollowed body to aid in victory.* - Mon Aug 31 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) uses his odd physiology to again take advantage. The beer pours along his tongue and throat, and again slides smoothly into the bowl-shaped gathering of threads. It again saves him from the very real possibility of becoming drunk, as the liquids never quite make it into his systems. 

With a slight slur, Zetsumo begins speaking, wearing an arrogant and proud grin.

". . .Y'know. To save you all the trouble. I'll let you all quit early if you want. I think I have this won. Mmm. . . Lady Luck has finally shown me favor," he shamelessly brags and gives a challenging gaze to both parties.* - Mon Aug 31 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) brow twitches.* - Mon Aug 31 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) takes it easy and cheats once more.

The beer again finds it's way harmlessly filling the container. And by now, it's at it's limit. He likely can only get one additional mug in before he's at risk of overflowing. "Geez. . . I really had to cheat this badly? I'm already pretty tipsy.. . " The zombie thought to himself with disappointment.* - Mon Aug 31 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't take any chances. 

He isn't going to potentially allow himself to spill over the container. Quickly, Zetsumo downs this beer fast, figuring that a quick ingestion would make things all the more easy. 

". . .Katshune is out. . " There's partial slurs, as he's still in the stage of immense tipsiness, rather than drunk.* - Mon Aug 31 13:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grins. Victory is all too clear.

There's a single cup left. The contents fill the mug up to the brink of overspilling. Quickly, his hands manuever and grab the last glass container with haste. Despite the quickness, not a single droplet is spilled, and like Popeye eating spinach, Zetsumo absolutely devours the contents. This one hits  a bit hard, and forces him into a complete drunken stupor. 

". . .Mmm. . . Zeeennnnnnnnnn. Who wonning?" 

As Katsune pushes the empty cup, he goes to grab it, but fails as Kilm does so far too quickly.* - Mon Aug 31 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) he clearly takes the money. They're stored in his suit.

"Two-hundredsh thoushan more."* - Mon Aug 31 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glances towards the whispering duo before he turns back to Katsune.

"Ain't think sha. . . coulda handle alcohol like that. How?" As usual, his words have an overwhelming drawl and slur. The player is just too lazy to convey the dialogue properly.* - Mon Aug 31 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raises a brow. Even while as drunk as can be, he can still register what's going on. Sadly, in this state, there's less of a filter -- which the fiend honestly had on at all times. How else do you think he could co-exists with this maniacs.

Once more, Zetsumo's hand rockets forward to give a rough finger flick to her forehead. ". . . Ay. I'm still your bosh, y'know. . . " He was still the domineering force in this organization, damn it!* - Mon Aug 31 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow.

He quickly stands up, though rises with a wobble. His body sways from side to side. Before long, the towering rogue leader was casting his gaze downward onto the youthful teen. His tendrils -- as you know he so commonly exploited  -- speed out and wrap around Katsune's ankles. 

Assuming success, he lifts the small girl upward, allowing her body to hang upside down. Her face would more or less be on level with his stomach.

A finger goes, flickin' the elementalist on the nose now. ". . .I'm not? . . .Not what my dad taught me. I'm more strong. . . and bigger. Tch. . . why would I listen to you,"  the Cursed Thread user declares with that silly slur. Of course, this is just a smidget of insight towards his world view. With a bully-ish smirk, the field keeps Katsune in position, wondering how she'd react to such treatment.* - Mon Aug 31 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raises a brow. He was drunk, not stupid.

"Nah. . . I'mma embarress her. Call me uncle -- nah. . . Call me 'daddy.' Tell me I'm the best in the world," the shinobi declares, seeming a tad-bit childish in his drunken state. While immature, at least it made it known that he had -some- humanity left. . . It was just hidden underneath the angst.

There's a subdued smile, and assuming Katsune complied he would casually allow her body to descend onto the ground. A belch escapes, and his gaze shifts towards Kilm. It sounded like someone was talking shit* - Mon Aug 31 14:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glances at Kilm. Something was different, but he wasn't quite willing to explore it just yet.

Katsune, due to her defiance is still held up with the tendrils. ". . You better hurry and do as I say. . . Man, I'mma remember this when I sober up," Zetsumo warns, lifting the girl higher. He seems to care little of those that are observing him in this state.* - Mon Aug 31 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) allows her to fall down. He wasn't too pleased. ..  but figured this was enough of a victory today. 

"Tch. . . so easy. Whatever. . . I'mma. . . go take a rest. When I get back up, we'[re having a discussion. All of you -- in reference to the attack yesterday." He proceeds towards the exit.* - Mon Aug 31 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Nothing was happening. He just looked forward to the unmoving entity. Calmly, Zetsumo turned, facing Sabo in his approach.

". . .What's with the toad?"* - Mon Aug 31 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"But to each their own. I've used it several times, each withotu detection."* - Mon Aug 31 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns. 

"Heading to the training field. ." He proceeds off.* - Mon Aug 31 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Then do so. I am thoroughly amused. . . Perhaps your disappointment in my summoning will take a shift when you see my new technique. . . It is nearly complete and will put me on an entirely new plain of power, woman," Zetsumo speaks in a whimisical tone, yet it's laced with subtle rage. He was a man that took himself serious, thus the belittlement of the duck summoning creatures -- HIS duck summons, rather. . . Left the brutish warrior a bit sour.

"In fact . Yes. I doubt you will be able to defeat the new creature I'll have in single combat."* - Mon Aug 31 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. He had finally awoken from his hangover, and speeds around. Eventually, Zetsumo would find himself traveling back to the common training grounds. With a poof, the shinobi lands on the sandy grounds, his eyes shifting to Katsune seconds after.

Vaguely. . . he recalls what had transpired earlier in the day.* - Mon Aug 31 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilted his head. Even with no facial expressions denoting emotion, he fcould tell that the woman was in higher spirits. Arms folded, Zetsumo looked on with a scrutinizing gaze.

"I recall the recent trip to the bar. . ."

His finger points forward. "You are exceptionally haughty when intoxicated. I suppose. . .  Alcoholic substances reveals one's true character as there is no filter. . . no thoughts in your actions." Zetsumo's nose wrinkles, it's hard to read him by now. The male is both amused, yet irked -- even if the action could be blamed on the alcohol, she was still pretty defiant.* - Mon Aug 31 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) chortles. He loved it. His arms remained folded as Katsune's entire demeanor had taken a turn, a complete one-hundred-eighty degrees. The fact that with a simple gesture, he could change someone's entire mood was a sign of great power --- and immensely stroked the warrior's ego.

"Oh how quickly your demeanor changes. . .Oi. . . I can't remember though. What was I even doing before I decided to stop short cause of my headache. . ." He paces back and forth, and eyes Kitora. She was there, no?

"I'd suppose you could remember."* - Mon Aug 31 23:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook hsi head. He was legitimately having trouble remember, simply because the confrontation came towards the end. A hand rises, rubbing his head. . . but it's all futile.

"Hrn. I can't recall. . . I believe I was trying to shake you down. . .Mmm," Zetsumo murmurs. He's irritated, as his favorite past time was harrassing those with defiance, and humiliating them -- just ask Kitora. WIth a shrug, the male allows the situation to drop for a bit. 

"Mmm. I'll remember it later. What have you all done in the downtime? Things came up, so I wasn't quite able to assign the contract. .. But believe me, it'll be worth your time. "* - Tue Sep 01 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze.

"The current crop is fine."* - Tue Sep 01 00:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) motions towards Katsune. "You understimate the development of my men. For example. . . THis one here is progressing nicely. She'd be able to give you a run for your money."* - Tue Sep 01 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folds his arms. 

"In fact. . I am curious. You two will wage battle for my interest--" He pauses, and turns towards the ever-elusive Mukade.

"What is it?"* - Tue Sep 01 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was never one to jump the gun. He was still suspicious. With the latest development, it was clear that in the end, Zetsumo really could trust no one but himself.

"Kitora, sense around, see if this is a henge. Or if there are any one in the nearby area. Likewise, this could be a trap, as I realize. . .. all of this is too good to be true. Thankfully, my summons excel in scouting as they can be sent out in large numbers and aren't typically chakra costly."

Abruptly, he moves, giving a cross chop to the woman's rib to try and disrupt any potential illusion or henge. Paranoia at it's finest.* - Tue Sep 01 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his eyes. "She checks out. We will move with caution, Kitora, Katsune. You will be with me. Arriving at the front gate, you have three minutes. . ." With that, chakra flares and he speeds off.* - Tue Sep 01 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stops short. He presses his hands against the ground, sensing the floor for any traps.

". . .Hrm?"* - Tue Sep 01 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) presses his hands together after gathering up blood. Five seals are done, repeatily, and thus several ducks are eventually spawned. 

"Mmmm. . . Place the village on high alert. . " The Kenryoku leader spoke, looking towards a nearby Amegakure NPC. Quickly, the grunt was off, doing just as instruction. The entire village was on high alert, and they kept eyes peeled for anything that could be seen in the forest.

Meanwhile, an entire flock of birds are in. Each with silly names. ". . .Take towardst he skies. The individual we are looking for is a teenager. He seems to be battle damaged, so look for anyone that is resting or moving with a visible limp and so forth. Go."

With a flutter, their wings flap and each are on their way.* - Tue Sep 01 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
After thirty minutes, three or four of theb irds manages to return, with woeful declaration. 

"Sir. . . So far. There is nothing--" 

He doesn't even allow them to complete the sentence. "GO LOOK HARDER!" His eyes shift over to Kitora and Katsune, and more ploys go about his head. "...Mm. Has your stealth improved any, Kitora?"* - Tue Sep 01 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) frowns. This was becoming a pain. . .None of the birds had managed to find the target. Nevertheless, even as they tired, Zetsumo was adamant in closing up loose ends.

"Mmmm. . . I'm at a lost of what to do. I'll start sending out Hunter shinobi. . . and i'll make it so his entire existence is a danger. If anyone is up to the task, I will grant you all a three-day grace period to go look for him. Although, I am not assigning the mission myself. . . it seems like a set up."* - Tue Sep 01 01:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs.

He summons two more ducks, this time younger and much smaller. "Take these with you. If the going get tough, they can escape and provide information. They're small, so you can hide them anywhere."* - Tue Sep 01 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) poofs away. He goes to conduct business, before eventually returning. What was done?* - Tue Sep 01 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't even face her.

"You are not."* - Tue Sep 01 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says nothing. His arms remained folded, and he looked onto the distance, as if his prey he so desperately sought to capture would once more turn to the gate for a battle. Sadly, we all knew that wasn't going to happen.

Clearly, in Mukade's extended absence, things had changed, in both Zetsumo's view, but as well as in the manner in which the Kenryoku was ran. The Zombie warrior remained silent up until the insect wielder was just a step away from being out of hearing range.

"Oi. In your absence, you are aware of the policy changes. . . Yes?"* - Tue Sep 01 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues to speak with his back turned. He hadn't the time, nor care to bother looking at the woman -- one he deemed to be a failure to him by this point.

"Mm. . . All that you are required to know is a change in hierarchy. Beth. . . Zenaki, yourself. . . It all means nothing. In the Kenryoku there is only Zetsumo -- then everyone else. No one is above the next. . . Disputes are encouraged to be solved independently. Else, I get involved. Then no one has a good time."

He falls silent right after, and continues with the thousand-yard stare.* - Tue Sep 01 01:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) still remains motionless. In his time, he had found granting trust to any individual person was a lost cause -- it gave them too much power. Too much leverage. 

Calmly, Zetsumo continues his gaze into the distance. Each step she took could be seen as symbolism, as it not only increased the physical distance between the two, but accurately depicted the growing rift that went on a mental and emotional level. Odd how at one point she was perhaps the closest thing the fiend had to a true friend.* - Tue Sep 01 01:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on. He seemed unphased, or ignorant to most of the happenings in the real word. It was like an invisible box was forming about his frame, blocking him off from the world. On the inside, the brute's soul churned with anguish and grief. This life was a lonely one -- yet it was necessary.

To get what he desired. . . It all hinged on him. At the end of the day, everyone else was a potential liability.* - Tue Sep 01 01:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stood there like a statue. He's just staring. . . and staring. . . and staring.

Then at last, Katsune is able to crack through his shell. ". . .Threat or not. He is a traitor, and I will find him and kill him. It is funny. . . despite living among me for five years. . . You hardly know a thing about me. . ." At last, the gaze is pried from the north and set onto the petite, purple-haired elementalist before him.

"If it came down to it. . . I would kill my own kin for betrayal. POwer. ..  Age. . . Gender. It matters little. What does matter is dealing with a kitten. . . before it can become a lion," he makes no commentary about Beth. She was a zealot to his cause, and would much rather suicide then do anything detrimental to the grand plan.* - Tue Sep 01 01:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"I don't care for his potential. . .The principle of the matter is what counts. Besides, he just came here with the intent on murdering one of my men. That can't be forgiven. Quit trying to protect him."* - Tue Sep 01 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze.

"There are two types of people in this world. The predatory and the prey. I am the chief. . . the king of my jungle. And no one will ever knock my down."* - Tue Sep 01 02:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wears a simper.

"I've been fortunate to find some very. . . specific people. Even with my distrust. . . They seem to blindlessly be subserviant to me. Even those that apparently hold animosity. . ."* - Tue Sep 01 02:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is arrogant. He leaps onto the wall to gain a better view of the land.

"I am certainly right. . . "* - Tue Sep 01 02:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues looking forward, seemingly still giving her the cold shoulder.

"What is it?"* - Tue Sep 01 02:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns at last. He's skeptical as always, considering the growing paranoia. "Then speak."* - Tue Sep 01 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) a string of threads shoot out, wrapping along the waist. He doesn't tell her where they will go, just to avoid the risk of someone else finding out.* - Tue Sep 01 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) removes his grip of course. His body remains tensed, ready for anything that could go wrong. "Speak with haste."* - Tue Sep 01 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept a blank expression, inspite of how disheartened Mukade seemed to be. His arms were folded, and there was a few inches purposely placed inbetween them to provide some breathing room.

". . .No one is completely trusted by me anymore. If this about the shift in hierarchy. . . My reasoning is simple, the Kenryoku was in need of change. I realized with the recent betrayal that things were going south because i was unattentive. Now? I must micromanage everything. . . My suspicion is simple. You and Neal were close, thus I express caution, particularly when the subject involves the little weasal," Zetsumo says in a neutral tone. He speaks no emotion, which was just a method to suppress rage -- as in truth, he blamed the Aburame personally for the defection.* - Tue Sep 01 03:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"How naive. .. While it is true that doing so would have given me great pleasure. That would not solve the issue. . .  To completely eliminate the risk, I must accept the burden of shouldering the load. . ." His arms fall flat, allowing his hands the opportunity to ball into a fist. The change is anything but subtle, and prompts his knuckles to crack.

"Mmm. . . though if you keep insisting, I suppose I will indulge you. At times, it's almost as if you enjoy being punished. . ."* - Tue Sep 01 03:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stared on with a solemn expression. He was tight-lipped, and remained on his best behavior as one of the most loyal  employees.

". . .To feel that way is ignorant. Yes, it is your doing that inspired my changes. Yet. . . In what way does it make your servitude to this point meaningless? I am not a fan of the overly dramatic, dear," Zetsumo states calmly, the anger in him was subsiding just a tad, yet he would never allow his guard to go down again -- it was just how cautious he was growing as of late.

"You've done well -- and your servitude, despite the blunder, is why I stayed my hand. It is why I didn't lash out at you. Be glad that I was that understanding, woman," he took offense. In his own twisted view, Zetsumo had done right by the woman. He hadn't attacked her, nor subjected the Aburame to tedious examination. Yet she had the right to be angry at him?

"Pursuing would have done little, I doubt you could keep up with his shunshin. Yet it begs the question, if his leg was injured, how could the technique even be used properly? It is still running, after all. . . I suppose it does not matter. In anycase, I will end the conversation on this. . " He pauses, gathering his thoughts. In the meantime, Zetsumo -- ever the manipulator -- takes a hand, and gently pats the woman the cheek.

"My actions are not an attempt to punish nor harm you. Things have just changed. . . No longer are you the 'Queen' you are at the same position as everyone else. If you truly are for me, then you will accept the role."* - Tue Sep 01 03:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"It is both amusing and disappointing that you see it that way."

He begins and takes a dramatic pause. Mukade's gaze met his, but even then he kept that detached look, preferring to dispel the issues with reasoning and logic, rather than appealing to the Aburame's emotion for once. "Simply because the amount of sway you hold in the organization has shifted does not mean my view has changed. You are still the same person i've known for years -- just no longer can you freely manipulate our underlings."

It was a simple response. He exhales, seemingly irritated as he didn't often waste time in allowing his accomplices to complain and air their issues. 

"At the end. . . You are no tool, but an ally. I don't want to see this being an issue any longer, do you understand?" the fiend speaks up once again, after a moment of pause. His body is losing tension, as the situation seems to be unwindingly, at least from his perspective.* - Tue Sep 01 04:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Judging by the tone, you remain unsatisfied with my explanation. But that is all I have to offer, what I speak is the truth. You simply must learn to accept it. I suppose that is all?" He turns towards the south and seems ready to leave. If anything, they were still in square one. The only difference being that Zetsumo was less angry, as the Aburame at the very least came to explain how it all happened.

However. . . Their relationship was still as rocky and uncertain as it was before the brief chat. Only time would tell if it would recover, or perhaps deteriorate even further.* - Tue Sep 01 04:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stops just before exitting the door.

"That's a broad question. In all honesty, if there was a reason to lie, I would do it. Yet this is not one of those times. . . You're simply behaving as if you're some insecure school girl. . .It's childish." His head turns, and he eyes Mukade in a skeptical manner. It's a look that begs the question 'Are we done?'* - Tue Sep 01 04:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) still looked on with that neutral expression. 

"Good. I'm glad we ironed things out-- And yes, I realize our relation. I realize the bond you hold to me, and it is why I've simply only 'demoted' rather than beat you to an inch of your life," He turns, still wearing a face of neutrality and ensuring that each humanly emotion remained shut off.

Although, Mukade's devotion was touching in a way. It appealed to both the human-side that he swore he didn't have. . . But also appealed to the Zetsumo's controlling nature. If she loved him, she was that much more susceptible to do his bidding, no matter how idiotic or cruel. 

"Mmm. . . Now then. I suppose this meeting is adjourned. ."* - Tue Sep 01 04:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. "It would do little. Any aggresion I've felt for the shortcomings has already been dealt with. Fortunately for you, I was able to 'express' myself on others. Not to say I'm not angry. . . Although, simply not enough to pulverize you," the shinobi admits. His body turns, allowing his gaze to fall direct onto Mukade.

He noticed, she seemedi ntent on keeping the conversing going. Perhaps due to the lack of contact they've had over the last few weeks?* - Tue Sep 01 04:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs. Although it expresses amusement, moreso than annoyance. By now, he's face to face with the feminine mercenary.

"Mmm. . . By now, you should know not to be shy. . ." His gaze falls downward, meeting Mukade's own visage. "If you want something, ask for it." The comment is suggestive, and he's leaning in close, 'invading her bubble' if you will. Gently, with the collision, Zetsumo is pushing the girl back in the direction of the wall.* - Tue Sep 01 05:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rolled his eyes subtly. He knew what she was suggesting -- or at least assumed he did. "Mmm. . . It has been so long. In truth, despite my annoyance towards you, you've been missed. In more ways than one," the Zombie Shinobi declared. Before long, he would pushed Mukade until there was no other way to go. Her back is tethered to the ground, and his body -- typically cold -- pressed against her own form.

At times, it was as if there was no heat being produced.

Until his adrenaline got going. The development of heat is in the obvious area, right at his crotch, and he's practically grinding against the slender woman with that appendage. "Relieve me, then." A simple command.* - Tue Sep 01 05:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's body remained almost motionless as her nimble hands invaded his clothing and beelined right towards his cock.

It's hot to the touch, and pulsates eagerly -- a tell-tell sign of how long it's been since he's even bothered with tending to bodily needs. The strokes garner pleasant coos and hums, and by then Zetsumo is having troubling staying put. His hips shake, and with each teasing the excitement is boiling over.

Mukade would easily feel the muscles in his cock contracting, forcing out clear, thick and sticky pre-cum. The bulk dribble ttowards the right, and likely soaks his cloth, although a good liter or so manages to slide down his length, and with the strokes, lubricate his flesh right from the jump.

From start the finish, Zetsumo is humming in a subdued fashion, as if he didn't want to let her know that she was doing a splendid job. In response, a single finger is held out, with sharpened threads coming from the top. A swipe is delivered, cutting through cloth, as the male can't seem to wait to have her body exposed for his own joy and pleasure.* - Tue Sep 01 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunted as Mukade saw it fit to assault his weak-spot. 

Although, it brought more pleasure than actual torment -- contrary to what the woman had intended. As her grip tightened, there's an increased in heat, and the constant pulsating or twitching grows more violent.

"You say that. . . Like you're in the dominant position, 'dear'," He says with emphasis, chuckling inbetween the light pants. "I know it's been long. . . But honestly, you haven't forgotten the order of things." His cock comes in contact with flesh -- though it isn't quite where he wanted.

A devious chuckle resonates. "I think I want it somewhere different now." Judging by where his stitch-riddled hands had traveled, onto her bum, it was clear what the brute was suggesting. "Stick me in." He didn't seem to be asking, that was for sure. In the meantime, he entertains himself, eying the Kiiro's developed features. The hand that was free migrates to her breasts, and pinches at the nipple, giving a squeeze as payment for her own domineering treatment.* - Tue Sep 01 05:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"That's it. . " He said with a calm tone, content that they were finally resuming their old roles. "Really thought you thought you were in control," taunted Zetsumo in a partially playful tone -- but he's clearly serious.

Each second of descent forces more of his beefy cock to impale Mukade's bum, and as it constricts, his cock jumps, though as no place to go. Still. . . this proved to be unsatisfaction, despite the pleasant and primal grunts released. Instictively, he sends threads out, to press against her shoulders and hips, pinning her effectively against the wall.

Quickly, Zetsumo moved beyond this. His hips wind back, before bucking forward and violently forcing his gargantuan member to plunge deep into the woman's anus. All twelve inches are plowed through, relentlessly and seemingly with no regards to how this may feel. As the abuse of her bum went on,  he seems to get particularly handsy, and continues to assault her breasts, giving gently squeeze to the pleasantly-sized mounds, only to eventually target the nipples once more. The pinches grow more violent, and he looks on with a deviously amused gaze.

"You're a bit quiet. Do you like this?" chimed the brute admist the fast-paced thrusts. The bulk of his attention is on her face to gauge the reaction.* - Tue Sep 01 06:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Continued thrusting, with his eyes glued onto Mukade's facial feature. This was like heaven to him, as it always fed his ego, and of course placed him in a dominant positioning. His thrusts seem to never lack in power, and his stamina at some point appear to never faulter or deterioate over the course. By now, it's clear Zetsumo functions solely on desire and adrenaline. With a last thrust, each inch of cock meat is stuffed in her heiny, and his hips rotate, causing his length to girate while inside. The male comes to a rest.

A hand moves from her teats at last, and proceeds to give vicious whips striking her ass whenever it was possible. 

"Mmm. .. Always so submissive. I will give you more. . . But you must show that you really want it. Beg me. . . Ask me as if your life depends on it. Remove this facade that you are in a position of dignity. Embrace the reality that you are my slut," He demands, speaking in a cold and calculated fashion. It's hard to tell, does he honestly see her this way or was the lust dictating his speech? His gaze was casted down, meeting her Topaz-titned eyes.

* - Tue Sep 01 06:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grinned with amusement. 

"Good girl." 

Once more, he'd proceed with the seemingly endless rounds of thrusts, and continued to wear her ass out for the better part of an hour. They would have shifted in positioning, with the last being 'Doggy-style.' Towards the end, the brute is finally at his climax, and releases his spunk onto her bum and back. She's left on the floor.

"Ah. It was great catching up. . .I'm going to go. ..  look around. Take your time in resting," he speaks casually as he leaves Mukade as a cum-covered mess.* - Tue Sep 01 06:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"I'm going to be severely disappointed if you found him and lost."* - Tue Sep 01 15:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) diverts his eyes to the side. 

". . .You're pushing your luck, y'know. I'd prefer you don't ask. But if you do, it's futile. There will be no answer, I won't entertain some rivalry or your obsession with the woman."* - Tue Sep 01 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perks a brow. He moves, and grips around her neck.

"There are things worse than death. . ."* - Tue Sep 01 17:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) the grip of Kitora's neck only tightens, as the airways are slowly being restricted. Using herculean strength, he's able to lift her into the air, while wearing a smile. "I see then, you've become resistant to normal means of torture. Perhaps on the physical level. But what of the mental, the spiritual?" He asks with a devious grin. 

"Or have you forgotten some of my methods, when my spawn was being produced? That is simply the tip of the iceberg. ."

His hand flicks, letting go of the tightening grip and prompting Kitora to descend.* - Tue Sep 01 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) just stares on incredulously. 

". . .Why would I do that? The objective would be solely for you -- and you no longer hold attachment to your 'senpai.' Thus that would be futile. .  No, for you. I would simply work to show you your true place.  . ." He speaks crypically. Although the plans could be guessed easily -- humiliation. To destroy her self-esteem. . . After all, she could only act with so much bravado because she felt some sort of self-worth.* - Tue Sep 01 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose. 

"My, you have good suggestions. But no. . . I wouldn't use a crowd. This would be for your punishment, not their's. . ." He states, throwing a shot. "Although, yes. Since you seem so confident, I will rectify the issue -- but not now. Mmm, later today, though. i'd suppose," Zetsumo states casually. He did like a challenge, although Kitora's arrogance had developed too far.* - Tue Sep 01 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) he proceeds to the north, and whistles, beckoning the girl like a dog.* - Tue Sep 01 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

He poofs into the area, his eyes shifted onto Katsune. "Oh. . . There you are. You seem to be more accessible than the other shinobi as of late. Nevertheless, I come to you for one reason. To train, there is yet another technique I wish to add onto your repetoire -- a chakra flow technique. After all, you'll be needing it," Zetsumo warns, although cryptically. The Kenryoku have remained inactive for too long -- soon, it was going to be time to make moves.* - Tue Sep 01 18:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) copies the gesture.

"You look and speak as if you don't want to learn from me. Be grateful, girl," he says with irritation. Geez, everyone was annoying him today. Was it just one of those moods? He proceeds south and heads towards the usual training grounds.* - Tue Sep 01 19:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is moreso annoyed at someone else. He's just taking it out on Katsune. "Meet me at the fields."

Poof! His body disappears in a plum of smoke.* - Tue Sep 01 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had been sitting in the center of the field indian style. After a few minutes, Katsune had finally caught up, much to his chargin. "I thought speed was a great qualities of your's. . .What took so long?"He replies with that saem grouchy tone. A hand motions down, directing the girl to take the same position as he.* - Tue Sep 01 19:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. 

"Right. . . Right. The technique in question is a bit lower-leveled than things you're probably used to by now. It's D rank. . . Yet the application of the skill can be of use, depending on the scenario. Introductions aside, the name is commonly referred to as Raiton flash. . . Now I will walk you through it."

As he was an expert in the technique, and quite competent in Raiton techniques all together, no seals are formed. On the inside, chakra is being kneaded and built up, gathering a high enough quantity to account for every inch of his size-able figure. ". . .To begin. One must be able to gather up a decent chunk of chakra. If you can do this, the next portion isn't much unlike Shunshin. The energy is to be evenly distributed, and siphoned into the air. No, it doesn't not take mastery of the tenketsu to be enabled. All you must do it release chakra from one point and spread it. ."

He gives a clear visible example, albeit it likely looks far simpler than expected. A light blue-silhouette of energy  overwhelms his body, giving the impression that his skin had ultimately changed. The release of chakra had initially started from the abdomen, yet the migration was a short and trivial process. 

"Mimic me. Mind you, in a real fight, this can be done almost instantly. . . As getting the chakra in place is the easy part."* - Tue Sep 01 19:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stares.

And stares some more. Once more, his hand stretches out and gives a harsh finger flick to the forehead. "You're moving too fast-- and take those damn gauntlets off," the domineering brute demands. "Your body will be a weapon. You don't need it. What more, you failed to follow instructions. I didn't ask for you to release Raiton, as that part isn't to come just yet. Pre-maturely developing the electrical current makes it so the lightning spawns from your flesh -- and while that can be a good outcome, the jutsu typically is used different," the sensei scolds.

He picks it back up from the top, semeingly having no desire to wait further for the young kunoichi.

"Anywho. . . once you spread the chakra, it's simple. . .You ignite the nature transformation. As your neutral energy is spreaded, you force the vibration and develop Raiton not only in the air, but also around your figure. It's excellent for nin-tai, and other usage. Of course, with enough skill, you can do this with no handsign at all. If this proves difficult, a single 'Ram' handseal should enable you to focus your chakra well enough."

Zetsumo grows silent after the explanation. He hadn't expected any questions, as this was just a trivial technique. Something any Raiton elemen talist should be able to do easily.* - Tue Sep 01 19:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow at the remark. He couldnt quite make it out.

"Speak up next time, 'dear.'" The title is said in an almost condescending fashion, perhaps to egg her own. After all, everyone knew Zetsumo loved to challenge fiesty people -- although simply just to break them down.* - Tue Sep 01 19:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wached with a diligent stare. He knew Katsune had the ability, it would just take some coaching. 

"What in the world are you doing? -- Don't let words distract you, wench. SImply focus on the task at hand. You got a grasp at it, but tank that single mass of energy and spread it thin. Chakra is very compress-able. . . What looks like a small amount is actually quite a few volts of energy. Keen in on that energy, and evenly spread it out in each direction. . ." He says calmly in hopes of guiding Katsune in the right direcetion. 

Patience was key.* - Tue Sep 01 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead, even as Kitora spoke.

His eyes are seasoned, and remain enabled to locate and precisely tell what errors were being performed. Yet color him surprised. After ten minutes, the jutus is completed, albeit in a novice level. 

"Mmm. Good, as usual, I expect you to practice this on your own time. There is much more development needed to be done. Now then. . . I suppose I will have you help me with something else." His eyes shift to Kitora.* - Tue Sep 01 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) points a finger at Katsune. It balls out. ..  and prepares for a flick.

"Don't be a coward. I'm giving you permission. Think. . . Something, anything."* - Tue Sep 01 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't necessarily require it to be perverted. Just humiliating.

"Hurry. .."* - Tue Sep 01 20:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"You're thinking too. . . maturely. What I ask for is not mandatory sexual. But something to teach her -- to humiliate. Try again," he says, clearly not through with his questioning.* - Tue Sep 01 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his gaze.

"And here I thought you had such an imagination. T'is a pity," Zetsumo replies. He yawns, eventually falling content with making the girl a human-dog. But would that be enough?
* - Tue Sep 01 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs. "You are dismissed if you wish, Katsune. Kitora, you remain with me. i'll gather then ecessary provisions. . . and begin making plans."* - Tue Sep 01 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Right. First thing I want to discuss is a move on Sunagakure. Any information you can share based on your brief time there? Such as the potential holding cell. . . an estimation of Sunagakure's numbers?"* - Tue Sep 01 21:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs.

"The calm before the storm. The era of peace that this land has afforded. . . Will soon come to an end. . " He looks ahead, staring into the horizon. Clearly, the fiend of a warrior is in thought, contemplating many things. He couldn't remain impassive for much longer.* - Tue Sep 01 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) eyes fall onto the Katana. "I vaguely recall you using it in the. . . the last 'bout? I think. . ." Zetsumo murmured quietly. Indeed, admist the Demon attack, when he wasn't kicking ass, the shinoibi had actually taken notice of of the swordsmen impressive skill. With the usage of chakra flow.

Arms folded, the warrior makes no moves and doesn't even seem apt on defending himself. 

". . . You are criminally slow. That's a poor ingredient for a warrior that is based solely on dominating in close-quarter-combat," scolded the far more experienced combatant. As usual, he wasn't going to move a muscle. He -wanted- this to end up in close-ranged. "Those of Sunagakure will make short work of you at this rate. . ." He seemed genuinely disappointed now, as there was more to be expected from the former test-subject.* - Tue Sep 01 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) remains stoic. 

He builds up chakra, an d guides it towards every individual celli n his body. Immediately after, the charka is manipulated into the Doton nature type. Considering the cells held atoms just like any earthly construct, Zetsumo holds a degree of control over the cell's attributes -- namely the hardness. Casually, his skin gained a brown color, mimicking common stone, and of course greatly improving defensive qualities. If not greatly powered, the Wind-infused Katana would prove futile.

It clanks, and likely recoils. . .

"My turn!"

In no time, the warrior's knee is sent forward. A milisecond before landing, it too gains an earthly shell, greatly improing the strength, and overall power of the physical blow. The knee in general aims to strike right against the boy's stomach, andp erhaps hold enough power to send his frame skidding away. "Take this! Come, do not let me best you at your own game. In fclose-quarter-combat!" Zetsumo barked, hoping to instill a sense of purpose in the young swordsman.* - Tue Sep 01 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. In all honesty, he could easily have just kept the battle going with a simple Domu -- but that would be too easy.

He had to completely and utterly test Sabo's limit. The second the boy is pressing forward, Zetsumo kicks from the ground. His body is accelerating towards the east, further incraesing the distance, and granting more than enough room to breath. In a single instance, the elemental master's hand flickered through five seals seamlessly. Admist the hand formations, his lungs contracted, being filled with oxygen along side Katon-based chakra.

Upon exhaling? Things got interest. A literal shower of smallKaton spheres were being ricocheted from Zetsumo's maw. THey moved with surprising quickness, and even seemed to curve, based solely on the ninjutsu user's thoughts. Dozens upon dozen litter the area, forcing Sabo to make decision. To continue his pursuit even with the incoming flames -- or to actually attempt evasion. Tirelessly, Sumo kept with the firepower, unleashing round after round.

(Like 30 Fireballs)* - Tue Sep 01 23:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued to look on into the distance.

"Soon. . ."* - Wed Sep 02 02:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) poofed into the area. Contrasting Katsune's laid back, and uninterested demeanor, Zetsumo seemed to be in constant thought. He was anxious, though not nervous. At last, the era of peace was going to come to an end.

QUickly, he looks to the habitually day-dreaming Kunoichi. "You there, I trust you've honed all of your techniques to an acceptable level." Good ol' Zetsumo, always business talk upon arriving. He seemed to have little chill.* - Wed Sep 02 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his gaze. "I'd hope so. Your life may very well depend on it in the coming days. Practice. . . not for my sake, but your own. My power, while great, is not infallible. I may not be able to shoulder the entire burden myself."* - Wed Sep 02 04:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. He tilted his cranium in confusion. 

"I suppose it is to be expected. Despite your development. . . you are but a child. I shouldn't anticipate you putting this together in a rational fashion. . .Mmm. Prepare, as I've said."* - Wed Sep 02 04:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wears a giant smile.

"You overstimate your worth. He didn't come here for you -- he didn't even care. No. . . there was a greater reason. Do you wish to know?"* - Wed Sep 02 04:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The stitches along his mouth stretch to the brink, as a giant smile is developed, reaching from ear to ear. He's grinning -- and boy, this is something you'd rarely see from the behemoth. It's as if he's been watching Dave Chappelle for the first time. The chuckle, for all intents, is somewhat hoarse, as his voicebox was necessarily used to such a jovial sound.

"There is no maybe. . I've comfirmed it all. Going further. . .With Osamu captive. You know what was bartered? Osamu's life for Mukade. . .He didn't even think of you. And it's all logical thinking. At the end of the day, Orakuru isn't what you think he is. He is a man driven by his natural or primal desires. Do you think he loved you? No. . . He simply saw a female his age that gave him the time of day -- and likely just sought to bed you. It's a cruel reality, he sought Mukade not only due to the stronger bond. . . But her capabilities. As it stands now, she is more versatile, and a more capable combatant than you are.  . ." 

The Zombie-esque fighter spoke in a genuinely calm tone. At times, his voice would take a tone that suggested pity, as he honestly believed everything said -- and there was clear evidence.

"He--" he stops short, giving Katsune time to respond.* - Wed Sep 02 04:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gains a grin.

"You are going into battle."* - Wed Sep 02 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glares.

"It's a simple formality. He is guilty. . . and I will kill him. Same with the SUnagakure shinobi that refuse to turn him in. I dislike. . . your defiance."

His arms are held behind his back, and a steady step forward. "You work for me. . . Not him. Your loyalties lay with ME. . . Not HIM. He is a criminal. . .And I've shown proof that he doesn't even care about you. Yet you continue with denial. . " His voice is raising. At the heart of it, he wasn't so much made at Katsune's unwillingness. . .After all, how else would someone react to having to kill their best friend.

Rather, Zetsumo remained irritated with the perhaps skeptical loyalty. He blamed himself for this, however, due to not being more involved in the Kenryoku's daily lives.* - Wed Sep 02 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) somewhat makes assumptions. Simply due to the Psuedo-Kazekage's unwillingness to comply.* - Wed Sep 02 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) paces back and forth.

"You've yet to see true power then. If only you were here in the latest attack."

Towards the north, there would be a larger, blackened stain on the floor. Burns. It seemed to take up the a large portion of the field.

"My. . . If you honestly hold that belief. . ."* - Wed Sep 02 05:09:07 2015
