"It is unfortunate that the actions of your previous leaders. . . Dictate that you all will suffer. This is a reasonable assessment. . .Don't you agree? After all. . . As Kirigakure murdered hundreds upon thousands, I sincerely -doubt- you were opposing the efforts. . ." He says, eyes narrowed.

You can tell he took particular offense to Kirigakure's action as a whole. Again and again, Zetsumo had been forced to witness atrociosities committed by the mist village. Yet imagine his surprise when the previous Kage -- apparently held amnesia, and was mystified at the fact that there were indeed people that sought to destroy their nation.

"Regardless. . I suppose that's besides the point. Terms and conditions. I don't have many demands."* - Sun Sep 20 20:05:58 2015

". . .Then this is unfortunate. As your village only has two options. Surrender or continue to die. . . " He says, his nose flaring once the ultimatum had been delivered.

His eyes casually move about, taking note of the number of individuals, as well as who in particular were about -- and yes, he's wary of looking at Ushinawa too. Not getting caught slipping. 

"Now then. . .I believe I brought you here to discuss terms of surrender. I won't just allow you to get off clean after all the work I've put in to actually be in possession to potentially win the conflict. ." There's a pause. After some thought, Zetsumo continued, hopefully putting to rest any silly idea that he would just allow Kirigakure to co-exist.

"My first demand. Noriko and the Hogo Clan. I want them delivered to me."

For a second, Zetsumo again is in thought.

"Lastly. Kirigakure army will be dissolved. I will spare the 'innocent'. But no longer will your village's military function. I want to have my troops moved inward. Of course. . . you can decline and resist. At the cost of thousands more being killed in combat. It is your choice. . . I am willing to continue battling until my body can simply go no further.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) starting off, he does five seals.

After gathering some blood, a massive, blue-feathered duck is spawned. It's easily big enough to carry an entire squadrons.

Soon after, tendrils are speeding from his body, and wiggling about in the air. "I hope you all don't mind . .Just insurance. These will be utilized to bind you."* - Sun Sep 20 21:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And suddenly, the strings speed out, binding each of Koeki's and Akemi's limbs-- hopefully.

Assuming success, Zetsumo's duck (with a load of people) begins to flap it's wings, moving onward to the border of Kirigakure. Considering Koeki's agreement, once she follow through, thousands of men that had been stationed along the edges proceed inward to secure the land.

Kirigakure was now being occupied.

Cue gliding towards the village's hotspot.* - Sun Sep 20 21:27:02 2015

And so it begins.

By now, his massive duck summoning was descending. Ontop? Was Zetsumo himself. He held two captives -- Akemi and Koeki.  "Kirigakure. The terms are simple. Your Mizukage has surrendered your village to myself. Submit, and bloodshed will be kept to a minimal."

And of course, had there been any grunt soldiers around, Zetsumo's own grunts would be placed in order to deal with such.* - Sun Sep 20 21:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) forms a single seal. He's just as ready as Kenshin was.

"Please. . .Make my day. How many will I be killing on this evening," the male pondered to himself.

"And that much is true. Yet do not answer my question with another question. Submit."* - Sun Sep 20 21:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had given warnings.

Seemed Kirigakure, was keen on being resistant. And thus. . .Not only would Kenshin and  Hassan have to suffer? But so did the innocent by standards. One rotten apple ruins to batch.

No thought at all is given, a few more seals are completed and without question, the male turns his head on over to Akemi and Koeki. "You should have more control of your men. You all will burn!" the beast thought with pity.

Massive inferno sought to wash over them, and effectively scorch the two kunoichi alive. It was a shame, the good had to suffer for the misdeed of the rambunctious.
(Dorja)
Simultaneously, Dorja flapped her wings, unleashing a massive gale of wind. It's sharpened, and seeks to inflict damage onto all of those that stood before her. 

(Masks)

And cue masks being unleashed from this point. Four speed downward at a criminal rate of velocity. Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Water -- leaving the Earth to be in his chest. They slam into the ground, and prepare for combat.

Looks on as his masks are destroyed.

He grunts, as each of his hearts are effortlessly taken. Admist that, however, he leaps ahead, while directly channeling earthen chakra to his flesh. Upon landing with a thud, more doton chakra is released into the flooring, prompting spikes along the ground to serve as cover.

Meanwhile, considering Kenshin would be pre-occupied, he has Dorja ascend higher into the air.* - Sun Sep 20 22:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And in comes Hassan.

Quickly, Dorja again flaps her wings, unleashing a stronger gale. It seeks to keep Hassan at bay, as she sought to cover for the rest of the Kenryoku that fled. 

Hit or miss, Dorja was far from a push over. Assuming Hassan had kept at his pursuit? Then she'd aim to manuever about -- even if she was a giant ass target.

Meanwhile. . . Setsuno had fucked up. The second she enters, Zetsumo had descended, and pressed his palms against the ground. Abruptly, additional spikes protruded from the ground, and sought to pierce through each of those summons -- and the real girl herself.

Calling this right now, the real Setsune isn't even here.* - Sun Sep 20 22:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
That duck is knocked right out of the skies.

Assuming anyone was still on the avian?  Would be knocked off. She disperses on impact, saving her own life.

Meanwhile, as the clones are dispersed, Zetsumo at last powers up. THe threads speed on out of his frame, and propels his body upward. There's a stark incline in chakra, no doubt. And certainly, his spiritual force is more powerful as well.

Hassan would rush ahead, likely puncturing his rocky flesh. It manages to make it through his Doton skin. Although, it doesn't get too far.

On impact, more tendrils slash from his body, aiming to wrap about Hassan's neck, even with the Fuuton armor activated.* - Sun Sep 20 23:00:03 2015

Three against one.

Chakra is funneling about his form, and emanating Doton chakra below in order to aid in an attack. The ground was shifting, and mud itself was forming --- Then the Speed Star made his mark.

Unable to keep up, the second Kenshin was around, a vicious kick manages to land on the center of his back. The earthen shell that had been worn is viciously cracked, and all the force eventually travels onto his sternum. There's a loud thud, and eventually, Zetsumo's entire chest had been caved in. 

This subsequently would have taken out his final heart. . . 

The threads about his frame wobble and he eventually loses control. They're like noodles at this point. Subsequently, Zetsumo crashes against the ground, defeated by the hands of Kirigakure. His vision is hazy, and life is fading exceptionally fast.* - Sun Sep 20 23:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And it was over.

He had lost the battle before it even began. Blood pooled out of his frame, and the threads weakly floundered about.

Unlike his previous defeats, however, Zetsumo's soul was not in a state of angst or turmoil. He had been freed. Once more, within his demented mind, it appeared as if the wind about his frame circled. It spiralled for seconds at a time, only to descend just as swift as it had came.

And once it settled? The ghastly apparition of his idol and father had re-appeared. The man known as Hadashi. Eyes narrowed, the ghost-like entity approached, his feets dragging along the ground. "I'm. . . I'm sorry. . ." By now, those that existed around were all shut out. He was essentially in a blackened, emptied plane -- Limbo.

"I--" 

Zetsumo is unable to even finish his sentence before the elderly ghost shushed him. "No. I'm sorry. It's my fault you even ended in that predicament. I'm the one that made you go on some strange crusade to complete my life's work. My dying wish shouldn't have been for you to reform the world. It should have been for you to release your hatred, and find love. To find peace in your life. . ."

". ..But the wo--" 

"And the world is evil, yes. I held the same view as you. . . But I've been watching from here. And as I observed. . .I saw the error in my own way. To truly see change. . . Different groups of people must learn to live together. They have to understand each other. The simple motto of 'might makes right' is flawed. . "

Teary-eyed, the monstrous 'God of War' breaks into sobs. Although, by now, his soul had already passed out. For those on the outside,  they would simply see a lifeless corpse. For the next hour or so, the brute would continue to argue his case, but it was all for naught.

In the end, his hand is taken within Hadashi's and their frames proceed to gain some transparency. In a burst of light, but eventually ascend into the higher realm, entering the purelands. (Nah. . .I'm going to hell.)

However, while this may have marked the end of Zetsumo's reign of terror. His will lives on. When would the next threat arise?* - Sun Sep 20 23:48:41 2015

Zetsumo's lifeless body is carted -- likely missing the head. Every sample or strip of DNA is easily harvested, considering a dead body had zero ways of defending itself.

Nevertheless, his dead body is suited all nicely in a tuxedo.

Once in the casket, all that needs to be done is burial.* - Mon Sep 21 00:04:54 2015

And things went from bad to worse.

Suintegu would likely see Zetsumo's corpse laying in a casket.

Before hand, one of the God of War's loyalist would have slipped away, and try to explain the gravity of the situation. There were measures put into play to prepare for this outcome.

Indeed, bundles of cash had been stored away -- along with a library filled with all of Zetsumo's knowledge. However, before the boy can be led to it, in comes Seisuke.* - Mon Sep 21 00:23:40 2015
