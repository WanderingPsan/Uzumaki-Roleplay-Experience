<br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. Towards the end of her sentence, his grip is taken advantage of. Forcibly, Zetsumo aimed to push her mouth forward, and thus taken in his length.

"Unfortunately, I do not. In addition to this. . . There is satisfaction and defiling someone as loud-mouth as yourself," the male declares, regardless of whether or not his attemtp had proven success. The statement holds clear evidence, as his cock seems exceptionally needy. It continues to pulsate, in rhythm with his various beating hearts.* - Tue Sep 08 08:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts on reflex as her throat clenched around the sizable organ. His hips push a bit, forcing additional inches of his meat to be forced inward. Yet after getting five inches in, Zetsumo comes to a rest. 

There are apparently fatigued pants, as despite the girl's inexperience, Katsune seems to do a good job. 

He would grasp at the sake bottle previously ordered, while somewhat lustfully looking down towards the girl. Eye contact is clearly made, and while Kat held a  look of hopelessness and contempt, Zetsumo's gaze told an entirely different tell. One of amusement, and of course, primal arousal. This was bliss to him.

"You have natural talent for this. Of course. . . I should have seen this coming. Certainly, a woman built like you would be no stranger to such," he says, blatantly insulting the foul-mouthed mercenary. * - Tue Sep 08 08:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He remained engaged with the process. It was clear, people could intelligently infer what was happening, yet others wanted to remain in debelief. For a time, the brute remained passive, letting Katsune do her thing.

Despite this being public, Zetsumo had no issue with getting involved himself. Rather than allowing Katsune the opportunity to service him at her leisure, the domineering male took advantage, forcibly pushing her head forward, while thrusting his hips. He invades her throat without any single ounce of remorse, and continued to do so for three minutes. He wanted to leave a good mark on the woman, and perhaps make her feel below him.

By now, twenty minutes had pass, and the Kenryoku leader is apparently reaching his limit. The pulsating cock is twitching more angrily and aggressive, no doubt seeking to 'express' it's love in a physical manner.

"Good. . . Anywho, prepare yourself. Despite my actions, I don't wish to dirty up the establishment."* - Tue Sep 08 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) aims.

His cock slit is positioned right towards the woman's lips. "Open up," he commands. Assuming compliance, in went the organ. There would be grunts, each in accordance to the number of the times his member pumped out more thick loves juices. It was quite a bit, considering how little time Zetsumo has had to cut loose. Liters upon liters flush out, intent on being gobbled up by the teenager mercenary. 

Of course, there ran the risk of spillage.* - Tue Sep 08 08:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his directioning. 

"Defiance even after you've done it all." The seed would be spilled, although only on Katsune's frame. Mostly her chin or bosom. "Now look what you've done. . "* - Tue Sep 08 08:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Why do I feel you haven't learned?" His threads wrap about her body, shielding her from actually having to leave in this state. THat said, Zetsumo begins to exit with the girl in toe. 

No one makes eye contact, yet there are a few people whispering and pointing. Some even chuckling at Katsune's expense.* - Tue Sep 08 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Subsequently, he arrives at home. Beelining, Zetsumo sets her in the bathroom.

"You may clean yourself up here -- But tell me. Have you learned?" He's legitimately curious, and honestly hopes she hasn't. Simply for future abuse.* - Tue Sep 08 08:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms and rolled his eyes. He leans againsst the wall, eying Katsune through the process, though seems irritated by the lack of response.

"I asked you a question woman. Perhaps you didn't hear me," the male said in an aggressive tone. A finger is held out, and there's a light spark of electricity developed. It's not thrown at all, but serves as a threat. "Speak up."* - Tue Sep 08 08:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Mmm. . . Had I not known better. I would say you would want continued punishment. Don't let my release fool you, I can very well keep things going," he says, again threatening the girl. His voice sounded irritated, yet his soul was filled with joy, these were the types he enjoyed to harras the most. As the satisfaction when they eventually cracked was the greatest feeling in the world.

He closes in, hoping to make uncomfortable.

"Although, I suppose it is safe to assume. You haven't learned." He looks interchangeably inbetween the water, and the womans figure.* - Tue Sep 08 08:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs.

The silence essentially invited him. He still remained in his Jounin-suit. In no time, he steps in, and again slides his now flaccid length out. Stepping forward, the lad presses against her. The height difference makes it so his member is pressing against Katsune's back. Meanwhile, a hand moves, resting on her bum, and giving a squeeze.

"You are. . . very difficult. Much like several of my other underlings were at first," he internally wonders where the attitude had come from -- and curses that it hadn't been around sooner.* - Tue Sep 08 08:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Then learn to listen. Sour or not, I am still your superior."

His lower body continues to shift, and there's a jump in his length. Clearly, arousal is returning at a gradual pace. 

"You make it so easy to want to continue to punish you. Not only are you so. . . insubordinate, yet with a figure like your's, it grows only more enticing," he admits, while still keeping a firm grasp of Katsune's bum. His grip tightens, nonetheless. * - Tue Sep 08 08:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs again.

His hands grip loosens, to allow for passage. A single finger falls, resting just towards the side of her sex, and rubbing.

"Why is it. . . You think you can bargin with me? There are no conditions where I am not dominant. You listen at all times," the male declares in an almost whimsical fashion. Blood continues to build up, and moves towards his stitch-covered member. It's swelling up by the second once more.* - Tue Sep 08 09:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilted his head. The rubbing continues, before eventually, Zetsumo slides over and sensually moves along the girl's sexual organ. It's a gentle process, and only targets her lips. 

"Mmm. I'll stop on one condition, and leave you be. I want you to get onto your knees, and beg for forgiveness. Then I can go, sastified."

Through the conversation, he's still aiming to take a look at her face.* - Tue Sep 08 09:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow. He pats the girl on the head.

"That is only half of the command," he notes, while still only semi-erect. His body shifts, causing the lengthy organ to sway back and forth, like pendulum.* - Tue Sep 08 09:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) chuckles -- this time a bit more enthusiastically.

"You are much like. . . Mukade and Kitora when I had first met them.I can see it, you will be more of my greatest allies yet. Once I. . . pacify your aggressiveness," He declares. As she turns and gives him her back once more, Zetsumo takes a step back. The gradual arousal is reaching it's breaking point, and soon enough, the Zombie of a warrior is fully erect.

A hand rested ontop, and pushes the foot-long length downward. He'd allow it to go down diagonal, and make contact with her sex. A hand rests on the girl's hip subsequently after, and with the grasp, she's lifted just a tad. 

"I'll pass. However, I suppose I'll make you take your own advice in a way," He says with a devious grin. By now, due to the grip, the woman's is practically sitting on Zetsumo's cock, which once more twitches in excitement.* - Tue Sep 08 09:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He's hardly gently with the endeavor.

Had Katsune been a virgin? Then things would be just as uncomfortable as they were pleasure-able. From the beginning, his thick cock plunges into the warm walls of the girl's vagina. He's easing in initially, but once the first rep is down, Zetsumo eagerly plows through. Again and again, his hips buck forward, and admittedly pleased grunts litter the showers.

Remaining dominant, the shinobi continues delightedly plowing, before finally changing positions. For nearly half an hour, her vagina is completely and utterly violated, until at last, he utilizes threads and positions her in a doggy-style position. After all, Zetsumo had no intent on having a second child, at least not yet -- despite Katsune's deceptively strong genes that would work well with Sumo's own physiology.

Towards the end, the fiend's cock presses against her pucker, while his hand slaps downward, leaving marks on the female's ample ass. The shower pours over them both, yet the brutish warrior seems unphased. Once more, his pelvis thrusts in and out, sodomizing the girl, and forcing her bottom to stretch in order to accomodate for his inhuman size. In the end, he manages to keep up the effort for an additional twenty minutes, before his cock had reached it's limit. Contracting, creamy cum spills from the slit, filling up the girl's passage to the brink.

As usual, it spills over, with some of the excess semen being painted on her buttocks. The water washes away some, clearly.

Zetsumo looks on, in hopes that by now the girl had been left a whimpering, cum-glazed mess.* - Tue Sep 08 10:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) exhales. Despite his words, it's clear that Zetsumo had done the deed mostly for his own perversion-- yet discipline played a clear part.

"My. You were pure before this. . . To think. You lost your virginity to a monster such as I," he says calmly, his limp dick laying on her butt momentarily. He seems exceptionally relaxed, moreso than before. 

After the comment, Zetsumo arises and takes a step out of the showe with damped clothes. "Perhaps if you behave, we may engage each other once more. Only if you behave-- and don't pretend as if you don't yearn it," he says with a chortle, and his voice as condescending as could be. The slit in the jounin suit is stitched up shortly after.* - Tue Sep 08 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns and proceeds to leave. He stops just short of exitting.

"Likewise. You won't say a word of this to anyone. Understood?" He instructs, his words carrying a bit of animosity.* - Tue Sep 08 10:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) speaks casually. It's clear he is no angel. He leaves on that note.* - Tue Sep 08 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) summons a duck after reading the scroll.

"Kanja. I want you to return this to Konoha. Find Shin." The duck takes the scroll and flutters off.* - Tue Sep 08 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

He takes a seat, and begins to go over plans. "So. Shin may still be alive, that's good. Although. . . I feel this may just be a trap employed by our enemies, to locate us."* - Tue Sep 08 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
This all happens before Shin comes of course.

"Right. Kilm, Beth, Katsune. This is a risk, but I want you all to go scout the eastern area. Be vigilant, and look around the forest. Meanwhile, I'll be sending my own flock ahead,, to check the surrounding areas for the skies. The goal? Is to thoroughly obserrve Kirigakure's terrain and check for traps. I stress, do not get too close to the village itself," he replies. After doing a small amount of seals, his hands press against the ground, releasing a ginormous flock of ducks.

The same instructions are goven, and a few dozens fly into the skies.

Only three remain with the ttraveling trio. One for each.* - Tue Sep 08 12:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns to Misa. Surprising, she hadn't died yet.

"Oh. You made it out. I suppose they onlybelieved you to be a citizen."* - Tue Sep 08 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow.

"Kirigakure? I don't believe they even made it to the battle. Nevertheless, the shinobi are weak. So I trust it was within your ability."* - Tue Sep 08 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead. He takes each of the reports, and looks them over. 

"Good. . .Good. Now you all can do whatever it is you intended to do beforehand."* - Tue Sep 08 13:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
With arms folded, Zetsumo looks ahead, curious to see what the male had to offer. Combining two nature types? It was something to be proud of, as such a feat was a rare endeavor. Initially, he seems unimpressed. However, the second outing proves to be fruitful. "Mmmm. I am unsure if that was actually two nature types. Yet, it is something to pursue, nevertheless."* - Tue Sep 08 15:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) returns. He looks ahead, eying Shin as the jutsu seems to be understood, albeit in a rookie manner. Meanwhile, Zetsumo is walking around town with a partially nude, and chained woman. It's like an honor walking their dogs.

"Oi. . . Blonde, who name escapes me. I was told you. . . Spoke in a proud fashion or whatever? You'd do best to lose whatever pride you hold," he declares, while shifting his gaze to Suitengu. "As for you. Tell me, how far has your Katon training gone?"* - Tue Sep 08 16:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shoots a glare to Suitengu, "I'd hope so. You only have two more days. Before I come to test your progress -- harshly. If you aren't up to par, expect punishment," he decares with some anger in his tone. There's a silent glare for a moment, before the rage that consistently was in Zetsumo's soon shifts direction to Amai.

"'Hmph.' She says. . . So the comments were true? I am displeased. Yet at the same time. . .I will relish having to discipline you."* - Tue Sep 08 16:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) encircles her.

". . Mmm. Although, you will need to be indoctrinated."* - Tue Sep 08 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) a finger pokes out, and jab's the girl in the temple.

"And working with the most wanted man in the world. It is. . . Fun? Mm. . ." He questions, baffled. 

"I suppose this is a common trait among ink-users." Yes, Zetsumo knew quite a bit about her abilities. This fact is all too clear. "I've known your kind. I am unsure if it is a kekkei genkai, although. . . From the looks of it, it's just an extreme usage of Yang Release. The other. . .She was incredibly apathetic, and careless as well. Mmm. .  What was her name though. . " 

After some deliberation. A hand motions downward, beckoning Amai to her knees. He cared not for her cooperation, she had to be humiliated, in order to be humbled.* - Tue Sep 08 16:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his gaze.

"You ask a lot of questions."* - Tue Sep 08 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grows aggressive.His hand comes to her throat. "FOR WHAT? SO YOU CAN RUN AND TRY TO BE A HERO?" He suddenly blurts out, having flashes of Orakuru. Immediately, he's debating on just killing the potential threat right then and there. Yet she had a unique skill..

". . Running to some stupid village and trying to ruin my plans." 

This dude had trust issues, clearly.* - Tue Sep 08 17:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts. His grip pushes against Amai and presses her against the fence. It has enough force to crack the wood just a tad. 

"I. . .Am. . . unsure," Zetsumo says in an almost tired fashion. "I want to screen her first. I believe she is still a liability for betrayal. Thus, it gives two options. I will either kill her, or I will indoctrinated her. Of course, for the latter, she is to be screened by our genjutsu specialists. I must probe her mind."* - Tue Sep 08 17:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Then you will have no qualms with being screened. May Hagoromo have mercy on your soul. . .If I am to find that you've been plotting an escape, or attempting to be insubordinate in some shape or form. Things won't end well for you, otherwise," he warns. The grip is released partially, yet Amai is still bond by chains, which are tethered to Zetsumo's hands.* - Tue Sep 08 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grits his teeth.

"And irritating me."* - Tue Sep 08 17:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) oozes with raping intent. (the cousin of killing intent.)* - Tue Sep 08 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) smirks.

"Well then. . . We will simply grant you strength-- Nay. I am moving too far ahead. I must. . . First ensure that you remain mine. Forever," He says cryptically. While saying this, the male gain oozes thos creepy, rape-y vibes.

"Mm-- What is it?"* - Tue Sep 08 18:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) holds a finger out. 

Threads push through, and the strings lash around violently. It's a good amount too, as it would seem the objects were very capable of clumping or condensing. ". . .They are both part of me. .  Yet not at the same time. Why do you ask.  .?" He seemed to care little. Whether or not you knew that little bit of information of the threads meant nothing in terms of combating him.* - Tue Sep 08 18:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grits his teeth. His eyes set onto Suitengu as the boy seems to tirelessly work on refining his elemental chakra. it was like watching a chip off the ol' block. He was like Zetsumo in everyway, even in the near obsessive manner of training. "Good. . . He is developing. . " Sadly, Zetsumo doesn't say a word, feeling that the lack of acknowledgement would make the boy thirsty or hungry to excel. Meanwhile, the second Amai spoke, the brutish Zombie moved to terroize her.

A larger clump of threads speed out, and invade her mouth. It seeks to overwhelm that area of the body and temporarily block passage.

"Indeed. These are particularly interesting substances, yes? I can control them with simple thoughts. I hardly even have to move." He wanted a freaked out reaction.

"You speak a lot. I found that this also functions as an effective gag."* - Tue Sep 08 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) takes pleasure in the tormented reaction. After ten seconds, he ceases. The threads slowly pull out, with sticky saliva clinging to the surface. Much of the slimey residue drips over Amai's face.

"You see? Pretty swift and nimble, yes?"* - Tue Sep 08 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilts his head. "You reacted poorly to such. I suppose you Kumogakure shinobi aren't used to cruel and unusual punishments."* - Tue Sep 08 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The scene is simple. 

Zetsumo, now sheltered by Amegakure, holds in his hand chains. The chains? Are connected to his nearly nude, recent Kumogakure war prisoner. In the distance, two of the Kenryoku lower leveled mercenaries are training. 

The second Maya had stepped onto the scene, his eyes flicker to the medic. "Oh. You're finally awake. . ." A glance is given to the rather impovished landscape. "Pardon the conditions. I don't intend to have us coped here for much longer. How have you been enjoying your stay in Amegakure?" Of course, there were clearly other topics that he sought to discuss. Why not have idle chit-chat.

"Oh. Meet my new slave, Amai."* - Tue Sep 08 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze, and looks Amai up and down.

"No need to get territorial, dear," he replies casually. The male nods, clearly agreeing with the comment -- Amegakure was terrible. Hence why he didn't plan to stick around. "Indeed, I agree. As for additional scrolls, the Gezo is being well -- they have terrible customer service. I am still anticipating their arrival. In the meantime, allow me to take that scroll off your hand. ANd I would love for you to demonstrate the jutsu firsthand," the monstrosity declared with clear intrigue. He takes steps forward, while pulling on the chain to guide Amai forward like a dog.

"Likewise. I have various plans or ideas that I feel you may like. Perhaps I will. . . enlighten you on them."* - Tue Sep 08 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folds his arm.

"And what would be your motivation?"* - Tue Sep 08 19:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) he takes a step forward. Once in distance, a hand moves, clutching at the woman's ample rear, and giving a rub. 

"I see. . . How short-sighted of me.."* - Tue Sep 08 19:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued dragging the pet along.* - Tue Sep 08 19:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was unable to decipher what the medic had been saying in her cryptic demands. His hands clenches around the chains even more rigidly. ". . .Treat her. . . As an individual? Please tell me. . . This is some elaborate joke, or perhaps you speaking in code," Zetsumo declares, with furrowed brows. "This my prisoner, after all. It was a great risk having to capture her," continued the fiend. His eyes tell the story -- one of immense confusion. 

Judging by how his hands remained coiled aroun the object, he had no intent on stopping anytime soon.* - Tue Sep 08 19:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wrinkles his nose. "That is true. Yet I prefer not to run any risk. Why don't you hold the chain then. . " A hand is held out. Whether or not Maya takes it, he allows it to fall. Clearly, had Amai foolishly sought to escape, she'd be put down -- with ease.

"Regardless. I want to see the jutsu in greater detail. Feel free to use it personally on me. It will matter little. Or well, I suppose the blonde can be a test subject -- that is her current role, to be frank."* - Tue Sep 08 19:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. 

He allows the chain to fall onto the floor. Yet before long, a single seal is done, allowing it to be assilimated into the ground. The chain is long, granting some degree of movement, yet in the end, she's tethered. Guards are about, observing. 

"Shin, Sabo, Paine, Suitengu," -- Yes, Suitengu. He cared not for age. "Keep watch on the woman."

A hand motions for Maya to lead to her desired location.* - Tue Sep 08 19:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) followed behind the woman as she led off to her desired area.

"Hot springs. . .? Works, I suppose," he says. There is nothing against going out for leisurely time with the medic, yet it wasn't the most appropriate place to show off her skill with chakra no mesu.* - Tue Sep 08 20:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) scratches his nose.

"Indeed. My curiosity is. . . Something that often makes me obsessive," he turns, facing the curved kunoichi and remains still. * - Tue Sep 08 20:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stayed put. 

"Oh. . .I hadn't really looked at the scroll. So it's function is directly cutting at the tendons of one's muscles. . . or cells. Clear uses in surgery. Yet the potential combative use. Mmm, you may very well become a useful fighter," Zetsumo comments, he broke the jutsu down on each level, in his head. Of course, as a non-medic, these were just very intelligent hypothesis. In no time, after her hand had channeled all of the chakra, sharp cuts run through his feet, as the achilles tendons are assaulted. Even then,Zetsumo doesn't flinch and simply remains motionlessly as the skilled medic did her thing.

". . .Hng. Painful, yet it works. I am. . . very impressed, Maya. "

Seconds later, strings are speeding out, and stitching back the cuts. Before long, all was well, and he's back at one-hundred percent. Turning back, the hot springs are eyed. "Well. Shall we?"* - Tue Sep 08 20:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms. He would first watch Maya strip down, and did so with predator-like eyes. It was  as if he was watching his next big meal, or rather a block buster movie. Nevertheless, in time, she had completely stripped down, and exposed her endowed body to his eyes, shamelessly at that. 

"Not shy, I see," commented Zetsumo.

Shortly after, he's following suit, revealing his cloth-less frame for one of the times in forever. It is then that Maya would be enabled to see just how oddly built the monster's body truly was. Stitches from head to toe, and masks littered from frame. Three of these masks? Were actually released -- to serve as protection just incase some heckler got smart. The earth mask sunk underneath the ground.

Other than looking like a doll that had been forced to weather the sands of time, Zetsumo was an athletically build figure, and endowed in his own right. Calmly, the shinobi moves forward, and allows his body to sink. Both eyes remain glued to Maya's figure, and that same. . . forboding gaze is apparent. "My. I hadn't realized you were so womanly. . " Creepy voice. "You brought me here to spend time with you. So then. . What would you like to discuss?" With that question, the male gets closer, now only b eing seperated by a few inches as the warm sensations of the waters took over.* - Tue Sep 08 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) exhales. The lost of Kitora was something he still was a bit depressed over -- on the inside. On the outside, Zetsumo didn't even flinch nor make other bodily reaction to the mention of the fallen Nara. His hands, meanwhile, drift through the water, shamelessly moving to get a fel of Maya's now completely exposed bum. "Mmm. Indeed, I know every element. And I willing to teach you a thing or two in several of them. Just so you can have some versatility, say for. . . Escape. Or surprise attacks," the Kenryoku declared somewhat whimiscally.

He took great pleasure that Maya was now seeking to be a more active portion of the milita. As a combat medic -- a position the group sorely needed. After all, had there been a medic in staff that could survive in battle, perhaps Kitora would still be living.

"We can begin first thing tomorrow I'd suppose."

The grip beforehand is again toyed with, and sensual rubs are delivered.* - Tue Sep 08 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raised a brow.

"Hrm? I suppose now would be fine. You know of the. . . Earth element? I will teach you an escape jutsu today. THen an offensive one tomorrow, fair? Or would you prefer offense first. . ?"* - Tue Sep 08 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on skeptically.

"Watch your tone. In anycase. . .step out of the hot springs so that I can demonstrate."* - Tue Sep 08 21:31:18 2015

"Molest you? Mmm.  Such a strong word. It implies I am trying to do something against your will," he replies casually, while still remaining almost uncomfortably close.

"Why do you ask?"* - Tue Sep 08 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) damn near breaks into a laugh.

"Don't make chuckle, woman," the male replies. Nevertheless, assuming compliace, they both would have climbed out of the hotsprings.

"This is one of the elementary Doton techniques. It's one of my more offensive jutsus as well -- so don't go around teaching anyone. It's to remain exclusive, understood?" He does no handsigns. Chakra pools from his stomach, and eventually gathers around the grand elementalist's mittens. Clearly, there's a flow of chi that is so thick, it grows visibly ,and causes the currents to shift.

"Once a large enough quantityo f chakra has been built up, you transfer it into the ground. The Doton chakra will infuse with the rock or earthly substances below. As that infusion is in place, you form the earth into thick, pillar or spear-shaped rocks. The focus being on the edges, which are to be sharpened. This is arguably the most difficult portion. Yet once enough time had been placed in the shape manipulation, you can at least spring the projectile forward. Upon mastery, anyon e can create four different pillars or object to make evasion diifficult."

Casually, Zetsumo's palms presses against the ground, and four, small structures pop up. WIth the hardened, and pointy edges, it's clear that this could impale pretty much anyone.

"Although. . . For you. Simply work on making one."* - Tue Sep 08 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms and observed as the bodacious woman worked to apply the jutsu. In truth, he was skeptical, as the girl was clearly inexperienced in Doton Release, and was now out to tackle on a C ranked technique. Of course, Zetsumo's eyes glaze over the shinobi's remarkably womanly features on pure instinct, he was a man after all. There's a clear admiration, and as a partial darwinist, he thanks mother nature for producing such a specimen.

As the technique is being applied, he descends, pressing a hand against the ground and clearly feeling the vibrations now running through the earth. -- Swoosh!  A singular, yet swift pillar speeds from the ground, and pierces through the skies. "And what do you know. . . You actually could do it. You've been impressing me quite a bit today," noted the zombie.

He speeds ahead, and sends a cross chop. The physical force is more than enough to shatter the rocky structure -- which was admittedly bristle. 

"Tsk. Could be better, nevertheless. I suppose I will show you another technique later. To compliment that one."* - Tue Sep 08 23:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) motions back to the water.

"Shall we continue?"* - Tue Sep 08 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raises a brow. He takes a step closer.

"Then. . .Shall we test your theory?" He seems a bit too eager to 'prove' himself. His lower body reacts positively, and there's occasional twitches along his member, which suggests readiness for growth.* - Tue Sep 08 23:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) takes a step closer. His hands hand against spseedly move ahead.. "Enough fun and games. Oonto your knees, I want you to lubcricate my cock. That I can pepentrate more easy." He seems demanding, rather cooperative.* - Tue Sep 08 23:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) breaks into a chortle. The woman must have been kidding.

After a brief chuckle, Zetsumo's threads lash out, speeding around Maya's waist and legs and literally aiming to force her into position. Yes, when in this state, the shinobi tended to act on primal instinct, which in this case was just overwhelming lust. His length continues to stiffen, and assuming success, the Senju would find herself face to face with the gargantuan organ.

It's still admist a growth, as Zetsumo looks over more of Maya's form. 

"Hurry up. . .I don't have all day."* - Tue Sep 08 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had been prepared to push his member in -- but pauses once the girl gives her reasoning.

". . .Mmm," the threads releases from her body. 

"I will let this slide for this occasion, I suppose. Refrain from. . . exciting me, yet not being prepared to deliver. I tend to get very. . . cranky," the shinobi warns.* - Wed Sep 09 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on with perplexion.

"Oi. . .You are a strange one to understand, you realize."* - Wed Sep 09 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) arrives in a more privatized area to do the dirty deed. 

He wore sparses clothes along the way, and fully abused the high speeds of shunshin to make the trip worth while. A hand gestures for Maya to get into positioning, lest she desire to be more difficult for own sick game.* - Wed Sep 09 00:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And thus, he does just as she says.

From this point on, it matters little how much Maya protested. He was on, and fully aroused. A foot-long erection is worn, and hovers over the girl's face. From the slit leaks clear fluid, pre-cum. The gooey spunk trickles, and occasionally  falls onto her flesh.

Cue. . . over an hour-long of lewd, sexual acts.

In this timeframe, there isn't a portion of Maya's body that isn't used for Zetsumo's own bodily pleasure. He's invasive, and of course rough. Only in the beginnings would there be only a semblance of compassion, before the brute is mindlessly and savagely thrusting his length into any crevices that made itself available. Thankfully for the medic, the inhumane amount of bodily fluids served as great lubcrication.

Towards the end, both are likely left covered in sweat and other fluids. 

He's beginning to reach his climax. Pulling out of vagina sex -- with a small amount of semen admittedly is unleashed while Zetsumo's length remains in. Yet he pulls out in a fraction of a second. With a grunt, thick, creamy cum is pumped out in mass, and pants Maya's body in white. Drained, the male falls to the side, panting profusely and preparing to take a rest. He had been up for the entire day, after all.* - Wed Sep 09 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. He awakens suddenly and moves over towards the foursome.

"Oi. Paine. . . Suitengu, you both remain active, yes?"* - Wed Sep 09 13:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. After some time, they'd arrive at a more privatized area. His arms remained folded. 

"Right. Today is the day, Suitengu. Show me your skill, lest I decide you are no longer worth my time. As for Paine, tell me. . . How far along has your Taijutsu prowess come along? With Kitora no longer with us, I'll be look to you as one of the people tasked with picking up the slack. So you and I will do what you usually do -- and that's work on reaction time, and hand to hand ability," He says casually.

Both arms still were folded, and a response is awaited. * - Wed Sep 09 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The second Suitengu began with the demonstration, Zetsumo was hooked, captivated even. Clearly, the adult figure was eager to see what his prodigous son had managed to produce. It was sensible -- in the event of an untimely decline, it was Suitengu that would be left to carry his legacy. Thus, the boy had to be properly be prepared and empowered in order to continue work. Eventually, the Katon chakra is being developed, via assistance of the Tiger Handseal, and likewise all of the energy flows onto the leaf.

Mother nature runs it's course, and the temperature from teh chakra begins to have it's effect on the leaf. Slowly, it's own temperature is arising, and flames are being produced as a direct result. Slight embers wrong along the leafy structure, stripping away any of the vibrant life that once existed. Dazzled, Zetsumo is looking ahead with a doll-like smirk, enarmored that his spawn had finally finished the basics of Katon -release. And while this was simple the bare essentials, it made it clear that the boy was at the very least able to learn a new jutsu.

"Hrm. . . I see you failed to inherit your mother's genes. She was. . . untalented, and often needed someone to hold her hand. Regardless, impressive. I suppose I will teach you a basic technique. 'Flamethrower'. . . Or 'Fire Stream' technique. Both are the same, it simply has a variety of names." Meanwhile, a hand beckons for Paine to stay still, they would have their spar, just not on the immediate moment. Suitengu's training was more important, at least for now.* - Wed Sep 09 13:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Right then. I'll be teaching you the Fire Release Stream technique. To do so is trivia. All you have to do is form the single handsign, the tiger. Build up a mass of Katon energy, and pull it from your stomach. . . Guide it towards your mouth. Make sure each inch of your mouth's insides are saturated with the flowing chakra. Take your training further, and bind the Katon chakra with the air molecules themselves. The two substances are to become one -- that is the basis for all Katon techniques. Mixing in your Katon chakra with air. It is this reason why Katon is so effective against wind techniques," the male explains. 

A single seal is formed, and chakra builds up in the belly. Flowing swiftly, the energy finds a home in his mouth, where the mixture occures. Casually, the shinobi exhales, releasing a simple stream. His? Is healthy. And thick, flowing throough the skies and illuminating the dimming lights in the nearby radius. Wavs of heat are evident, and washes over all of their frames. This was the strength of a powerful Katon elementalist, and general ninjutsu speciaist. Upon showingo ff just a bit, Zetsumo's gaze falls back onto Suitengu, who had been working admirably to this point.

"MMm. Once the two are mixed, you exhale, and ignite your Katon chakra. Upon exit, it should shift into a simple stream of flame. This jutsu is D-rank, as it requires little shape manipulation. This will be perhaps your only offensive jutsu for a while, as I doubt you'll be able to perform more advanced skills at your age." He speaks nonchalantly, doubting Suitengu's skill, even if the boy had provened his worth otherwise. Having said that, Zetsumo's eyes stare restlessly, seeking to watch the youth emulate his attempt.* - Wed Sep 09 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead as Suitengu did his thing.

Even while not a sensor, the shinobi could practically feel the build up of chakra, as it poured from his stomach, and gathered within the stomach. It isn't long before flames are being sprouted, and rushing away from the boy's inside. Of course, considering the clear inexperience, the flames seems sickly, and a far cry to what Zetsumo himself had been able to accomplish just a few short moments ago. Yet color him impressed, as the seven year old proved capable of reproducing his efforts, in just a few short minutes. NEvertheless, the same stance as before is given. There would be no praise, nor even a single smile,. What was done, was done.

"Your flames were weak. Yet this is at least a starting point. Continue practicing the jutsu at your own leisure. Continued practice eventually will grant you the needed experience to perform higher leveled elemental skills. Perhaps in a few months, you will be capable of learning the Goukakyuu technique. This being. . . essentially a higher powered version."

Why teach Suitengu such a basic move such as flamethrower? It was simple. He was a child, and this would be vital experience in actually being accustomed with the basic ninjutsu. Calmly, Zetsumo sits now, looking aheadto  the duo training up ahead.* - Wed Sep 09 15:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) bits his thumb.

Blood is spawned. Seconds after, five seals are performed, and ah and presses against the ground. Poof! A plume of smoke momentarily clouds the area. As it clears, a simple duck is in the area. It quacks, and moves over to Beth.

"Do her bidding."* - Wed Sep 09 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"More scouting? Good. I do intend to make a move upon Konoha in the coming days. I actually have a plan that should work. . . Even if they have a glaring, overwhelming, number advantage," Zetsumo noted. There's a grin, because really. . . the idea swirling in Zetsumo's were full proof. There was literally no chance of failure -- at least from his perspective.

The train of thought is ended prematurely, once Paine had ran over. There's a brow risen in confusion, and for just a moment, an entertained smile was sported. He turns, seconds after, and continues sitting. . . just bidding his time.* - Wed Sep 09 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged. He pulls on the chain, bringing the girl forward. 

The shinobi moves downward, bringing her towards Paine. "She's busy. Likely building up more herbs, and refining her poisons." After that brief statement, a hand moves towards Paine, gesturing the girl forward.

"Dissida. Become acquainted with our newest recruit. Amai. . . an ink user. Likewise, you too become acquainted with Dissida," spoke the forboding fiend.* - Wed Sep 09 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze on over to Shin and Paine.

At least -someone- was opting to be productive. "Good. Keep up the work, Paine. I may be looking for you to be my instructor one of these days." 

Yes, Zetsumo was finally willing to go into another profession. His eyes flick back to Amai, and he looks on in thought. "Oi. I still have to screen you. I'll do so in about ten minutes."* - Wed Sep 09 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) pulls on Amai's chain. He's leading her off for the interrogation. 

"I'll be back shortly."* - Wed Sep 09 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) clenches the chain.

"We will wait for our interrogation specialist to come."* - Wed Sep 09 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on boredly once the genjutsu is put onto place.

"Indeed.  .Indeed I do. . ." He says with a hum. There is skepticism when looking at the kunoichi was still certainly held in bondage. On one point, she was agree-able. Easy to control. Yet the nonchalance that she spoke with, it made it apparent -- she believed there to be no danger in this captivity.

"First. Have you ever considered going for an escape? Likewise. . . Do you honestly hold no fear for your current predicament?"* - Wed Sep 09 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was stomped. 

His face told the tale. How could someone who had honestly feared for their life remain some calm. Was she literally just beating the interrogation jutsu?? 

"Mmm. Then why does your demeanor state otherwise? I will ask another question. What is your opinion of joining my ranks then? Of being. . . Well, a servant meant to well. Bring pleasure to I -- your new leader. To do my bidding, even," the shinobi states. Thoghtfully, he's looking ahead -- though anticipates some hidden insubordination. The best part was systematically torturing someone until they were puddy in your hands.* - Wed Sep 09 18:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"I see. Well then, you must learn. As this is your new life. . .Once you can be. . . convinced. Maybe then I can grant you a bit more freedom. I'd like to use you in battle . . .Yet I suppose I must eliminate any liabilities."

With a snap of a finger, he orders one of his subordinates to bring in yet another Kumogakure, war prisoner. This one is relatively young, and sports blue hair. Judging by her physique, she's no older than the age of twelve, and is bond in chains. "So. . .I will go a bit old-school in a little. How opposed are you to torturing in the name of Zetsumo?" He says with a evil smile.

"But first. . .Hrm. . I need to ask more questions."* - Wed Sep 09 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Now you do. Hrm. . I do want more questions, though. Tell me, is there anyone left in Kumogakure that you hold dear?" The spine-chilling tone he spoke with before had began to subside. For this question, Zetsumo was legitimately curious. After all, to truly control someone, you had to know the important details or facets of their character.

With that information, you could manipulate them to your will -- whether it be willingly, or through. . . other methods.

"And I will generalize. Is there anything you feel is necessary to share?"* - Wed Sep 09 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He manages to produce a Kunai knife from his sleeves. It's held ahead, just by Amai's nose. "Endearing. You have someone you care about. Regardless, the final question is this -- What do you feel needs to be done so that I can secure your loyalty?" A simple question all in all. It clears the inquiry is made genuine. He was legitimately filled with curiosity -- how do you make this woman crack.

The Kunai sways to and fro, occasionally swiping at her nose, giving gently cuts. Nothing that was painful.* - Wed Sep 09 19:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Ink. . .Hun. That simply cannot do. You will earn your items back once you've proven yourself. Now then. . .I will allow the chains to be loosen just this once. His threads shoot out, ripping through the bondage and granting Amai so long awaited freedom.

The knife is held forward.

"Beth. You are free to go."* - Wed Sep 09 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"You are more annoying than. . . the mother of my children. I want you to torture and murder this one in my name. After all. . . If you are willing to kill for me.. . Then Perhaps I will be able to trust you."

And he intended to do this frequently, to avoid having another person like Orakuru within his rank. The child, meanwhile, trembled and scream. Although, being gagged tended to muffle most of the sound your body produced.* - Wed Sep 09 19:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead with a strange, stitch-filled smile throughout the entire scene. This was like watching a horror movie in 3D. Getting close, the warrior served as. . . guide to the entire scene. He was so close that the blood from the child's dying corpse would splatter onto his outfit. 

". . Good. . Good. I am impressed, your hands don't even tremble. Your demeanor, it seems unchanged. You don't look at all too truthfully deter to harm this girl -- even if she is of your ilk. Of Kumogakure," Zetsumo comments admist the lengthy process.l Eventually, the killing blow is at last delivered, sending the pre-teen to the floor with more muffled cries. It was a gruesome endeavor, and of course blood spilled itself all over the floor. The red nectar trickles onto his boots.

As Amai finally stands, an affectionate pat is given to her head. 

"Good. .. Good, my pet." The tone is half mocking. The pats continue. "Tell me. How do you feel? Do you not take pleasurei n knowing that this one has perished only so that your current positioning in life can improve? This is how the world is. . . at the end of the day. This is a world based on destoying those below you. . . the natural order, survival of the fittest."* - Wed Sep 09 20:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked on with bemusement. Where had this beast come from? "My. . . In all your time here. I believe you to be the prey. . . A simple plaything not only for Zenaki, but my own enjoyment," he replies, moving in a circular fashion. His eyes trace up and down the blonde's form through this all, carelessly forcing his boots to spread the blood around the isolated chambers. After a rep, he stops ahead for the Ink User, and still remains skeptical -- if not just amazingly intrigued.

". . .I am unsure if this is a hoax. Regardless. . "

A hand shifts, grabbing at Amai's chin, and forcing her head up to meet his own eyes. It is often said. . . you can read someone's character through eye contact -- and that was precisely what Zetsumo sought to do.

On the flipside. . . his pupils told a tale of their own. One of hardship and struggle. It spoke of a man that was quite simply TIRED of how the world continued to operate. . . Vividly, it detailed just how many heartaches and breaks the mercenary had been forced to endure. But on top of this, while the eyes were dull and demonic, there was. . . clear drive or motivation. He did everything for a reason, and seemed to begin seeing some potential in the often dull Ink Pracititoner.

"Shall I grant you another? You seem to take joy in such."* - Wed Sep 09 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Indeed. You seem to take pleasure in this. I will grant you another prison to torture -- although, be warned. I am running a bit low. However, give a request for the type of prisoner you would like to mutilate, and I will try to find one that best fits the description."

He speaks in a gruff tone. Although, the venom from before is fading. Now, Zetsumo is in higher spirits, due to the simple notion that there could be a new, loyal minion.

His hand finally removes itself from Amai's chin, allowing her head to fall down at its leisure.* - Wed Sep 09 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wears a coy smile.

"Hrm. . .Amai. You aren't playing with my emotions. . . Are you? I have my ways of checking your authenticity. . As you would know."* - Wed Sep 09 20:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
To ensure that this was authentic, he calls ahead one of his genjutsu specialist.

She again places Amai within said genjutsu, prying away the truth. Had the girl honestly gotten a rush out of kill? A second question also is delivered to see if Amai's act had simply been to fool Zetsumo.

Should both check out, the Kenryoku leader wears a perplexed expression. "Mmm. . Interesting. I won't yet allow you your ink tools. However, I may be willing to let you wear clothes at least."* - Wed Sep 09 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns and proceeds to the exit. He would wait outside.

"I will leave the chain off for the day. Clean yourself off and take some of the spare clothing. -- Do not take this as any actual freedom. Don't dare go the village's border, and do not grow complacent, you still have to be tested."

He leaves on that note.* - Wed Sep 09 21:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continues to ooze with creepster intent.* - Wed Sep 09 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Just stat set. it'll fix ur thing - Wed Sep 09 21:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) eyes the increasingly skillful usage of the Shunshin technique. He's impressed, but makes no compliment on such.

"Good. Then tell, which Katon techniques do you already know? So I can tell which I am to teach you. Likewise, show me a demonstration of your Fire Release prowess," the kenryoku leader demands. He falls silent seconds after, and looks on with anticipation.* - Thu Sep 10 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
All the pride he felt in Shin. . .

Had subsequently died. "That's it? Well then. Give me a run down of all the techniques you know in Fire Release. Then I'll choose what to teach you from there. Of course, considering your low level of skill, your options are likely limited."* - Thu Sep 10 09:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Well the jutsu in question is unconventional. As far as Katon techniques go. Unlike the typical, run-of-the-mill fire release skills. You're not actually creating fire. But rather, you're manipulating the air currents. . ." He says with a drawl.

A hand seal is formed, and instinctively, Zetsumo's chakra is going into a frenzy. The process by now was all to familiar, and of course took ZERO effort from the experienced elementalist. Katon chakrai s fuming, and grinding up against one another, building up the necessary heat and potency needed for any Fire Release skill. Had Shin been a sensor, this casual process was easily to be noted -- but what more, the ease in which Zetsumo commanded such a massive amoount of energy was mind-boggling.

It was clear that the male lived and breathed elemental ninjutsu. One could only hope he wouldn't expand his repetoire into another skillset. . . anytime soon that is. Before long, the Katon energy that had been boiling arises, and moves along his sternum. The chakra pathways seem to welcome the trek, as each particle of ethereal energy held no issue in it's movements. In record time, the mass of energy finds a new home, just within the male's lungs, though remains inactive. After all, if his body or mouth was occupied, how he could continue with the explanation?

"What I did right now is just gather up my chakra. It's resting in my lungs. What you do next is simple. Inhale. . . Inhale to gather a large amount of oxygen. From there, like with your Goukakyuu, the Katon chakra is supposed to mix. Yet this is where your jutsu deviates. Instead of making an equalized mixture of the two. You're going to purposely make sure that the flow of chakra is unstable. Oversature the oxygen,. and rather than make am ixture that will eventually spawn an inferno. .  You've spawned a chemistry experiment that's just ready to blow."

Seconds after, Zetsumo inhales, an d releases the oxygen after performing that dangerous mixture himself. It flows about, filling up the area to the north. For those looking on, the oxygen appeared to be transluscent smoke. It billows about. 

"And boom."

Soon a small spark is sent ahead, causing a spontaneous combustion. It blows up nicely, though doesn't seem to endanger anyone. Even as a bullyish, abomination. Zetsumo had perfect control of his strength, and thus made sure not to cause any unnecessary damage.* - Thu Sep 10 10:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept watching with dull eyes. It isn't long before the jutsu is committed, and while there were clear signs of inexperience, this was at least a decent starting point.

"Mmm. Refine the technique, and work on your elemental affinity. Do so in conjunction with Kilm and Katsune -- I haven't a clue where they've gone." With that, the shinobi  leans against the tree.* - Thu Sep 10 10:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"As am I. Although I may go sate my boredom in a few hours."* - Thu Sep 10 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Make a suggestion. I find it odd that. . . so many of my ilk find it difficult to gain enjoyment. Anything we do. Dinner? Go watch a local fight, and so forth."* - Thu Sep 10 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugged.

"Then sleep, I suppose," Zetsumo seemed to care little. He'd proceed towards the west. "I do have some plans I need to do regardless."* - Thu Sep 10 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had done poofed silently onto the roof tops. He looks down, peering. Of course, it would seem that Zetsumo's other engagement had been completed in record time.* - Thu Sep 10 13:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) oozes the persona of a creepster.* - Thu Sep 10 13:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had gone into a sitting motion. His eyes continued to stare at the girl's form. . . And subtly, the creepy aura from before intensified. Despite his growth, Zetsumo still held those strange social quirks, such as standing too close, or awkwardly observing individuals from odd locations.

The persona that lingered in the air now had evolved. No longer was it creepy or stalker-ish. Yet now, it was the aura of a predatory. What type? That remained ambiguous. A scroll was in hand, and in an unhurried manner, the Mercenary's hand is scribbling, jotting down notes -- for something unrelated to the observation.

Thankfully, with this being a hotspot, the load of people coming in and out drown out the scribbling sound effect. "Dyed her hair. . ? Looks odd. And now she has the same hair style as Katsune. "* - Thu Sep 10 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Like an owl, he watched from above.

His eyes trace over each of the different outfits she tries out, and he's judging it base on the appearance. Of course, Zetsumo holds no exception to the girl showing a little bit of leg. The more the m errier. 

Then. . . the last comment is heard -- barely. Even over the roar of the crowd. "Konoha? Has this woman lost her damn mind?" The brute makes no moves, however, and just continues to observe. As she moved? So did he. There was no way he was letting her leave the village, obviously enough. On the inside, Zetsumo remains more than just a little irk'd. After all, when he had offered to spend time, she brushes him off and opts to sleep.

Eventually, the writing from before comes to an end. He pockets it.* - Thu Sep 10 14:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) finally makes his appearance known. His body flickers into the area, and a hand wraps about Misa's arm. "You're not leaving the village. . ." Zetsumo states with a drawl. He's as controlling as can be. 

Admist the travel, Zetsumo catches a bit of Beth's question. And it's irritating. His soul is in turmoil, and seems to come alive at the mention of his deceased, Baby Momma. "She's dead." Short and simple. His eyes avert to the side once the death had been declared.* - Thu Sep 10 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"You are with me. Going to Konoha would place you in danger. And I won't allow that," he says in a gruff tone. Even with the. . . violence or aggressiveness that he spoke, there was legitimate concern. A fleeting glance is given to Beth, but Zetsumo opts not to console her. Doing so would just make him more angry -- again, upon realizing that it was partially his fault that she had succumbed to death.* - Thu Sep 10 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) whispers: Comfort her. - Thu Sep 10 14:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) refuses.

He turns, facing Zenaki, while also allowing Misa's grip to be released. "Heed my warnings, Misa," Zetsumo states, still unwavering in his desire to keep her Amegakure. 

"What is it, Zenaki?"* - Thu Sep 10 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: This.. Will be fine. Whispering will be fine. - Thu Sep 10 14:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) notes that Zenaki is whispering.

"Fine."* - Thu Sep 10 14:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Well.. I was with Beth at the cafe. And somehow she used a sort of jutsu to make my body move and think in my head. And she made me strip inside of that cafe.... So.. Just telling you this.. For the note. - Thu Sep 10 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: I see. Uncalled for. . Why did she do that? - Thu Sep 10 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: And watch Misa behind yourself. - Thu Sep 10 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: And. Just to play. I guess. She was ''playing'' with me as she described it. - Thu Sep 10 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: If you feel. . . enraged. Just say the word. . .? - Thu Sep 10 14:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Just.. for a note for you.. I guess. You can punish her if you wish. Some sort of way to get her back. No idea how yet tho...  - Thu Sep 10 14:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: I will allow you to decide her punishment. Get back to me when you've decided. - Thu Sep 10 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: I think, breaking all her fingers bone for bone. So she can't make handseals anymore. To do this. That will work.. - Thu Sep 10 14:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Foolish. I need her to be able to use ninjutsu. - Thu Sep 10 14:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: But it would fit her punishment... Awww.... It would have been fun to hear her scream in pain... Uhm...  - Thu Sep 10 14:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns to face Zenaki for a while.

"And why didn't you tell me sooner? About Beth. Of course, me harming her too severely is out the question. I still need her to do my bidding after all.."* - Thu Sep 10 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) allows her to leave. 

Of course, he has men trail her just incase. Y'know. "We may talk later," of course, his voice is devoid of any emotion. He had no intent on following her around personally, clear -- especially as Misa seemed intent on being alone.

Once she had gone, Zetsumo also sends a small chick as well.

He turns now, facing Zenaki. "How goes those poisons?"* - Thu Sep 10 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had kneeled. He gestured to Zenaki. "I don't believe you're greeted your aunt either. . . Boy." It seems Zetsumo takes offense to Suitengu's disregard of the medic.* - Thu Sep 10 16:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He nods. It seemed Zetsumo had an innate desire to see his family actually behave like one -- a family. "Good. Why don't you two. . .Go get a bite to eat? To know one another." Odd that someone who was so harsh on Suitengu actually wanted to get him to know his aunt -- even as the boy still remained unaware of Zetsumo's true nature.

"But only for an hour. Then you should get back to your studies and training."* - Thu Sep 10 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shrugs.

"Perhaps it is due to how weathered my flesh is. . I am only twenty-five. Why do you ask?" Although, it was something that could be hard to believe. Judging by his tired eyes, and peculiar flesh, saying he was nearing a century in age wasn't that big of a stretch.* - Thu Sep 10 16:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Indeed. This one is. . . special. He has a great future in store," Zetsumo quickly replies back. While Misa held sarcasm, he -- on the other hand -- remained passive, and unconcerned. 

"I held no qualms with the question. . . I was simply inquiring. You seem to be quite. . . defensive today. For what?" His body slowly turns, and he's facing Misa.* - Thu Sep 10 16:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tilted his head. He glances to Zenaki and Suitengu respectively, before realizing that the aunt had fallen asleep, in a day dream even.

He moves ahead, and stops just infront of Misa, looking the girl up and down.

"Indeed. It's as if you've jumped in a time machine. In just a month or two, your entire look has shifted. Be it something as simple as your hair color. . .Or your figure. Tell me then, how has your personality shifted? You seem just as. . . Nonchalant and. . . difficult to read as ever."* - Thu Sep 10 17:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"You wish to mature. . .? Your personality is not something that changes on a whim. You are who you are. . . Why do you want to seem more mature? It was your immaturity that made me fond of you. After all. . . Most people who irritate me on your level would be long dead," Zetsumo notes truthfully. It was Misa's immature quirks that had legitimately kept her alive to this point.* - Thu Sep 10 17:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
". . . How. . . short-sighted. Had I wanted you dead. It would be no issue. I would forcibly end your existence in a second," his finger rises and flicks the woman on the forehead -- somewhat hard. "Count your blessings. Not many can get away with being as irritating and dramatic as you. Yet I suppose some of the dramatics have been one of the reasons you've continued to live," Zetsumo notes with nonchalance. His voice is still as forboding as ever, despite seemingly being in a neutral state.* - Thu Sep 10 18:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Amai was clothed.

"I haven't even touched her. She is a war prisoner from Kumogakure. And you continue to bring up the 'torture.' Let it go -- Where the hell even is your son, by the way? You left him in Konohagakure?" Zetsumo doesn't flinch at the flick. It does nothing.* - Thu Sep 10 18:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"You are certainly. . Nothing like me." He took offense. How dare Misa compare herself to someone as great as he?

"Good then. I wish to have him wage combat against my own child. To see who is on path to be stronger. As for 'making it up' to you. This is a situation we've gone over. . . again and again. .. and again. And once more, I will explain. I have no clue what you want -- It is likely something that I will never do. Such as those 'romantic' scenes you view in novels and such," Zetsumo states.

Meanwhile, he yanks the chain, pulling the woman -- Amai -- ahead.  Once Misa had spoken, he moves to the next subject. "Regardless, meet my newest prisoner. And perhaps a future Kenryoku member. The ink user. . .Ahai."
* - Thu Sep 10 18:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"We will see. I will. . . be enthralled to see how you react once the two come to blows. On another note, make a request -- that isn't romantic. . .or predicated on weak emotions that you seem to be adamant on. And it will be done."

Clearly, the brute was adamant in making amends. Of course, he would never stoop so low as to display 'romance'. . .It would just make him weaker.

"And the Kenryoku is the name of my mercenary group."* - Thu Sep 10 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. "Right then."

He leans against the fence.* - Thu Sep 10 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kills that bird.

". . .Spy." His thread shoot out, and coil around Misa's waist. He's controlling -- and wouldn't allow her to leave. "Stay put."* - Thu Sep 10 18:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) speaks calmly. Like the Magic Conch Shell from Spongebob.

"No. ."* - Thu Sep 10 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is alerted of the birds.

"Never again." Quickly, he sends a giant Goukakyuu, scorching them. Rather than be reduced to ashes or just a charred carcass. The birds are. . .What?! Made into a finely cooked, roasted meal. The skin is light-brown color, and all the feathers had been stripped. Bon appetit.* - Thu Sep 10 18:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shakes Misa violently.

"I don't take kindly to being ignored."* - Thu Sep 10 18:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grunts.

The shaking continued. "Quit putting on a scene. You only behave this way because you have a crowd around," he says with irritation. At Hideki's question, his hands go through a short string of handsigns. An abnormally large duck is formed after a plume of smoke is delivered.

It's one that is taller than the fences. Yet it seems relatively unintelligent.

"That. Creatures you can use for your own desire. Be it fighting, scouting, or just plain eating."* - Thu Sep 10 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. -- He begrudgingly allows her to go.

"I will meet with you shortly. Get your rest, however."* - Thu Sep 10 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's brow twitches. Had she purposely excluded him?* - Thu Sep 10 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"Well. I suppose I do have a job. There is an informant that I need to be silenced. He's long. . . since expired his usefulness. Thankfully, the male takes residence in Northern Amegakure. On a farm. --Go there, and kill him. It's simple. . Although, he is far from a pushover. I would grant me tthrall here. . . as assist. Yet I don't quite have that much trust in her. . "

A simple 'contract' mean to be fulfilled. Had Paine not gone to sleep, she too would be on the mission. 

The 'informant' went by the name of Wilcon. He excelled in Raiton and Suiton ninjutsu, and was quite speedy. "Work with haste. You have till sun down to complete the mission." Soon after, Zetsumo's eyes fall back onto Amai. 

"Hrm. . '* - Thu Sep 10 20:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

"It is possible to have more than one summoning contract. Although it takes a high level of skill. Typically, this is restricted only to those that specialize in summoning ninjutsu. Why do you ask?"

He yawns, and finally opts to give Amai a mission. "You, servant girl. I have a task for you to do. Go into my cells and cull the rowdy prisoners. Each have been tied -- and dont' even think about letting any go. You have three hours."

Yes, in the prisons there would be guards all around to ensure no one did anything funny. Yet despite the guarrds, there seemed to be little man power, thus they just remained securing the area rather than dealing with prisoners. Some prisoners were violent, other perversed, and the last bulk just downright crazy. Thus, Amai would have her hands full.* - Thu Sep 10 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) was shocked.

"What. . .? I had expected you to come back a bumbling mess," he says with disappointment. He was actually looking forward to her coming back damaged -- be it physical or mental.

"Well good. You've done a good service to Kenryoku. -- DIssida. Tell me, how has your Taijutsu training come along? I may be in need of a taijutsu instructor in the coming days. To enhance my own skillset." His eyes flick to the concealed figure, before turning to Amai.

"Hrm. I'll probably be looking to assimilate any taijutsu or elemental techniques you may possess as well."* - Thu Sep 10 21:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms.

"You are the resident taijutsu specialist. You are far superior to Katsune in hand to hand -- the only thing is. You lack speed, thus your opponent can escape you with ease," he declares.* - Thu Sep 10 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Of course you can. .. Katsune is a genetic freak. But you. . .However. You have another quality -- a willingness to try. She excels so easily, andthus, she doesn't understand the value of hardwork. Keep pushing your body to their limit, and beyond. And one day, you won't just match her speed, but you'll outright surpass it," Zetsumo muttered. He disliked the pessimism.* - Thu Sep 10 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) sighs.

"No Paine. Don't think too much on it. Regardless, yes. Go refine your taijutsu ability to their peak. I won't my instructor to be able to teach me to the best of her ability," He replies, still adamant on having the air head show him the ways of a close-quarter-combat specialist.* - Thu Sep 10 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives a glaance. He doesn't seem to mind. "Remember our conversation the other day, Paine."* - Fri Sep 11 07:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Sep 11 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: I woke up to one of your shinobi staring at me-- he was watching me sleep. - Fri Sep 11 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm back . . . - Fri Sep 11 13:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Which one? - Fri Sep 11 13:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: So random one, I don't know. - Fri Sep 11 13:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Og. - Fri Sep 11 13:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I never told them to actually go inside the house.. - Fri Sep 11 13:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Huh. - Fri Sep 11 13:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't even flinch.

"Believe what you will. No idea what a 'wasteman' is. . ."* - Fri Sep 11 13:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Lord Zetsumo, Can I speak with you? - Fri Sep 11 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Use a dictionary! - Fri Sep 11 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: You may. <@Kilm - Fri Sep 11 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Err . . . Privately? - Fri Sep 11 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"And you're likely using some. . 'slang.' I'm certain wasteman isn't a word," he replies to Misa. Soon after, the brute heads towards the north.* - Fri Sep 11 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Right. . .What is it? - Fri Sep 11 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So uhh . . . I got to talk to an old friend and he gave some info on what Kirigakure has. - Fri Sep 11 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: And . . . I think I can ask him to help us against Kirigakure if he wants to and that is if we ever have to fight against them. - Fri Sep 11 13:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: And where is he? - Fri Sep 11 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He went off but we are going to keep in contact through birds. - Fri Sep 11 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: It's been 5 years since i've seen him. . . He used to have a name called Hiru. - Fri Sep 11 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Then I am interested. I will allow passage into Amegakure. - Fri Sep 11 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Tell him to return. - Fri Sep 11 13:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He said Kirigakure betrayed him and took his kiba blades. - Fri Sep 11 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: And Niklaus had done some actions that ended up in killing his family. So I think he hates Kumogakure too. - Fri Sep 11 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Yes . .Yes. I am sure his life sucks. - Fri Sep 11 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay . . . I will talk to him about coming here through birds then. - Fri Sep 11 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I will get one now. - Fri Sep 11 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) summons a bird. He hands it over. A scroll is given too.* - Fri Sep 11 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is this good? - Fri Sep 11 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Is what good? Send the message. - Fri Sep 11 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I sent the message. - Fri Sep 11 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Since too close) - Fri Sep 11 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (ok) - Fri Sep 11 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Good. He probably didn't get too far. - Fri Sep 11 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think he will come back. - Fri Sep 11 13:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We should go back where everyone is. - Fri Sep 11 13:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He asked when and where. - Fri Sep 11 13:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sent again. - Fri Sep 11 13:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Now. - Fri Sep 11 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: And I'll wait for him by the gates. - Fri Sep 11 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (meaning tell him to come to us right here) - Fri Sep 11 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I told him as soon as possible and Amegakure. - Fri Sep 11 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He should be coming then. - Fri Sep 11 13:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I will come wait too. - Fri Sep 11 13:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. You came. - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm.. - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you were interested in fighting against Kirigakure? - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed. - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: They have my possession. - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What about their allies? - Fri Sep 11 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They might call upon them. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Of course. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps a conventional attack isn't something you should lean towards. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Back-doors. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I've scouted Kirigakure. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Lord Zetsumo wants to hear all about it as well. - Fri Sep 11 13:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Right. We can discuss more in private. - Fri Sep 11 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Come. - Fri Sep 11 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) raises a brow. He leans against the wall, purposely by the exit.

"Right. This one says. . . you have information in regards to what Kirigakure has?"* - Fri Sep 11 13:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed I do.. - Fri Sep 11 13:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: For one. - Fri Sep 11 13:42:24 2015

"Right. Your information is noted -- but you are to remain here in Amegakure in the meantime.  Feel free to become acquainted with your sister."

He rubs his chin in thought. "Where to hit first. . .Suna. . .Or Konoha. Mmm, nothing like the land of fire," murmured Zetsumo. He looks a bit to the north, wearing a grin before going to lean back against the wall.

"Right. Anything else you'd like to note?"* - Fri Sep 11 14:22:30 2015
