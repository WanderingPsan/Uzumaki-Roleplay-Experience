<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks on irritated towards Misa. . . Why did she feel she had any sway on the decisions?

"Right. I don't particularly feel comfortable in having him go along. After all, so very sensitive information is in the works. It would not be such a difficult task to have someone else attending. Just as precaution," Zetsumo replies. He looks ahead to Ushinawa now, still clearly intent on having this handled in a swift and effective fashion.* - Fri Sep 11 17:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Fair? - Fri Sep 11 17:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) summons two small chicks.

They move, getting in Ushinawa's clothes. They're vigilant, and seem to be prepared to disperse in the assumption that an attack goes on. These young ducks were going to be his eyes and ears to ensure that all went according to plan.

"Mmm. Return in four days. That should be enough to move to Sunagakure, get your warrior, then return."* - Fri Sep 11 17:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) had no wife. . . Nor ex-wife.

Yet he took exception to the comment. Quickly, his hand is coated in Doton chakra, and a mighty swing is delivered to the girl's stomach.* - Fri Sep 11 18:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glared.

"Beg for my forgiveness. And apologize. . .Not only to me, but for the rest of the Kenryoku. We do not take the demise of our former comrades lightly."* - Fri Sep 11 18:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: That seems painful.. - Fri Sep 11 18:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) growled. He wasn't opposed to jokes, yet Amai had hit a soft spot. The Genin's mouth contorted into a scrunch, and spit is being pulled. Eventually, however. . . The saliva subsides. No use in kicking her as she was down.

"You are forgiven. . . . momentarily. Get up. ." 

That said, Zetsumo slides his feet over, and stares on lazily to the to the arriving duo. "That was fast. . . Perhaps she met you half-way. Who are you woman?" Beady, demonic eyes pierce through the area, and stares daggers towards the apparent Kunoichi.* - Fri Sep 11 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: She didn't.... - Fri Sep 11 18:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's glare remained persistant. It was unwavering, and perhaps grew in intensity. Calmly, his sinister aura or persona had manifested, thickening in the air. There was something odd. . . The woman had rubbed him the wrong way. 

". . .I see no goddess. . . Nor a deity. Your name. Speak it. . ." The tormented soul demanded, his voice tone soon shifting from the casual manner it held before. Indeed, aggitation was on the rise.* - Fri Sep 11 18:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Oooooh, scary. - Fri Sep 11 18:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine. - Fri Sep 11 18:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Guess it matters very little what her name is at this point. We aren't the same people we used to be. - Fri Sep 11 18:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) took a step forward. A hand moves  and clutches at her chin.

"I know this to be a lie. Tell me. . .Why are you so combative? I've come with no intent. . . on bringing you  harm. Although I suppose. . . an alias is intelligent."* - Fri Sep 11 18:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: A fight? - Fri Sep 11 18:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Stop asking. - Fri Sep 11 18:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: For ink. - Fri Sep 11 18:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ..... - Fri Sep 11 18:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze to Beth.

"Settle down. These are allies. . . I've told you time and time again. . . I do not bring people to be your toy's. Remember this. . " He speaks with irritation, at Beth's sudden bloodlust. The girl seemed to be -too- bloodthirsty, even for Zetsumo's taste.

By then, his eyes meet Ushinawa. And while the grip of Mariana's chin had been released, there was now a menancing glare being distributed to the rogue. Still, Zetsumo does move an inch. This could be seen as well. . . A simple, Macho-showdown. 

"Mm. The adrenaline. All must be calm. We are not the enemy -- and we shouldn't battle one another. . ." He turns, feeling the animosity was boiling over. And as everyone knew, despite the brute's reserveness, when he got going. . . It was pretty difficult to place a lid on it. 

"For the 'Amanda.' I will simply say this, have a nice stay. Mmm. . .Likewise, grant me a scroll detailing your skill. Perhaps you may be of use."* - Fri Sep 11 18:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: makes sense - Fri Sep 11 18:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks:  Wonder if Zenaki is around. - Fri Sep 11 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) exhales. "Good. As for 'Amanda.' Yes. .. I would very much like to see your skillset."* - Fri Sep 11 18:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: What do you mean by scroll? - Fri Sep 11 19:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Write your skills in a scroll and then give it to him. - Fri Sep 11 19:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So he can read it. - Fri Sep 11 19:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm not a fighter, I am a lover. - Fri Sep 11 19:15:12 2015

And of course gain loot. After a day's travel, the male arrives, victorious in his campaign. Tens of thousands of warriors flood, taking post around the borders of the city, and working in tandem with the AMegakure shinobi. Thus. . .

The village is notably. . . much more active. Many of the shinobi are running about, gathering provisions to make the attack a success. He had intended to bring a massive squadron, as well. Enough to outnumber Kirigakure, while also having more than enough sitting back to counteract the eventual interference. The terrain was advantagous as well, as any re-inforcement would take DAYS to arrive. While travel to Kirigakure would only be a few hours.

"Gather any of the resources you may need. Be it weapons and so forth. -- I should also make plans for a particular person."

Likewise, once Amai spoke up, a nasty glare is delivered to the woman. "Why would i take a runt like you to battle. However, i will give you a simple job. Craft explosive tags. I need them in the thousands."* - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015

Shortly after, Zetsumo arrives in a private cell. The place is devoid of any color, and walls for that matter. There are cold, steel bars blocking any exit or entry -- save for the locked door of course. Which is easily accessible to those with the proper key.

At the center? A massive desk. It's been fitted out, rigged even. To have various sheets of paper, cutting devices, and of course ink. Zetsumo? Was going to purposely watch. Even more, a Fuuinjutsu specialist is called to help with observation, just so Amai didn't try anything funny.

"Come."* - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: So. - Sat Sep 12 14:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Of course. She'll be screened afterwards to ensure that there is no funny business. - Sat Sep 12 14:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: No. You'll be in here. - Sat Sep 12 14:23:47 2015

Quickly, he has Amai pulled away.

As usual, the shinobi had every bit of intent on screening the girl to make sure she hadn't rigged the tags to be detrimental to his forces. The interrogation genjutsu is again applied, and of course she's question if any traps or measures had been made to damage nto only the Kenyoku, but Amegakure and the rest of Zetsumo's forces.

Assuming no actual issues? 

He allows Amai to waltz out. "Good work. I will grant you a small amount of ink, and paper. It should be enough to allow you to create two medium sized monsters. Simple. However, you are still going to be watched closely. Come," Zetsumo whistles, calling the girl again as she were a pet -- which he may very well promote her too.

Having a human-like pet was proving to be fun.* - Sat Sep 12 15:30:20 2015

"I would suggest a battle between you and I. Yet I suppose I will have to wait until we are on the field. As a word of advice. If you possess Katon or Raiton, you will excel battling at my side. Although, the former is likely a given, considering your claim of being a match for that nuisance, 'Black Blade,'" He replies, although his voice suggests uncertainty. It was a logical assumption.

"Ah. So he can manipulate the Syrup Trap once it's on the floor? Very well. I will go into battle with my summoning. It is a factor that I've often gone over. Considering, if I'm in the sky, his taijutsu is more or less insignificant. His range ability is an afterthought, considering no one can dare compete with me in a fire fight," Zetsumo notes.

The tension in the air continued to rise. Birds fluttered about, already in preparation of navigating to a different location. It was as if they had a sixth sense. . .One that could detect danger or anticipate it before the roars of war had even began.

"Mm. . . Nature. It has a way of making even the most simple of creatures react in their best interest." There's a grin being worn, and of course, many of Zetsumo's hired guns were running about, making preparations themselves.

"You there. Tell me herbalist, finish the gathering of poisons. I'm getting anxious. . . My blood is boiling, and I will soon need an outlet."* - Sat Sep 12 18:35:31 2015

And so it began.

"It's time we made our moves. I hope you all aren't having cold feet. Go ahead, I'll make announcement to have my troops move. We're not going INTO Kirigakure, mind you. We're all simply just setting up camp to stake them out."

He pulls out a map. "First thing? I'm having my men take out the bridge. We're going to set up various embargos along the land, and completely and utterly eliminate any semblance of eccomerce they may have. If we can't wrecklessly run into the island-based city. . .We will simply evaporate them."

Once giving clear instructions, Zetsumo makes rounds about the village, immobolizing a large troop of his own band of misfits. A group numbering at about one thousand are charged with attacking the bridge -- and are certainly instructed on not daring to cross. From there, they're simply staking out to ensure that the bridge actually remains down.

Considering the waters itself was filled with booby traps, crew of men would arrive along the coast -- but not too close. And set up additional barricades. Sticky, oil-like posion would be released from cannisters from among the four large group of shinobi stationed away from one another. At the most, they would be seated a mile away from one another, and of course were numbering in the thousands (1, 500 more or les.) Inbetween were a small squadrons, all intent on serving as communications for the endeavors to organize strikes.

Thus. . . the waiting game began. How long could the Kirigakure shinobi wait? one could only imagine how long it'd be until the village needed outside assistance -- or until they came to fight themselves.

Ontop of this. Birds are sent over the lands in the hundreds, each with specially made explosive tags. These tags in particular were easily twice as strong as the standard, and are shapened in compacted balls. Assuming capability of getting over the land, these avians unleashed the tags as the flock makes way over the isolated island. And hopefully unleashes hell. . .

A massive stream of fire had bene produced on a moment's notice, secreting sickly inferno seconds later. With unreal quickness, those flames were upon the Ink Spawns.

And had that not been enough?

He's following up. "Wind Release. . . Greatbreakthough." Suddenly, powerful gusts are produced, likely incinerating the spawn completely. "Interesting technique. I can tell. . . This could be fatal. Mmm. . . Your squabble is over something as petty as relationship? You should know. . . girl. Relationships such as that will only make you weak."* - Sat Sep 12 22:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept his arms folded.

". . .You imply that even with her ink. . .She is even a semblance of a threat. You are correct in your assumption. . . Your former companion, she is my prisoner. . .My thrall even. One that seems to have a murderous streak," Zetsumo's serpant-like gaze turned over to the rambunctious teenager. The same expression from before is worn, but it sports a different aura. He was peeved.

"Even with the countless men I've killed. It was never over something so petty. No. . longer am I intrigued. Rather, now I'm sickened, repulsed even. The both of you. Kneel before Zetsumo for even daring to damage the land i've been charged with repairing."

The tone, while stern, also remain collected and calm. It was one that could perhaps be suggested as a request -- yet the underlining tones were quite clear. He had demanded their compliance. * - Sat Sep 12 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It's best if you comply. - Sat Sep 12 23:00:54 2015

". . .Both knees," his eyes canted over to Hanabi briefly. He demands complete and utter subserviance.

Suddenly, his threads speed from his body, and give a nice whip to Amai's rib. It's a fierce blow, one that can leave a reddened mark. Yet he holds enough restraint to ensure that the power resonating through the strings lack just enough strength to avoid piercing skin. 

"Do it like you mean it, wench. . . You behave as if I've done you a disservice."* - Sat Sep 12 23:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Mm. - Sat Sep 12 23:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Something for you to do... - Sat Sep 12 23:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I don't feel the slightest pang of sadness for their idiocy, they should've known when to stop.... Self control is a must.. - Sat Sep 12 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: I was expecting a better show.  - Sat Sep 12 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks towards the cloud, in clear thought.

"Mmm. I do have a special mission. But it is a bit late for you all to do. . ." He says with a hum. And of course, Zetsumo was also relunctant as it was likely an assignment he would need to do personally.

"I do have one contract. ALthough, it is a bit unorthodox. Amegakure -- like any city has crime. Stake out the local dinery and see if you find any suspicious activity. If anyone comes to rob? Kill them. Oh, and bring their bodies to me," he says. A hand is pointed to Sabo and Paine, more or less telling them to go provide assistance. 

(10 RPs for it to be C. 15 for B. In the case of the former, RP a B-ranked crook showing up.)

Once that had been settled, his eyes shift on over back to the two kunoichi that had dared frustrate him. "Now back to you two. The issues. . . They stop now. Mainly because. . . the battle has proven to be dis-interesting. You both now serve under me. Is that understood?" Simple and clean. He had essentially strong armed both into serving him. Questionable? Maybe. But that's how about half of his forces had been accumulated.* - Sat Sep 12 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Well for Amai. It was a given. ButI suppose now. . . I may send her on an assignment or two. - Sat Sep 12 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It would be my pleasure. - Sat Sep 12 23:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Paine. I suppose you're in a daze? - Sat Sep 12 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) internally is seething. He fed off of disapproval or rather defiance from his captives. Yet they were so eager to serve. Was Zetsumo honestly that charismatic?

His hand would stretch forward, strings serving as the bridge between his limb and hte rest of his body. Digits softly pat both of the individuals on the top of their cranium, hoping to further demean them. "Mmm, hug it out then. And rise. I don't want to hear of any of you trying to murder one another. Else. . . Things will take a fatal turn."* - Sat Sep 12 23:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks ahead to the duo. Internally, the desire to bring harm to them both was rising immensely. Of course, this wasn't simply due to rage, but as a result of his desire to see them squirm about. 

"Mmm. Good, you two may rise. But that's the last I'll have of such pettiness."* - Sat Sep 12 23:34:11 2015
