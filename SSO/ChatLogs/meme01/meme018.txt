"That's a good thing that we no wounded. And Amai is always around. . .Your excuses aren't sound. ."

His hand stretches out, with the strings tethering the distance between the hand and the arm. Assuming no interference, those strange fingers clutch at Zenaki's chin, and forces her to look on over to his direction. Even from a distance, the shinobi aims to establish eye contact.

"And you know me well enough to know. . . I don't do excuses. Clean up your act. ." The grip on Zenaki's chin intensifies, although it never reaches the point where you'd think she was at risk of suffering a bone fracture. He wasn't that strong. .  YET.* - Thu Sep 17 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head. 

"I promised this yes -- but that was simply out of the goodness of my heart. . " The grip is tightening, and from the strength mustered by the strings, Zenaki would find herself being lifted a tad. Zetsumo could smell the arrogance running from her soul. She should be cowering -- perhaps it was due to his inactivity that she had forgotten just how terrifying he could be.

Tapping at his side, a scroll is summoned. 

"And I have them. Yet I would never grant it to someone as arrogant and problematic as you are currently being. You will change. . . understood?" The scroll was titled 'Chakra Scalpels.'* - Thu Sep 17 16:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"There are several other medics around. Don't be so naive. I have three other medics -- don't think your position will ever keep me from doing you harm. Recall your place, dear. Considering we're the last living, I am the defacto family head. . . the leader," he says, referencing their fallen father.

"And you won't -try-. You will.. .Is that clear?" By now, the hand is used to pull Zenaki closer, away from her food. Up until they were face to face.

His hot breath was breathing on her neck, making this situation more uncomfortable than it'd need to be.* - Thu Sep 17 16:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: None of those medics is as good as I am, though. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a giant frown. He'd use that same grip and press Zenaki up against the wall. A gathering of threads move out, and whip at the girl's rib cage.

He was aggitated, that much you can tell. Why in the world was this girl undermining his authority and behaving as if he couldn't act on these threats? Had she forgotten just how nasty Zetsumo could be. . ?

". . .You have no leverage, you know this? What Beth done. . . It's nothing compared to what I can accomplish if you continue to tick me off. Understood? I won't be granting you thisj utsu scroll until you prove yourself worthy of learning. . ." The male warns, still remaining uncomfortable close to the bound medical shinobi.

His flesh is convulsing again, as the strings within his body grow active and aggitated. These guys in the Kenryoku. . . They were beginning to become an issue.* - Thu Sep 17 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

The girl wasn't getting it. A two fingers extend, and smack Zenaki on the cheek. "Really. . . Even if you aren't trying, you're ticking me off. I don't care if I'm your brother. You treat me how I am to be treated, as your boss, leader -- and perhaps god," the previous strike likely leaves a red mark on her face. Eventually, Zetsumo's grip is relinquished.

"After we're done here. I want several batches of the poisons produced, and copies done. I will grant you the damn jutsu scroll. But only after it's clear that you respect me. Right now, I don't get that impression. I see a girly that oddly thinks she holds leverage on me. Be it due to relation, or because of your status as medic. . "

Even as his hands had been released, Zetsumo remained infront of the girl. How she landed? Meant little to him.* - Thu Sep 17 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Begrudgingly, the male grows. 

The scroll in hand is taken, and thrusted against Zenaki's chest. "Precisely. Craft your poisons as I have many shinobi that utilize kenjutsu. Having your poison added to the mix will only bolster our strength -- and make a victory against the allied shinobi unit inevitable. This is a scroll, one of many. It's a high leveled medical ninjutsu, and perhaps the most potent that you'll learn. You'll find it especially useful as you'll be able to work on your toys without having to cut them open. .. "

If opened, the skill would be clearly 'B-ranked' which happens to be Jounin-calibar techniques. He huffs, and figures the point had been made. Although there's still clear aggitation of how Zenaki behaved initially. Zetsumo was not one to be taken as a joke.* - Thu Sep 17 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glared.

"Good. This is what I expect -- I won't have my precious sister fade into obscurity. Fighter or not -- you will have  use. If you are a medic, you will simply be the best damn medic the world has to offer," Zetsumo comments. Then the knocks pierce through the skies.

His eyes shift over. 

"Come in. What is it?"* - Thu Sep 17 18:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: When one challenges the Raikage to battle for the title of leadership he must listen , it is an honor bound position followed previously by Niklaus.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a grin. He could smell a trap.

"It sounds foolish. I forseet his being an attack -- as I'm certain based on what you say. Those within Kirigakure, they fear you. You will go there. . .Then you will die. I implore you to negotiate a more. . . neutral ground," he replies, finding the entire situation to be odd. Not on Ushinawa part, of course. But rather, for the opposition.* - Thu Sep 17 18:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm... - Thu Sep 17 18:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: However, I do think... The Mizukage would also come, but I fear neither. - Thu Sep 17 18:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tapped restlessly onto the table.

"That's agree-able. To assist in this arrangement. Let it be known, should he agree I willhave my men stand down. He will be given free passage to leave Kirigakure for the duel," he replies casually. 

"Of course. . I will still prefer to have this 'Mariana' remain with me. Fear not, I am not like the. . . more rambunctious members of my organization. I will not bring harm to her, nor do I have desire," of course, that last line was a stretch. He always wanted to hurt people, it's just that he held great self control. 

He arises on that note.* - Thu Sep 17 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 18:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"We are simply talking business, Shin. I suppose then, I've spent enough time here."

Promptly, he proceeds around the table, while also wrapping  a wiggly tentacle around Zenaki's waste. "You are free to go make arrangement at your leisure. I have to tend to my men," Zetsumo replies. A hand gestures towards Shin, motioning for the lad to follow suit. Assuming no intereference, the trio were heading right towards the exit, and subsequently moving west.

He had shaken down the medic, now it was time to do the same to the other lazy mercenary.* - Thu Sep 17 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yes sir - Thu Sep 17 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shunshins into the area, staring directly towards Katsune.

His feet squishes against the mud, leaving foot prints all over the field. "Hrm. . ? Oh. . You actually did it," the tyrant replies with a light frown. . He's a bit disappointed, as now there was no reason to be even more cruel due to the subordination. 

"Right then. Shin, show me how far you've come with the usage of the last technique I showed you."* - Thu Sep 17 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"This better be good too. . " He muttered under his breath. Briefly, he turns away from Katsune and observes as Shin prepared to perform the technique. Even as a nonsensor, it was as if Zetsumo could feel the flow of oxygen within the boy's body being shifted and overwhelmed with an irregular gathering of Katon chakra. Before long, that same gas is being seeped from Shin's nostrils and mouth, much to fiend's delight. 

It isn't long for the excess of oxygen is being ignited by a tag. 

Dazzling flames sprout into the area, giving an orange glow that swiftly dissipate given enough travel. "My . . That was relatively impresssive. Especially for a boy that wouldn't even claim 'Elemental Ninjutsu' as his specialty. Good. . .Good. I'll show you a new technique in a while. Although, do not take my compliments as a sign to slow down. Your overall competency in Katon release still leaves much to be desired. You would know that relying on your. . . other talents simply won't suffice in the ninja world," the demon says, scolding Shin even as a compliment is given.

"But first..."

Robotically, he turns around, eying Katsune and the mud she sat in. His arms are folded, and a scowl again is forming. "So you finally decided to stop being lazy. The field is muddied. ..  swell. Now that the environment is settled, show me your Dragon Mud Bullet!" he orders. Meanwhile, Zenaki is manuevered and set up ahead. Her body is displaced, soon being seated on the mud. She isn't addressed on this occasion, but it's expected that she actually begins to work on that scroll that Zetsumo spent eight million to purchase.* - Thu Sep 17 18:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Sep 17 19:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
With a pivot, his body suddenly accelerates. With an odd degree of grace, he's dancing about the incoming mud bullets, forcing the first few to miss their mark entirely. 

As he's closing in, the Snake hand sign are effortlessly woven through. From this, a block of earth pops from the ground, enduring and blocking off the rest of the incoming projectiles. Each hit shakes this modified Earthen Corridor to the core, but none ever seem close to compromising the thickness and sturdiness that came from Zetsumo's technique. 

It's by this point that Katsune would likely recognize -- this guy isn't too slow. Assuming she had ran, he would be upon her, and a hand clutches at the teen's neck, choking her a bit and pushing her against the wall. Simultaneously with the gesture, the mitt has chakra flown into it -- Doton chakra specifically. It treats his cells very much like common earth, and thus grants his skin an inhuman degree of endurance, and for some reason empowers overall physical capability.

"You got a lot of nerve. . .! I know what you were aiming for, tramp. . !" * - Thu Sep 17 19:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) loosened his grip just a -tad-.

It's enough to allow an almost negligible amount of oxygen to slip through. For a moment, his beady eyes just stared ahead, taking in the beautiful sight of Katsune's struggle. No matter how petty. Doing something of this calibar always placed his soul in a state of bliss. ". . .Futile. Do you never tire of this. . ? You step out of line. . . Then I put you back into your place. ."  As another moment of scanning, Zetsumo finally moves to act. The grip is taken advantage of, and from this position, Katsune is easily lifted. 

He takes her body, and goes to ram it against the muddy floor. Thankfully, she had done a damn good job in preparing the area, as the mud cushions the blow. Kneeling over, he continues with the abuse, flipping the loli's small frame, and pushing her head now, face first into the mud, as if trying to make the woman eat it.

All of these acts are aided in part by the herculean strength granted from his 'Earth Skin' technique. "ALthough. . . It would be a lie for me to say I don't enjoy demeaning or humiliating you. Yet I implore you to learn. Hence why I am making you grow acquainted with the mud. Perhaps then you will understand what you are-- at least in comparison to myself. Nothing but filthy mud,"  Zetsumo taunts. Eventually, he rises, and stands erect.

His boot is rising, though. . . and chakra continues to churn. 

. . . Cue moment of pause. 

"Excellent work on the Earth Dragon by the by." It was true, for someone who wasn't as experienced as he, the technique was well-done. Although, it remained riddled with flaws.* - Thu Sep 17 19:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 19:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: How're you doing? - Thu Sep 17 19:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Then came the lightning.

It sparks, and clashes against the Doton cladded hand. Yet. . . Given his clear advantage in all things elemental, and the fact that this technqiue was vastly inferior to his Domu, things don't quite go as Katsune had planned.

"Mmm. . Had she been a better elementalist, or perhaps even used a stronger technique, I may have actually felt that. . " he thinks to himself.

Instead of being shocked, lightning runs along his brown, earth-covered flesh. It zaps, and begins to crack away at the doton transformation. But, save a few pebbles being broken off, and dust falling onto the floor, Zetsumo remained relatively uneffected. Although, in unlikely case that she manages to shock through the earth skin, he shrugs off the light static as pain was simply pleasure to him.

Instead, his foot comes clamping down, hoping to press and keep Katsune's frame bound to the floor. Would it even work? (Pause for now to see if that works)* - Thu Sep 17 19:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: >Still nub - Thu Sep 17 20:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
She manages to slip out of his grasp.

The ground is being split open or rather made into a suitable condition to slip in. Sadly, before Katsune can slip away, his threads speedo ut from the ribs, and go to wrap about the kunoichi's muddied body. 

". . .I didn't say you could slip away. . . Quit being difficult. ." The voice suggests amusement and pity at the same time. Ontop of this, he suppose now that Shin was back away, it was time to address him.

"Ah. .. Shin, you've awoken. What jutsu will I be teaching you now. . .You know of the 'Fire Run' technique, yes?"* - Thu Sep 17 20:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yes, I've heard of it - Thu Sep 17 20:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Hrm. . . <*Speaks casually while tormenting Katsune*>Hrm. . . And you know Housenka. I have other techniques,  but I fear they may be beyond your skill level. - Thu Sep 17 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I've taught you the Exploding Flame Shot? Or my Fire Pistol? - Thu Sep 17 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: No . . . uhm, Kilm and I discussed this  technique of yours. - Thu Sep 17 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The threads continue to move about, slithering along Katsune's body like slippery snakes. They eventually find way to her arms, and aim to pry her hands away from one another. Assuming they're quick enough, she'd be held in bondage, and presumably kept from doing anything else.

The efforts take quite a bit of his thread quantity, although it's quite clear that he has more being stored within his frame.

"Right. Elaborate, Shin. What did you discuss? And which technique?" His eye momentarily flicks on over to the genjutsu-minded shinobi. This last a second, and he's right back to observing the girl and her futile attempts to resist.* - Thu Sep 17 20:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: That we hadn't learned on our own - Thu Sep 17 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) tucks his thumb into his hand. Katon chakra routinely is built, and flowed towards the hand. Once the thumb flicks forward, a speedy bullet of flame goes rushing forward, intent on smacking Shin right in the forehead. It wasn't going to burn, though, Zetsumo had restraint.

Meanwhile, the threads continue to move uncomfortably about Katsune's body. The quantity soon enough grows to an extent that most of her frame is covered.* - Thu Sep 17 20:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...That looks cool. - Thu Sep 17 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . .It was a joke, Zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The point was to make you move. Not actually hit you. - Thu Sep 17 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) internally frowned.

He was having so much fun harrassing her, though. A bully at heart, but feeling justice had been served, the shinobi releases her. . . The threads quickly are unraveling, and aim to slide her across the ground on release.

"I didn't find it funny," the grouch says with a huff.

"Of course. . .Doing that to her was some of the best entertainment I've had all week," he says within the safety of his mind.* - Thu Sep 17 20:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: So boring. - Thu Sep 17 21:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . - Thu Sep 17 21:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) dusts off his hands.

"Right. And that was just a single variation. I can also fire it with my index finger. If you know 'Exploding Flame Shot' then you can probably just see it as a variant of this. This technique is especially useful since you can fire it without any handsigns, and of course it can be used in quick succession. . "

He says, holding a hand out once more to guide the boy along this process.

"To do so. Build up your Katon chakra. Rather than having it knead with the oxygen in your body, you attack or target the oxygen by your figner tips. Manipulate it into small, bullet-like shapes. Once the flame is conjured, send the gathered energy flying forward. As you progress, you'll be able to spawn them more quickly."

Finally comes the hands on demonstration. 

Azue-colored chakra is clearly flowing from his palms. Eventually, that same energy breaks off into particles, and flows within the air itself. Dimly, light is produced as flames sparks up while simultanously being manipulated around the fingers. Like regular gun, bullets of inferno are being rocketed off, and clashing against Shin's frame. Again, it's held back immensely to avoid leaving severe burns.

"Simple."

Fuck his thousand warrior sacrifice.

He seemed relatively unalarmed, and stared the massive Snake in the eyes. "If he wants sacrifices, he can just take part in one of the future battles. I have hardly any men to spare," Zetsumo speaks softly in reference to Hanabi -- although his gaze never leaves Manda's.

"Name's Zetsumo. 'God of War'. . .Although, I haven't a clue where that moniker spawned from. Your master here says you can tell me what I need to know. Give me any important details from the recent conflict within Konohagakure. I know it ended in my favor, or -our- favor. But perhaps there are some details worth mentioning."

It was odd how little fear he showed despite coming face to face to one of the more significant reptilians the world had to offer. And why? It was simple. This wasn't the worse thing he's seen. There were many 'Ducks' that he had grown acquainted too that were just as fiercesome -- believe it or not.  Still, despite the bravado, his body remained tensed and prepared to act. Never would he dare underestimate or make light of such a powerful summon.* - Fri Sep 18 00:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"I see. . .Then there is nothing of relevance. It is clear that Ushinawa has survived to this point, that is for sure. I suppose that is all I need to hear. . " He says, flicking his eyes on over to Hanabi.

He stares for a moment, before loooking back up to Manda.

"And the reason I have no fear is simple. I can summon creatures mostly rivalling your might. . . And unlike Hanabi. Those that I summon under true power -- and treat me with respect. I am the master, they are the servants." He wastes no time, demonstrating precisely what had been stated. Five short seals later, after gathering blood, the area is covered in smoke. As it clears? A giant avian is left in its wake. She's covered in cobalt and thick feathers. They seem to practically glisten in the sunlight.

Zetsumo remains ontop of the magnificient summoning creature.

"S-Zetsumo-sama? Why did--" He cuts her off quickly as usual.

"This is my own summoning, Dorja. She knows my strength and I'm certain she could take on you -- along with anyone else in the area. Regardless. . .I know enough. I'm going to head off for the night. You all. . .Don't be stupid in my absence," the shinobi declares. If not opposed, he flutters off -- and offers final comment. "I'll comfirm with Ushinawa. If what you said is true, you'll be rewarded accordingly, Hanabi."* - Fri Sep 18 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns. He and Dorja continued to fly off into the sunset. The messenger bird had arrived -- and how rude was it of Zetsumo to not notice. Leisurely, the shinobi sat ontop of the magnificient avian, and he'd proceeded along the giant forest.

"Mmm. Things are finally coming together, Dorja. I feel the war will come to an end and finally. . The dreams I've told you off will prosper. But first, I must go collect the income from a little birdie of mine. ." Dorja continued to flap her wings, she seemed to have restlessly worked to keep his and her own body airbourne. Eventually, they would be upon Konohagakure, an old establishment. 

Hopefully no one spotted him or sought to attack.* - Fri Sep 18 01:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And then the morning came.

He yawns, stretching out each of his muscles and preparing for another bit of traveling. "Rise and shine Dorja. . " He kicks off, and lands right on her back. His feet kicks, prompting the avian to take to the skies. And take to the skies she did. . . Quickly, Dorja's wings are flapping, and she's speeding ahead, moving westward to the destiantion.

"Things are looking up. . Dear. Although I am unsatisified. I can't help but feel as if. . This Ushinawa is showing me up. He's been the driving force in this war ever since joining my ranks-- save for that one battle." It was true that Zetsumo had been the lynchpin to pushing Amegakure to victory -- and as a result, his own agenda. And certianly, he was by far the biggest threat to the opposition. And while there was happiness in the recent exchange. . . He couldn't help but feel envy. * - Fri Sep 18 01:38:20 2015

Kaboom. . .!

Massive explosions were occuring. To the west? Remained the small group of shinobi who he could likely identify as allies. And now, the point of focus remained in the massive steam cloud. It takes no time at all for Zetsumo's chakra to get churning and flowing. And just like that. . .He's not at maximum power. 

Those with sensory ability would be able to detect the sudden increase in strength, and overall chakra quantity.

"Fuuton release. . .Great Breakthrough. . !" Five seals flat are completed, and quickly, there's a massive gale going over the area. It sweeps the scene, and takes out the steam immediately. WHat more? The Shadow Clone that ran was almost certainly caught in the range. Overall, this certainly deals with the initial threat -- thus making it apparent. The true culprit wasn't to in plain sight.  ". . .Hrm. Gone. . .And I'm willing to bet its--" 

Hiding like a Mole. The bane of Zetsumo's very being. He and his summoning were practically the same people, and often worked together in unison. Abruptly, Dorja is building up chakra and releasing a massive stream of water. Following suit, the shinobi empowers the suiton was it crashes along the ground, using his patent Earth Flash technique. Given the combination, the on impact the ground would be absolutely ruptured, and the lightning literally pierced through the earth.

This meant a bigger issue than you could anticipate. As the water spreaded, so did the electrical current. * - Fri Sep 18 02:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued in hot pursuit.

First thing first came the clone. With a simple thought, his body again convulsing. From his frame, a thread-covered entity is being richocheted and eventually lands onto the ground with a loud thus. In no time at all, this creature takes a more humanoid appearance -- and the ground itself beckons to the entity's will. 

Instantly, spikes protrude, four spawning from different locations to impale the Shadow Clone's body. Meanwhile, once that clone had immediately dispersed, the Doton Mask continues working, sensing the ground for any disturbance. It too could used magnetic sensing, and quite quickly, it's digging up massive holes in the ground to serve as an avenue for Zetsumo's continued chase.

"Hrm. . .? Dorja. . .Bomb's away."
--------------------- Doton Mask ---------------------------------------
"O-Okay sempai. . ." the avian declared.  Her tush shook, and from her rear, two massive eggs fall, and clatter against the ground. He follows the same tactic as before. 

After three seals, his hands again spark with electricity, which subsequently fire along the ground. It ends up colliding with the unstable 'grenades', sending off a massive explosion of Suiton and Raiton might. Needless to say, the ground was going to take another hit. Perhaps this would catch the fool unfortunate enough to have been hidding underground? Regardless, considering Zetsumo could too feel the vibrations of the earth -- he had no intent on stopping any time soon.
* - Fri Sep 18 03:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Clever. Although not good enough. Zetsumo sends two more specimens to go assist in the endeavor as they proved to be faster than even he was. The Fire and Wind brothers. God bless your soul, Katsi. Before that had happened, the Grenades from before had done a number of the landscape, forcing a large crater to be spawned on the area. . . as lightning runs along, rupturing the ground. "I should just send my Lightning Mask too. ."

The Earth Mask continued with his endeavors. The distraction with the clone would have been dully noted. Although, there was one issue. The mask, due to sensing the vibrations along the ground could tell when a new entity had been spawned. Thus, it's evasive tactics were sadly just a tad bit below standards.

On cue, using it's speed, and above-average body sized, the Mask dived in, effortless forming enlarged tunnels along the ground. It pops up subsequently afterwards, giving room for the next strike- -while moving towards the right to take cover.

Quickly, the tunnel is filled to the brink with toxic, Katon-spawned gas. It foams, and soon after. . . the combo of epic proportion is unleashed. After slyly linking together, the Fuuton and Katon heart unleash two attacks in unison. Goukakyuu. . .and GreatBreakthough. 

This combo in particular? Is out of this world. On impact with the Burning Ash technique, the combination unleashes a massive torrent of pure, unadulterated. . .Almost hell-like fire. It aims to force the ground to implode on itself, while potentially burning Tethy's to a crisp. Considering the nature, it also covers a criminally large range, making evasion all too difficult.* - Fri Sep 18 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The Earth clone promptly deals with such. 

CHakra flows along it's frame, and from the ground, a corridor spontaneously speeds up. The goal? To encase the clone, effectively blocking the Great Breakthough  technique before it can even get far. 

The earth itself would rupture, but it doesn't quite break,

Meanwhile, the previous assault goes on without a hitch.* - Fri Sep 18 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) Zetsumo OOCS: (The explosion

Zetsumo OOCS: (_-oh
Blue Fox OOCS: (yeah)* - Fri Sep 18 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shook his head.

"The Mighty Tethys. . . 'Black Blade'. . .Running? What happened to all the smack he spoke of before. . . He isn't so big when not backed by a massive army," Zetsumo murmurs in pity. Simultaneously, the Lightning Mask is spat out, entering the fray and stopping right along side the other three.

The trio of Masks out work in unison as per usual.

From the Earth? Comes a massive Earthen Corridor. It splits along from the mountainous walls that are on the east and west. The goal? To limit just where Tethys had to run. It would rise high into the skies, making it certain that his only method of evasion was a predictable location -- the ground.

On cue, the Wind/Fire Masks do their thing, linking up against for another, massive infern o combo. It covers a ludicrious length and wind, in hopes of quite literally evaporating the famed Mizukage.

Last but not least? Earth Flash is delivered. Lightning runs along the ground, underneath the flame, in hopes of ensuring that the Hozuki would not escape the endeavor. After all, where did this man have to go? By now, it was up to the masks to finish the job since Tethys proved to be a swift little bugger.

* - Fri Sep 18 04:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The Earth Grudge Creatures would have continued pursuit regardless.

In the end, it mattered little how many meatbags you formed considering the simple magnitude and size of the onslaught. All the clones would have been easily destroyed, and the attack still continues onward to Tethys in all honesty.* - Fri Sep 18 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Given the circumstances. . .

The five Exploding Water Shots does the trick. It manages to fight the flames to a stalemate. Although, it's at a cost. The explosion releases a shockwave, enough to deter the bulk of the Kage Bunshins that had been spawned. 

Likewise, the previous Great Breakthough serve well to stop the incoming electricial circuits. 

Sadly, it doesn't seem that the Creatures are quit through. The Wind Mask covers the advance, releasing another massive torrent of wind to deal with any of the Kage Bunshins that may exist.  

Quickly, while still running, the Fire Mask continues attacking. From it's maw, large strips of flames immediately go along the ground, moving at a criminally swift pace. The goal? To again entrap Tethys within a technique -- this time via Katon. Considering Tethy's strength? He would have been able to chip a hole into the corridor, barely.

Presuming the flames go around, the foursome of Earth Grudge Creatures do their thing. The Fuuton mask releases several small tornadoes -- Divine Wind. The entire area is engulfed in scorching heat, marring the ground with dark, tattered rocks. 

The Raiton Mask unleashes another surge of electricity along the ground, in hopes of taking out the Hozuki threat once and for all. 

Lastly, Doton gets into the mix. A mitt presses against the ground, and from the Earth, several swift and enlarged pillars are being erected along the surface. Four in total. Each hit appears to be intended for lethality, hoping to puncture and force reliance on the Suiton Transformation -- which Tethys had seldomly used much to Zetsumo's surprised.

Or well, the Mask's I guess. Zetsumo has long since been left behind.* - Fri Sep 18 05:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Bah. He's too far to use that jutsu. Look at me force once. - Fri Sep 18 05:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: .. - Fri Sep 18 05:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And more clones are added as fodder to save the original Tethys.

The Suiton endeavor serves it purpose, fighting off most of the flames. Sadly, 'Raging Waves' doesn't cover too large of a range, and the flames are coming up from all sides due to the tornado. The clones probably go poof.

Tethys, in his escape, likely would suffer burns along his legs, although he's able to be thrown.

Hot in pursuit, the Earth Grudge Creatures continue to fire off attacks.

Two bolts of electricity form into balls, each flying and aiming to pelt the Hozuki as he's airbourne. Hit or miss, the Earth Grudges is following up with a variant of the usual Katon-Fuuton combo. Instead of a massive stream, there's a gigantic ball of firey death sailing ahead.  

Flooring suit, the lonely Doton Mask tries to get in-- likely to no avail. Had the first assaults not done the trick, it uses the somewhat soaking floor to craft mud. From this mud, a Dragon Head forms. Cannon-ball sized mudballs are being richochet'd at blurring  through the skies, hoping to pelt and continue to keep the pressure on.

Meanwhile. . . Zetsumo is way back, still trying to chase and catch up. "I should just Shunin.."* - Fri Sep 18 05:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Bullseye.

The Mud Bullets come last, assaulting Tethy's frame as the electrical shocks continue to go through. They pelt his back, sending condensed shockwaves along his frame.

The Earth Grudges continue chasing. . . And. . 

(Anywho. Agreement made OOCly. Tethys can escape -- under the assumption the agreement is honor'd. Although, I'm messaging Zeno at the moment. Considering downtime, we can just vibe. If he answers it's legit, I'll let it go through from this point. If not, we'll pick back up.)* - Fri Sep 18 06:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And at last. . .Calmness befell the area.

For the last hour, the two waged war. Again and again, the Titan known as the 'God of War' displayed his seemingly boundless elemental expertise. Kumogakure suffered greatly, and the earth practically cried out in anguish. ". . .Mmm. He is resourceful. . .That clone technique is beyond the norm as well. He can seemingly use more than one elemental nature type. But all the same, he will succumb to my might. . ."

And the prediction ringed true.

In the end, the Earth Grudge Creatures manage to outlast Tethys. No matter how deterous or resourceful the Hozuki proved to be, he just could not quite escape the range of attack these brutes possessed. 

Admist the 'Blue Fox's speech, the actual Zetsumo had finally arrived. Ontop of a duck, and panting for air due to the amount of chakra that had been expended in the high speed chase. ". . .And it finally ends. This battle. . .It has been a long time coming, 'Hogo.' I knew since the days of the old 'Gezo Tournament' that we would one day engage in combat. And to think. . .Five years later, it is still the same result. With you remaining on the defensive while I dominant for the entire duration. . " the 'God of War' monologues. 

With some of Tethy's body at last evaporating, he looks to the skies as the oft volatile, close-quarter-combatant literally ascended into the heavens. On the inside, there existed a somewhat empty feeling. It was as if a portion of his life was being close.

For years. . .Zetsumo clawed his way up the food chain. And now, with such a key piece in the opposition taken out. . . It was beginning to look like his dream was on the horizon. "Despite your running antics, you were a worthy adversary." Upon descending from the avian, the hearts ball back up into stick spheres. Each speed into his body.

The victor makes his approach, and seeks to gatherwhat remained of the 'Black Blade.' Likewise, he has some of the help come, carrying the dehydrated carcass. It was time to head back home.* - Fri Sep 18 06:55:47 2015

After day's travel, he would return to Amegakure or. . .Where ever they'd have been posted.

Of course, he would have Ushinawa transfer Kumogakure's resources at a later date. Indeed, he's floating above and making his descent. Although, before outright landing, Zetsumo looks ahead, eying the trio as they mingled within the city.* - Fri Sep 18 07:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Tethys is dead . . . Damn . . . I should've known he would've faced Zetsumo soon. - Fri Sep 18 08:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Nothing can be done about that anymore though. - Fri Sep 18 08:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) scratches his nose.

There were no clear injuries on his body. Just his slightly charred clothing. "I see. Well, I have a new body. Sadly, I don't think his organs are in good enough condition for harvesting. It would still be worthwhile to dissect and check his genetic structure. . . No?"

Even with the battle being day's removed, Zetsumo still seemed to suffer from fatigue -- mentally. He leans against the fence.

"I can have it stored for later usage. . " He replies, directing all his attention to Zenaki for the time being.* - Fri Sep 18 08:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. Will do. I will check on it later.  - Fri Sep 18 08:47:34 2015

"I got a message from Ushinawa to come to Kumogakure to collect resources and such. On arrival, there was an attack. He collapsed and I pursued the 'Hogo'," Zetsumo replies bluntly.The dried carcass is taken and placed into storage to later be tended to.

He continues to move onward, leaning against the wall.

"I suppose. .. This is another one of Zenaki's playthings. . .I still can't fathom how she keeps attracting these freaks," he comments in an offhanded fashion. His eyes shift on over to Katsune.

"Yesterday. . .Did you not notice the resemblance you held to my dear Mukade? It was uncanny. I am amused that my thrall unsettled you to such a degree. You were getting so worked up," he says, somewhat mocking Katsune for her inability to keep Amai under control. * - Fri Sep 18 09:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's not for any other reason than her being able to fly. - Fri Sep 18 09:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Since she can fly, I needed to set rules. - Fri Sep 18 09:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There would've been no rules at all. I wouldn't have -needed- any because that pretentious girl is so irrelevent. - Fri Sep 18 09:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm sure she's insanely weak too. I bet it takes her longer to draw than it takes me to weave a few handseals. - Fri Sep 18 09:04:38 2015

He looks around. ". . .Bah. I would say my victory should inspire celebrations. However. . . The war is far from over. ." Zetsumo murmured. He was still stressed, the war still very much hinged on himself performing at top capacity. He couldn't let the Kenryoku down.* - Fri Sep 18 10:17:10 2015

"And why am I just now finding out about this?"* - Fri Sep 18 10:22:17 2015

"All in due time, dear. All in due time. . . It should be our's however. Given enough time."* - Fri Sep 18 10:49:36 2015

"Maybe, maybe not. Why do you ask? We're not exactly keen on providing information to a stranger," the guards replies, still keeping their weapons strong.* - Fri Sep 18 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) says: Long story short, I came to ask..Why War upon so many villages..What is it that he is after..This would be my first time meeting the man, I came with no hostile intentions..Since I was married to Kastya, many feared him..She feared him..I've lived long enough to see the power he holds..And I only wish to ask why.. - Fri Sep 18 10:54:43 2015

"Because the world is evil and must be changed. . ." 

A deep, booming voice can be heard from above. He was perched ontop of his flying summoning, staring down onto the ANBU Agent. The gaze was regal in nature, and akin to an angel looking down onto simple mortals.

"Now be gone, boy."* - Fri Sep 18 10:56:25 2015

"Last time I'll allow it. Keep me informed all on the happenings, woman."* - Fri Sep 18 10:58:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I'll just tell Zetsumo things that i'm sure are very important . . . Since everything else just keeps getting friends into trouble and makes me feel bad whenever they're the one who get punished and not me. - Fri Sep 18 11:16:54 2015

"Good then. It may very well ensure that you live a long and prosperous life. ." He says dully. He was still suffering from mental fatigue. The last few days had been exhasting, and he was likely needing some relaxation to calm his nerves.* - Fri Sep 18 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is, I was considering running away for a while. - Fri Sep 18 11:19:28 2015

His eyes lazily fall onto Katsune. "For what reason. . ?"* - Fri Sep 18 17:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Reasons. - Fri Sep 18 17:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Fri Sep 18 17:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stretches. He looks to Paine, who seems to be continuing her meditation efforts. ". . .She does this a lot," Zetsumo states with a drawl. A hand flicks away, motioning all the twenty guards to more or less. . .Get the fuck out. It wasn't that necessary, considering it was just a single 'War Prisoner' being guarded, and she may not even remain one for much longer.

His eyes scan about the area.

"The war is almost over. And rightfully so. . This entire thing has been a snooze. I hardly ever get to cut loose. .. " Zetsumo complains. He whistles shortly after, and snaps his fingers -- in order to call Amai over like the pet that she remained to be.

"In anycase, I am rejunvenated. What has occured in my absence."
