"No can do. You must be taught. . . Perhaps once you experience this, you'll learn the error of your ways. And won't dare try such a move on my sweet sister ever again."

His grip of Beth's hair is subsequently allowed to fall free. She'd be on a freefall, likely landing on her knees -- and if that didn't happen, she certainly was going to be forced there. Right on levels with the behemoth's crotch, which was swelling and gaining an amassment of blood. Arousal. Primal, unrestrained arousal.

The brute castedh is gaze downward, and the fear wreaking from Beth's was like music to his ears -- or a pleasant smell. One that attracted him, and only enticed the fiend to act further. It as as if he fed on despair, and at this very moment, Beth was an all you can eat buffet in that regards.

"Begin. And don't try anything funny, no ninjutsu. Lest I get really. . . Really. . . 'upset.'" A simple warning. What was bad now? Could for certain get worse.* - Tue Sep 15 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) continued to shake his head in a slow, mechanical fashion. Beth had made her bed, now she had to lie in it. Considering she had no intent on actually getting on with the act? Zetsumo takes initiative. The strings governing his Jounin suit are undone, allowing his pelvis region to breath just a bit. There's an innate twitch occuring along the fabric -- which was as a result of his pulsating member. Quickly, his length was expanding, and more importantly, hardening. Before long, a hand slips through the opening, and snakes out his stitch-covered, zombie-like cock. It's flapped forward, smacking the woman rudely in the face.

As that settles, he's positioning it, allowing the head to rest right on her lips.

"Hurry up. I don't want to keep people waiting," barked the domineering tyrant. It was a shame. Beth had retained her purity for all of these years. Pity she had to fuck up this bad.* - Tue Sep 15 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
The whisper grants an avenue, an opening even.

As her lips spread, he pushes in, allowing the head of his gargantuan cock to slip in. By now, the blood ceases it flow, allowing Zetsumo's length to be at full size -- and it's a monster. A stitch covered monster, with flesh that appear as if it was the fringe of decay. In terms of length, his member seemed to be at least a foot long, and oddly remained overwhelmed with veins, that squirmed and pivoted, as there were worm-like insects wiggling within.

The throbs remain consistent, occuring in unison with the many heart beats that inhabited Zetsumo's body.

"Mmm. . ." hummed the demonic brute. He still looks down, now wearing a doll-like grin, as possessive eyes take in the girl's clear despair. "This is necessary. . . She's grown too lax. She feels untouchable. . .Now I will make it clear that I still have my methods of getting through. After all, there is no better way to get through to a woman. . . than to take what she holds dear."

After some thought, he barks out! "Suck. . . I'm sure you aren't that ignorant."* - Tue Sep 15 01:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Inevitably, she shifts her face and forces his length to exit much sooner than anticipated. 

Even as Beth backpeddled, there was little area for escape. Her back remained pinned against the wall, and her knees rising only increased how feeble she looked. This, sadly enough, was Amegakure. Zetsumo's playpin. . . his jungle, where he remained the apex predator. 

To him, Beth was now just a piece of meat ready to be devoured.

His body slinks over, and soon, his cock lingers right infront of the teen's face. Even now, he's still reeling from the pleasant sensation that had developed from just a brief moment in Beth's mouth -- and he had to have more. A hand remained at the base of his zombie-like dick, and the sexual organ repeatily is risen up, only to smack down. 

On the tenth collsion, and small  release of pre-cum rushes ahead, splattering about the girl's face, and drooping down her feature. His throbs only grow more ferocious. "Get to it. Or else, things just get rough. If you're going to behave like a whore. . .Then that's simply what you will be. My whore. Now do as I say."* - Tue Sep 15 02:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
He growled, reeling from the defiance.

Persistance was key, and it seemed Zetsumo held that quality in abundance. Again and again, through the night, the Huevo-spawn kept at it, prodding his hot member against the girl's head -- before eventually forcing it back into her mouth. Now? He's rough, and unrelenting.

His cock is repeatily shoved in and out, the sheer size enough to force outlines to be formed along Beth's flesh. It's hardly a pleasant process, and eventually, with the mixture of thick pre-cum and throat saliva, his cock is left a glistening, sticky mess. Towards the end, Zetsumo pulls out, and allows the throbbing sexual organ to remain on the victim's face.

Cue. . . . two hours later.

In this time frame, he's an absolute animal, and focuses attention towards the teen's two tight, virigin holes. Neeedless to say, due to his inhumane size, there's quite a bit of stretching occuring, and her 'womanly regions' are left gaping a tad. The last area that had been targetted was of course Beth's vagina. The girl's back is left tethered onto the wall, while her body is covered in saliva or sweat.

He's just now pulling out, and aiming his cock-slit upward. "Mmm. . . For shame. I had to wear you out in such a thorough fashion. But I trust now -- you will never. . . ever. . . try such things against my kin." Like a firehose, creamy, white semen comes pumping out of his dick-slit, and goes to coat Beth in a nice layer of his unborn children. Through this all, Zetsumo hums, andh is body twitches with delight upon each contraction of the muscles that lingered within the sexual organ.

Finally, the deed had been done.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have arose.

"Now tell me. There will be no retaliation, correct? And I will never get a report from Zenaki talking about how you mis-used your skills. . .?" He looks ahead, staring with a distant look. There seems to be no shame.* - Tue Sep 15 02:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) smacks butt just to irritate on the way out.

"That oughta learn her."* - Tue Sep 15 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
For the weeks that ensued. . . War was a steady process. As the commander, Zetsumo remained a busy bee. He consistently moved from the Amegakure camp, all the way towards the outskirts of Kirigakure -- to ensure that everything remained in place.

Yet only a fool could remain in a stationary position for too long.

Thus, on this day, the male took a short, brisk walk back home. His feet slid across the floor, and before long, he had stopped right at Katsune's home. The door is cracked open -- and had it been locked, he'd just literally break in. Regally, Zetsumo moves over, heading right into the bedroom, his eyes beelining for Katsune.

"You there. Awaken if you haven't already done so."* - Tue Sep 15 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"I pretty much own Amegakure. . . How do you think? If I want to get in a house -- then I will. There's nothing else to say on the matter."

As usual, his eyes carry a pesona of sterness. Despite the stern demeanor, however, it's clear he's examining her form -- as it lacks clothing. His pupils occasionally flick up and down, as if undressing the youth, most likely to her chargin. And the more she disliked it, the greater ppleasure that came as a result.

"You've been very unproductive." A whip forms from the strings that made up his body, and it slams hard against the ground. Whip-lashing sound effects ring through the small living quarters, and a devious smile springs to life.  "You realize how much I dislike those that remain unproductive. . . Especially in times like this. Your senses most remain sharp and refined for war. After all, your skillset is perfect for dealing with the enemy," he says, referencing Katsune's three different elemental affinities, all of which would work wonders considering the terrain.

"Get up."* - Tue Sep 15 16:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's suddenly incredulous gaze makes it clear he's having a hardtime believing anything.

Of course, by this point, the male had heard all about the rogue or 'Anbu' that had infiltrated the village in his initial assault on Kirigakure.  ". . .Like what? I heard all of your exploits. Getting more or less manhandled by that Anbu. You should be ashamed -- but that weakness can be fixed. Put some clothes on, wench. We're heading out, and I'm going to teach you a thing or two," the brute states. 

His eyes still hold that predator-like persona, as if he's viewing Katsune as nothing more than a piece of food, rather than an actual human being.* - Tue Sep 15 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rips through the sheets via his threads.

He's hardly amused, and continues to give an uncomfortable gaze as Katsune is getting dressed. "Took you long enough. I'm going to teach you a few new techinques. . . After I check your progress on the various ninjutsu that I've already taught you," Zetsumo notes. He turns about face, and briskly heads off. The door, by now, was certainly still open as it would have potentially be torn off the hinges to grant entry.

Before actually heading to train Katsune, it seems the boss man was moving onward to the local plaza. After all, there were many other underlings that had been checked in with.* - Tue Sep 15 17:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) after eying the duo for a brief moment, Zetsumo blurs off. In record time, the shinobi lands with a skid, and eyes Katsune.

"Now tell me. Have you mastered the last Doton skill I've shown you? I expect proficiency, if I am to teach you one of my more potent abilities," the brute says. His eyes scan over the north, as various other shinobi comes from the plaza in order to learn the Genjutsu Release technique.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a dull expression.

The Earthen Corridor would have sprung up, enclosing numerous trees within circular dome. His direction never turns from Katsune, although is eyes flick about, taking note of the change in scenery. There's a silence, as Zetsumo gathers his thoughts or opinions on the matter.

". . .Pitiful. Pitiful. .. Although, I will be willing to teach you an additional technique. It's offensive, and will work in conjunction with the Earthen Corridor. For now, do as I say. Clear out the grass here, and cover it entirely within mud. In prepration for my next jutsu. In the meantime. . .I will teach you maggots the art of 'Kai.'"

His eyes are shifted on over to Paine and Amai for the occasion. A hand motion s them forward. "For this technique, you can either use a single handsign. Or at mastery. . . Just flex your chakra control. What I want you all to do is focus on your chakra circulatory system, and pause all movement. Once done? You take a bit of chakra, and push in the opposite direction of the normal circulation. In practice, this will eliminate a genjutsu. But going further than this, to actually be successful in your endeavor. The quantity or force must be greater than the amount of chakra placed into the initial gen."* - Tue Sep 15 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) doesn't pay those people in the back any attention.

Indeed, his focus is now on endowed kunoichi known as Katsune. He looks ahead, and forms three seals -- slowly. "These are the set of hand signs you'll need to learn the jutsu. And of course, a pre-requisite is to have a muddy terrain. Thus, knowing mud-based Doton techniques, or Suiton does wonders to building up the necessary skill."

Sliding over, he stops right by Katsune side. Doton chakra is being built up and stacked onto of one another. It eventually reaches a boiling point, and eventually begins to leak out of the male's frame. The thickness is clear, and there's a purple-ish glow shrouding his figure. Those with keen senses likely would feel innate disgust, as the essence of Zetsumo's chakra was foul. If you could compare it to taste? Normal energy was akin to. . . syrup. His? Was like spoiled milk.

He was rotten to the core.

From the spillage, the fiend guides his chakras down onto the muddy surface, and forces the ground itself to quiver. It's shaking -- hard. And for the moment, it's as if there's a subtle earthquake being developed along the general terrain. Eventually, the mud takes shape, and forms a massive dragonhead. The mass enough to eclipse even a normal human body. "What i'm doing is building up a Dragon Head. It'll be made up of entirely mud. But that's the point. From this mud, you can easily access and form condensed spheres. The reason the Dragonheadi s necessary? Is because you're using the chakra infused in that to make the earth react -- and launch your formed spheres ahead. It possesses quite a bit of power, and can be sent in bulk to make evasion all but impossible," he notes.

The Dragon's maw practically flaps, and unleashes a subtle roar.

Before long, all of the energy from before is put to use. From the Head's mouth comes an onslaught of bowling-ball like spheres. They speed, each slamming against neighboring trees with enough force to topple the wooden constructions. On occasions, many  of the bullets actually break through the tree barks simply because of how fast and hard they can go.

"It is simple, yes? The only difficult portion involves shape manipulation. You have to shape the spheres on the fly, and launch them on creation. Of course, the higher your skill, the more you can form at once. I want you to just practice forming a the head, and sending single spheres."* - Tue Sep 15 18:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives a gander to Paine through this sequence. It's clear that the young girl is in her zone, focusing hard to either master the effects of the Genjutsu Kai technique -- or just focusing mroe to unlock her ability.

In fact, he very much desired to see how badly the girl had progressed.

But for now, Katsune demanded his attention. He watches casually as the girl continue to struggle, forming golf-ball sized spheres, and send them propelling ahead. It's a sad endeavor to watch, as they hardly move with any urgency. Each one seemed to wobble upon formation, and of course seemed to be swaying even in flight.

Nevertheless, after several minutes. He looks ahead, eying as the girl as she returned. ". . . " Silence runs over the area, upon hearing the question. Had she done good? Hell no. Although, considering this was perhaps the most potent offensive technique she'd have up this point, it was a decent try. After all, B ranked techniques weren't easy to come by, nor learn. After some deliberation, his hand rises, and rests ontop of Katsune's head. 

She's stroking the girl's hair, as if she were a feline. ". . .Adequate, my pet. Nevertheless, in a few day's time. I will teach you the proper process to form mud. You've likely witnessed me do so myself on various occasions,"Zetsumo says with a drawl.  Again, those same, primal eyes fall and it's clear they're not looking at Katsune just for the sake of conversation. They're the eyes hunter hold when looking over the form of prey.* - Tue Sep 15 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) 's hand can simply extends, while being held together by his strings. The pet continues.

"I expected more enthusiasm. . ." Zetsumo says with a snide expression. This was growing to be one of his more favored activities.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) shifts his gaze to Paine briefly.

"I wish to evaluate your strength in a bit, Dissida. As for you. ." His sights shift, falling onto Suitengu.

"You've also learned Raiton. . .?"* - Tue Sep 15 21:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grabs.

He shunshins off, landing just south of the local plaza. His arms are folded and strings manage to break through the flesh on his body. "Come now. I dont think your little. . . kicking technique will be as effective as before. You'll have to come at me harder. As usual, expect me to rely on my Earth techniques to defend in the event that you get close enough -- although I doubt you will," the male states with a partial grin. He falls into a stance, eagerly awaiting to see the fruit of Paine's labor.* - Tue Sep 15 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
And so the battle had began.

"Huh. . . So you've gotten a bit faster. That means little, however. Your speed, up to this point, is still inadequate to truthfully be a taijutsu specialist. . " Quickly, as she;'s in her approach, Zetsumo takes a back step. It's swift, and it's clear by this point, the male's speed exceeds even that of Paine's own by a fair margin. Of course, Zetsumo has little clue that she's actually powering up, considering the Gate of Opening  possesses no tell-tell sign of usage, save for someone actually having the ability to sense or see chakra.

As he's moving away, a single seal is formed. The area -- still muddied from the previous training exercise -- takes form, creating a massive Dragon head. From it's maw, cannon ball-esque blasts comes rushing out, each aiming to target either Paine's legs or her stomach. And as usual. . . the full extent of Zetsumo's might isn't utilized. Right now, he's battling with half efficiency, as using too much would pose the risk of hospitalizing one of the best fighters Kenryoku had to offer.

Still, regardless of the strength being held back, each of the 'bullets' prove to be swift and difficult to avoid. Overall, only a dozen are fired, regrettably. "Come now. Show me more of your power. Certainly, you don't think your current speed or strength is enough? You have no real ninjutsu to rely on. So make your body an unstoppable weapon. Something that is to be feared."* - Tue Sep 15 23:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Impressive. - Tue Sep 15 23:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looked ahead dully as the girl utilizes swift kicks in order to subdue the mud bullets. In most scenarios? This outcome was far from a reality. Although with Zetsumo holding back to such a degree, it seemed that Paine was actually able to contend, sending the large bulk of those weapons off course.

"Hrm. . . Not bad--"

THe kicking never stopped though, and inbetween those kicks, she's closing in on the distance swiftly. Before long, she's upon his body and an additional 'Leaf Hurricane' is being produced. In no time at all, the strike is sailing. At the last second, Zetsumo displays his refined reflexes, and a right forearm shoots up, blocking the collision at the last second. Considering PAine's deceptive strength, the blow was enough to force his arm to gain soreness, but as everyone knew. . . .The fiend known as the 'God of War' was criminally resistant to pain.

In response, threads coil from his  rib cage, and aim to lash or slap harshly against the Taijutsu Specialist's body. Hit or miss, he's pushing off to parry the blow and subsequently sliding away. "Try this on for size. . .I'll use a bit more power!" Instinctively, his hands had pressed together and formed a large array of hand signs. On cue, chakra pours out, and kick starts a strong, large gale of wind. It pushes ahead, covering enough of a radius that well. . . Evasion was all but impossible -- assuming Paine wasn't secretly Kenshin in disguise.

That said, he purposes places enough force to ensure that spinning and forming a 'hurricane' as Dissida commonly did would be pointless.* - Tue Sep 15 23:49:07 2015

Boom, perfect hit.

"That gives me some breathing room. . . I won't get too excited. And so. . . I won't accidentally hurt this chick," Zetsum muttered to himself. It's clear he's very self conscious or aware of how bloodlusty he was growing -- the second she proceeded to run again, wire-like strings speed out, this time spawning right from his stomach. It seperates into four different gatherings. One aim to clash against Paine's torso, while the other three slash at the lower body, more specifically the ankles.

They're swiping with great intensity and hoping to trip the girl up.

Hit or miss, he's quickly following up. One handsign later, the mud on the floor again activates. A quick wave overcomest he area, and aims to slam against Paine's frame. If hit, she'd be carried back, further granting Zetsumo the advantage of long range. "Too slow. I can just keep up with these massive attacks and you don't be able to avoid."* - Wed Sep 16 00:24:57 2015

Once Paine had lifted herself into the air, Zetsumo is quick to follow the example.

His legs quickly propel from the ground, allowing his frame to speed upward. Admist the rising, his hands come together, formnig the 'Snake' and subsequently incasing his body completely in doton skin. If all went according to plan? The Dissida would find a rock man essentially tackling her mid-air. "You're faster. . . Certianly stronger. . .  But the question remains. Are you able to take a punch or hit?!" That's the factor he was testing today.

If not evaded, Paine unfortunately would be. . . Wait for it. . 

Rocked. Of course, even while having rock-like skin, the male still retained a great deal of flexibility. * - Wed Sep 16 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Boom! Boom!

The two kicks does wonders, and actually can break through the Domu! At once, the flesh is again exposed and bits of rocks falls onto the ground. Even as his body is being rocketed up, Zetsumo offers resistance. Strings spew from his torso once more, and aim to swat at Paine's wrists -- and if struck, coil around. He needed -some- form of defense.

"Domu. . . .Isn't cutting it. I might need to power up a bit more -- this girl is pushing me to my limits in terms of hand to hand combat," the zombie thought to himself. The stressed comment completely differed from his demeanor, though. On clear display, a clown-like grin is worn as a result of the mass of adrenaline now flowing. "You've gotten stronger! But you're still way too slow. . . No excuse for being slower than me, Paine!"* - Wed Sep 16 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) is taken for a twirl.

He grins, and admist the spinning, his hearts proceed to move. "---So this is the extent of your training, Paine?! Interesting. . . Interesting!" the warrior shouted as the rotation went on and on. They're both sailing down, and just before crashing. . . a change occurs!

Each the threads that lingered about those organs would link together, and eventually the springs are pushing out from the major appendages on the body. This goes further than just granting greater spiritual force. Nay. . . It bolstered bodily defenses as well.

With a thud, they eventually meet the ground, forcing dirt and debris to float upward, clouding the general area. 'Z-Zetsumo. . ' That brief comment is enough to alert the shinobi of Paine's location. Immediately, the strings from his body speed ahead, and aim to latch around each of her legs and arms -- hopefully binding if so. THe dust continued to settle, and oddly, the shinobi remained fine.

His flesh released 'crunching' noises, however, and bits of rocky residue were rolling on off. * - Wed Sep 16 02:09:04 2015

The threads simply re-adjust. They seek to grab ahold of Paine's body as she makes her movements. To assist in this endeavor, he simply applies his 'Hiding like a mole ' technique to help detect.

Considering that Paine's vision was likely hazy, it was unlikely that she'd be able to avoid. 

"Mmm. . ." Hummed the fiend, he was desiring an end to the bout, but had no intention on submitting. hopefully, not too much effort was going to be needed.* - Wed Sep 16 02:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

Today's spar had finally finished. He arises, and allows the buffs to recede. "Not bad. .. Paine. Your taijutsu is getting good, although you're still far too slow. Work on your speed before anything else, and you should grow to be al egitimate force."

His gaze shifts to Beth shortly after. "Beth. I'll be needing your assistance in a bit."* - Wed Sep 16 03:01:58 2015

And paranoia runs high.

Quickly, he grows just as protective, and threads are rushing from his frame. They lash out, dangerously slamming against the ground. 

"---If there is nothing to fear or hide. Then the jutsu is trivial. All precaution as things are going to pick up. . . relatively soon. . " The warrior said with a rather muffled tone as a result of the strings that now flowed from his mouth. His chakra is flaring and seems to steadily on a rise, along with the general potency of that same ethereal gathering.

His brow twitches.

Each of the strings in his person retract.

"And the 'secret' is out. . " Zetsumo says  sarcastically.Their status was all to clear. "Nonsense. You should stop thinking with your emotion.

Who would have thought that -he- of all people would join forces with the same village that condemns his kin. ..

Indeed, his eyes even trail over the Kagemane that sped over the ground, and actually was a legitimate detriment. ". . .So she managed to pass on her technique before dying. . .Good on you, Kitora."

The tone or volume is still criminally low, enough that perhaps only those right next to him would be enabled to hear. Still, Zetsumo doesn't act just yet. Although, just in case. . . five seals are completed, and he holds his hand on the last one.

Although, once Beth tried to make her get away, it's clear he  isn't going to just let the lass walk out. The previous build up of chakra is quickly dispersed. In it's steead, thick strings flush and block the path. Zetsumo gaze falls onto Beth. . . And he can tell, she was the cause of the sudden disturbance.

"You're not going anywhere."

A glance is given to the surrounding area. "Now then. Tell me what the fuck is going on here? What is with all the commotion? I trust. . . It isn't over something stupid or silly. As that will make me pretty upset. . . We don't have time to be acting like children admist a war. Any miscues, any lack of focus could be the difference between living or dying. You all should understand this. . ." He exhales, showing clear irritation at this all.

A hand motions for Beth to back up, and warns her of dire consequences should she seek to be insubordinate on this occasion. Value or nothing, Zetsumo had no need for someone that would just start unnecessary conflicts, and wouldn't listen to commands.* - Wed Sep 16 17:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore a bemused glance.

Then Katsune and friends set things straight. 

"I will speak on the issue. First and foremost -- Don't you ever. . . Ever. . .Lay a hand on my sister," he says, casting his glance onto Beth. "Is that clear? She is not a combatant and here for support. If I ever. . . Ever hear of anything against her again. THere will be dire consequences. She cannot fight you all off. . .But believe me, it is no issue for me to do so."

Once that's done, his gaze shifts back on over to Katsune. 

"You acted solely on presumption. I will admit, Zenaki is a fool for even allowing Beth to get close to her -- and should express caution. Based on how Zenaki herself has reported the situation. . .It does not seem that she is too grateful for your 'White Knight' act. . ." After a pause, he gathers additional thoughts, and grants his judgement.

"Since there no serious damage done. I -won't- beat you all to an inch of your life. However, Beth Katsune. . .If you all cannot co-exist while we're here. Simply don't interact. Likewise, Zenaki. Stop being a fool," He says, referencing his younger sister's amazing naivety. Seriously, it was out of this world. Having said that, he figures that the situation can at last dies, and removes the strings that had previously blocked Beth's path. 

A glance is given to Suitengu-- and is lifeless in expression. "So what if you can use Kagemane. . . You're still nothing." These are all thoughts, but it's clear just from the glance, that's exactly what was being thought.* - Wed Sep 16 17:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) looks ahead. He seemed captivated moreso by the Snake Lycan's ability to conjure snakes without the need of handsigns. In addition to this, Zetsumo remained legitimately curious -- could this young Uchiha even react? 

The snakes were swift for sure, yet Zetsumo found himself able to easily keep up with the speedy reptilians. "Evade. . .or counter. Should--" And the battle was already over. A look of disappointment is casted upon the two combatants. "Oi. . . Your apprentice here has a long way to go, Ushinawa.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) yawns.

He looks ahead, already telling that it was the same act done against Beth a while ago. Although, no actions are taken. Curious eyes look on to see if Hanabi had what it took to break free? 

"I guess those summons lack intelligence. They wouldn't try to break their summoner out?" Zetsumo speculates.

That said, he didn't find it too kosher for anyoen to take advantage. After a brisk walk, a hand presses against Hanabi's body, and chakra floods through, effectively breaking the genjutsu.

"I would prefer for you to work on what you know already. There is still time, but you need to at least have a smidget of proficiency with the skills I've taught already," Zetsumo replies. Although, it wouldn't be hard to teach her the skill once Katsune had actually done what was told -- the jutsu was simply D-ranked after all.

"In anycase. . . The snake girl. What skills exactly were you trying to pry from Hideki's mitts? I'm certain he simply has basic elemental techniques. . ."* - Wed Sep 16 19:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oh well. - Wed Sep 16 19:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: .. - Wed Sep 16 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrowed his gaze. Katsune had a good point, although when he referenced training what had been taught to her. . . Zetsumo had been speaking moreso on all the skills she had learned-- and yet to master. Running into battle without adequate control of one's technique would often get someone killed. It  was the outcome that he feared to be Katsune's fate simply because of the overwhelming laziness.

That trait wouldn't be allowed to exist for much longer.

"The jutsu is simple. It's amazing how you've yet learned it. . .Although, overall, the jutsu holds little offensive potency. Especially for the likes of you. To do so, you have to release doton chakra into the floor, and simply go about manipulating it state of manner. -- That's what Doton jutsu really is. Manipulating properties of earth. Be it weight, hardness, shape, or state of matter. On this occasion, you're going to be breaking the earth's atomic structure down, giving the solid earth a now muddy consistency. . ."

And he does this with ease. One handseal is all that the titan needs. Visibly, thick chakra rushes into the floor, and uproots the dirt above the grass. Instantly, that grainy dirt is transformed, and made to be mud. At first glance, it was a safe assumption to think this was an application of Suiton ninjutsu in conjunction with Doton -- But oddly enough, in the wonderful world of chakra, you could make the substance purely by controlling the earth. After stomping his foot, Zetsumo's mud is given life.

It speedily rushes ahead in the form a wave, and sought to engulf  Katsune. The strength, at his level at least, perhaps runs the risk of forcing her to skid backwards. Cruel? Maybe. "I haven't forgotten about the middle of finger. . ." the controlling leader thought. 

"A simple technique. The letter 'D' in rank. All you need to do is focus on what I've said, and once the mud is in place, you can send  it ahead in the form of a singular stream."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: See you guys later. - Wed Sep 16 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) turns.

His hands stay in that same formation, and just as Katsune is landing, his chakra flares. Expotentially, Zetsumo's strength is increased, and again, a wave of mud comes over. Now she had made this a challenge. "Just. . . Trying to ensure you know how the move is performed. . ." hummed the brute in a lazy fashion -- and this was far from the truth.

It remained to be seen, could she evade again?* - Wed Sep 16 19:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Do you want to spar? - Wed Sep 16 20:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Wow.. - Wed Sep 16 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: First of all, come over here and hugs me. - Wed Sep 16 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Can't believe I am seeing such a sexy species in-front of me. - Wed Sep 16 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) simpered.

The success greatly brought him pleasure, and that excitement only grows more prevalent as the girl expresses the anger. ". . .What have I told you about your mouth. . .Watch it -- Get to work on practicing that jutsu before I fall into a fit of rage." He damn near growls afterwards. At the end of the command, the muddy ground is again shift, bubbling as if it were a pot of water over a stove. Clearly, Zetsumo felt the need to continue tormenting the girl -- but sought to have her train first at the very least.

Assuming Katsune complies, he kneels while clearing his general area of mud to sit. As the teacher, he was going to keep an eye on her with that same, un-nerving gaze that he usually wore when dealing with the rambunctious teenager.* - Wed Sep 16 20:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay, let's do this spar then. - Wed Sep 16 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: And fine.. no tears or anything. - Wed Sep 16 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mhm.. - Wed Sep 16 20:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) kept watching with dull eyes as Katsune went around perform the simple elemental technique.

The ground itself proceeded to change, as the earth that hadn 't been effected by Zetsumo's might before was soon being controlled by the younger Earth Elementalist herself. Just as he had done moments prior, the earth's flooring shifted. What was once solid and brittle dirt was slowly being liquidified. Like hot magma, mud seeped from the ground, overwhelming the grass, and proceeds to bubble.

"Mmm. . . Good. Now keep the focus up, and impose your will on the body of mud you've formed. It is your property, and an extension of your consciousness. Will it to--" He tries to coach her, but the ambitious Kunoichi seems to be well on performing the jutsu her damn self. With a roar, the ground against shifts, and a flood of mud is being unleashed towards the wall. It flows elegantly and without restraint, crashing into the surface, and perhaps holding enough strength to cause a crack. 

Of course, given the basic nature of the jutsu, this was far frm the full potential the doton release could accomplish. As Katsune looked towards him? Zetsumo wore that same passive expression, as he knew praise would just inspire more laziness. ". . .Pitiful. It needs work, but at the very least, you no longer have an excuse. You have the knowledge and the equipment needed to perform all of your jutsus for practice on your own time. For now, however. . .You may cease in your training. . ."

A glancei is given downward as it seems Beth was also keeping busy. His body momentarily jolted in surprise as the kunoichi showed a competent degree of skill in the Suiton release.* - Wed Sep 16 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) narrows his eyes.

"Right. I'll see you in the morning then. . " He says cryptically. Indeed, she would likely be seeing his face the second she had awaken.* - Wed Sep 16 21:26:11 2015

He turns to Mariana. "You there. . .You're not a shinobi, yet it's clear that you know ninjutsu. Likewise. . .from what I've been told, you hail from Sunagakure. Curious, why didn't you jump on the bandwagon and join your village's pitiful attempt to bolster or aid Kumogakure and Kirigakure?" You can tell the last sentence itself made Zetsumo sick.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have been moving on by. . . He sees the strange situation with Hanabi apparently over the boy, forcing him strange fluid. But. . . THis is none of his business. Casually, Zetsumo continues off with Yumiko in tow to teach her the new technique.* - Wed Sep 16 23:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) stops a few paces away from the commotion.

"Right then. Are you prepared to learn? This will be a simple technique on chakra flow."* - Wed Sep 16 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So what form of wind is this? - Wed Sep 16 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I told you already. Chakra Flow, you're going to be taugh to make a sphere of wind in your hand. - Wed Sep 16 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: To improve your close ranged ability. - Wed Sep 16 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Ah I see, this will be great then. - Wed Sep 16 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I could use them on my kunai. - Wed Sep 16 23:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: ----Oh on my hand. - Wed Sep 16 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) he holds a hand out. 

"Right then. You know the common properties of performing Fuuton. As you'd know. . .It's simply taking your chakra and spreading it thin to become one with the air molecules around you. When you can do that, you'll be enabled to manipulate the element directly. . .Now, I'll show you precisely of how I intend to make the manipulation."

His hand begins to secrate some chakra out, and thus the wind currents are manipulated. They spin, while also being formed into miniture blades. All in all, the air currents are being pulled forward towards the center of his palm. The epic centre, where the attack can eventually be compressed. All of this seems to be a seamless endeavor, considering Zetsumo's great degree of skill as it pertained to elemental might or ability. Eventually, a small, palm-sized sphere is being held.

It's positioned right infront of Yumiko's face so that she can see what the technique looks like firsthand. "What I did was simple. I took strips of oxygen, and shaped it with my chakra into. . . dull-like blades. From here, all of the air currents are pulled in unison, and compacted into a sphere. You follow me so far?" The teacher finally shuts his trap to see if Yumiko had been paying attention.* - Thu Sep 17 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"Right then. . . And here is a firsthand example."

Abruptly, his palm thrusts forward, and collides with the center of the woman's chest. On impact, the condensed sphere of wind would be unleashed. Torrents of air currents blast into the area, and aim to shread against Yumiko. Of course, given his high degree of skill, Zetsumo is carefully. The attack certainly packs enough of a punch to send Yumiko skidding backwards. But ontop of this, the jutsu certain would slice her flesh partially, while also reducing the upper torso of her clothing to shreads. 

The aftershock even auses Zetsumo himself to step back, and place a hand to shield himself from the excessive wind. "Oi. . .Maybe I used too much force."* - Thu Sep 17 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) gives a glance to the skidding Yumiko.

"Now that you've seen it. I want you to try it yourself, considering the explanation I've granted. Feel free to use it even on me if you need to," he notes. The wind that was previously swirling in his hand comes to an abrupt end no doubt. Now it was on Yumiko to display her talent.* - Thu Sep 17 01:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) folded his arms and watched as the girl did her damned best to imitate. 

"Clever. Two hands work better than one. Keep at it until you have a high enough quantity of Fuuton to account for your entire hand. Once you got the quantity down, move to shaping the  oxygen, and compressing it towards the center of your hand," he explains, hoping that his voice would enable the Sarutobi to have a better time in performing the jutsu.* - Thu Sep 17 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
Given enough time, it seemed Yumiko's training had been fruitful.

Although, not as energetic or powerful as his own, the attack showed signs of being great. Rather than being a wide, spherical shape that took up the entirety of one's hand, Yumiko's looked moreso like a baby version of Zetsumo's Kaze Boru. It ccovered approximately fifty-percent of the girl's hand. Meanwhile, the ciculation remained sporadic or unhealthy.

"Mmm. . .Not bad, I suppose. Yet forming is one thing. Use it now, I'mm anxious to see the fruit of your labor. . ." he says in a demanding tone. * - Thu Sep 17 01:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) wore that same expressionless gaze.

His arms are folded. "Perhaps. I won't grant any promises. If you seek to please me, you must continue to strive for excellence, and continue to seperate yourself from the pack," He says in reference to the rest of the Kenryoku shinobi that served under him. If Yumiko truly sought to gain Zetsumo's favor, she would need to make herself irreplaceable.

Unfortunately, as it stood now, the Sarutobi was simply an expendable pawn. Maybe in the future this could change.* - Thu Sep 17 01:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, I understand. - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: And I will continue in aiming to do so. - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Excellent. You may take a recess or continue to practice the technique, I suppose. - Thu Sep 17 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I will continue to train this one ability after recess. - Thu Sep 17 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: My chakra is limited. - Thu Sep 17 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"I will return shortly."

He poofs to give a quick survey of the village.* - Thu Sep 17 01:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) poofs back after a few minutes. It seems the village was enduring a period of inactivity.

"Anyway. . .Tell me. Why do you serve not only myself, but Zenaki so faithfully? It isn't a complaint by any means. But I am curious to see what makes you tick, or how your mind works. Certainly, there must be a great reason to force you to have such devotion to myself and my kin." he says immediately upon poofing in.* - Thu Sep 17 01:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
How heart warming. She spoke in a tone that could melt someone's soul. Despite working with some of the most cutthroat rogues in the world today, somehow. . . Someway, Yumiko had retained her innocence. Even as a slave.

It was a shame, that the delicate tone had no effect whatsoever on Zetsumo.

He was a man without a soul. A man that stored or blocked off any bit of information that could leave him vulnerable. Even as Yumiko smile, he wore a placid expression, and his lips were strickened to the point where you would almost certainly assume he was ready to scowl. "I suppose that is a logical explanation. Well then, continue on. . . Tell me, then. WHen not being used as a 'doll' for Zenaki, nor being used for experimentation, what other things are there for you to do as a form of recreation? Certainly you haveg other things in your mind besides being a slave or minion."

By then, he formed a single seal, and sprout up a small pillar. As it comes to a stop, Zetsumo descends, planting his rear in the man-made, earthly construction to sit. His darkened eyes rested onto Yumiko, and he seemed quite adamant in finding out more information for whatever reason.* - Thu Sep 17 02:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) ||
"So as a form of fun. . .You run around. . . Give others flowers. Sounds repetitive, and easily exhausting. I can't fathom how you can find that fun. . " He still wears that lifeless glare as Yumiko's eyes meets his own. Even with her bubbly personality, Zetsumo doesn't budge an inch. It's clear he's long since given up on any positive emotions.

". . .Regardless, elaborate. What do you mean 'She gives me freedom'. . .?" That brief comment was something of interest.

"And I'm sure 'death' has. . ." Cue emotionless tone for that last comment. His eyes seem to hardly blank, and there's minimal breeding. For all intents and purposes, Zetsumo very much looked to be undead, a zombie even.* - Thu Sep 17 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you happen to have exploding water shockwave, Lord Zetsumo? - Thu Sep 17 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Negative. - Thu Sep 17 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah, I can teach it then. - Thu Sep 17 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Perhaps later. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can drop you a scroll. - Thu Sep 17 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I'd probably check to see if you're any good with it. - Thu Sep 17 02:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) rose a brow.

"Huh. . .You picked up a nifty skill. Where did you learn it?" Certainly, a jutsu of that calibar was worthy of having. But it was a wonder, when did this guy find time to learn such an impressive technique?* - Thu Sep 17 02:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I did say during interrogations that I had met Tethys outside of Amegakure in my training spot . . . Which was already pretty close to the village. He wanted to give me this jutsu . . . I figured I might as well and take advantage of that. Didn't change my answer to him though. - Thu Sep 17 02:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He did want me to leave . . . I refused. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Amusing. Indeed, however. This would be a potent skill to add to my own repetoire. I will accept you offering. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Tell me. Out of all your elements. Which is your worse? - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right now . . . Fire, I think. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I'd assume Earth considering how reluctant you were to accept my Earthen Corridor. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: -- Oh? - Thu Sep 17 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have better jutsu for earth. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . I don't have that many good jutsu for fire. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I see. Name off your Fire techniques. - Thu Sep 17 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Goukakyuu, Exploding Flame shot, Misty Flames Dance and soon Fire run. - Thu Sep 17 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm still looking to learn B ranks. - Thu Sep 17 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wouldn't mind learning some for either fire or lightning - Thu Sep 17 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods.

"I will see what I can do. In the meantime. . Practice your 'Fire Run' technique. Despite the rank, it holds uses. Mainly in manipulating the terrain. You'll one find yourself appreciative of the fact that you can limit your opponent's range of movement by scorching the area in fire."

Of course, Zetsumo was also wary of just handing out knowledge of all his B-ranked techniques. After all, what would be worse than having someone with as much knowledge and skill as Zetsumo going directly against him?* - Thu Sep 17 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Understood. - Thu Sep 17 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would rise from his rocky stool.

"I see. I will continue to converse with you at a later date. But for now, I must go rest. Perhaps Kilm will indulge you in conversation," Zetsumo suggests. Without another word, he turns and moves off into the distance.* - Thu Sep 17 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm. - Thu Sep 17 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Evening. - Thu Sep 17 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hello. - Thu Sep 17 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) appears in a plume of smoke. He looks around, gauging how many were actively loitering within the public square. 

Who would have thought sweating out a singular village was going to such a tedious task? "I wonder. . . How many forces were left to protect their own villages. None of the current kages seem to be very intelligent to me. . ." Zetsumo pondered to himself. Eventually, thoughts of war are placed aside.

Those contemplations instead are replaced with curiosity.

While -he- remained a stick in the mud that very rarely took time off for his own enjoyment, Zetsumo remained certain that the rest of his allies or underlings would take liberties to take advantage of the somewhat cozy village. ". . .Right then. How goes the day? I trust you all haven't just been lounging about." The comment seems to be geared towards both the Kenryoku, and those that seemed to remain allied with the Uchiha -- Ushinawa.

The former, that being the Kenryoku, likely knew what Zetsumo meant. He was always wondering if they had been refining their jutsus or other techniques, after all.  

Having said that, the gent moves about, and leans against the wall, ears wide open to hear responses.* - Thu Sep 17 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Felt lazy. - Thu Sep 17 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) cants his eyes over to Hideki. Immediately, his eyes flashback to just a few day's ago. The urge to smirk is sufficiently hard to resist. The memories of the strange, yet thick and creamy slime oozing from that girl's mouth while invading Hideki's own -- it sent chills down the Zombie's spine. But there were excited chills. Nevermind the fact that he found entertainment in the teen being manhandled. Nay, now Zetsumo was thoroughly curious to see what was to become of the Uchiha after the assault. "Will it just continue to give 'sea-sickness'?" His thoughts briefly trail further, taking note that Hideki would very likely seek out more dosage. It was probably going to be like a drug.

"Going to find that. . .'Snake Charmer' I'd assume,"Zetsumo says with a chortle. Of course, it was an offhanded comment, he hadn't even looked towards Hideki while stating it.

After getting lost in thought for a few seconds, the lad's gaze eventually fall onto the duo. If there were two words to describe Kilm and Katsune, it was simple. Lazy and unmotivated. His teeth clenches together, and frustration is boiling over.

"Laziness breeds death and weakness. -- And I believe I was speaking to you, Katsune. Open your damn mouth. . .! Before I open it for you," He declares, feeling that there was no longer any excuse for Katsune's laziness. She had been equipped with the techniques needed to prosper. Now the ball was no longer in Zetsumo's court, it was going to be up to the young kunoichi to determine whether she'd be worth a damn thing or not.  Of course, with the rage comes the usual flare of his chakra.

His skin can be seen convulsing as the strings in his body grew more lively, and felt the need to prepare for exit. It was as if someone had unleash a jar of rabid worms within his body. Or rather, it gave the appearance that Zetsumo possessed thousands of slender veins that were dancing along his body, just below the surface of his flesh.* - Thu Sep 17 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: It seems I have arrived during some sort of chastising. - Thu Sep 17 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) glanced ahead. "I see. Best of luck in that endeavor, I suppose. I'll be sure to keep an eye on the. . . developments," Zetsumo says, referencing Hideki's command. The glare does little to phase his demeanor. In fact, even while he could feel the Uchiha staring daggers at him, the mercenary leader found joy, rather than fear. It was endearing, to say the least, that the boy even attemmpted to instill fear within the most notorious 'criminal' in all the world.

He didn't care that Kilm had 'mastered' his skill. Mastering a technique went further than just using it for a few hourso n the day of learning it. You had to keep at it, practice using it in certain fashions and so forth.

"Cute. I don't think I buy it, though. You're going to get yourselves killed with the continued laziness. Katsune in particular, head down to the field before, and literally encase that entire place in mud in preparation for your jutsu ---" He turns to face Zenaki who had coincidentally walked in on the area.

"I'll be back to check it in a little. Zenaki, you and I are to have a word." Without waiting for a response, the shinobi begins to move ahead, expecting his younger sibling to follow just as commanded.* - Thu Sep 17 14:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Shin. I want you to continue working on your Katon release. I'll be showing you a new technique later. - Thu Sep 17 15:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) would have continued walking. Eventually, they were beyond the village's square, and moving towards the plaza.

Here? There were many different areas to indulge in. Be it a fighting arena, spa, restaurant, bar -- and the list goes on. "Right then. You've been elusive as usual -- is it because of the situation with Beth? I've dealt with it by dealing out a sufficient punishment. She shouldn't be an issue any longer. And I don't expect to see any more rising issues between you two. If there is? Tell me," he says charismatically.* - Thu Sep 17 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) perked a brow.

"Oh. Tell me more then -- and choose which activity you would like to do," he says, referencing the massive plaza they were in.

A hand flicks to the various buildings.* - Thu Sep 17 15:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) grinned.

"I see. Yes, well Beth was taught a lesson akin to that. She should know better than to ever violate anyone again. I suppose. . .We will say her punishment was . . .The same thing, except multiplied," Zetsumo states cryptically. A hand motions to Zenaki afterwards, gesturing for the girl to lead the way to the dinery. 

The entire situation with Beth -- he wanted to put an end to it. Hopefully, the fact that he had acknowledged and punished Beth ten times over would have been enough to end all the issues.

* - Thu Sep 17 15:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) nods. 

"Indeed. That's all that needs to be said on it."

He takes brisk strides, following closely behind Zenaki before they reach the restaurant. A seat is taken towards the west of the younger sibling, and before long, a waiter is being called on over. Before an order could be made, Zetsumo's gaze flicks on over to the medic -- who had been presumably falling behind. She no longer had sickness to blame, either.

"So tell me. Besides you being so naive as to continue going with Beth. What have you been doing in our time here? I'd like to think you've been hard at work with refining your medical ability. But from the looks of things, you've been lounging about," he says with a calmed tone of voice. It was a trope by now, with the rest of his underlings finding zero motivation and seeming to lack the drive to go stronger. Funny that this demotivation came admist a war.

Not to be a pessimist of anything. But Zetsumo was starting to think everyone -- save for him -- would end up dying if this was kept up.* - Thu Sep 17 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zetsumo(Meme01) brow twitched.

He ordered a whole turkey -- yes the whole damn thing. And a bottle of sake himself. "Thought you weren't a drinker. Regardless, you realize. . Yes. That your current progression is inadequate. Where are the poisons I tasked you with creating? Likewise. . . I had expected you to improve on the designs you've already had. You aren't sick anymore. So what is the excuse now?"

He takes the bottle that's quickly delivered and sips. The turkey itself is being torn limb from limb, and he's eating like a barbaric animal. After some moments of chomping away, his eyes drift over to gauge Zen's own reply. How would she justify this?* - Thu Sep 17 15:30:46 2015
