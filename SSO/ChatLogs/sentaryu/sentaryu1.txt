<br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) had been sitting around, silently talking to himself about the goings on in his life as of late. He would have sat there and had an entire conversation if he hadn't heard Tethys speak up to those in the immediate are. It was about time someone spoke on something other than their personal endeavors. Rahm had heard the magic word, "Mission", and he quickly turned to face Tethys with a sick smile. "I'm up for a....mission..kekeke"* - Tue Sep 01 00:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) follows behind Koeki, his eyes darting about with each person or object that came into his view. It was his first official assignment and he had no way to defend himself other than a crude form of hand-to-hand combat. Once they made their stop, Rahm set his sights on one of the strange ships off in the distance, spacing out a bit as he stared on.* - Tue Sep 01 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) was still spacing out a bit but snapped out of it as soon as he was addressed by his comrade. Nodding slowly, the boy then turned to Koeki with a smile. Judging by his facial expression, one would think he hadn't been listening to a word she'd said about being polite. 

"Gotcha, boss." he replied.* - Tue Sep 01 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) takes a few steps toward their newly acquired vessel and leaps toward it without a word. Landing with a thud, Rah then turned his attention back toward the pirate ship off in the distance. The young man then turned to the superior of his group with a resting facial expression "I don't think they'll take kindly to our arrival." he stated blandly.* - Tue Sep 01 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) just stood by silently after his last contribution to the situation, his eyes still locked on their opposition. Of course, Koeki went in with the good intent as she stated before but the response from the pirates would most likely be negative. Without a word, Rahm moved closer toward the edge of the ship, hopinhg he wouldn't have to do or say anything special.* - Tue Sep 01 01:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) chuckled lightly at the attempts to get their crew riled up and ready to fight. It was quite amusing that a bunch of pirates assumed they could speak in such a manner to them, at least in Rahm's eyes it was. Awaiting further instruction, the black and green-clad boy stood unmoving in his spot.* - Tue Sep 01 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) knew shit was about to get real on the ship and as such, he stood firmly and awaited the first strike from the opponent. The pirates would most likely attack head-on and go straight for the first person who'd even bothered to speak against them. Rahm would have preferred to have a sword or something other than his hands but his strength alone would have to suffice. His facial expression quickly shifted and his smile became a crazed look. It was time for the genin to prove his worth to his comrades by any means. 

The pirates made their move, quickly closing the distance between the two ships and went straight for Koeki as suspected. Rahm immediately leapt from his spot closest to the edge and moved to apprehend a slim, blonde pirate nearest to him. He couldn't have been much older than Rahm, a rookie at best, so it would likely be an easier battle. To his surprise, the young pirate revealed he'd had a small blade hidden in his sleeve and he quickly drew it to take a swing at the nearly-shirtless Rahm. With a quick back step, the genin dodged the incoming knife attack and then darted forth with both hands out. No man with a weapon would expect an unarmed fighter to take them head on but Rahm was not ordinary. Once in range, the boy quickly wrapped his hands around the pirate's neck and squeezed with all his might. The pirate would indeed struggle but his strength slowly escaped him as he was being strangled and brought down. Who the fuck let Rahm out of his cage?

Shortly after his disposal of the lesser pirate, Rahm turned to assist his comrades in their individual battles. He let out a maniacal cackle and sprung forth, ignoring the fact that most of the enemies would likely be armed. A wild punch here, a sloppy sweep there and shoulder charges that would make the best fighters cringe, Rahm jumped around like a flea between enemies. If it weren't for the fact the pirates were all damn near defeated, he would have needed to restrained with force by his comrades. It was as if he'd been kept from the world for so long that he'd lost all sense of humanity but this was just his instinct kicking in when it came to fights. When it was all said and done, Koeki and Mizumi brought him back to his senses before cleaning up and making their way back to Tethys with the report.* - Tue Sep 01 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) looks up from mumbling to himself and his ears perk up at the mention of a blade. Rahm had practiced with wooden weapons but had never been given a proper introduction to using real swords. Waiting for the moment to join in, his lips twisted into a smile one could only describe as crazed.* - Wed Sep 02 03:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) leaned over and looked at Violet, his head tilted slightly to the right.* - Wed Sep 02 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) turned to Tethys slowly and creepily. "But I WANT one! kekekeke."* - Wed Sep 02 03:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) looks down at Tethys' arm and watches as the more experienced shinobi unsealed a tanto for the boy's use. The genin's eyes widened at the sight of a tanto and he gladly accepted the gift. Reaching out to hurriedly grasp the weapon, Rahm seemed to drool a bit in the midst of the exchange. He gripped the handle of his new weapon before he would strap it to his side hastily. His facial expression grew more crazed for a moment but quickly changed to a smile. He chuckled to himself, now holding the one thing he'd been waiting for since he became a genin.* - Wed Sep 02 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) had been sitting admist the stone tiles just outside of the rather large mansion, speaking in a hushed tone to himself. To anyonen ot within five feet of him, it would just sound like quiet jibberish. Every few words spoken, Rahm would nod his head as if he was in agreement with his own statements. His low volume exchange with his inner demons would be interrupted as he looked up to see Tethys approaching at a regular pace. The boy's eyes lit up and he quickly leapt to his feet to greet his superior. With a sudden change of demeanor and a bow toward Tethys, Rahm smiled and spoke in a seemingly normal tone. 

"Sir, I looked everywhere for you before you had taken off. I was going to ask if I could undergo training, or t-trials to be able to use this better." he states as he reaches his right arm over his right shoulder to grip his sword's hilt. 

Unsheathing the weapon swiftly, Rahm's left eye twitched as he brought the sword down and held it by his side.* - Thu Sep 03 03:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) nods slowly, his arm bringing the weapon back up to it's resting place to sheathe it once more. His facial expression remained unchanged for the most part. Rahm then looked down at his feet for a moment and then back up at Tethys.

"A-alright. I should have guessed you wouldn't use such a small weapon for combat."* - Thu Sep 03 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) had grown restless, waiting for the day he would be taken in for his training with one of the few people he looked up to. It was quite the hassle for someone with a condition like his to even be in one spot for more than a few hours, let alone a few days. As Rahm sat around whispering obscenities to himself, the boy couldn't help but repeat the same few words in his head. "Sword", "Train", "Master". He'd repeat these words every so often, telling himself that he would be trained soon, he would just have to hold on a little longer. Of course, he had still been by himself and had yet to be trained in any fashion. Rahm sat unmoving for far too long, so he'd have to come to a decision soon. Either the boy was going to sit and wait around for something that seemed it would never happen or he would go off on his own and work on his technique himself. 

Slowly rising from his seated position, Rahm scanned his surroundings quickly and took note of the lack of people in his immediate area. It was now obvious to him what he must do. "Kekekekeke....Looks like I'm on my own." he thought to himself before heading for the outskirts of the village.* - Fri Sep 04 11:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) had noticed a rather large clearing just east of the Kage's mansion and decided that this would be his training ground. There were plenty of trees, rocks and other natural formations that he could use to aide him in his endeavor. Telling himself that he would succeed was one thing but actually doing it was an entirely different beast. His mental condition wouldn't allow him to take action as a normal person would, thus making it twice as hard for him to perform any action without an inner conflict. Rahm's lips stretched into a sickening, wide smile that would lead any onlookers to believe he had officially lost his mind. Of course, those who knew of him would know that he hadn't a regular mind to begin with. Setting his sights on a short, thin tree in the distance, Rahm cackled to himself before making his way over to it. One would have been under the impression that the tree was living due to the way Rahm approached the inanimate object.

Slowly and steadily, Rahm reach up with his right arm with an open hand. Once close enough, he gripped the hilt of his small but deadly weapon. With a tug upward, the boy unsheathed his weapon and brought it from his back to rest at his right side with the blade pointing forward. The wind blew soflty and Rahm's hair swayed about as he repared himself to make his first move. The boy quickly began, pushing off of his left foot and swinging vertically from low to high at one of the branches protruding from the right side of the tree. The tanto's blade sliced through the thin limb of the tree, severing it completely from the rest of the plant itself. With a ruffle and the soft thud, the disassembled branch hit the ground beneath where it once hung. Rahm's smile grew a bit wider as he watched the limb plummet. This was going to be fun.

Immediately after his first strike, the rookie shinobi brought his weapon down and prepped himself once more. Leaping a few feet into the air, Rahm flipped and twisted to the right, swinging his blade horizontally aiming to sever another of the trees limbs without much effort. It was a success, the sharpened edge of the weapon severing yet another branch from the tree's mass. As Rahm passed over the small tree, he then positioned himself to land just behind his target. Once behind the tree Rahm would aim for a thicker branch and bring his tanto across it to continue his assault of the massive plant. The tanto would slice part way into the tree limb but stop just a bit more than halfway through the branch. Rahm grew frustrated rather fast and he pulled his sword back, making a slicing motion against the remaining material. With the friction and shrpness of the blade against a thin piece of wood, the limb was then completely cut off. The larger limb then dropped to meet with the smaller one from before. Rahm's facial expression contorted into one of pure maniacal ecstasy.

The adrenaline in his body slowly started to pump, his mind drifting off into thoughts of actual combat with his blade. He envisioned himself surrounded by a group of fighters on about his level, but none of them able to stand up to his reaction time. As one of the men made their way toward him, Rahm would jump just above his head, performing a front flip while moving backward. In one swift motion, Rahm brought his blade from his back and swiped for the man's neck with all his might. Before landing, Rahm made sure that he flicked his blade to the side, the blood that now coated it's edge being thrown about. Landing softly, the boy then looked up to see another of the men coming his way. Rahm then dashed forward, the man he'd recently cut falling down with his head falling in the opposite direction. Just before Rahm could make his move, he snapped out of it and realized it was all in his head.

Rahm snapped back to the field of trees and looked before him. He found that the tree he'd been practicing on was now nearly reduced to a stump, most of the branches and upper portion now laying around the roots. He took deep, heavy breaths with the smile he'd always had still plastered on his face. Quickly, the boy sheathed his weapon and turned toward the Kage's mansion. It wasn't the best of training sessions but he was losing himself in the midst of it and needed to take a break before he succumbed to insanity in full. Beginning his slow walk, Rahm hadn't realized his body was covered in leaves and other debris from his tree chopping session but he wouldn't seem to care either.
* - Fri Sep 04 13:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) slowly strolled toward the Kage's mansion, his appearance still one of a gardener gone mad. Noticing that there was a decent gathering of his fellow shinobi up ahead, Rahm stopped dead in his tracks. Whispers filled his head and his inner demons began to make themselves present once more. They spoke obscenities and spoke against Rahm being around people for the moment. The boy reached up and palmed his head with both his hands, wanting the voices to just stop and leave him alone. He turned on his heels sharply and darted back the way he came but instead taking a left once he'd headed toward the field. The whispers grew louder and their statements became more about finding somewhere to hide. The statements quickly became demands and Rahm was now in conflict with himself once more. A part of him wanted to feel like he could fit in with the rest of the village but the voices in his head refused to believe there would ever be a bit of normalcy. His existence was one that few would understand and he knew somewhere deep down that he would eventually lose himself. 

Still plagued by the voices within, Rahm continued running, spotting nowhere he could hide for several minutes. It wasn't until he laid eyes upon an abandoned building that he thought he would be able to safely stop and rest. Making way for the closest window, Rahm dove forward with both his elbows pointed toward the thin glass. The glass shattered upon impact and Rahm then rolled forward as he hit the floor to soften his landing. Hoping that no one had been around to hear the commotion, the boy lifted himself up from the floor and made his way toward the furthest wall from him. Sitting himself in the corner, he balled up and began whispering to himself softly. 

"I won't let you take me. You can't do it. I am not crazy." he spoke to himself repeatedly, his eyes beginning to well up with tears.
* - Fri Sep 04 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) had been sitting quietly for as long as he'd been in the midst of the town square. It was quite a regular day, save for Tethys leaving out with the troops earlier. Rahm had been sitting around thinking of ways to perfect his craft and further his understanding of understanding of swords. It wasn't until he'd heard a commotion coming from the way of the gates. Looking up, the boy could clearly see what was left of Kirigakure's army marching up with the leader in pretty bad condition. As Tethys made his way to the square, his injuries were made much more apparent to everyone outside of the mansion. Rahm's eyes widened and his mind danced with thoughts of finding those who'd left his leader for dead. The boy hopped up and took a few steps forward, unsure of how he'd be of any assistance. 

"M-My Lord...Wh-who did this and why?!" he quizzed, his body shaking violently as he spoke.* - Mon Sep 07 00:36:28 2015

What Rahm hadn't anticipated was the giant Snake making it's way toward the two of them with no signs of stopping. Rahm wasn't the nimblest of shinobi but he knew he had to do something. Diving to his right, Rahm would hope to get far enough away from the impact site and get his bearings to actually prep for an attack of his own at some point. 

"Shit! That thing is huge! (That's what she said)" he thought to himself as he did his best to get the fuck out of the way.* - Wed Nov  4 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rahm(Sentaryu) is left by himself, now most likely the next target in line to become a plate of crispy bacon. Rahm followed along to assist his feelow Kirigakure shinobi but was left out to dry when the shit hit the fan. Now unsure of if he should even make a move, the boy just stood there, struggling to keep from losing his cool. The tug of his sanity slowly slipping away from him would make it pretty difficult  for Rahm to keep his composure. At this point, it was either take one for the team, try and flee with Violet, or try and convince the attackers to take him in with them. Rahm had very little time to decide and he wasn't going to just stand there and exist.* - Wed Nov  4 03:41:52 2015

Rahm had never dreamed someone this powerful would show up and assert such dominance over those he used to lok up to. Understanding now the decision he had to make, Rahm tilted his head took in a deep breath before shouting up to Ortho.

"Just who are you?! I've never in my life seen anything like this before!" he exclaimed with curiosity evident by his tone.* - Wed Nov  4 04:07:28 2015
