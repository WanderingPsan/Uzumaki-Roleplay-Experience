<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs- as she flourishes her hands to the side, and forms her Nodachi. She stares at Kinami calmly, as she lifts the weapon above her head..and adjusts her stance. She stares at the woman calmly- her posture relaxed, at ease.

"Well... I remember how much you can take... so I believe I don't have to hold back, on my end. Just try not to break me too quick, neh?" She suggests with a sigh- as her Nodachi gleams dark purple- and she tenses.

She begins to chant something as she stands there- and black spears begin to appear, flanking her in the air beside her. There's a lazy smile on her face- as six spears of blackness begin to float beside her- six to either side.

"Let's dance a while."* - Wed Dec  9 12:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as Kinami seems inclined to launch herself at her all out. It's problematic, she thinks to herself calmly. I can cope with this, she reafirms to herself calmly. She tenses- and as she stares at Kinami with a grin- she moves.

She has the same reaction as ever to her foes attack; choosing not to dodge, but to twist her body to role with the attack she can barely process happening.

The six spears launch- aimed to slow her foe down by aiming at the legs- criss crossing patterns meant to trip more than damage... but it's all for nothing, really.

Her blade moves in a blurring, flaming blur towards her foes shoulder- expanding massively as she brings it down. Her blow lands but seconds after Kinami's does- a massive downward stroke by a flaming sword....

And then Kinami's blow strikes her gut- and shatters several ribs. Her eyes widen at the searing pain- it reminds her of her father, of her childhood. Of Huevo Diablo... of a lot of things- before she's launched into the wall- and spurts blood from her lips.

She's unconscious within moments- even her body, even her insane love of bloodshed, unable to keep her in gear after a hit like that.

She's not dead- but if she's not taken to a hospital soon, she might be; several ribs are busted, and her head is lolling to the side after snapping against the wall the blow threw her into.* - Wed Dec  9 12:17:42 2015

She's barely conscious- as she stirs from the pain.. and she groans, grunting out.

"Fuck.. shit.. what.." She groans- clearly confused, and possibly mildly concussed. "Owww.."* - Wed Dec  9 12:33:04 2015

"Ah.... Chikyu, you head out. I'll wait here for Kiyoko.." She says softly, closing her eyes.. and passing out from the painkillers.* - Wed Dec  9 12:46:43 2015

"Yo."* - Wed Dec  9 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly, gently squeezing Chikyu back.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: If you get good at magic, maybe we can put you on as a magic act for a festivel. - Wed Dec  9 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) squints at Hiroshi- then quietly shakes her head and just.. sighs; clearly unamused. It seems the Kazekage has left- leaving the secretary on duty again. She stretches out thoughtfully- leaning back with her hands on her hips.

"....Yare yare daze.... No, Chikyu.... I- nevermind. Forget I said anything!" She says grumpily- reaching into her robe and pulling out a small book- grumbling as she begins to read from it.* - Wed Dec  9 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Nothin! Just- don't worry about what I said, a'right>? - Wed Dec  9 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *shurgs* Sure, whatever. - Wed Dec  9 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly pauses a short distance away from the others- and thinks for a moment- before shrugging.

"I'll be at the gates, on guard duty." She says simply- heading towards the gates calmly.* - Wed Dec  9 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Have fun Mitsu!~ - Wed Dec  9 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: See you, later. - Wed Dec  9 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs as she pulls a scroll out of her robe, and nods; accepting gate guarding duty as she leans against a wall, crossing her arms as she looks towards the gates and the normal guards with a low sigh and a faint smile.

"Yare Yare Daze, thsoe guys.."* - Wed Dec  9 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums peacefully as she stands there. Eventually, she decides to practice some handseals; forming a Kage Bunshin to watch her blindspots as she stands there- bored on the gate duty, smiling gently anyway.

"Mrm... not so bad, I s'pose.."* - Wed Dec  9 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly- as she sends her clone to climb up the side of the wall- then forms a second to climb up the other side of the wall; humming as the clones clamber up. It's not the most useful of techniques, to her; but it's good practice for her control, especially considering how hard it is for her to pull off.* - Wed Dec  9 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums, ast he two Bunshin lookout for some distance from atop the cliff faces; while she stands beside the normal soldiers- then slinks back a distance- cracking open a black tome from within her robe- and humming as she starts to read from it; a relaxed posture emanating from her.* - Wed Dec  9 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs as she finds herself drifting into deeper contemplation- if she's really the same person she was when she came into Sunagakure, intent on killing a few people on 'accident' in spars then leaving before they realized she was there.... if she's the same person she was when practicality made that impossible,a nd she chose to stick around a while..

If she's even as vicous as the woman who asked to take a life for the Kage- and she sighs as she does so...

"...Guess Pragmatism... hasn't left me very dark, mrm.."* - Wed Dec  9 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts, as she pushes herself off the wall, after a while- and dismisses her Bunshin before turning to head back into town.* - Wed Dec  9 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: !!! - Wed Dec  9 21:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: How are you? - Wed Dec  9 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) smiles gently and nods- wincing as her movement is slightly painful, still; her ribs mostly mended after a few months- but in places, still in pain.

"Mrm... glad to hear it. Just noticed you- figured I'd ask how you've been."* - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins lightly, tucking her hands into her robe as she shifts to walk up beside Paine- moving to follow her along.

"Shouldn't be too hard."* - Wed Dec  9 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly, then shrugs.

"Mrm... I'm fine with either way. A caravan is easier, because I don't know the way to Kiri myself- but if you do know, we can walk."* - Wed Dec  9 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: then u-umm...we will u-uhh...w-walk... - Wed Dec  9 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: A'right then. Lead the way. - Wed Dec  9 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly as she walks towards the edge of the Sunagakure border besides Paine- hands in her robes folds and a smile on her face. She walks carefully, so as not to place strain on her mostly-mended ribs before they are done healing...

As she cheerfully walks along beside Paine.

"Mrm.."* - Wed Dec  9 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- pausing her peacefull humming and smiling as she looks around- at the edge of the desert, now; the absolute edge. It's been a while of walking, and her ribs are feeling better by the day- each night of rest, she wakes feeling mroe mended now..

"So, Paine. You ever been to Kiri? It's the only village I haven't ever visited.."* - Wed Dec  9 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks calmly, shrugging at the question and smiling faintly. She's contemplative, for a moment- weighing what she's about to say; unaware that Paine did, in fact, used to be Kinami's sensei.

"Mrm... Kinami..? Ah... she broke a few of my ribs, yeah. Shit hurt, but... I'll be fine, in the long run. I've already lounged about in the hospital for a few months, and it's mostly healed up." She says cheerily. "Damn, but that was one hell of a punch on her part.."* - Wed Dec  9 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Guess she was really pissed over some shit that had happened earlier that day... I knew she was, too... - Wed Dec  9 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: But I really thought I could take what she could dish out, when it came to takin it out on me. - Wed Dec  9 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, well.. we all make mistakes. - Wed Dec  9 22:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as they walk through the trees- humming gently at the auburn and golden leaves that fall around them in cascading patterns- drifting lazily through the air in their eternal autum. She sighs at the gentle beauty of the natural world; and soaks it in with a certain special apreciation for the symbolism of those leaves falling- it's death, but death, as always, bringing new life.

That is what death does, after all; these leaves fall, and new plants grow in the soil. One life dies- and his soul nourishes his killer. It is natural and right.

"Mrm... a slug, huh..? Who keeps a slug as a pet, I wonder... Hrm? We're close? Greaty!"* - Wed Dec  9 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as she climbs out of the boat, pushing herself upright as she looks around, a lazy smile on her face.

"Who, Kirikagure? I'm sure they'll be fine, we're just here to check on the condition of our allies, right?" She says warmly, stretching out as they clamber on out of the boat.* - Wed Dec  9 23:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs wearily.

"Anyway. Got anything to say, or..?"* - Wed Dec  9 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Paine, c'mon. No one here wants to say anything.. we should just report that people are agressively secretive and head home. - Wed Dec  9 23:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as they head to Sunagakure- humming peacefully.

"Well, guess that's that.."* - Wed Dec  9 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm....were b-back... - Wed Dec  9 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs as she walks towards Koji.

"It's a damn shame, but.. Kirikagure is the least freindly village I ever visited. Not a soul there was willing to so much as talk at us- they just stared at us funny. The most we got out of one was a 'Nope' when we asked if he'd be alright tellin us how things are. Buildings, land- all seems fine. People? Straight dickish. I suggest annexation and invasion, it was all kids, no adults- someone should be takin care of em.."* - Wed Dec  9 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: A'right then... Well, if you do decide on a war- tell me, yeah? It might be fun... Mrm. See you around, then. - Wed Dec  9 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) waves and turns to walk off- chuckling faintly.

"See you around too, Paine."* - Wed Dec  9 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) says: If they don't wish to speak I wonder how we're going to seek diplomatic terms.. - Wed Dec  9 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums as she walks in- knocking on the locked door to the lab and humming. Her torso is still bandaged- but her broken ribs are by now, almost completely healed.

"Yo, Kiyoko. You in?" She inquires with a relaxed smile.* - Wed Dec  9 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles then nods, pushing the door open slowly. She steps inside, shutting it behind her as she turns to face Kiyoko with a relaxed smile.

"Yo, Kiyoko. Figured since my ribs are done fixing up, we might see about that operation we where gonna do a few months back, yeah?" She says with a relaxed smile as she walks in- and notices the glasses still in her hand.

She chuckles faintly at that. "Hrm? Eyesight trouble of your own..?"* - Wed Dec  9 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly smiles and nods, walking up to sit on a nearby table, stretching out and nodding calmly.

"Sure, that works. I have some texts to study anyway..." She says calmly- chuckling faintly. "So, what's up with this compound anyway?" She inquires calmly- as she reaches into her robe, and pulls out a small black tome- the same one she is usually seen reading in the square.

She leafs through it- her own notes on her meager personal knowledge of spells and summoning.

"Hrm.."* - Wed Dec  9 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly nods- listening attentively as she soaks in the other womans words- attempting to become smarter via osmosis, perhaps, without actually understanding a damn thing the other woman is saying for the most part- and with that in mind, she calmly listens to what the other woman has to say- sitting on the table off to the side. She is careful to heed the medics words- staying a good distance away as she calmly nods.

"I see. Interesting... I don't really understand any of this- but I trust you to do what you do right, so.... and besides- it sounds like you've accomodated for the risks well." She says warmly, as she sits back a distance from where the mixture is being prepared- curious.* - Thu Dec 10 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly- clearly amused by Kiyoko's faint flush and tone.

"Yeah, I remember... as for which eye to start on..? Well, how about we start with my left, yeah?" She suggests calmly- as she leans back against the table. "I lie down, like yesterday, now- right?" She says calmly- a willing test subject, calm and confident as ever as she lays back- setting her book aside as she looks up at Kiyoko with a lazy smile.

She lays back- calmly relaxing her body much as she can; utilizing the same basic principles as a normal meditive state to relax herself as she lays back- keeping her eyes open.

"I don't really know what you mean by dominant eye, but I'm left handed, so.. left eye. May as well."* - Thu Dec 10 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hisses audibly- clenching her teeth together. Tough skin and high pain tolerance is suprisingly meaningless to a faulty compound being dripped directly into her eye. On one hand- the dilation is immediate! On the other.. she is hissing in pain as her head slowly starts to feel a growing, pounding sensation- as the lgiht in the room becomes painful rapidly in response to the dilation.

"Gyah, ow- fuck!"* - Thu Dec 10 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts- as she lets Kiyoko tug her along, following the medic's guidance- as she begins to wash out her eyes; grumbling quietly as she quickly rinses the solution out of her eyes- before warily swaying back, and rubbing her pounding forehead.

"...Yeah. I'm not pussyin out cus it didn't go right at first. You did say you where learnin, after all... uhgg.."* - Thu Dec 10 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- then nods and heads home, yawning.* - Thu Dec 10 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks into the door- shades over her eyes as she walks in, stretching out calmly. She waves at Kiyoko- though her hair is messier than usual, her smile is as arrogantly relaxed as ever.

"Yo. Ready when you are." She says calmly- setting aside the sunglasses to reveal her still-dilated pupils as she shifts to lay back on the table- and achieve the stillness of before, grinning; figuring it'll be similar.

"And... yeesh. Get some rest, yeah? Don't worry so much; if you go too long without sleeping, it's liable to cause more mistakes and problems than it fixes, you know."* - Thu Dec 10 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Right, will do Doc. - Thu Dec 10 02:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) meanwhile, walks up to the door and knocks a few times.

It's been a day or so; and her eyes are hidden behind rather fine looking amber tinted shades.

"Mrm.."* - Thu Dec 10 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Hnnn...! - Thu Dec 10 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) turns from where she's waiting at the doorway, tilting her amber sunglasses down.

"Hrm? Sanoke, whats up? You need somethin?"* - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Bored. Got anything you need done? - Thu Dec 10 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) looks into her robe.

"Well.. I'm Koji's secretary, so. I could hand you a few missions. Screw it- here." She says- pulling.... two completely random scrolls. "These should keep you busy. I might be in the middle of treatment when you get done with em, but hey. Shouldn't take too long.. and you might finish before she gets to me." She says cheerfully.

"Heh. Let's dance whenever, Chikyu."* - Thu Dec 10 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs- running to meet Chikyu's charge with a youthful laugh and a broad grin. She flicks her own Nodachi out to the side, holding it two handed and low as she crouches- grinning as her close freind swings an overhead strike towards her with that huge hunk of steel... and nodding slowly...

As she throws herself to the side- sweeping her blade to meet the thicker weapon in the side- throwing it to the side with an attack aimed at the weapons side, almost- the nodachi's longer but thinner blade slamming into the side....

And then, as she steps forwards, grinding against it while pushing it to the side- sliding down the blade towards the hilt, intent on skipping away from the hilt before she hits the crossguard tos trike at Chikyu's arms!

"WAAAHHAAA!"* - Thu Dec 10 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Nice to see a good sword fight. - Thu Dec 10 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins as her attack is deflected, then throws herself back as Chikyu recovers the blade- a gleam in her eyes as she shifts her posture- before slamming her blade straight up- catching her freinds attack on the crossguard of the Nodachi- which cracks, briefly... but does not break....

As she then levers the blade forwards, and moves to stab it forwards at an angle towards Chikyu while remaining locked by the crossguard with her heavier weapon- a gleam in her eyes as she thrusts for the chest; bracing her feet against the sand.

"Hiyaa! Sneaky?~ Non, non, non! Just SKILLFULL!"* - Thu Dec 10 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) --- is mid fight --* - Thu Dec 10 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins wide- launching herself back as her thrust is evaded- and just in time as her foe steps to the side herself and flows into a series of thrusts. She finds herself stepping back- one at a time, ducking and weaving as she grins wide- her Nodachi shifting back and forth to push stabs to the side, and yet...

She doesn't seem to be counterattacking, yet- as her blade continues to shift to fluidly divert her flows strikes one after another- aiding her in dodging by pushing the blade one way as she moves the other.

"Hah! Not bad.. Mrm? Sanoke, huh....? A'right, the pay should.. hit you shortly!" She says- before shifting at the final thrust. She shifts her grip on her Nodachi.. shifting it to the side....

Then taking a thrust to the side- as it rends through her robe and cuts into her side as she swings to slash her blade into Chikyu's side.. a gleam in her eyes.

"I'll.. hrmph.. fill out the paperwork after my fight, yeah?"* - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- skidding back as her one attack narrowly lands. She pants lightly- eyes agleam as she stares at Chikyu, cracking her shoulders as she is left to make the initial attack. She grins at the other womans hanging back- letting her attack.

She breathes in- and out... and laughs softly.

"Let's try something /new/ Chikyu." She says lazily- as she stabs her blade into the ground before her- the sand parting around the twisted soulsteel... as she begins to chant. Her words are strange and twisted- and heavy with power. The darkness writhes around her- as her energy shapes and twists.

"Bose Lanze." She incants- finishing her incantation as spears of dark energy spiral into the air around her- six of them, for now. She gestures with one hand- the other resting on the pommel of her Nodachi..

And all six fire straight towards Chikyu; one aimed for each limb, and the rest for her torso!* - Thu Dec 10 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles, as her weak attack is deflected and endured. The spears are endured and parried by the blade. Each one shatters into physical shards of shadow- that then fade into wisps of blackness, curling around the weapon that deflected them. She grins as her foe charges- breaking past that shadow to launch at her.

She watches Chikyu as the woman attacks her- and she laughs wildly. She rips her sword from the ground two handed- throwing up a cloud of sand as she slams her blade upwards- pushing the horizontal sweep upwards as she laughs happily.

"Hah! This.. this is great!" She booms- as her blade cleaves up from the sand to meet her foes horizontal sweep- pushing it up towards her face as she leans back- avoiding the stroke via attacking it... and laughing heartily the entire time.

"JUST GREAT!"* - Thu Dec 10 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: ...... - Thu Dec 10 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins wide- as the blades clash again and again. She grimaces.... and then does something perhaps surpising. She let's the Nodachi fade entirely- and steps forwards. She snaps a hand forwards- as she reaches to grab the blade- pushing her hand into the blade's edge.

She grunts; as the blade digs into her her hand. Blood spills... and she grins- as she clutches the steel. She pushes it to the side- and then hammers forwards with her other hand for Chikyu's gut; even as she moves to twist her hand to push the mammoth blade away with all her strength- intending to unsteady Chikyu.

"Wasn't plannin on it!" She roars as she steps into it.* - Thu Dec 10 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts- swaying back at the kick she recieves in return; grinning as she sways backwards, blood dripping from a hand- the other curled up into a fist still. Her stomach hurts as well as she sways back, grunting as she does- and shifts her hands up to her shoulder- forming another Nodachi and tensing.

No- it's the same Nodachi.. but not damaged as it was before.

She grins as she stands there- weapon leaned on her shoulder as she sways backwards, grinning wide.

"...Hahh... This is great."* - Thu Dec 10 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: http://noiselesschatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/masterdisguise10.png - Thu Dec 10 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins. It's an attack she doesn't actually think she can just take- or parry- for that matter. She's unsure of it's actual force- but the theatrics linked to the stroke throw her of...

As she responds by leaping back as fast as she can; skidding to a halt as Chikyu's blow throws up sand. She chuckles, as she steadies herself- swaying a bit...

"..Ah.. it's getting late, and I'm tired.. how about we call it quits, for now?"* - Thu Dec 10 10:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums peacefully while walking out, away from the Arena. She stretches out and looks around, hands in her pockets.
