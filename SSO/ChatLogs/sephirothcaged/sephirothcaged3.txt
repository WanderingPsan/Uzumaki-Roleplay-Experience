<br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins wide as her blow is forced aside... but slightly. Her strength is immense, even without any specific strength training... a natural surplus of raw power that seems to stem from simple general physicality. 

His sheathe- his bokken- slams up into her chin... and she steps forwards. It hurts- it leaves her sore.. but it's nothing to the pain she's known before- to the pain from her other wounds... as she twists the blade in the air...

And as it is forced up by her foes stroke- she pulls it up higher...!

Then let's it expand above him- a gleam in her eyes as a tormented soul wails from within the blades steel- screaming as the blade expands to many times it's normal size- growing in every way as she holds it there for a second- a spectral figure grasping the blade and pulling it down towards Menma....!

As it falls with sudden and monstrous force due to the momentum behind the blow caused by weight.

"Checkmate."* - Mon Dec  7 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods slowly- a lax smile on her lips as her blade rests against the sandy floor- having shaken the ground for that brief attack. As he yeilds... she nods... and straightens her posture- as the blade fades into shadows and a dark mist- that soon too fades away.

"Ah... fair enough. A good match, neh?" She says with a lazy smile- stretching out as she does- grinning broadly as she moves to pick up and sheathe her more normal Katana.

"Ah.. but that was fun."* - Mon Dec  7 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Anyway.. I guess you and that other man... - Mon Dec  7 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Are all the swordsmen in Kumo..? Well... how about you keep your word about the bet we made by tossing me a scroll for that Raiton version of chakra flow, and I'll be on my way- neh? - Mon Dec  7 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh..? - Mon Dec  7 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: If you'd died from that kind of attack, I'd have been very dissapointed! - Mon Dec  7 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I mean- I certainly wasn't aiming to kill, after all! Why- the last time I struck someone with that.. - Mon Dec  7 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: They where barely fazed at all! - Mon Dec  7 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs heartily as she leans agaisnt the wall- arms crossed.

"Ah.. Yeah, I've fought people who could endure that kind of stroke without issue. I don't really think of what I did as trying to kill you, mrm."* - Mon Dec  7 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I'm a very fragile person. *nod*, I declare that a tie. - Mon Dec  7 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Pussy.. but, fine. I don't much care about the bet anyway- I had fun, heh. - Mon Dec  7 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and shrugs, tucking her hands into her pockets and moving to head away- yawning.

"See you another time, maybe." She states lazily as she heads for a Caravan..* - Mon Dec  7 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums as she walks down a street- hands in her pockets and a lazy smile on her face as she does. It's her second time in Konoha ever, but so far she likes it more than last time- the first it was just a pit stop on her way elsewhere, after all. She lazily smiles as she looks around- and pauses as she comes to a gathering of people- crooking an eyebrow up.

"Hrm..?"* - Mon Dec  7 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) looks around- having approached the scene- eyes lazily roving from person to person, as at first she seems to be being ignored- and finds this amusing. She hums gently as she looks on- then turns her head towards the discussion that seems to be going on. 

She seems deeply.. relaxed, at ease... but that smile is almost actively malevolent. She's luxuriating in her current freedom as best she can- and she loves it. She had her wounds patched up and bandaged over the few days traveling here from Kumo...

But that means her torso is still wrapped with bandages, along with one of her hands- though the wounds beneath have already begun to close.

"Mrm... And what seems to be goin on here..?~"* - Mon Dec  7 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: .. Uh.. Some random guy.  - Mon Dec  7 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: That I talked with earlier. - Mon Dec  7 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly at that- as she shrugs and nods.

"Dull and boring, huh..? What a bummer.." She murmurs- as her senses pass over the others; her meager sensory ability flickering idly by as she checks for anything she might recognize from experience- her own unusual chakra not hidden in any way..* - Tue Dec  8 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) looks over the group and nods slowly, sighing idly as she feels nothing of note- except.. .that nothingness is notable in and of itself. Her own chakra is bizzare- dark and twisted.. though her reserves are far from impressive.

"No good times to be had? Ah, I'm sure that's an exageratiion!" She says with a lopsided, lazy grin as she looks over those present, sighing idly.

"Mrm.... I mean, there has to be someone worth fighting 'round here... or something worth doing.."* - Tue Dec  8 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: You're a realy good fighter, huh? - Tue Dec  8 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Well, I'd like to think so.. - Tue Dec  8 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ...Oooh. - Tue Dec  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Kinky. - Tue Dec  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) cracks her shoulders and chuckles at the other womans tone with Claud- faintly amused by the entire scenario, hands in her pockets. She observes the two's relationship calmly- and smiles plainly as she looks back to Asteroth and nods...

"Ah, I see... Natural pools of water, neh? Sounds nice- I rarely get a chance to enjoy anything like that back home.. Mrm. I don't suppose you two would mind some company, one of these days, eh?" She inquires idly, hands in her pockets and a grin on her lips as her vile mana pulses quietly.

"I'm on Vacation after all- may as well relax at least a little!"* - Tue Dec  8 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and shrugs at that question. She leans into the fence and thinks for a moment- smiling lazily.

"Ah, Sunagakure." She answers calmly. "Out in the hot desert, you know? Not many chances to relax in a water spring out where I come from!" She says with a bright smile- violet eyes settling on the blonde woman... before she chuckles softly.

"Mrm... And as for considering it-  whatever you decide, I s'pose.~" She says with a half smile as she leans there- thinking quietly and shrugging. She stares at the other woman with curious eyes- taking her in steadily.* - Tue Dec  8 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: Sunagakure huh... - Tue Dec  8 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: I wonder how everybody is right now... - Tue Dec  8 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And no need to be sorry. . Simply found it weird that you were silently observing for so long. <@Alex> - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: I'm not very vocal, I suppose... - Tue Dec  8 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly, tucking her hands into her pockets and nodding.

"The atmosphere is cloying as all hell, yeah." She responds calmly towards Asteroth. "Just.. suffocatingly restrictive, in some ways..." She muses idly, tilting her head back and chuckling.

"Plus? The sand..? Get's everywhere."* - Tue Dec  8 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) thinks: I really wanna head back just to check up on everyone.  - Tue Dec  8 00:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: I want to kill someone today.  - Tue Dec  8 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and shrugs- speaking placidly.

"Well, there are other ways to find my amusements, mhrm..~"* - Tue Dec  8 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: S-So.... - Tue Dec  8 00:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To the hospital? If Hanae will have you. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ...Anyway. You also said the resturants aren't too bad, neh? How about I go buy us some dinner and your favorite one, and we talk..? You seem.. interesting; and it seems theo thers here have their own plans to attend to. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you leave, be sure to alert me. - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Besides, I'd rather my trip here not have been a total waste of time. I've got a few more weeks before I have to go home, and I'd rather not waste them. - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Oh I'm sure she can help me. And I need to help Yoshi out aswell.  - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: So her name is Asteroth? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: What's with this kid. .? - Tue Dec  8 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) crooks an eyebrow at the mans approach from behind her- and sighs. She's been passively focusing on her sensory abilities for some time now- and she almsot /feels/ the man slide up behind her.

She hears him whisper- and says in the same, cheerful, polite tone as ever.

"Get out from behind me before I break something, mrmkay?" She says- clearly adressing Hanae- before turning her attention back to Asteroth.

"Mrm, so. Lead the way?"* - Tue Dec  8 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: O-Oh. Can I go with....? - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) feels that dark energy- and sighs almost pleasantly. It's been a long time since she encountered another... she shakes her head and chuckles.

"I've never met the man before. I don't take kindly to having people in my blindspots."* - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hanae~ Come come~  - Tue Dec  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) rolls her eyes at Alex and sighs at the boy trying to follow them.

"That might not be your best idea, kid- but if you really want to, I won't be the one to stop you.. Heh." She says lazily- as she turns to walk towards a resturant she saw on her way in here- idly inquiring.

"Hey, you a fan of this place near the middle of town I saw a while back? Nice long tables- seemed like a proper resturant?" She inquires of Asteroth, as she turns tos tart walking down the road- humming cheerily as she keeps her senses expanded in quiet paranoia.* - Tue Dec  8 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kid.... - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) squints at Alex.* - Tue Dec  8 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Hnng, s-sorry... - Tue Dec  8 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs softly as she leans into the seat- looking on calmly, hands at her side as she waves over a waiter.

"Yare yare daze.. kid, you really freindless..? I mean, c'mon. There have got to be better things you could be doing.."* - Tue Dec  8 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she leans back and nods slowly.

"Ohoho..? I see, I see.." She murmurs- vaugely amused, but nodding along- as a waiter comes up to patiently await their orders.

"Well, Asteroth.. it's a pleasure meeting you."* - Tue Dec  8 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) thinks: I really don't have any friends. Only my bats..... - Tue Dec  8 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- as the waiter approaches calmly and continues to wait patiently.

"Ah- Mitsunari Akimora, at your service, m'dear." She says in her usual calm, not-quite-snide tone- before looking to the waiter.

"Give me something... that Konoha serves, that other villages don't, if there is any such thing. If not- steak and pasta." She demands calmly of the waiter- smoothly self confident and relaxed, at ease completely despite her surroundings.* - Tue Dec  8 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she leans back- smiling almsot kindly at the mute youngling.

"Yo, relax. It's not like you're in a room with a pair of evil witches waiting to sacrifice you to Satan, or somethin- just two nice older women!" She says- a hidden joke in there, certainly, as she laughs cheerfuly afterwards- clearly amused by the absurdity of her words.

She turns towards Asteroth and nods- speaking in a lazy tone. "Yeah, it was a long trip away from 'home', but I'm glad I took it. So many more opportunities for a woman away from 'home'... though, I regret- I haven't met anyone else of my 'ilk' for some time, since I left." She admits mournfully- smiling warmly backa t Asteroth as she locks eyes with her- not at all unnerved..!* - Tue Dec  8 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and nods towards Asteroth as the waiter walks of with their orders- then looks over at the woman and crooks an eyebrow.

"Big breasted Bim- Oh! Rias! That whore who was fucking Hassan back in Suna!" She says brightly, nodding. "I had heard she was returning back to Konoha after the man she was whoring herself to for tutelage died, but I was unaware that the village actually promoted a whore like that to a Kage position! I am /amazed/!" She says- laughing heartily and shaking her head.

"And to think, I asked permission to kill her for going rogue, a while back.. ah, if she's a Kage now, I guess that's not happening.."* - Tue Dec  8 02:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles, apparently amused by... this entire scenario.

"Mrm... Man.... what a crazy place.." She murmurs as she leans back in her seat- waiting for the food.

"What's wrong kid, cat got your tongue?"* - Tue Dec  8 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and shrugs.

"Probably. I mean, I did just admit that Rias is and has always been a filthy, dirty whore."* - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at the display- making a faint smile as she looks on- not looking into the box as she stretches out.* - Tue Dec  8 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: My.. - Tue Dec  8 02:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- as if on queu, two large plates are carried forwards by a waiter; each relatively identical. Two steaks; seasoned and drizzled in sauces, steaming hot fresh of the cooker.... and to the sides of the slabs of meat, pasta in a foreign style; cheese sauce and tomato sauce drizzled throughout with the flat, long noodles that are mixed in. She hums cheerily as she looks over and sighs happily as a plate is set down before her- and another before Asteroth.

She sighs happily as she reaches for a fork and a knife, grinning as she starts to rend the meat with the knife vicously- then take delicate little bites.* - Tue Dec  8 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly- a relaxed smile on her face as she starts to feast as well; enjoying the fine food before her. She's already agreed to pick up the bill- and doesn't mind regardless. Money means little to the wandering warrior, after all.

She looks up and nods agreement though, and smiles kindly at Alex.

"Yeah! You said you where here cus you wanted to hang out- but you've just stood in that corner, rigid as a board, acting terrifeid! Relax and come over- or get outa here!" She says cheerfully- before returning to her food.

"And I agree wholeheartedly, Asteroth- a private word would be grand."* - Tue Dec  8 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: ....Was this kid raised by wolves, or something? - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: No idea.. - Tue Dec  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ...'Yet'. - Tue Dec  8 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kid... I'd do it. - Tue Dec  8 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm.. - Tue Dec  8 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) just calmly eats her meal, as she looks out the corner of the eye to see what happens.* - Tue Dec  8 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at this as she eats from her own meal, crooking an eyebrow. Her own steak has dissapeared in mere moments, as she turns to the foreign looking pasta and eats hungrily.* - Tue Dec  8 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and nods.

"A'right then... sure." She says calmly as she pushes herself up to stand- leaving her meal msotly finished as she turns to head for the door- humming calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly leads the way out into the woods away from others- humming calmly as she walks out to stand near Asteroth- a lazy smile on her lips.

"So.... you want to talk..?~ Let's talk. Where to start..?"* - Tue Dec  8 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and speaks calmly.

"I fled Huevo a long, long time ago, darling. I decided a world where a woman can't ascend to the top? That's not a world I want to live in... so I left, when I was young. I can assure you- I didn't come here looking for a fellow Necromancer... though it is interesting to have found one. You a run away too, or..?" She inquires calmly, hands at her sides- empty and open palmed...

But calm and ready. She's tensed- waiting for the other to make a move... or maybe jsut keep talking. She's not sure.* - Tue Dec  8 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and speaks plainly.

"Bryson? He's a damn idiot- and he's yet to gather the courage to face me. I've destroyed his credibility for the most part, but the man lives because he's too much a coward to face me no matter what I say to him." She says in a lazy drawl- chuckling.

"Though.. I'll admit. There's a reason I pushed to gain a vacation; having to follow that places laws all the time... I can stand it, yes- but it's stifling. I haven't taken a life in... too long.." She murmurs- sighing faintly and chuckling.

"Mrm.... I came out here for this trip to take a trip on the wild side, get away from the law for a while.. relax... and what do I find, but a fellow practioner of the dark arts, who is also seperate from the Huevo... Mrm- I suppose this is fortuitous, in a way..." She muses- chuckling.

"Still- I will admit. I am looking forward to convincing that priest to attack me, so I can slay him without worry of retribution."* - Tue Dec  8 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles at the question- and shrugs.

"Well- you show me yours, and I'll show you mine.. as for how it's fortuitous?" She smiles faintly. "I haven't had any kind of teacher in /years/.... and I might know a few things you don't."

She says in a freindly tone- before chuckling idly as she smiles faintly at the woman... as she speaks calmly.

"As for if I'm powerfull..? Well.. my command of the more escoteric arts might be limited.. however.." She smiles faintly- as she holds out her hand- and darkness gathers. Her mana surges- and her soul takes physical form....

Into a blade, long and twisted, from the Abyss; formed of her soul into steel. 

"That's one of the things I can do.... how about you?" She inquires calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- then grins at the other womans attack. The wave of energy pushes her slightly back- and little more.

"Mrm....I see. I've dabbled in summoning lately as well- though with little instruction... I've so far only plumbed the lower levels of that art.." She admits softly- chuckling faintly as she is indeed forced back by the wave of dark energies. She shudders faintly- enjoying the show, the display... the fascinating power of such a technique.

She straightens out and nods slowly- smiling faintly.

"I'm impressed, regardless; my own grasp of the arts is... admitably, lacking- on the other hand, my swordplay is... quite good. More to the point- I know the methods of a deathbringer used to devour the souls of those I slay with my blades.... I'm not sure if I can teach you that- or if you're interested, honestly." She admits calmly- smiling placidly.

"So... what kind of a deal shall be struck, then. No one gives anything for nothing- but.. I'm not so prideful as to not admit. That brief chanting time, among other things.. you're likely more experienced than I am- and what is more.. I need a teacher, and you know things I don't. What do you want, mrm?" She inquires flatly- speaking concisely and calmly, as she steps forwards in the aftermath of the purple blast- sighing contently as she holds her blade steady in her hand.* - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) strokes her chin- amused that flattery seems to have worked so well. She strokes her chin- and answers calmly in response to the womans boastful words- as she sits down across from her- laying her blade on her lap as she sits cross legged.

"Define servitude, in this case. I fully intend to return home, after my time is up- I intend to avoid being declared a rogue.... but I'm willing to make agreements, and to take orders... within reasonable limits. I'm willing to call another my superior, my better- but... I'm not willing to go rogue from my village when I know full well? I'd die within the month I did it. So- here's what I'd suggest. I agree to your service... and when you need me; you can call on me. When you have need of a warrior, or want someone dead- you will call for me. When you do not need me- I will continue on as I have for the last few years; serving Sunagakure as a 'Shinobi', and hunting for souls. Does this seem agreeable?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods slowly- staring at the woman calmly. She scratches her chin- and thinks for a moment.

"I gather mine from the hells, from the realm of Satan. I trust that won't be a problem in our relationship...." She says calmly- before smiling faintly.

She watches the womans displays calmly; eyes flickering from black attack to bleak blast.

"So. What way of having a hold over me do you propose...? And... how do I know I can trust you to hold your end of this arrangement, mrm?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Naturally I'll be teaching you other useful spells. Although, the nifty ones are harder to learn. - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Of course. Nothing worth using, is easy. - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Still- my questions remain. How do you intend to have... a hold, over me? - Tue Dec  8 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's what I'm thinking. - Tue Dec  8 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stares calmly at Asteroth, thinking calmly.

"Well, propose a method- and I will make my own reply." She says calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm.. - Tue Dec  8 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I don't have much I value to hold hostage, so.. - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I can't exactly put my curse onto you. - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? A curse..? - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. - Tue Dec  8 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: What manner of curse is this? Or... no, you said it's not possible here, so. - Tue Dec  8 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Irrelevant, I suppose? - Tue Dec  8 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It's possible. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But not appealing. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'd essentially be under my spell. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm.. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mind Control? - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mind Control is... not acceptable, yse. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Alright. I'll teach you, I suppose. But you work for me. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Before we begin, tell me. - Tue Dec  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Any dreams or actual goals in mind? - Tue Dec  8 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at the question- and speaks softly.

"...When I was little, I didn't want to be alone anymore... but nowadays, that seems like a small dream.." She begins softly- leaning back.

"Now..? Well... I enjoy battle, let me begin there. I enjoy the rush of conflict.. the joy, of taking a life... and I enjoy living. I like most of the days of my life I spend- and so... I came to a decision, a while back." She grins fiercely- as she turns to look Asteroth in the eyes.

"I want to live forever- and to grow powerful enough... to fear nothing. If Huevo comes for me one day, to drag me back? I want to be able to slaughter every man they send, and toy with their souls... I guess, in a word..? I want to become... the most powerful being I can."* - Tue Dec  8 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That's not the only thing I want- but it's the easiest summation. - Tue Dec  8 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I see. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . I'll give you a proposition, i suppose. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I will help yougain strength. But you're too join me. I too tire of the Huevo.. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And wish to form my own network -- filled with our kind. - Tue Dec  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'll be the first of many recruited within my ranks. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Potentially even a lieutenant -- given that I don't know your true strength. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: In exchange, I'll aid you gain strength. Understood? But I expect my word to be taken seriously.. - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly.

"I see. So you wish to form a counter-organization of Necromancers, seperate from Huevo..? I agree- this sounds... very good, to me." She says- an almost predatory smile spreading on her face as she pushes herself up tos tand, and lets her blade fade to shadow.

"Very well. And what sign of my loyalty do you want to prove I am serious, then..?"* - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Alright.  - Tue Dec  8 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly, rising up to stand.

"I'll grab the corpse... soon as I get a good chance." She states calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. Pleasure fchatting with you. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: And a pleasure meeting you... Hopefully.. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: This can be the begining of a long, profitable freindship. - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'll see you around, mrm? - Tue Dec  8 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly, as she turns to walk away- her intent simple.* - Tue Dec  8 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly hums- leaning against a wall, and unfurling a scroll to read as she awaitys a response from her Kage- reading it calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why are you here? - Tue Dec  8 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) pauses as she is adressed almost as soon as she arrives from the Caravan- and turns to smile, waving cheerily.

"Still on vacation. Heard some shit was goin down- not sure what. Figured I'd come and wish the guy I sparred earlier today well for the future, pay my respects at the graveyard, then head home. I made this place my first stop on my trip- may as well make it my last, too, before I finish my trip home!" She says cheerily, one hand in her pocket, the other wavign cheerfuly at Eiyu.

"Why?"* - Tue Dec  8 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh? - Tue Dec  8 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'm just passing through, relax.... what's with the issue? We may not be quite so closely linked after this...  - Tue Dec  8 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: BUt I was under the illusion that we where still allies, right? - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That's my intention. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, eiyu. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I don't want any outside company. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: You parting from suna? - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: No need for hostility, then.... - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We're attempting to reclam our independence, yes. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'll just be passing through, like I said. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yeah well good luck with that. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Or you can go the way you came. - Tue Dec  8 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stares at Eiyu- and holds up her hands, sighing.

"You know, you're sure not talking like someone who want's to continue to be freinds... Yeesh, I was here earlier and no one had any issues- a few days later, told to leave soon as I show my face?" She shakes her head and sighs- before turning to walk of with a nod.

"Fine, fine.."* - Tue Dec  8 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Seems I'll have to use my ultimate weapon.... - Tue Dec  8 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Yare Yare Daze.. I'm not even here on work.. - Tue Dec  8 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly heads away from the Raikage- and once she is out of sight... heads to look for a local graveyard. She looks around and sighs- smiling faintly. She looks for a grave labeled Maloth..

She hefts out a shovel she bought at a local store- and hums calmly as she looks for the grave- a sack over her other shoulder. She idly wonders about avoiding the guards on her way out- then dismisses it. She hums calmly- as she finds the grave labeled Maloth- and begins to dig into it.

It's a few hours of digging to unearth the corpse; and then she lifts it out of the grave; before sliding it into the sack. She shrugs and turns to walk away calmly- humming warmly as she moves to head out- the decaying corpse reeking in the sack.* - Tue Dec  8 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks in with a Sack on her shoulder. Looks around. See's many people. Walks out.

"....Another time."* - Tue Dec  8 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) waves at Asteroth with one hand- the other holding a sack over her shoulder.. then heads out.* - Tue Dec  8 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Come. - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: A'right. - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly shifts- holding the sack out casually.

"Was a bittt more hassle than I thought. Soon as the Raikage spotted me, he told me to leave." She says calmly- before chuckling and nodding.

"I'm pretty strong." She states calmly- as she hefts the sack back over her shoulders and moves to follow Asteroth.* - Tue Dec  8 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs, tossing the corpse down.

"Because he knew I'm from Suna- and apparently, Kumo has some issues with Suna stirring up. And I didn't get him to let me stay! I snuck behind his back, defiled his graveyard, then snuck out!" * - Tue Dec  8 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. . Hopefully that doesn't incite rage. In anycase, I will give you this basic spell to work on your own. I'll call you later for more hands on training I suppose. - Tue Dec  8 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: A deal is a deal. - Tue Dec  8 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly, and nod's calmly; accepting the scroll and tucking it into her robe, smiling faintly.

"A deal is a deal... and now- I should return to Sunagakure, before someone get's worried. I got permission to extend my vacation a little, to scout out Kumo- but I'd best get back soon, or the Kage'll have my ass.." She murmurs- waving goodbye and chuckling.

"Send me a bird when you need me, I s'pose. This was a fine exchange."* - Tue Dec  8 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Farewell, for now. - Tue Dec  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly as she walks back towards Suna- waving at Trill as she heads past.

"Yo. Heading back in- done with my vacation." She says with a lazy smile.* - Tue Dec  8 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I'm so happy for you! - Tue Dec  8 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh t-thanks.. - Tue Dec  8 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly stretches as she walks into the village- a lazy smile on her face. She looks around and sighs, as she turns to squint at Momura- then Chikyu. Then the others! She smiles lazily as she turns to approach them, waving.

"Yo, how goes it?"* - Tue Dec  8 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hi mitsunara.. - Tue Dec  8 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hrm? Long time. - Tue Dec  8 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? Oh my, she's pregnant, huh..? Good for you, Momura.. and yeah, Marco. - Tue Dec  8 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Thanks.. - Tue Dec  8 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I took some time off. With the Kazekage's permission, o' course. - Tue Dec  8 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Hmm. - Tue Dec  8 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uhuh.. - Tue Dec  8 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ....Anyone could predict that, though - Tue Dec  8 06:16:19 2015

"I don't mind. I don't advise it- but I don't mind." She states with a relaxed smile as she gathers her energy into the blade of darkness between her hands. She relaxes back into her posture- and smiles warmly at Chikyu.

"I've been meaning to use this a bit more often, myself- work on using a weightier blade more regularly. You mind?" She asks calmly.* - Tue Dec  8 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and nods as she leans back. She makes a snap decision to hold back a little- at least at first- in terms of sheer force. But at the same time.. she feels the need to practice with her heavier weapon- as it is the one closer to the nature of her soul...

And with that in mind..?

She steps forwards- and kicks up the sand as her Nodachi seems to snap forwards in a blur of motion. Her own body is consistently visible; but her weapon blurs in the air as she makes a two handed sweep for Chikyu's side; holding the blade backwards, to strike with blunt blows.* - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015

She grins faintly, as she twists her blade to reverse her grip- holding it upside down as well as backwards now as she rotates it to intercept the stroke, then pivots her body to push it towards Chikyu as she moves...

Before her shifting her grip again back to it's original format sweeps the blade just as suddenly as it did to block while she steps back- utilizing the blades reach as a zoning mechanism to make the area she just stepped through untenable with that sweep!* - Tue Dec  8 06:52:09 2015

"War... you know, most of mans greatest inventions, have occured during war time, as a response to needs and conflicts caused by war?" She says cheerfully. "War, you could say, is a great source of progress and innovation, you know.. a great source of power." She says with a great big smile as she reads from the book...

A lazy smile on her face as she does.* - Tue Dec  8 07:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at Nigen's indignation- and shrugs quickly.

"Maybe they would have come eventually- but war, conflict; these spurred them to come into existence so much quicker. And besides that point.." She laughs softly.

"War is good for business. It makes people money- conflict spurs individuals to grow, and weeds out the weak. Some die, yes- they suffer. Others grow- and gain, exalted and glorious in their own might. War is a crucible in which legends are forged, and the weak fade to nothing... Lives, souls... it all fades away..." She laughs again.

"And in that conflict, people grow. Nations grow. War is the great changer, the great source of growth in the wake of it's destruction."* - Tue Dec  8 08:00:25 2015
