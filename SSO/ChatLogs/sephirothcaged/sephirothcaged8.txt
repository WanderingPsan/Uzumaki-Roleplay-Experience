"So, I hear you plan to leave town. Mind if I ask why?" She inquires in a warm, conversational tone.* - Sat Dec 12 16:10:36 2015

"Not sure it's any /one/ thing.."* - Sun Dec 13 04:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) smiles and nods, smiling warmly as she leans back- a lazy smile on her face.

"Yeah... I'd say so." She says with a broad smile, yawning sleepily.

"Mrm.. how 'bout you?"* - Sun Dec 13 04:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums peacefully, hands in her pockets and a lazy grin on her face as she calmly nods in response to that.

"Mrm, I see, I see! Me... I guess I'm glad for a lot of reasons.. I've been working out my own style, and it's really coming together.. not quite done, but... soon.." She says- with a broad smile as she looks around.

As Iza speaks, she looks over at her- and noticse Lera.

"Yo, Lera, Iza. How you guys been?"* - Sun Dec 13 04:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly as Chikyu speaks- nodding slowly. 

"I'm sure it will be... the Demon's Fang.." She murmurs softly- a lazy smile on her face... a gleam in her eyes that betrays her lazy expression, in favor of the burning determination within.

"Hrm..?" She blinks as she looks towards Chikyu, blinking.

She grins faintly.. and thinks for a moment... before nodding, a lazy smile on her face.

"Sure, Darlin. We could do that. Where do you wanna go?" She inquires warmly.* - Sun Dec 13 04:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly, scratching her head and smiling gently.

She loops an arm around Chikyu's shoulders- and nods, smiling faintly. "Mrm.... Yo, so.... where did you have in mind.. specifically?" She inquires- chuckling faintly as she leans back against Chikyu, enjoying the girl's affection and humming.* - Sun Dec 13 04:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs softly- and then speaks in a lazy, calm tone.

"Nah.. I'm the dude of this relationship. I'll pay." She says simply- as she starts to walk towards the resturant in question- remembering it from a trip with Lera a few years back- and humming calmly.

"Mrm.... So, how was your day?"* - Sun Dec 13 04:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and shrugs as she leans back into the seat upon entering- a relaxed smile on her face.

"Mrm... Well, because..." She trails- shrugging. "I 'unno." She says with a lazy smile- chuckling. "I 'unno. I just.." She shrugs again- then laughs.

"I did, y'know? Anyway.. you order, yeah?"* - Sun Dec 13 04:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins at the other womans words- then chuckles softly. She turns to the waiter as they make the orders- and she speaks softly.

"Steak and Garlic Bread, with Caesar Salad." She says- ordering the foreign food with some practice and calm, as she looks back towards Chikyu- she laughs softly and carelessly as Chikyu makes her comments, smiling peacefully.

"Mrm, you'll be taking initiative, will you..?~ I see, I see.. I wonder how this will turn out, neh?~" She teases playfully, leaning forwards onto the table and grinning bright at Chikyu.* - Sun Dec 13 04:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that- smiling peacefully. She sighs happily- leaning back against the chair with a gleam in her eyes, tapping her chin.

"Well.. I've been out with others- but not for a date. Mrm... I've hung out at dinners, but... not on a proper date, no..." She says softly- shrugging and smiling.

"....Mrm... not that I'm a Virgin, admitably.."* - Sun Dec 13 05:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs softly at Chikyu's obvious embarassment- clearly amused as she shrugs and nods- laughing softly.

"It matters little to me, one way or the other.." She admits with a lazy smile. "As for the rest... Ah, I'm glad to let you accept that honor!" She says with a grin- as a waiter comes up and asks about drinks..

"Sake." She says calmly- before looking back to Chikyu- a lazy smile on her face. "Mrm... so, well. Got anything to talk about?" She inquires warmly.* - Sun Dec 13 05:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs softly as the salad arrives before the main meal- and she grins faintly at Chikyu, leaning into the table and humming calmly.

"Ah... sorry- but that's a secret. Besides... a person like you... could never make it work, anyway. Not you, personality wise. More... genetics." She explains calmly- a chuckle escaping her.

"It's akin to what a Priest does.. but the other side of the same coin."* - Sun Dec 13 05:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and nods slowly- then speaks calmly.

"Well.. I can tell you a few trade secrets.. but we're in public, so.. I'd rather tell you later, you know..? They are... some of them are very..." She trails of- thinking. "Sensitive... if you know what I mean..? Mrm..." She leans back- then whispers softly...

"....And... it's.... no. My family.... was.." She frowns. Her smile... all mirth.. it fades away... and she sighs wearily, hanging her head and leaning into the table.

"...To sum it up? My father was an asshole, and my mother was a whore who wasn't willing to complain about it."* - Sun Dec 13 05:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs and just nods- smiling faintly and shaking her head.

"..Yeah, yeah...Anyway.." She trails of- then smiles brightly. "How about your family..? How was your home life?" She asks with a gentle sigh and a faint smile as she leans back into her chair, arms behind her head.* - Sun Dec 13 05:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods slowly- smiling faintly, chuckling softly and listening.

She sighs gently and leans back; enjoying the story and smling peacefully as she leans back into her seat and laughs softly- a gleam in her eyes.

"Mrm...I see... that sound's wonderful and warm... so... nice and happy, mhrm.." She says warmly as she leans back- a gleam in her eyes and a warm smile on her lips as she relaxes.

"... I'm glad to hear you had such a happy home life, you know?"* - Sun Dec 13 05:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) notices, but calmly refuses to comment as her own meal arrives- and she sighs warmly, as she starts to cut her meat, before devouring the chunks one by one; hungrily digging in with a warm smile and a gleam in her eye, humming peacefully between bites.


"Mhrm... that's true.. It's the duty of parents, to take care of their children.." She muses idly- before digging into her steak hungrily.

"Mrm.."* - Sun Dec 13 05:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and thinks quietly, as she leans forwards.

".... I think if someone hurt's one of those tiny children... I'll have to kill 'em." She says calmly- with a warm, lazy smile, and the same gleam in her eyes as ever.* - Sun Dec 13 05:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) shrugs at that- then laughs softly.

"Mrm... I 'unno, I'm not the type for pre-emptive punishment..." She muses idly. She chuckles faintly, closing her eyes and shrugging. "...Mrm..... anyway, enough about that.. how you like the food?" She asks- as she reaches for a cup of sake to sip.* - Sun Dec 13 05:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly nods- then chuckles as she takes another drink of the sake before moving on to the garlic bread; humming calmly.

"Darling. I handle my booze just /great/." She says lazily- a chuckle on her face as she relaxes back into the chair- a gleam in her eyes. "Habitual drinker."* - Sun Dec 13 05:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) pauses- chewing on toast. She turns to wave at Kiyoko, chuckling faintly.

"Yo, how you doin? Me and Chikyu are out on our first date." She explains, a relaxed smile on her face.* - Sun Dec 13 05:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as Kiyoko rolls up, and nods slowly; a smile on her face- as she explains calmly.

"Mrm.. Chikyu-Chan asked me out... and I had told her, in a few years time, I'd be willing to give dating her a try, so.." She smiles and shrugs, leaning into Kiyoko's arms for a moment, before looking back towards Chikyu and smiling warmly.

"Mrm...And I s'pose you will."* - Sun Dec 13 06:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hahh.... To think, anyone'd be concerned about me.. - Sun Dec 13 06:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly, vaugely amused by the concept of someone else being concerned about her, rather than the other way around...

"Mrm.."* - Sun Dec 13 06:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What are you talkin' about... we love you. - Sun Dec 13 06:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs jovially at that note- grinning faintly.

"Mrm.... What can I say..? I like danger."* - Sun Dec 13 06:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hehe... I guess thats a part I love about you too. - Sun Dec 13 06:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that, turning to look at Lera and Kiyoko- a lazy smile on her face as she does, sighing gently- a gleam of almost envy in her eyes...

"Mrm.."* - Sun Dec 13 06:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly- relaxing as Chikyu leans up to kiss her; leaning down to kiss Chikyu back- chuckling faintly as she does; closing her eyes and pulling the slightly smaller girl in as she hums.

"Mrm.." She murmurs- before parting her lips for a gentle kiss; warm, soft... and gently embracing her.* - Sun Dec 13 06:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as they pull their lips apart- a gleam in her eyes. She chuckles softly.... and nods slowly.

"..Any time, darlin. Anytime." She says gently- not letting go of Chikyu after they break from the kiss.* - Sun Dec 13 06:34:11 2015
