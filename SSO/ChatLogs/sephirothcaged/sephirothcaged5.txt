<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles faintly at this, shrugging.

"Mrm.... As you say, Bryson. See you around, yes Priest?" She says calmly- before turning to look at Momura with a gentle smile.

"Now, how about that spar, mrm?"* - Wed Dec  9 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Mmhmm - Wed Dec  9 05:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as they walk into the Arena, smoothly drawing her Katana and smiling- relaxed as she leans back.

"Mrm... propably, you're still stronger than me... but at the same time... that's fine. Mrm...Let's take it easy then, shall we?" She suggests- chuckling.. as she drops the Katana into the sand- and calls forth her real weapon, flicking her wrist.

"Though- I will admit. I've been meaning to train with this a bit more. I hope you don't mind." She says calmly.* - Wed Dec  9 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she leans back, Nodachi held in both hands, leaning it on her shoulder.

"What, I have to make the first move..? Yare Yare Daze.. A'right." She says, as she waves the blade downwards while chanting... and steps forwards. As she is moving towards Momura's side- a series of black energy constructs begin to form around the woman, even as she dances to the side, blade held two handed as she grins wide.

"I prefer to wait, y'know." She teases- as the dark energy forms into a series of spears.... that fan out to hover around her shoulders- three formed so far, but not yet firing, as she sweeps her blade for Momura's legs to cut towards them- though she /does/ hold the blade backwards as she dances into the fight, a grin on her face.

"Let's dance.'* - Wed Dec  9 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles lazily- as she barks out a few more words in a guttural, twisted tongue- pausing and planting her feet as she lifts the sword in her hands like a conductors baton, gesturing towards Momura and laughing.

Two more spears form... as she speaks, even as she ends her chant, and the five spiral around her blade, waiting to be fired.

"Hah! Not bad.... you're quick, yeah... Let's keep dancing! Klatu Nikto!" She barks out- meaningless words that have nothing to do with her chant, meant as a feint. She waits a full second between saying them...

And surging forwards, firing the spears out as she does- the five splitting of- then launching themselves at Momura in a dancing pattern- one stabbing for her stomach, another for the face; a third for the right shoulder, a fourth for the left- and the fifth and final moving to sweep itself at her legs from behind just after the others as Mitsunara begins to charge in their wake.

"Think quick!~" She giggles as she locks her eyes on Momura.* - Wed Dec  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins as she leaps up in response to the womans attacks, a gleam in her eyes as her blade blurs in her hands.

"I see.. yeah, my magic ain't that strong, sadly.." She muses aloud- even as she's leaping straight up in response to the sweeping kick- going airborne without being struck- as she brings her nodachi down in a blurring answer to her foes own kick- a crescent blurring to meet the lashing limb...

If this is succesful, her blade presses against that leg; the flat of her Nodachi gleaming bright as she pushes down- then launches herself backwards using Momura's own attack for leverage- rolling with the blow to throw herself back off of the kick in a semi-guided fall backwards- not meeting it head on, so much as bringing her blade down on the ankle to use like a lever.

If it's not? Then chances are, she's airborne as shit- even as she laughs wildly.

"Damn, what is it with you and those kicks! You do that a lot, you know.."* - Wed Dec  9 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- taking a moment while Momura speaks to step back and tense- holding her blade steady. She stares at Momura, and nods calmly at that statement. She steps back slightly- and readies herself, flicking her blade to the side as she realizes something that makes her /happy/.

Momura can handle her punishment. She flicks the blade to the side- and laughs.

"Yeah? Show me what you've learned, then!" She booms- as she suddenly... slams her blade forwards in a crescent- as she shifts to roll her body to the side- shifting nto to avoid her foes blow, but to take it to the side rather than head on, and mitigate the damage- the pain- by rolling with it. It still nearly knocks the air out of her...

But it's a pain she can live with, as she blurs her blade just as the kick lands- and just as fast... even faster; the crescent of her blade nigh instant despite it's unwieldy size..

As it erupts into flames- and this time, it's edge first.. though, at least, any cuts will be cauterized!* - Wed Dec  9 05:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- as her vicous stroke is mostly avoided. She breathes in... and out. Her blade is avoided but narrowly, as she steps forwards into the stroke... and grins, as her foe begins to blur. She barks out a few words- chanting lowly in a twisted tongue; as the spears from earlier seem to reform, even as her blade continues to burn in her hands, even as she pulls it in close to her body.

A blow- and she's launched up, three spears formed and holding close to her body as she grunts, even as the blow to her rear launches her airborne- and the last two spears form- all launching in a blind barrage at Momura to try and halt her combo, even as Mitsunara's focus is lost as she's launched.

"Gragh..." She grunts- as she holds her blade tight.

"Tch, exactly what I try to avoid.."* - Wed Dec  9 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) flicks her blade out to the side from where it's tucked in close to her body- as she's flipped upside down and held by her Ankles. It's a few moments in the air- a few, quick, blurring moments. Her reaction time is limited...

So she does two things. She tucks her body in- curling to take the blow on the back of her shoulders as she tucks her head in- held by ankles and waist, her upper torso not truly restricted...

And she blurs her Nodachi into the other womans side as they are locked together into the fall- a roaring laugh escaping her as they hit the ground- her body taking a crushing blow.

Her bones are rattled in their sockets; and while nothing is broken.. Everything hurts. She's sore and aching- and unsure of how much damage that much force did to her- but her body is thankfully, insanely resellient.

She roars- a gleam in her eyes as... at the same time as they where falling... a bluring crescent of flaming nodachi was launching itself into Momura's side.

"DON"T CALL ME DONE YET!" She roars- having endured the attack by shifting her body to take it somewhere less lethal- as she endures most attacks by rolling to absorb force more efficiently!* - Wed Dec  9 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: <*Incoherent Kenpachi Laugh*> - Wed Dec  9 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) slowly pushes herself up from the cloud of sand pushed up from Momura throwing her down. It makes it a little harder to see- prompting her to expand her meager sensory range through focus. 

She breathes in and out- taking a short breather of her own as Momura flips away. As the sand dances around her- her blade steaming from what blood it's managed to draw evaporating into the flames of her spiritual blade's chakra flow coating...

As she tilts her head to the side, and sweeps her blade- pushing the sand aside as she stares at Momura- eyes agleam with a certain... glee.

"You know.. on one hand. Marco... has a point. On the other..? I'm havin wayy too much fun.. to stop now.." She admits with a lazy smile- as she once more lifts her Nodachi to point it at Momura- and begin chanting; and as she speaks and incants; twisted words peeling from her lips and warping reality..

More spears begin to form- five forming.. and still, she's not firing yet... as she gathers the spears to spiral around her blade.

"So... it's your call, I guess.." She murmurs aloud- pausing her chanting- before laughing and returning to her focus, as she crouches while holding that blade in a two handed thrusting posture- standing still as she focuses her mana into those black spears once more...* - Wed Dec  9 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- as the number of spears settles at six... before she barks out those two meaningless words again- this time /after/ she's already fired, once mroe hoping to throw off Momura's agile dodging with cheap tricks... 

As rather than fire as the woman is running in that pattern.. she skids to the side. The shuriken graze over her body- the projectiles doing minimal damage; as the spears spread out to the sides, fam out- then attack in a barrage- six aimed at each leg from different angles as they shoot forwards while Mitsunara runs forwards..

Laughing aloud with a gleam in her eyes as the spears launch forwards- and she follows them in with a blurring crescent swipe from the side that leads towards the bystanders- cutting of that angle of escape as she sweeps her blade towards her sparring partner- a gleam in her eyes and a laugh on her lips as the blade arcs in just after the barrage.

"Yeah, yeah!"* - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) smoothly breathes in.. and out. She doesn't seem to care about the Shuriken whatsoever. Even as the spears fail to do real damage- the woman laughs. She's in everything for the thrill- even as her foe snatches out a hand to push her crescent off target.. she grins faintly.

Just as her foe has grown familiar with her own attacks- she has grown familiar with Momura's. She twists- taking the strike meant for her throat to a shoulder as she rolls with the blow- exagerating the knockback of the blow by throwing her shoulder back as it is hit; rolling with the blow...

As she grins wide at Momura- as they are for a moment, face to face- each without arms unoccupied- her with both hers on her blade- her foe, with one mid punch, and the other on her wrists.

She does the only logical thing in a fight like this.

She brings a knee for Momura's post-pregnancy belly- laughing as she braces her leg against her foes body, and kicks back to create distance.

If this works- she banters at her.

"Ah... how about we call it a break, now..? This was... good.. really good... but at the same time... if we go much harder, someone's gonna get hurt badly.."* - Wed Dec  9 06:44:03 2015

"Yo. I know half the village already knows- but yeah. I'm a Necro. Bryson may have already ranted to you about this- I'd just like to state? My first loyalty is and has always been to the village, so... any yammering Bryson gives about me being a thraet to Suna? Is him viewing me as pure evil due to my heritage and ability set. Nothing more. I'm going to make the same request of you that Hassan granted me, and that I forgot to ask Hassan about, now." She says calmly- turning to face him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles at the taunt and nods- accepting it as she flourishes her hands out to form her Nodachi... and slowly starts to advance- a lazy smile on her face.

"Knowing you..? I guess I'm fine with that.. let's put this conversation on hold, Lera. I've got a fight to attend to." She says calmly- as she focuses.. and begins to chant as she walks slowly forwards- darkness twisting in the air around her.

It spirals into five long spears- straight black pikes of dark energy that twist in the air around her- and she chuckles faintly, as they do; ending her chanting as she makes a firm step- and sweeps the blade.

The five spears rear back- then snap towards Kinami suddenly, as if fired like bullets by the woman chanting; the five attacks each aimed at a different part of Kinami's body- some aiming into the places she'd most likely dodge into to avoid the others!
