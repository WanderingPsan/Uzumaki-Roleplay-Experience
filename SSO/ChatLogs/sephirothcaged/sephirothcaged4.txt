And blackness begins to gather. Shadows congeal into spears- long black shafts attached to Kunai-sized blades that twist and spiral around. They bleed blackness; and she calmly begins to manipulate them in the air, rather than fire them off ata nything.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay so we will stay away from your chakra network and all that because of the necromancer stuff. - Tue Dec  8 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You said about hand eye coordination...  - Tue Dec  8 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) lays back on the medical table, and relaxes.

"Do I need to do anything, or do I just letcha work?"* - Tue Dec  8 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly nods- setting her Katana against the side of the table- stretching out...

And relaxing back- letting her body untense as she closes her eyes- and breathes in.. and out. She opens her eyes and relaxes- letting her arms lay at her sides as she lays on her back.

After a few moments of easing herself into the position- she speaks calmly as she attempts to simply slip into a meditive state while laying on her back; focusing on emptiness to attain stillness.

"..Ah.. ready."* - Tue Dec  8 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) peacefully rests in her meditation against the table.* - Wed Dec  9 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh? - Wed Dec  9 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) perks up- shifting to sit up right as she looks towards the door, scratching her head.

"Mrm, should I come too?" She inquires calmly, scratching her head- looking to Kiyoko. "And ah...Kiyoko. Sorry about this. Guess we should head over, huh?"* - Wed Dec  9 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why does everyone get suicidal around me? - Wed Dec  9 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I was the one who reported it and I'm getting questioned -again-.. - Wed Dec  9 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Heya Kiyoko and it doesn't matter. - Wed Dec  9 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly- almost protectively- follows around Kiyoko.

"Yo, Ai. Sup?"* - Wed Dec  9 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Goin well. Keepin Kiyoko company for now.. - Wed Dec  9 00:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ...Even if I am a good torturer. - Wed Dec  9 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly waits, meditating in the living room.* - Wed Dec  9 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs- as she forms another Kage Bunshin- her earlier formed clone still studying at the Sunagakure library- reading up on assorted subjects. This one, she stares at for a moment- before dispelling it with a faint chuckle, as she reclines back into her chair.

"Practice, practice, practice.." She murmurs idly.* - Wed Dec  9 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks as she leans back- after dispelling the clone- and sighs quietly as she thinks on what to do next. She ponders the topic- then shrugs. She lifts and waves her hand; incanting low words as an array of black spears forms over her head. She chuckles at the bladed weaponry of shadow, as each pole twists and writhes...

Before she snaps her fingers and dismisses them.* - Wed Dec  9 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as she incants again;  recasting the spell after dismissing the initial results; letting the black smoke curl back into spears before it's even done fading away- as she feels the rush of her mana, her chakra, her /energy/, her POWER, by whatever name it wishes to be called, flowing through her and into the air. Her control is lacking- her raw strength with such spells leaving much to be desired...

And yet it remains beautiful- as she stares at the shafts of those blackened spears..* - Wed Dec  9 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stares up as the spears revolve in the around her- then aims every single one at herself. She chuckles- twitching a finger as she launches them into her own body- and each, one by one, shatters against her form; unable to pierce her body.

She laughs softly at the display- shaking her head quietly... before she resumes the incantation to summon another set of dark spears- sighing quietly as they hover into the air around her.* - Wed Dec  9 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly as she leans back and once more- launches a volley of her own attack at herself; and once more, the spears shatter on her body as she leans back and takes the hits.

Before resuming her chanting- growing bored with this method of training, but at the same time realizing the nesescity of it all as she feels the shadowy energy roiling around and within her with every incantation..* - Wed Dec  9 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) knocks on the door.

"Can I come in..? There's nothing to do in the waiting room, n' I got bored of meditating."* - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: At worst he'd lose his arm, shoulder, and be unable to do hardly anything on his own. - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks in- closing the door behind her- and leaning against it silently; apparently just intent on listening in.* - Wed Dec  9 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Wed Dec  9 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It was obvious he did them to himself, and considering his drugged state and pain it was conclusive with the type of messy injuries delivered. - Wed Dec  9 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not exactly. Don't assume right off the bat. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...his injuries SHOW he killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Someone would have had to force him to do it with his own hands to make it look like suicide. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Simple. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
