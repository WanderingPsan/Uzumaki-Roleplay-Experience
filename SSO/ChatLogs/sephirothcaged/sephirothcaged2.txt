It's a mystery. She speaks calmly as he asks his question. "I use my chakra to fuel the ability the soul trapped inside the blade is using." She explains calmly- as she holds the weapon steady and looks on.

Of note about the blade is also that it is far sharper than steel- but about as tough as steel... currently, at least. Of note as well is that when he first saw it, it was more comparable to iron in both forms. 

She waits calmly as he makes his tests- and sighs.. breathing in and out as she stares lovingly at the sword- careful about it.

"Now.. have you any more questions or tests, for now?" She asks- as he concludes his searches.* - Sun Dec  6 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that- as she dismisses it into tendrils of shadow- and thinks on how to respond.

"Until I have collected more souls, my versatality with it is.. limited, yes."* - Sun Dec  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she starts to head for the door- swaying her hips in a slow, sultry gait.

"Simple. I ripped out my own soul, and formed it into a blade." She says in a relaxed tone as she heads for the door.* - Sun Dec  6 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles- then shakes her head.

"Nope! Well, only insomuch as I was born with a soul, you know. I had to learn how to call it- though... you couldn't. Being human, and not a necromancer, and all." She admits calmly.* - Sun Dec  6 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hah! I'm going the fuck to sleep, why? - Sun Dec  6 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stretches otu and yawns.

"It's late, and I'm tired."* - Sun Dec  6 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. If you intend to sleep, I suppose I can try to redeem myself in gambling later. - Sun Dec  6 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, I suppose you can.. but y'know. - Sun Dec  6 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I've got the devils own luck. Heh. - Sun Dec  6 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) waves goodbye as she strolls out- humming calmly as she reaches into her vest- and pulls out a small black book, and begins to read..* - Sun Dec  6 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: His name is Otorius. Hiroshi might be able to tell you more he sparred with him. I only caught the ending. - Sun Dec  6 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) yawns as she walks out into the training field- humming calmly- holding a book up before her face and reading quietly as she enters. Her eyes flicker across pages and words- soaking in knowledge slowly, piece by piece as she studies whatever is in that strange little tome...

"Hrm..? Is something going on..?"* - Sun Dec  6 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Is he strong? - Sun Dec  6 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Oh that guy? He's a noobie like me. He does that thing like you guys I think. - Sun Dec  6 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Which thing? - Sun Dec  6 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh remember when you and Bro were sparring Koji and the white haired lady? You sade you can't take a hit from them cause it goes right through. That thingy. - Sun Dec  6 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ohhh. That bullshit. - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Yeah... it hurts - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Your plants? - Sun Dec  6 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) shrugs and yawns.

"Lots of things hurt." She says in an almost blaise tone as she shifts to lean against a wall- book still open in front of her as she leafs through the small black tome; humming calmly as she murmurs incomprehensible words under her breath. It's clear that, for now, she is quite distracted with her studies...* - Sun Dec  6 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Hmm...I should get a book on kenjutsu... - Sun Dec  6 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Hmm... I should test my summon against someone who wasn't about to become Chuunin... - Sun Dec  6 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hey! - Sun Dec  6 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) turns and looks at Hiroshi, squinting.

"I've seen you around a few times. How good are you in a fight?"* - Sun Dec  6 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) scratches her head with one hand, as the other continues to support her small book, and thinks for a moment.

"..Ah, nevermind." She says- waving it off with a shrug. "Was considering, but... nah.." She murmurs aloud- before returning to her book and sighing quietly. She squints at a passage- and can be heard to murmur aloud.

"How the hell am I supposed to pronounce that..?" Before returning to silently reading-s ighing and shaking her head every now and then.* - Sun Dec  6 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Er.... okay? - Sun Dec  6 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Have to play it like bro. *mental nod* - Sun Dec  6 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Finally someone with hair like mine. - Sun Dec  6 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hello. - Sun Dec  6 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT!! - Sun Dec  6 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Ah, um, hello? - Sun Dec  6 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Who're you? - Sun Dec  6 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Names Mirai. - Sun Dec  6 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Nice to meet you, Mirai. But, um, why're you pointing at me? - Sun Dec  6 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at the familial reuinion taking place in front of her- even as a sick envy begins to curl in her stomach at the sight of them all being so happy together, at the thought of a real, functioning family compared to...

She curses under her breath, tucks the tome away, and heads for the square.* - Sun Dec  6 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sits down on the bench and sighs- feeling almost weary, after forcing herself to stalk away. She leans her book on her lap- and begins to resume reading from the small black tome- frustration welling in her. So far, it seems useless- but she knows better! She knows that the dark things in this tome have a potential- that her twisted arts could grow and swell into something beautiful...

But she also knows, that is very nearly out of her reach, as things stand. And it aggravates her almost as much as seeing a happy family, as thinking of reuinions...

So she throws herself into the tome- intent on puzzling out the art of summoning..* - Sun Dec  6 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) lowers the tiny black book and sighs as she leans back- thinking quietly.

"...Don't worry about it. Just a personal problem- an old one." She states softlly- before lifting the book back up and returning to her studies with a low sigh, and a calm smile.

"Just didn't want to be around a family re-union, is all."* - Sun Dec  6 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: You should head back. You've got family waiting back there, right? Family you haven't seen in a long time. Go spend time with em. - Sun Dec  6 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: -- Before I pick you up and throw you at 'em. - Sun Dec  6 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and shrugs softly as he walks up- reading her book and nodding as he walks off.

"...Thanks, yo. Now- get with you! To your family with you- back! Back!" She demands of Koji- her playful smirk hidden behind the black grimoire she's reading from as she relaxes back fully again- intent on resuming her exploration of whatever is inside that tome..,.* - Sun Dec  6 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Should I..Just keep walking? - Sun Dec  6 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mitsu. - Sun Dec  6 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec  6 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Follow. - Sun Dec  6 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) blinks as she lowers the book and crooks an eyebrow up- then thinks for a moment- and shrugs.

"Well, you're the superior officer here. Whadaya want?" She asks- sighing as she once more tucks away her black book and stares at Ai calmly, shifting to rise- hands hidden in the folds of her robe.* - Sun Dec  6 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Just follow. - Sun Dec  6 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Uh.. Sure, I s'pose. - Sun Dec  6 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Where in the hell..? - Sun Dec  6 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) frowns as they arrive in a graveyard, of all things. A bleak wind seems to howl through the empty desert into which this effigy to death and mourning is erected- and the woman beside Ai scowls slightly as she closes her eyes and sighs. She'll remember this place for another time, yes- but at the same time..

She shudders- as she opens her eyes and looks over.

"....Freinds of yours, I take it?" She tactfully says- ignoring her utter bewilderment at being the one brought out here.* - Sun Dec  6 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed. - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mhrm.. - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sorry for your.. uh.. loss. - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: It's fine. - Sun Dec  6 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: How have you been? - Sun Dec  6 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: --- Oh god, did he bring me out here to ask me to raise the dead for her? Shit, I can't even do that yet.. - Sun Dec  6 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, pretty good... - Sun Dec  6 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I haven't talk with ya in a while. - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Bit ticked that... taking time of from my normal routine to study other things.. Seems to have resulted in the others leavin me behind, but.. good on the whole.. happy. - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly and smiles faintly.

"..Mrm. And I suppose we haven't. You got something you want to talk to me about, then..?" She inquires calmly.* - Sun Dec  6 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- faintly smiling. It's nice, she thinks to herself- being considered a freind by someone... it creates a pleasant, warm feeling in the womans heart as she looks on.

"Ah.... well, I wasn't gonna worry about rank anyway, so that's no issue. I mean- you've seen how I adress the Kage. You think I'm big on respect? Hah!" She teases lightly- before shrugging and thinking.

"Mrm.... well, I suppose that leaves me to pick the topic, huh? Mrm... huh.." She trails of- scratching her head. "Y'know, I've been considering.. leaving town on a bit of a trip- just to wander between the villages for.. maybe a year or so.... and see what I can? Mrm... I think it might be a nice way to get stronger for a bit... if I can get Sanoke's permission. What do you think?"* - Sun Dec  6 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that- and shrugs.

"I'd mostly be riding the caravans between the villages.. but still.." She tilts her head back and chuckles- accepting the rose and staring at it for a moment... before speaking on in that same cheerful, nonchalant tone.

"There's a limit to how strong I can become without real conflcit... without chaos and murder... without taking more lives... as it is... I'm almost wasting away, in here..." She admits softly- a slight frown on her face.* - Sun Dec  6 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she leans against a headstone and crooks an eyebrow up... then shrugs... thinking quietly.

"...It's not so much that I can't become stronger, as.... my soul- it thrives on battle.. on carnage... and I sate it with spars and mock battles- training. It makes my body stronger- but.... god, it's like a hunger.." She murmurs- before shrugging and leaning against a random tombstone, thinking quietly.

"...Still- if you're willin to help me out with training? That'd be great, yeah... I could sure as hell use a hand." She admits with a faint smile- leaning back thoughtfully.... before shrugging.

".....Mrm.... anyway. Enough about depressing shit...Wanna hit up the bar, later? I could use a drink, after this discussion."* - Sun Dec  6 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) scratches her chin- thinking quietly as she leans back.

"Eh... drinking in a graveyard might be a bit morbid for you, so... Hrm... and I live in Chikyu's place, so 'back at my place' is out...... you got anywhere that might work?" She opines with a crooked eyebrow and a faint smile.

"And.. who do I remind you of, then?"* - Sun Dec  6 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- nods slowly... thinking quietly as she leans against the tombstone- thinking quietly.

"Mrm.... An empty house. The inn is being used as a prison." She says calmly.* - Sun Dec  6 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Let's go then. - Sun Dec  6 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure. - Sun Dec  6 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Good here? - Sun Dec  6 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure. - Sun Dec  6 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) slides to sit at a table- chuckling.

"Mrm.. guess we're squaters... this'll be nice." She says idly- as she reaches for the glass, and pours out into cups rather than shotglasses- humming calmly as she then tips back a cup- sighing happily.

"You know, I beat Marco in a drinking contest the other day? He's so mad!"* - Sun Dec  6 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Yaeh. - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: A hundred grand, in a drinking contest. - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Don't know if I can still hold down mines. - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh... - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: See, I just drink to relax, you know..? I like the warmth... Mrm. - Sun Dec  6 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see. - Sun Dec  6 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: This is gonna be the first in months. - Sun Dec  6 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that.

"Meanwhile.. I mighttt be an alchoholic..." She admits lazily, as she takes another long sip- and gestures for Ai to take his own cup- humming calmly.

"Mrm.."* - Sun Dec  6 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly, as she shrugs and nods- thinking quietly and humming warmly as a pleasant buzz starts up in her head, and a warmth spreads through her body, down her throat..

"Ah.... well, we'll see, won't we?~ Mrm..... so, how have you been lately?" She inquires- as she takes another long swig and sets her cup down, waiting for a response.* - Sun Dec  6 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly. She herself is coping well- but the warmth that spreads into her body is something that, as usual, she invites. At the mention of Ai's body, her eyes flicker to the body in question as she knocks back a long draught...

Then speaks plainly.

"Your body, eh? I can help with that. You could join me for a workout- or I could walk you through some hand to hand in a few spars."* - Sun Dec  6 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Heehaww hahaha.... - Sun Dec  6 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she leans back into her seat- and just chugs the glass down, finsihing hers and wiping her lips- swaying a bit as a warmth spreads through her entire body... and she giggles.

"Ahaaa.... yeah, I wouldn't mind workin on that body.." She murmurs out- slurring faintly before giggling again... and thinking. "We can totally start whenever!"* - Sun Dec  6 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles lazily at that- nodding firmly as she sets down the bottle thoughtfully;  having emptied her own glass, if not the entire bottle. She smiles happily at Ai and shrugs.

"A'right.. ahh.... Sure, let's work on your body, mhrm.... where do we start..?" She murmurs- as she shifts in her seat with a drunken smile, and her hands shift over to rest on the other boys hips- then glide up his sides.

"Hrm.... measurin..?"* - Sun Dec  6 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) passes out- to have one hell of a hangover later.* - Sun Dec  6 23:01:32 2015

"HOw you doin?" She inquires lazily.* - Mon Dec  7 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm good, just got my arm taken off not to long ago. - Mon Dec  7 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as she moves to sit down and relaxes back, sighing warmly as she waves over the bartender and orders Sake.

"So, any reason for your chosen order of events?"* - Mon Dec  7 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs cheerily as she knocks back a chug from a bottle, herself- but she... doesn't seem to grow drunk so quickly; long experience as an alchoholic girding her against the booze flowing down her throat as she sighs happily and sets the bottle down.

"Interesting, she says."* - Mon Dec  7 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) squints at the slumping woman before her, as she takes another long swig of her buttle- then nudges Hassan's shoulder, squinting as she uses the bottle to nudge.

"....Really?"* - Mon Dec  7 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) blinks at this- as her slight nudge somehow results in Kinami.. sliding of the table!? And then- suddenly! An abrupt headbut towards her shins..!? She grunts as she pulls her legs up- then pushes back from the table, skidding her chair backwards as it begins to tip over, and she leaps backwards out of it onto the floor- swaying unsteadily.

"The hell, woman!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stares at the Drunk woman and squints at the strange, strange motions towards the door- warily moving to follow her.

"...Kinami, what the fuck..? You are drunk, not stoned!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) squints at Kinami as the girl slides up to rise and stand. She raises her fists in response to the declaration- and just laughs softly- nodding slowly.

"Right here, huh..? A'right!" She states... as she feints throwing a punch- then sweeps with a kick to her foes legs as her fist instead curls in front of herself to form a guard after the mock punch meant to draw attention, even as she steps forwards into this strike.

"LEt's see how you fight drunk!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: stat set kinam - Mon Dec  7 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts- as the blow hammers towards her. She's blocking already from her earlier half-feint... as she tenses and tanks the blow as best she can. She skids back slightly as the woman seems to throw her entire body against her- her arm bending under the strain, but not breaking as she rolls backa nd down with the blow....

Then hammers her other fist for Kinami's chin in a brutal full force uppercut to force her off of her as she steps forwards while her foe is still charging- roaring out with what is very nearly glee as she laughs heartily.

"WAAAHAHAAAA!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as the woman seems to bend impossibly to dodge her initial uppercut. She grimaces as she staggers forwards- momentum carrying her forwards... before a headbut again forces her back. It bruises her chest as she sways backwards- coughing badly- but then she steels herself and plants her feet.

She roars- as her arms shift to grab onto either side of her foe as she slams her head down against the back of her foes neck before she can bend back up from the headbut...

Then slams her knee up into Kinami's gut- even as her foes forehead digs into her gut painfully- nearly making her want to puke from sheer painful physical force that slams into her body- a roar escaping her as she staggers back and counterattacks!

"GAAHHAAHHAHAAAA!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) staggers back as Kinami seems to fly out of her grasp after the series of blows she landed in retaliation for the headbut- coughing as she steadies herself.. and stares in bewilderment at the immobile woman laying on the ground in front of her- and squinting.

"A-ah... Kinami.. what the fuck!?"* - Mon Dec  7 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) blinks as Chikyu walks up to squeeze her- then chuckles softly and shifts to hug her back, gently squeezing.

"Yeesh.. of course I'm fine. 'm Tougher n' most, you know!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) scratches her head and chuckles- nodding slowly.

"..>Yeah, a'right." She says calmly- bending to heft Kinami into her arms in a firemans carry.* - Mon Dec  7 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly drags Kinami off like a cavewoman for a lesbian threeway.* - Mon Dec  7 06:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly sets Kinami down on the couch, yawning.* - Mon Dec  7 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she's hugged. The Necromancer hugs Chikyu back, squeezing her tight as she hugs her back- a lazy smile on her face as she chuckles softly.

"Heh, no worry of that, m'dear." She says warmly. "I like clingy."* - Mon Dec  7 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at the question- enjoying the other girls closeness as she rubs Chikyu's back- swaying from side to side with her arms looped around her and a pleasant smile.

"A bit tired, yeah. Why do you ask?"* - Mon Dec  7 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at Chikyu's almost devious smile- smirking playfully in response to her advances as she let's the girl pull her down against the cushions. She curls her arms around the other girl- letting one hand drift to cup her rear, as the other runs up and down her back.

"Heh, I guess I don't mind having a cute little teddy bear to hold while I nap, no." She teases right back-leaning into Chikyu and sighing comfortably.

"Mrm... nice and comfortable, mhrm."* - Mon Dec  7 07:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly.. and sighs gently... nuzzling into her calmly as she simply curls up around her... and enjoys the warmth of the other girl. She enjoys the warmth- both physically and emotionally. She snuggles into her- and slowly.. begins to drift of to sleep holding her, yawning quietly.* - Mon Dec  7 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: What a naughty teddy bear I'm hugging. You can't cup that spot, until you're sure you want all of it. - Mon Dec  7 07:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) is akin to a rock in her sleep- a warm, soft, clingy rock. It's not too easy to get out from under her- but it doesn't seem to wake her. She just shifts to hugging the pillow next to her instead of Chikyu, and rolls around a bit- snoring quietly.* - Mon Dec  7 07:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) yawns as she looks around- hands in her pocket and a lazy smile on her face.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as Sanoke fails to realize that it is vaugely mocking to hit him with that many honorifics- then speaks bluntly.

"I want permission to go on a trip through the regional villages. I wanna go for a walk, fight people from other villages, and see what I can learn- and maybe kill some bandits while passing by. If you could give me permission- or a misssion that allows me to do this while performing it- I'd be really damn happy."* - Mon Dec  7 20:46:17 2015

"I didn't have a time period set in mind, if I'm honest. However long it took?" She explains- before stepping forward and whispering to him.* - Mon Dec  7 20:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: I need to go out there, harvest some souls, and come back significantly calmed down. - Mon Dec  7 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: So you want me to send you out to potentially take innocents to calm yourself? - Mon Dec  7 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Of course not! - Mon Dec  7 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: I'd only kill people who could fight back. - Mon Dec  7 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Civilian's aren't worth the effort. - Mon Dec  7 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Just because they can fight back doesn't mean they're not innocent. - Mon Dec  7 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Look- I'm literally going to head out. See if anyone attacks me. And kill anyone who does. - Mon Dec  7 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: If you want something to fight, I can give you an unruly animal or something. - Mon Dec  7 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: So it'll probably mostly be ban- that is nowhere near the same. Come on, man! - Mon Dec  7 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I was considerin' it. But you're kinda making me nervous. - Mon Dec  7 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Plus, the fact that you have no set timeframe. - Mon Dec  7 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stares at him calmly.* - Mon Dec  7 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Somewhere between one month, and one year. More likely, around two months. - Mon Dec  7 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Too long. - Mon Dec  7 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: -- Oh come on! I have literally never taken a single day off before.  - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: You can have a single month off, and I'll be watching the news accordingly. - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Gah... are there any missions that go out of town, at lea- A Month..? A'right. - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Don't even think about comin' back if you've done bad things. - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: ...Define Bad Things. - Mon Dec  7 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Oh! Also. Which Villages are we allied with, and which are we not? - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Killing people just to sate your 'crazy desires.' I can understand self defense. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: But that's all I'll accept. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Pretty much all. But Kirigakure tends to have dicks that won't let you in. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Look, it's not a crazy desire. It's a cold, calculated desire for more power through consuming souls. But I will accept this condition. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: ...And huh, we're allied with everyone? Shame... but cool. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: A'right then. - Mon Dec  7 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: ... I'll be back in a month- thanks. - Mon Dec  7 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) clasps her hands together- and with a relaxed smile, calmly bows.

"I'll be back in a month, then." She states warmly- turning to head for the caravan organizer- intent on booking herself for her trip.* - Mon Dec  7 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hmm..Sanoke, hows the Kage business goin for y'? - Mon Dec  7 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uh, we need a medic to help this guy out. - Mon Dec  7 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Which guy?..Oh what's wrong? - Mon Dec  7 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks up to the group- humming. She dismounted a caravan not a few moments ago- a caravan that continued on towards the local merchants. She's a tall, lithe figure- wearing a single Katana at her hip and smiling almost lazily as she makes her approach- robe flowing about her. A Sunagakaure headband is worn as an armband, as she looks around with a playful smile.

"Yo.... Kumogakure, right? Caravan guy didn't lie to me, yeah?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, I see... Mrm... always wanted to visit this place. How you guys holding up lately, then? - Mon Dec  7 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Pretty good. - Mon Dec  7 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: No idea man. - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: People just come and go, I wonder if our guards are just being lazy. .  - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) turns to look at Hei- and speaks plainly.

"I'm on a month long leave with my Kage's permission. I decided to spend it touring the other Shinobi villages we are freindly with, looking for good swordspeople to see what I could learn from fighting them." She says calmly.* - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Come to the wrong place, we don't have many swordsmen. - Mon Dec  7 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: I should go talk to my toad buddies. - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Forever alone status. - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and turns to face Hei- nodding slowly as she cracks her shoulders.

"I see, I see- a man who likes his swords big and girthy, eh? Fan of the girth over length side of the debate, mhrm, mhrm... I see. You got a Zanbatou sealed on you, somewhere..? Cus I don't have one to lend you, but I'm sure it'll be fun."* - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and sighs as she nods at him- frowning.

"Ah... shame... 'n of course, there's no Marco on hand to just buy one from... shame... well. How are you with a normal Katana?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yo, real quick. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Are Sunagakure's guards still on edge? - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh? A bit... not as much? Plus.. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: The new Kazekage's a lot more lenient about letting people in. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright. . .I'm going to go visit. - Mon Dec  7 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I ask 'cus I can stand to lend you a normal sword, and use somethin else. - Mon Dec  7 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmmm. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: A regular katana? - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Eeer.. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Not that proficient.. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly, hands in her pockets- then sighs and shakes her head.

"Damn shame.."* - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: How about you give me time to go buy a Zanbatou and we'll go at it? - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure, if you know a place you can get one reasonably soon. - Mon Dec  7 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whistles calmly at this- crooking an eyebrow as she draws her own Katana and holds it lazily out to the side, left handed.

"My, got ahold of that real fast, didn'tcha..? Hah! A"right. Well... I s'pose I'm ready when you are." She says with a relaxed smile.* - Mon Dec  7 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and breathes in... then out- as she leans one arm back- and holds her sword forwards, pointing it at him as he seems to lean his blade on the ground- a lazy smile on her face as she points her weapon right at him. 

"So, you're ready, yeah?" She says with a lazy smile at his drawing the weapon- before slowly begining to nod... as flame springs to life around the steel of her Katana- dancing along the edge as she holds that posture- relaxing her body and spreading her legs ever so slightly.

"...Let's dance, yeah?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) steps back slightly. She's not used to dodging- but the electric light running down the blade has her wary; so she shifts her usual strategy slightly as she steps slightly back- then as the blade cuts through where she was, she winds her arm back..

And lunges for a thrust over his arms towards his chest as the blade comes down towards where her hip was but a second ago. It's a narrow dodge- she's barely fast enough to avoid the strike..

But the time it took to reach her, and the simple nature of the attack... it gives her the reaction time she needs. 

Even as she thrusts in towards his chest with her left- blade still aflame- her right hand rears back and hangs low to wait to act- a grin on her lips as her entire body tenses at this initial exchange.

"Phew! Maybe we can trade tricks after this- I've always wondered how to do this with lightning! Bwaahahaah!"* - Mon Dec  7 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) thinks: I;ll be sure to use my weapon on her. - Mon Dec  7 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: ... - Mon Dec  7 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins faintly at the narrow evasion of her blow- the huge weapon knocking her Katana offcourse and into the air above them. She grins as her body shifts- too slow to evade his stroke... as his restrained blow fails to penetrate her hip- instead grazing off and cutting her robe slightly at the hip; his restrained strength not quite enough to pierce her body...

As her right hand hammers forwards towards his wrists, and her left reverses it's grip on the blade held in the air- before bringing it down in a blurring, accelerated crescent.

It's a simple answer to her intial blow being thrown offcourse- as the flames around her blade die down, and she moves to swing the blade straight down for his shoulder while her hand moves to grasp his wrists- trying to push his blade to the side and unsteady him for her other blow- a gleam in her eyes as she steps closer- lulled into a false sense of security by that blow skidding along her body.* - Mon Dec  7 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) frowns at the end to the battle- as the flames around her blade fade. She squints at him- stepping back as she lifts her blade- then flicks it to the side.

"..Eh? You want to stop just like that..? Ah, what a buzzkill.." She complains, sighing as she steps backa nd stares at him. The unarmed hand moves to rub the back of her head as she sighs and stares at him.

"You /sure/ you wanna call it there..? I was jsut startin to have some fun.. You're pretty good with that thing."* - Mon Dec  7 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Somehow... I doubt that. The strength to swing around that big 'ol thing... - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: But not to pierce my skin with it? - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'm not buyin it. - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Y'know? - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hahaha. - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- and sighs as she sheathes it.

"Still... if you wanna hold back, that's your call, I s'pose.." She murmurs, shrugging. "It's a damn shame, though..."* - Mon Dec  7 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think Sogeki has seen me yet. - Mon Dec  7 22:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Yo.... so.  - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) tucks her hands into her pockets within her robe, and smiles lopsidedly.

"So.... I am led to believe you know about some good swordsmen out and about.. or are one?"* - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That so, eh..? - Mon Dec  7 22:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Kenjutsu techniques or Jutsu, yeah. - Mon Dec  7 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins at his agreement- and nods.

She moves to draw her Katana- and speaks idly.

"I don't suppose you use any specific style, neh?"* - Mon Dec  7 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at his question- pointing her blade at him tip first, held loosely to the side and forwards in her left hand, as her right hands near her waist- and she teasingly opines back.

"Not quite. Now- please. Take the first step of the dance whenever, neh?"* - Mon Dec  7 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins faintly... as he lunges forward at an incredible speed. She steps forwards- and his blow lands- a blunt impact of iron against the side of her chest.. as her hand darts out and grabs his wrist as the blade makes impact. She endures the blow- grunting slightly as it impacts... but rather than recoiling from the blow, stepping into it and grabbing for his wrist to hold the sword there- as her left arm rears back..

Then lunges to stab straight into his gut with her own blade- snapping forward like a piston hammer as she laughs cheerily-- a gleam in her eyes.

"Rules? Just don't kill each other!" She roars.* - Mon Dec  7 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) laughs wildly- as the surge of electricity runs through her- and seems to do little more than make her hair stand on end- as she flares the same attack backa t him as her own blade continues it's thrust without a skip in the beat- likely running home into his stomach or side- as she hopes to stun him right back with a flare of the exact same move..!

"Waaaahahahahah!" She laughs- as there is no window of time caused by the stone- and her grip doesn't relent- though her hand on his wrist tenses tighter and tugs him forwards, before letting go..!* - Mon Dec  7 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- as his blade cuts open her palm easily as it slides back- the sheer cutting power rending through flesh. It hits nothing vital- and she isn't goign to be losing the hand to a graze; but his blow cleaves through her skin as she pulls her hand back- laughing...

Even as her response to hsi dodge to the side is simple- in a second she is twisting the blade... and chasing his dodging form with it- as fire explodes around the steel- a laugh escaping her even as pain lances through her from her hand, and the electric charge seems to leave her shuddering....

Even as she pivots her entire body- and the blade accelerates into a chakra fueled blur- a crescent of iron and flame that chases Menma's body as he retreats away.

"Haahh! Not bad!" She laughs cheerfully as she pursues him.* - Mon Dec  7 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins as she presses forcefully at his blade with her own briefly- before skidding back, using the momentum to flow backwards- as she breathes in... then out....

And grins wide, as she drops her sword to the sand beside her- letting the flames wink out... As she gathers her hands over her head- a grin on her lips.

"Why in the hells would I give up.. when I'm having so much damn fun! Come on- you're not done yet, are you..? I only cut you once!" She says with a laugh- as she holds her hands together as if holding a weapon- but seems to be carrying nothing as she stands there- waiting,..

"Come on! Come at me! Hit me! Strike me! Yeah!" She roars.* - Mon Dec  7 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) brings her hands down- and as she does- a gleam in her eye. A sword froms between her hands- and it's a different beast entirely from her prior weapon that is brought down towards his soulders as he moves to slash at her chest. She steps forwards- doing little to avoid his blow, but instead accepting the moderate slash to her body- a thin line of blood spraying from the wound.. but nothing beyond her ability to endure, as she works through the pain- and continues her own slash.

A Nodachi formed in her hands- long and curved. It's edge coming down for his shoulder at full speed- the monstrously large and long blade coming down- formed of purple metal of some kind- called from elsewhere by some strange methodology.

It falls like a heavy, descending steel log- and she laughs as it does- a gleam in her eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins as their blades clash- her own pressing down firmly. Her grin is broad- as she holds the clash for a moment... as she applies pressure- and leverage; leaping up and tensing her legs against the wall behind her- before kicking of it to push forwards- angling her blade against his like a lever...

To flip herself over him to land a short distance behind him, unless he chooses to break the clash while holding one hand against her own two handed slash- in which case it likely becomes a vicous stroke to his shoulder from a bizzare angle..!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) meanwhile, as he is standing- she is turning and swinging her blade to move. Her blade swings towards Menma's own as he turns to face her in the spar.

As the tip of his blade points to her... the side of her blade is already coming up in a diagonal crescent. She has a longer weapon- as she moves to slam a crescent towards his blade- then slide forwards to, while pushing it aside with the side of hers, thrust for his chest as she laughs wildly- a gleam in her eyes of vicous.. almost a hunger, really.

Her blood is racing- adrenaline pumps through her body as she throws herself into it. The scent of blood is on the air- and while blood loss is something tow orry about, sooner or later.. she can still move.

Sheer brutal hunger for battle, keeps her moving.

"Hah! Ready to yield!?"
