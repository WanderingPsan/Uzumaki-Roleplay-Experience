"....For one- I think about how happy it makes me, knowing I have freinds.... for another, I have trouble supressing a passing thought or five about your body.. for yet another.... I think of you as someone strong as hell, with a personality I can definitly respect and get along with.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that- blushing despite herself at the wink as she starts to dig in with a voracious appetite of her own; her usual hard work and intense training regimines leaving her starvingly hungry when she does get to eat. She pauses only to take the ocasional shot of Sake to wash it down- sighing contently on the burn down.* - Sat Dec  5 21:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sighs, as she walks out from the others- heading to a mostly isolated corner of the village and stretching... as she moves to lean against an old, dead tree- and reaches for a small book. It's something she's kept a real secret, for some time now...

It's a simple book, too. Plain- black. Bound in leather and tied shut. It's a grimoire- and a simple one, at that. A grimoire on a topic she had yet to really delve into- something she stole from her father when she fled her home.

She flips it open and starts to read- studying into it slowly and surely as she puzzles out- piece by piece, the basics of summoning.

It's a process that eats away hours- eats away days. It's how she comes to pass the time when she's not training in other ways, or eating... and eventually- it begins to have born fruit.

And so it is that one day- she finds herself standing in between a few cacti- sword sheathed as she breathes in... and out. In.. and out.

She gathers her energy; and begins to chant in a low tone; a harsh, twisted tongue leaves her mouth. Piece by piece, she gathers twisted energy; and as she finishes chanting, a dark maelstrom forms. a twisted vortex from which begins to crawl a beast of stone- stone that crumbles to reveal a gothic seeming gargoyle; a monstrous creature of dark flesh that snarls at the air- desiring to bring chaos and destruction.

She chuckles softly- and speaks gently.

"Success.."* - Sat Dec  5 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) now finds herself staring at the Gargoyle thoughtfully- as she thinks for a moment.. then nods.

"Mrm... Well, demon- lesser of your kind as you are... still, I have some respect for you... so I guess I'll send you back, rather than.. right." She murmurs- as she looks down and reads on Banishment... nodding- then chanting directly from the book an incantation to release it back to whence it came, sighing.* - Sat Dec  5 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks into the Arena, humming gently as she does so. She frowns however, as she walks in....

On her freind puking? She blinks in suprise.

"Wait- what the hell?!" She says- running in towards Chikyu with a frown. She has no idea what's going on- but her first, instinctual thought, is very simple.

Murder whoever hurt one of her freinds. She bares teeth as she jogs forwards, looking around- frowning.

"What the hell is going on here?!" She hisses as she looks at the puking Chikyu.* - Sat Dec  5 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) continues to walk forwards- gently shifting to help support the girl who just finished puking her guts out- staring on with concern as she frowns, steadying her- patting and rubbing her back gently as her other hand rubs her stomach.

"Hey.. hey, christ. I'm all for hardcore training- but if you end up puking like that? You trained too hard, for too long- and shoulda been taking brief breaks every now and then!"* - Sat Dec  5 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And...alll I need is a few more drinks. The heat going to kill me first. - Sat Dec  5 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) winces at Chikyu's response to trying to drink water- patting her back gently and half-hugging her with the comforting movements she is trying to give in wory.

"Ah... we should get you inside. Your house, or the hungry ant? EIther way, I'm coming with you- get you out of the heat, and get you some more water." She says sternly.* - Sat Dec  5 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Well..? Do you want to go to your house, or the Hungry Ant, Chikyu-Chan? - Sat Dec  5 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Which...ever is fine. - Sat Dec  5 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: We can go to my house, if you'd like. - Sat Dec  5 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Again... all three are nice options. - Sat Dec  5 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Go to me house. - Sat Dec  5 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I expect you all to be dressed in skimpy close and waiting on my desk. - Sat Dec  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I can make some stew for her at my house, let's go then. - Sat Dec  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Shut up Sanoke. - Sat Dec  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Food...sounds good! - Sat Dec  5 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and nods- smiling faintly at Mizora, as she internally curses not being able to get a chance to be alone with Chikyu after making her decision.

"Right- lead the way then, yeah Mizora? I dunno where you live." She says cheerily- as she gently helps ease Chikyu along; an arm around the other girls waist holding her steady- and her other gently patting her stomach to soothe her after her puking incident as she walks along.* - Sat Dec  5 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Follow along. - Sat Dec  5 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) meanwhile, calmly exerts a suprising amount of strength in guiding Chikyu along- as she looks around once inside the house- then immediatly, moves to guide Chikyu down towards the cushions- propping her up, then sitting down next to her room-mate with an arm around the other girls waist still holding her steady.

"Ah.. there. Is this better?"* - Sat Dec  5 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Hm, we are? - Sat Dec  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Akira gave me the key to his house, after Marissa died. - Sat Dec  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that, nodding slightly as she shifts- squeezing Chikyu with a concerned, warm hug before shifting to rub her back gently- unsure why she's doing it, but hoping to soothe the girl.

"Yeah, seems so- me and Chikyu live right across from you and Marissa, mhrm."* - Sat Dec  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) smiles gently- blushing at Chikyu's joke, and letting up on the pressure somewhat, nodding slightly as she shifts from hugging her tight, to just rubbing her back gently. She bows her head as Mizora offers food- speaking gently.

"Ah... thank you kindly.. and- sorry, Chikyu-chan! I jsut got.. a little worried, seeing you pukin out like that.." She admits with a faint smile- before breathing in the smell of the food and sighing happily.

"Ah... smells great!"* - Sat Dec  5 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: So you two are like Kiyoko and Lera? - Sat Dec  5 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: !!!! - Sat Dec  5 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm..? Well, we've been considering dating... planning on it, even- though we've yet to start... but if by that you mean, lesbians? I swing both ways, but seeing as all the good guys in town seem taken? May as well be. - Sat Dec  5 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Uh...huh.. - Sat Dec  5 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: And here I figured Chikyu was still innocent. - Sat Dec  5 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hrm? Oh, I'd say little Chikyu is still quite innocent! I mean, we're interested in each other- that doesn't mean we've /done/ anything... - Sat Dec  5 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: ..Yet. - Sat Dec  5 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: So lewd... - Sat Dec  5 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ..Eh? - Sat Dec  5 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I don't see how I've said anything really outright Lewd, y'know.. - Sat Dec  5 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: So much for my goal of having a forever innocent friend.. - Sat Dec  5 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: All though.. I'lla dmit. - Sat Dec  5 23:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Riiiight... - Sat Dec  5 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Wah-h...don't say that now - Sat Dec  5 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles throatily for some reason, rubbing Chikyu's back gently, then pausing to just let her hand rest holding her close- a faint smile on her face.

"Regardless... Chikyu's right. As of now- nothing's happened.. and besides. You should know that no one stays innocent forever! And I assure you- regardless of /that/ kind of innocence, she's still not any different as of late than usual, from what I've seen." She says with a lazy, warm smile.* - Sat Dec  5 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Mrm... later, then.~ - Sat Dec  5 23:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ITS TRUE! - Sat Dec  5 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly.

"It helps that I sleep in the living room, fully clothed, and never take the robe off anyway, except to shower." She says dryly- a lazy smile on her face. "And to be frank? I have more decency than to peek." She says with a relaxed smile- shrugging.

"We're not lying- but you're free to believe whatever you want- though if you're just teasing poor Chikyu because you know she get's flustered over these kind of thigns easy, for shame!"* - Sat Dec  5 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Gotcha... - Sat Dec  5 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) frowns as she notices this- and sighs.

"You see? You see what you did, Mizora?"* - Sat Dec  5 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: ...Eh... - Sat Dec  5 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Its not...Mizora's fault. I... I just got something in my -*sniff* eye. *she begins eating agian* This...stew is delicious Mizora. - Sat Dec  5 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) pouts at Mizora, narrowing her eyes and sighing.. as she starts to eat.

"...This stew is delicous, tho, yeah."* - Sat Dec  5 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I believe you, okay...? - Sat Dec  5 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly- clearly amused by Chikyu's reaction as she eats a good deal more sedately.* - Sat Dec  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ...So. - Sat Dec  5 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: .....What even where you practicing, Chikyu? - Sat Dec  5 23:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Yeah much! - Sun Dec  6 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Though, a full stomach is making me pretty sleepy. - Sun Dec  6 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah... - Sun Dec  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Well, how about I take you home and you can get some rest, yeah? I've got some studying to do, but... may as well walk you over. - Sun Dec  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Sounds good, lets go then. - Sun Dec  6 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Do you want the rest of the stew - Sun Dec  6 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: ? - Sun Dec  6 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah.. I'm full. How about you, Chikyu? - Sun Dec  6 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Of course! And again, thanks for the food and rest! - Sun Dec  6 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as she rises with Chikyu, keeping an arm around the slightly younger girls waist with a smile as she moves to help support the pot of stew and nods her head.

"Thanks for the hospitality, Mizora- yeah?" She says brightly.* - Sun Dec  6 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Mhm, no rpoblem. - Sun Dec  6 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: See you later, Neighbor! *flashes Mizora a smile* - Sun Dec  6 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly, walking with Chikyu- leaning into the other girl as they head to their shared house.* - Sun Dec  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums calmly as they walk in- leading the way with a warm smile.

"So... you wanted to get some rest, right..? Would... you mind talking, before you go to lay down?" She asks- blushing faintly as she holds Chikyu in her arm- looped around her waist, smiling warmly at the closeness.* - Sun Dec  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she's pulled in close- enjoying it. A low purr rattles in her throat as she looks down at Chikyu- and speaks softly.

"Well... I was thinking. I'm fine with starting to date early- going out... cuddling and stuff... just- taking it slowly, yeah? I don't wanna.. do anything physical, until you're older- but.... I figure.... just going out and stuff- maybe cuddling... that's fine, you know?" She says tentatively- smiling as she wiggles her waist into the arm holding it..!* - Sun Dec  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as Chikyu pulls her closer- letting her hand on her back stay still.. as her other shifts up to stroke Chikyu's bright pink hair gently as she murmurs softly- enjoying the other girls touch against her own pale skin.

She's rough to the touch, rather than soft- hard and solid, all muscle and scar tissue all over her body- but she's warm like fire, as she cradles the younger girl close, nuzzling into her as she murmurs softly.

"...Yeah... all of that.. sound's about right to me... especially that last bit, heh..? Mrm... Anyway... you can't takem e to bed like a teddy bear, you know... tempting as it is to let you pass out like this and curl up on the floor... so how about I carry you to your bed and tuck you in, huh?~"* - Sun Dec  6 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly at that as she rubs Chikyu and holds her close a moment longer- before speaking softly and nodding as Chikyu pulls back.

"Well.. maybe I just wanted a sneak peak of a certain room, neh..? Hah... but- no. I think I'll leave you to put yourself to bed, and get to my studying alone, no? Rest tight, Chikyu-Chan." She says warmly- before turning to glide out of the room..* - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Don't work over work yourself... Well if you do, I'll carry you back and cuddle you to full energy. Just like you did to me. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hah!~ - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That sounds more like encouragement, than a threat.~ - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) walks towards the square, yawning and stretching out- a lazy smile on her face.

"Anyway... how about you, Momura? How you doin?" She inquires with a lazy smile.* - Sun Dec  6 01:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly as she reaches into her robe- and pulls out a small black book. It's quite plain looking- there are no words on the cover, or the binding. It's thick, though- and it seems to be firmly bound, at least.

As Kuro comments, she blithely puts in a comment for Momura's sake.

"Well, spending time with someone you love tends to have that effect- and she has her boyfreind around, no?" She says with a lazy smile as she flips it open- and settles on the early chapters; reading up on incantations and mouthing strange words- speaking none aloud, just practicing the variation and cadence silently; much like how a Ninja might practice handseals.* - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) continues to read- wraping her mind around the pronunciation of words in a strange, strange tongue- and the specific rythms and flow of words. For now, she focuses on the entry on a specific rite and ritual- but she plans for so much more, one day.. humming calmly.

She speaks aloud, as she lets her mind focus on that, and lets herself engage in mindless dialouge.

"So, Kuro, how have you been lately?"* - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've been alright. I feel more connected to the world lately. - Sun Dec  6 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, I guess it's because I've been meditating more often. - Sun Dec  6 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) peers up from her small black grimoire, blinking at Kuro. She pauses- as internally she tries to think on how to prononce 'phtagn' aloud.

"Yeah..? You do that alot, don'tcha..?" She muses aloud- as she looks back down from him, to her book; as she reaches the end of the section she's already made use of- and recycles back up to the top to re-read it rigorously.* - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015

"Hrm..? Something up?" She murmurs quietly.* - Sun Dec  6 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) scratches her head, tucking away the book.

"Ah... care to spar, maybe?" She inquires calmly.* - Sun Dec  6 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Sure. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: L-Let's go. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as she steps into the arena- and speaks calmly with a lazy smile as she speaks aloud towards Momura.

"Give me a moment to get ready, alright?" She says with a lazy smile- as she lifts a hand- and her other reaches to pull her book from her robes. She trusts those she is here with; and so she tests it.

She begins to chant aloud- speaking words straight from the book she is using to learn her trade....

And darkness sworls in the air around her- twisting and writhing as she incants words in a strange, dark tongue. Darkness gathers before her- a vortex of shadow as she chants.

If she is not disturbed- something emerges from the shadowy hole in reality, as it fades away to reveal a stone statue- that crumbles away to reveal the beast it was in edifice of.

It's a monstrous /thing/- a gargoyle of the classical style that emerges forth if she is allowed to finish her chanting; the harsh and guttural words of a twisted tongue emerging from her lips..

As a Demon steps forth- a gargoyle of some kind as it steps forwards and grins evilly.

"Let's see how combat ready my summons are.."* - Sun Dec  6 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods slowly as she steps back and braces...

And then the woman blurs forwards- and obliterates the demon. It tries to move- and it's far from slow; indeed, it's speed is unnatural for it's size as it starts to move.. shifting forwards, tensing to attack her- and then her blow lands to it's jaw and dislocates it's neck...

Before a series of other kicks shatter bones and force it back- before launching it up. It shatters- and soon fades back into darkness as it's defeated...

And then Momura comes at her a moment later.. but if nothing else, the time her summon bought her is valuable. She sighs- as she forms her real sword. It blurs forwards- a crescent of action as she is charged. She's quicker than before- but not by much...

And somethign seems a bit off, compared to earlier fights- as she actually makes an attempt to dodge; and while she only does so partially..

It's to line up a smooth strike with the Nodachi she just conjured into her hands, as it sweeps through the air in a massive blurring crescent towards her foes gut to knock her out of the air mid attack...

But on the other hand, it lashes out blunt back-end first, to avoid possible bisectings.* - Sun Dec  6 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts- as the blade is ripped from her hands by sheer force- and fades from existence as it loses contact with her body and she stops focusing on it. She's launched backwards- it's sudden, abrupt.

The foot plants in her chest- and she staggers backwards. She grunts as she steadies herself after staggering away- and calls her sword back into her hands, summoning it forth as she stares at Momura, coughing briefly.

"Damn... you didn't just got stronger.. am I losing my touch?" She murmurs- frowning as she sways back and forth- grimacing as she smiles faintly.

"Well.. damn.."* - Sun Dec  6 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles as Momura responds by moving to capitalizes on her momentary apparent weakness. She grins faintly as her foe launches towards her... and breathes. As her foe moves to slide...

She brings her blade down to meet her foes handstand.

"Don't get cocky!" She berates the girl- the flashy manuvear buying her a few moments to veer backwards and avoid the initial kick- as her blade expands above her head- and then slams down- exploding with flame as it comes down towards Momura- straight towards her body as she is- this time- holding it the correct way around, having summoned it facing towards her foe instead of away as she steps backwards...

And swings straight down to meet her foe's handstand and kicks with a blow straight to the body, roaring out a Kiai as she does.* - Sun Dec  6 02:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins- as her blade is thrown to the side. Her arms jar as the blade shifts to the side- as she grunts and plants her feet low into the ground.

A fist hammers forwards- as it smashes into her nose; and her nose breaks. It's pushed into her face; as blood sprays from the punch... ANd she pulls her blade back into her foes side- roaring aloud as her nose shatters.

She's staggering back- and she's yet to release the Nodachi's state from the enhanced form, as her arms burn painfully while lifting the currently huge Nodachi...

As it forms a brutal crescent of flames towards Momura's side as her head is knocked back and her nose broken into her face- blood dripping down from her face as she roars in pain after delivering the cut.

As she let's her blade fade, and nods slowly.

"..Ahaa... I suppose.. we should call it.. quits." She says softly- a chuckle escaping her lips as blood smears over her face. She coughs briefly- then laughs aloud- a wild, whooping sound.

"So where you, but hey... who cares?" She says in almost drunk tone. Her nose drips blood and she laughs softly at Kinami.

"And what do I care..? What does that have to do with anything..? Yeah, you're stronger than me- for now- and ain't it great?" She says with a lopsided, almost drunk smile- as if she just had the time of her life.

She hums calmly- as she lifts a hand and begins to incant under her breath; harsh, twisted words that hiss and drip from her lips- the chant dark and almost painful to the ears to those that can hear it..

And as she finishes it- a dark vortex rips the air beside her- pulling itself free and hissing. It's a beast of flesh akin to stone.

It roars- only to be yanked back into the vortex a moment later as she dismisses it, humming calmly.

"Ah... Mrm... still.. okay.." She murmurs as she looks on at the fight.* - Sun Dec  6 03:49:32 2015
