<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles calmly at Chikyu's words, as she draws her Katana and shoulders it- holding it one handed in her left, as her right hangs by her side. There's a gleam in her eyes, as she slightly shifts her feet- and plants herself firmly in the sand, grinning lazily.

"Well.. I suppose I'm ready when you are, yeah?"* - Thu Dec 10 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) squints at how much the other woman is holding back. All she wanted was a spar where the other woman didn't launch into the chakra gates of Hachimon; not a spar where the other woman doesn't even really try. It's almost offensive, really.. as she moves fluidly.

She blurs her Katana into a crescent- timing her movements to strike her foes wrist as her own right hand curls into a fist aimed for her foes gut. She, unlike her foe, isn't really holding back at all...

She's just not phenomonally strong, compared to those around her- as she drives her fist forwards, twisting it towards her foes gut as her blade moves to throw the punch offcourse- a gleam in her eyes.

"Tch.. I know you can do better 'n /that/ without entering the gates."* - Thu Dec 10 23:36:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as her foe staggers back. She too, recognizes the bottle- so she makes it ap riority. As her foe reaches for the bottle, she lurches forwards- chasing her foe's retreat as she flicks the Katana out of the crescent to lunge for the bottle- moving to shatter the bottle of Sake, then thrust her sword through it onwards to her foes chest, as her other hand rears back and curls into a fist- but is not yet thrown.

"Aha! I see..!" She says firmly- a gleam in her eyes- as she grins broadly, gritting her teeth and bracing herself as her right hand hangs low- waiting for her foes reaction, held in reserve to handle whatever is thrown at her next..!* - Thu Dec 10 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grimaces at Kinami's dodge- as the woman then starts to flail from the crouch. It's a disgustingly unpredictable posture- as she has no way of knowing what her foe will do next, as she tenses her body- breathes in and out.....

And flings her Katana full force, point first, for Kinami's center of mass as she leaps back- and waits for the response to that as she lifts her hands after making the fling- intent on gathering her Nodachi; as it begins to form into her hands out of purple energy as she retreats after flinging the Nodachi.* - Thu Dec 10 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as the woman catches the blade out of the air. She grimaces- as her foe makes a show of tripping. It's a good way to avoid the general attack range of her Nodachi as it forms- so she throws herself back and up to avoid low attacks entirely as her foe throws herself downwards.

She swings her blade down- and just barely, it meets the weapon coming towards her ankle. She may not be near as quick in body movements; but her blade moves far faster than any other part of her body, as she slams it down in a crescent- aimed to slide down the side of the Katana, towards her foes arm.

She's grinning as she flows back. Her movements are, apart from the slight leap, minimalist. Efficienct. Calm, succinct. There's a burning gleam in her eyes.

"Hah...." She murmurs- as regardless of her own manuvear... her leg is grazed- leaving a notable cut in her robe and a trickle of blood on the Katana..* - Fri Dec 11 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) idly wonders if she can outlast the womans drunken state. As a career alchoholic, she is well aware- that a lightweight who can get drunk off of just three gulps, will likely not stay inebriated long.. .or just pass out. Either way... She stares as she steps back from the womans sleeping form- and squints.

"This is just wierd.." She complains- before stabbing her blade into the ground- and spreading her arms as she begins to chant. Darkness forms into spears as she incants darkly; twisted words peeling themselves from her lips as she stares at Kinami's sleeping form..

"Kinami, you are so wierd, drunk!" She complains- before she snaps her fingers and rips her sword back up; a barrage of six black spears of shadowy energy throwing themselves one by one towards Kinami.* - Fri Dec 11 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grins. It's not a pretty sight, either- as she crouches in response to the high, launching headbut. She crouches and steps back... sweeping her blade up from the ground in a blurring and flamign crescent- a sudden explosion of movement that throws sand everywhere.

Her attack is launching up straight down the middle of Kinami's body- as a headbut crashes into her gut, and she grunts; bruised badly from taht single blow...

As her blade is coming up beneath Kinami in a blurring, flaming crescent straight down the middle- rather than letting her fall to the ground of her own accord, intercepting her fall with a stroke to the body.

"Hrngh..!"* - Fri Dec 11 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sways back- grunting as her foe seems to endure her second strongest possible attack with no damage or even flinching. She grimaces; realizing that this battle just can't be won by her like this. She sways back- as she is body slammed and knocked down, Her sword fades to shadow as it's knocked out of her hands- and she is left pinned to the ground- grunting. Her entire body aches at this point, and it's clear she's lost...

But she's still struggling- her knee slamming up into her foes crotch again and again, despite her foe being female.* - Fri Dec 11 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sways groggily. She's out of it from sheer pain by the time Kinami is done- her body inert beneath her by the tenth headbut to the chest- her ribs cracking slightly; not breaking.. but certainly damaged- not by any individual strike, but simply by the repititive blows to the same location as her own knees stop shrotly after that point.

By the time Kinami stops, she is inert and in pain- groaning incoherently.* - Fri Dec 11 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) just.. groans. Nothing is audible- just sounds of pain.* - Fri Dec 11 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as she slowly shifts to start sitting upright- and winces. Her ribs hurt, but she's not sure how bad it is at all.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) groans as she rubs her chest, squinting.

"Fuck.. fuck my chest.."* - Fri Dec 11 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Heh. - Fri Dec 11 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly, grunting as she endures- then nods.

"Gotcha.... Hrn.... hey, I don't have any medical supplies so I'm headed to the hospital anyway. Now a good time to resume that thing we where goin at before?" She suggests with a lopsided smile.

Fucking lunatics.* - Fri Dec 11 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly, chuckling softly.

"I'll pick him up after Ig et my bandages on, yeah? Mrm... that's your and Lera's kid, right?" She says warmly, looking on at the child and reaching out to pat the kids head as she stands up- wavering slightly.* - Fri Dec 11 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah, remember I had him a year back? We just kept him in daycare a lot. - Fri Dec 11 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and nods, smiling warmly.

"Yeah, yeah.. I remember.. cute kid."* - Fri Dec 11 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles and walks in- sitting back on the table and looking around, scratching her chin thoughtfully.

"Mrm... So. Last solution lasted about a day- twenty four hours, give or take."* - Fri Dec 11 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) hums peacefully- holding the one year old child and bouncing him gently on her knee. She turns and smiles warmly at Kiyoko, nodding with a bright smile as she shifts to hand the child back- waiting until she is not holding a child anymore to lay down, chuckling faintly.

"Yeah, I'm ready when you are, Doc!"* - Fri Dec 11 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) stretches out and thinks, smiling peacefully at Kiyoko and wincing. Her eyes are dilated- but it lacks the painful, hellish burns of some previous experiments. She tenses for a moment- then nods, laying back down and calming herself.

"Yeah, sure. Hit me up doc."* - Fri Dec 11 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) scratches her head and nods- squinting as best she can with her eyes hyper-dilated.

"I thought we wanted the Iris to get used to the compound..?" She murmurs- sounding confused as she stares at Kiyoko with a gentle smile.* - Fri Dec 11 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah... so. - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Guess.. come back tommorow, yeah? - Fri Dec 11 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... - Fri Dec 11 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) heads out- humming calmly as she dons her amber-tinted sunglasses. She spends a day or so- working out, eating, resting....

And then returns the next day, no shades on- hands in her pockets, robes mended, bandages still around her ribs.

"MRm.. Yo, Kiyoko-chan. How you doin?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) chuckles softly. As Kiyoko is finishing the mixture, the necromancer walks over to the playpen and reaches in to pat Hoseki on the head.

"Yo, aunty's back, little squirt.. Heh, adorable as ever." She says warmly- ruffling the baby's likely tiny hair, before stepping back to sit on the table and stretch. As Kiyoko walks up, she gives her a brief hug, before leaning back and grinning.

"Not a problem, doc. Not a problem 'tall. Mmm.."* - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) nods calmly- agreeing before laying back and relaxing.

"Yeah, works fine for me, Doc. Whatever you think works." She says peacefully- as she relaxes back. "Even me out." She says almost jokingly- before once more slipping into a meditive calm state..

She allows Kiyoko to work- calmly accepting the series of droplets into her eyes.. and breathing in, and out.

"Stings a little, like usual... seems to be normal dilation."* - Fri Dec 11 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) sways after the second treatment. A low groan escapes her as she moves to sit upright- then lays down and closes her eyes, wincing.

"Ugh... sure as fuck dilated, but... fuckk, my head.. everything is bright, way too bright.." She murmurs, rubbing her forehead between her eyes. It's painful- a spitting headache.

"Fuck.. got any painkillers on you?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Shit... - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) knocks back the cup and the pills- then sighs as she opens her eyes and looks around.

"Ah... a bit better.... sorry. Guess I'll just.. rest for a while until it wears of, tell you how long that took..?" She says- chuckling faintly. "Guess I'll find a lair to sulk in for a bit, nice and dark, neh?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Guess that means you don't want to continue for now huh? - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'm game, yeah.... if you are, anyway. - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I figured since it did work, we'd be doin the usual wait a while thing- but I'm game to just keep going.. head hurts, but.. - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That can't really get much worse, neh? - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you okay with me doing the left eye then? I don't want to irritate the right eye. - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure. - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) lays back down and sighs gently.* - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) leans back and lets it all happen. The dilation is, then, gradual. The first few drops- slight... then more- moderate.. and finally; all the way... and as she opens her eyes, she blinks a few times.

"Ah... funny. Just about evened out perfectly.. though, that didn't make my headache any worse, thankfully." She says- chuckling softly from the ground.

"Some mix of all those ones you just used, maybe..?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe, there were a few that worked really well.. Seems the more natural compounts that are plant related work the best. - Fri Dec 11 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Go rest up, and we will be starting a new form of treatment soon. - Fri Dec 11 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Whatever you say, Doc.  - Fri Dec 11 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) dons her shades and heads out, humming peacefully, hands inside her robes.

"Mrm.."* - Fri Dec 11 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Have a good one! - Fri Dec 11 03:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) waves. She's wearing Amber tinted shades, and smiling in a lax fashion.

"Sup?"* - Fri Dec 11 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) calmly approaches, sword drawn as she looks on. She squints for a moment at the bizzare duo of men- then speaks in a deceptively cheerful tone as she lifts her blade; honestly /overjoyed/ at a prison break, and clearly unintimidated.

"Ahhh.. I see. So..! Someone has a deathwish!~ Oh, but I really cannot /wait/..!" She says cheerfully as she stands there- a gleam in her eyes. "Now, here's the dealio, Gentlemen! You eitehr head right the fuck back into your cells, sit the fuck down, and accept extended sentences..~" She says- a gleam in those violet eyes as she steps forwards.

"Orrrr... you die, and your souls know no rest for all eternity, screaming forever in the darkest depths of hell, mmrrrmkayyy?~ So tell me!" She says brightly.

"We gonna do this the easy way... or the hard way? The choice... is yours."* - Fri Dec 11 23:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) grunts as the one man lunges straight towards her. She shifts back slightly, and then... grins, as Izanami cuts through all the hair. Her eyes gleam as the clones lunge in- and she moves forwards. Her blade blurs in her hand- her left handed stroke starting to her left- then sweeping through to her right in a flowing, brutal motion.

Her blade moves fluidly- carving through the clones and dispersing them in a wave of destruction- a gleam in her eyes as others begin to deal with the hulk...

And she turns to grin at the Booty Warrior.

"Seems you've chosen.. the hard way." She states calmly, as she steps through the cloud of smoke launched by her blade dispersing the clones... a murderous gleam in her eyes as she starts to laugh happily.

"Come on then! Let's go!"* - Sat Dec 12 00:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) frowns as her foe commits suicide in a dissapointing fashion- the explosion from the tags somehow managing to tear the mans body apart- showing a pathetic physiology. She seems.. dissapointed, as she steps back- completely unharmed by the pathetically weak explosions that, as far as she is concerned, are akin to firecrackers.

Smoke flows around her as she steps back, feeling... cheated, as she grumbles and sways back.

"Disgusting cowardice.. pussed out like a Bitch."* - Sat Dec 12 00:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) steps in as the man staggers in pain. He's nearly defeated by that strike- the many palms of Mizora striking true into the mans body. She drops her Katana as he charges, and lifts her hands.

As he staggers, she conjures her blade; a vortex of shadow rippling into her hands...

And then she brings the blade crashing forwards- stepping in between the mans charge and Hiroshi... bracing her blade.. and expanding it as she thrusts it forwards towards his eyes as he charges into Hiroshi- staggered and slowed by his weakened chakra due to Mizora's attack...

She simply steps in, expands her blade- and thrusts it for his eyes, which should logically be a weak point on the mans otherwise insanely durable body, to attempt to pierce through his eye socket to end this and stop his charge towards Hiroshi.

A lesser woman might have aimed for his groin- but she's aware that his dick is probably the most durable part of his body.* - Sat Dec 12 01:12:54 2015
