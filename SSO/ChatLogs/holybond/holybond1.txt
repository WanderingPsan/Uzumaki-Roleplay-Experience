<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) watches what looks to be a fight. "Hrm...I wonder who will win this..."He'd be thinking to himself as he was starting to put his beats on the girl.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) got into her boxing stance, closing her eyes and reopening them, revealing her azure blue doujutsu. Keeping a steady gaze at Momo, she awaits him to make the first move, since it was something she never did. "I am ready."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) looked at the girl as he saw the eyes change colors. "Interesting..." he thought as he did one handseal infront of his face. Next thing you know, the water would begin to give off a heavy fog, making everything hard to see. "Keep your eye on the birdy!" he yelled as he began to form the rat seal. He would then channel his chakra into the air, thinking. "Wind style : Divine wind!" This wind would quickly rise from under the girl, attempting to cover her entire body with a tornado, cutting her up pretty badly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) activates his technique blowing the mist away.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) kept her eyes fixed on Momo as he did his seals for hidden mist jutsu. Since she had already knew this technique, she was already familair with how people faught within the mist. Her eyes granted her slight ability to see Momo within the mist, reaching into her holster and throwing three shuriken in the direction that he was still standing before he was able to do his wind jutsu. Forming a few hands seal while in the mist, she murmers, "Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu." Multiple fog clones were created from the properties of the mist, and since Momo was clearly not able to see Luna in the mist, he would not know which one was the real Luna.*
