<br><font color=yellow>*Maunten, Suchiru(Kaguro2) turned his attention towards the shinobi before him. Suchiru stood at six-foot-three, a massive man with a body to match his arrogance. Clad in commoners robes and a set of leather armor, along with a massive scythe that hung from his back. He didn't plan on giving them a chance to come up with a strategy, as he was already weaving through a set of seals.

A clone erupted into view to his right, rushing forward swiftly while drawing to scythe in order to tear into Yan. The man was big, but he also carried a considerable amount of speed, parring, if not surpassing, ordinary jonin-level shinobi. The scythe came diagonally: aiming to breach the armor.* - Wed Sep 30 03:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: He's scoping us out, looking to how we react. Don't show too much of your technique yet. - Wed Sep 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maunten, Suchiru(Kaguro2) hidden within one of the run-down buildings, Suchiru watched as Yan took immobolized the clone, only for it to be swept away in the mud. He'd been prepared for this, however, knowing the shinobi would eventually come. Some citizens lives may be lost, but his cause was just, and he would do anything to make his name known.

"Die!" Suchiru growled, performing the snake seal. Several explosives he'd set up all across the village and road ways, including around the shinobi, began to detonate. Only those within feet of an explosive would actually have to deal with the damage, while others would simply be buffeted by smoke and debris. Within seconds the entire village was up in smokes, and the fog prevented most eyesight. (1-4 safe, 5-6 near explosive.)

He made the same seals as before, conjuring three clones of himself, enough for each shinobi. Each clone leapt out of a whole in the roof of the building, then went off to different corners of the village to await the shinobi's reaction. Each weaved a set of seals, associated with the 'fire style'. Suchiru leapt onto the roof and remained waiting. He had already chosen his opponent.* - Wed Sep 30 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The original is the middle building blocked by the congestion of the townfolk. There he can command his clones and watch closely those who enter the village. He's using the townfolk as shields. - Wed Sep 30 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maunten, Suchiru(Kaguro2) "Fire Styl: Dragon Flame Bomb!" 

Each clone enhaled, then released a massive torrent of flames that took the shape of a raging dragon. Using this technique, the clones would overpower Yan's doton ninjutsu and attempt to destroy the clones as well. 

The original however performed a single handseal from on top of the building, and disappeared. His body was a flicker, and he was gone with the wind.* - Wed Sep 30 04:51:24 2015
