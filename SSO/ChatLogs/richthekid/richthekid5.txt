<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he walked up seeing Marrisa. He'd simply wave with a slight smirk upon his face.

"Yo! I'm here testing the private exams, hope I can get through."* - Sat Oct 31 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) would've noticed the tense aura coming from Marrisa as soon as entered. Once that fan was swung, his feet changed to the left direction as he kicked off the ground swiftly activating his shunshin ability using flames to cloak the direction he was going, and due to the flames of the jutsu coming his way he'd possibly cover Marrisa's sight from him. He knew that he had to escape the range of the technique due to the previous fight with her-- and for some reason, the flames seemed even brighter. He attempted to gain the largest distance away from her as possible, Angetsu didn't even near her strength all together.

"No chill." He'd mumble to himself silently, afraid to give his position away. He was focused on Marrisa, if she was damaged before he'd stall until she gave in.* - Sat Oct 31 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) felt his legs get captured by the technique, this was ridiculous-- not warning, no chill, I swear she claimed him as her student. As soon as he reached the other side, he felt himself let out a muffled scream in pain. However he hadn't escaped just yet, once again a blast of wind was sent towards him-- this time he was too in pain to even realize she used the technique, once again he was hit by the pressure and blunt force of the technique and thus was sent flying through the wall, his armor being shattered to pieces.

"Shit, I need to activate that Lean Fist if I want to win-- need to roll a quick blunt." He'd think to himself trying to reach into his holster and pull out the care package. Inwardly he cried noticing he didn't bring a grinder with him, he'd have to pick them apart himself.* - Sat Oct 31 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) // 'One time student' my ass. As soon as reached the que in his pocket, another gust of wind however this one having the same feeling as the technique she used before. He was knocked back getting slashed by countless of chakra infused wind particles unable to do anything, due to the speed of the technique.

"No fucking chill." He thought. 'Kill him quickly' face ass, nigga couldnt get a kunai and slit his throught or some shit.* - Sat Oct 31 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) plays dead.* - Sat Oct 31 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) had stopped rolling from the previous attack, his body was completely aching and he couldn't even feel his own crimson liquid trickle down from the numerous cuts and bruises upon his body. He was laying down flat, eyes slightly closed and staring-- gazing at the sky. If anyone was paying to his facial expression, they'd not that he didn't seem to have any pain, any hatred neither regret he just stared at the sky as if he was a new-born baby staring at it's mother. 

"The world, so many flaws . . . Even though I noticed this at an early age, I looked passed it . ."

Angetsu wasn't physically speaking, neither was he mentally thinking. It was as if someone was speaking to him as the perspective of a younger version of himself, it slightly amazed him yet he expected it-- he knew he was going to die and he could feel the cold breath of the Shinigami near him preparing to take him away. 

The kunai that was launched towards him hit the ground besides him, the explosive tag visible from the corner of his eye. At a point, he wanted it all to end but time was moving extra slow for a reason unknown, was Kami giving him a chance to say his good byes? No it wasn't possible. His lips curved into a weak smile, if he was moving onto a better place why should he remain sad. 

The explosive tag was set off, engulfing Angetsa in a death trap. He heard people say once, that when you die the darkness would take you away-- but it wasn't correct. He infact was taken away by a bright light.

This technique can be used as a blanket term for the majority of Nero's techniques. His chakra is used to amplify the sound waves from arm movements to attack his opponent. By generating enough sound, Nero can use this to redirect the waves in mid-air to his intended target. By damaging the victim's inner ear, the victim's inner ear, the victim is rendered off-balance and nauseous. By sending the sound-waves through a solid object, this technique can be used to destroy it.* - Wed Nov  4 15:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nero(Rich The Kid) released a sigh as he was currently locked away in his prison cell. He had his back against the wall opposite to the door in a seating position, on leg on the floor while the other had his knee up supported by his foot flat on the floor. His arm was rested upon his thigh inwhich made it seem as though in a comfortable position. Nero's ear twitch hearing the birds from the outside, it immediately made his lips curve into a slight smirk.

"I can hear it . . The time I'll see light is soon . ." He'd say, not caring if the guards were around.

His grin widened revealing his shiny and sharp teeth. The shinobi guarding his prison cell looking in suspiciously, after all Nero said multiple things that confused the guards on rare occassions however he stated nothing about breaking out. With this infact in his head, the guard tensed up, the prisoner's smirk almost striking into his soul as if he could hear the guard's very heartbeat itself.

"Tch . . It's almost time. So who will it be . .?"

His questions were rhetorical, not meant to be answered by anyone. His one open eye averted it's gaze towards the ceiling, as his grin straigtened up. His ear twitched once more as an explosion rang from the outside, it was definently time.
