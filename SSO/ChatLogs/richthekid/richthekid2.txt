<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) remained silent for several seconds before taking a few steps backwards and raising his hands up. He shifted his stance slightly to the right and made his legs shoulder-width apart. 

"A riddle to be solved another day . . Let the training begin." He'd state. * - Sat Oct 10 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes at the chakra infused oxygen that was exhaled for the man's lungs in the form of flames, he thought nothing of the technique already knowing that it was dodgable. Swiftly, he kicked off the ground dashing to his left and around the fireball aiming to get close to his opponent. While he did this, he performed a couple of handseals-- using the fireball cloak the seals made before he appeared by the side. If he successfully closed the long distance between them, he'd thrust his hand forward sending forth chakra in the form of wind. The streams attempting to impact into the boy and send him back into the mountain causing extra damage, SnJ style tactics-- wall damage my nigga.* - Sat Oct 10 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) was ambushed by attacks and both sides, it was clear that the boy was no amateur at fighting however neither was Angetsu. Swiftly he reacted cancelling the current technique he was using and kicked off the ground activating his shunshin technique. In the eyes of those attacking him, it'd seem that he'd disappear in flames however it was to conceal his movements. Angetsu would reappear above the clone, while drawing forth one of his blades. As he fell, he attempted to make a swift slash upon the clone before he reached the ground. 

If this was successful, Angetsu would proceed in placing the blade back into his sheathe and proceed in getting into his fighting stance once again. He was prepared to get close to his opponent after his reaction.* - Sat Oct 10 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) was caught successfully by the spikes and it was clear that his opponent wasn't going to wait until he followed up, and due to this he decided to react swiftly. His feet was suddenly claoked in two balls of flames as his eyes radiated a sense of determination within them. He attempted to use his strength and emit the flames forth as a repellant force almost to launch himself out of the spikes, he exerted his chakra more so that he could glide through the air backwards for more time-- soon performing a backflip to land himself. His eyes shifted in the direction of Ortho noticing the lightning coming his way, and almost immediately he attempted to go through a range of handseals and slam his hands on the floor.

If he was successful in reaching the end of the handseals before the technique reached him, a barrier of wind emitted from within coming into contract with the eletricity-based attack and would seperate the electrical charges. However if he didn't reach there in time, which was probably the case, he'd instead place his arms in and X-Formation to take the damage of the raiton, yet it didn't do much as he was electrocuted. * - Sat Oct 10 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) || The battle between Ortho and Angetsu was indeed getting tense. It was clear that Angetsu was beginning to tire out. As their techniques clashed, he noticed that Ortho would have the upper-hand even if he had better elemental contol with his technique. His eyes narrowed forth noticing the earth flash coming his way with speed and immediately activated his shunshin, disappearing in flames and reappearing exactly infront of the new comer girl.

"Get back."

He'd simply warn her in a mere mumble, he'd use the fact that his position was unknown to his advantage. He still had some movement left within him, swiftly he kicked off the ground propelling his body into the air where Ortho's real body was-- of course due to there being two, he didn't know which was which so he went for the one being closest. He launched his feet outwards similar to a drop kick attempting to collide with him and send him into the clone.* - Sat Oct 10 23:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) winced as he also had only a little time to react to the surprise attack that was launched towards him, swiftly attempting to raise his hands up into an X-Formation however he didn't have enough reaction-- well he did, but seeing as Ortho took a hit he decided he should also take a hit. The blunt force of the liquid impacted into him sending him backwards and causing him to smash into the ground. As he collided into the ground, dust was forced into the air clouding Angetsu's visibility for only a few seconds before dispersing. 

". . . Interesting . . ."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he swiftly got to his feet, he wasn't exactly that tired he came across to be. Swiftly he attempted to perform a backflip kick, as he did this flames cloaked around his feet increasing the strength of the kick-- his aim was to connect it under the chin of Ortho's clone. He exerted the flames to distance his way behind Ortho before landing.
