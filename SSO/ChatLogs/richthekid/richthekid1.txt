<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) didn't waste a split second in reacting once the name flew into his ear. Swiftly, to one's normal eye sight it'd seem that Niklaus disappeared or infact moved in such a quick blur. He closed the distance between himself and the foolish blonde in but a mere few seconds. Once he reached her, his hands shot forth attempting to grasp a firm hold around her neck and lift her upwards ignoring any squirms that she made had acted out of reflex on.

His lips curved into a small smile of amusement as his gaze met her own.

"Oh.. Yes, do repeat that. I'm sure you have something absolutely hilarious to say when your throat is crushed."* - Tue Sep 01 18:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) 's grip around her throat eventually loosened allowing her to fall freely onto the ground. He proceeded in taking a step backwards away from the fallen blonde consulting with hiimself whether to launch his foot into her face or simply gouge out an eye. With much thinking he decided to go with the hidden third choice and not do anything at all, he grew fond of the girl and he'd rather not make an enemy out of her.

"Moving on."* - Tue Sep 01 19:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) leaned back on the chair and placed his feet ontop of the table.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) passes the other weapon.* - Sun Sep 06 16:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) was leaning on the edge of a coffin, much to a nice design clearly old. He had his arms crossed looking ahead with an amused expression. Behind him was several more coffins specifically counting up to six all together. Besides Niklaus sat his dog, Hayley which held an annoyed expression upon her face continuously growling and barking lowly towards her owner however it was simply ignored.

His eyes narrowed further as he noticed Orakuru begin to approach and at this point Niklaus would reach into his holster and pull out a dagger, it seemed he had no hostile intentions yet. As he glanced towards the dagger, he'd hold it up towards the boy.

"This is, what I call, a Mikaelson's dagger. There are only six of them in the world, crafted by a certain white oak tree that was burnt down before my clan was mercilessly slaughtered by Kumogakure themselves. However, funnily enough my family survived. We made a pledge, 'Always and Forever' meaning through whatever trials that we were to face in the future, we move together. Ironic really, our family relations all began breaking apart starting with are dearest mother."

He motioned to the one coffin that stood out, the designs being extraordinary. Carvings all over the wooden structure.

"I placed a dagger in that very heart of hers. Then came my brother Finn, he was a mother's boy and so when he heard of her death he tried to kill me-- unfortunate for him I was stronger even if he was the eldest and so he was blessed with a dagger. Mystic was suppose to be next, but he ran away just in time-- clever boy so I have an empty coffin for him. My sweetest and beloved sister, Yumiko is in there.. She was a fiesty one indeed, always about romance and love... Though there was never someone great enough to fit her in my eyes.. I had mercilessly killed them all. It came to a point where she tried to leave my side.. Leave forever and break the pact..... It was clear she was fit for the third one. And then there is the noble Daiki.. He always put family first.. After hearing of my deeds, he turned against me which led to the fate of the others.. The dagger. My father's death? Not needed to speak about, I wasn't a fan of stabbing him with a dagger but I still did anyway."

He motioned to each respectful coffin as he called out the names of his family. And then his eyes descended upon the dagger within his hand.

"You see, I travel everywhere with my family for the reason my family remains together forever."* - Sun Sep 06 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes, he could understand that Orakuru wasn't joking about his statement and with such reassurance came his ability. It caused his face to become serious, he often pondered who was worthy enough to kill him. A chuckle soon escaped his lips as he tossed the dagger over towards Orakuru so that the boy could catch it. Once he did so, he told his dog to return to Niza's side and remain there for his return which she complied to with much hesitation.

"If you are -able- to kill me, I wish for that dagger pierced into my chest reaching my heart. Call it a traditional thing if you may, also-- my family remain together. If you are -able- to kill me, when I am moved my family follow." He stated as his eyes began to shift pitch black as well as his iris now glowing a golden color, he was prepared to fight Orakuru.* - Sun Sep 06 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) stopped his emoness as he was starting to sound like Hiru, even if it was by the slightest-- he decided to enjoy himself in battle like he usually did, what made his boy think he could defeat him in the first place. Shifting his gaze upon the golem that arose due to the summoning contract, Niklaus went into deep thoughts feeling the warmth of the flames. It came into contact with the air increasing the temperature of the air and clearly his senses was telling him to avoid coming into contact with such a beast. 

"Guess I shouldn't have sent the little wolf back, ah well.."

Kicking forth, he expected that the Golem didn't have much reflexes as such. The bigger they are the harder the fall the saying goes. Swiftly, Niklaus began spinning rapidly in attempt to bypass around to Golem entering his Tsuuga state and attempt to strik at Orakuru. Just as he propelled himself forth, he reached into his holster and placed two explosive tags upon his feet as a preparation for something.* - Sun Sep 06 17:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) spun out of his Tsuga as he took noticed of the ball of flames coming before him. His surroundings were clearly a forest and it would give the boy an advantage if the forest was set ablaze, at this Niklaus rolled his eyes-- advantages or not he wasn't giving it. As he landed on the grass, he didn't waste a split second in tilting his body forward and pushing off once again. This time he applied a little chakra to his feet as a repellant force thus giving him a further push off and acceleration.

"I'm certain he's not faster than I."

He spun once again rapidly turning his appearance into some sort of tornado if you'd like. He was attempting to close the distance between him and Orakuru so that he'd catch the boy in his Tsuga and hopefully shred him to pieces. Time was ticking.* - Sun Sep 06 18:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes at the time clicked a two minutes, it seemed the last minute had arrived and it was either Ora died or Niklaus himself-- it would be exceptionally easier if Hayley was here but beggers couldn't be choosers. Niklaus shifted his gaze ahead, it was time to pull out the ultimate weapon within his bag-- his final stand. Both balls of flames came towards him as he once again spun out of his Tsuga, eyes shifting left and right noticing the positioning of the projectiles. Swiftly he attempted to intercept and move north east diagonally, it all came down for speed for Niklaus.

"It's been a pleasure."

Niklaus performed a single seal allowing the explosive tags upon his feet to explode giving him an amazing boost in speed, it did damage his feet however nothing that could be ignored. Once again, he went for the third Tsuga of the day-- you know what they say, third time is a charm. Swiftly he spun rapidly with the increase in speed, if Orakuru was able to dodge this one the boy would truly be amazing. * - Sun Sep 06 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mikaelson, Niklaus(Rich The Kid) was continuing his onslaught upon Orakuru until suddenly the boy disappeared from his view, even with his heightened perception to see the movement people made the boy completely disappeared. It was not until several seconds later till Niklaus pinpointed the location of the whire haired-- however at that point it was utterly too late. In a swift motion, the blade impaled into his back and successfully reached his spine thus rendering any movement from him unavaible. He was forced out of his Tsuga and fell hitting the grass with a thud.

"The empty... Coffin... Is for me..."

Niklaus let out a chuckle, he wasn't going to waste anymore words. He lost unfair and rectangular, if Hayley was with him he would've pwnt this nigga. With that Niklaus was at a peace of mind, he couldn't find at his best without his partner-- so truly his death remained an undefeated death, fuck y'all. Now all that awaits is that dagger in his heart 'yo.* - Sun Sep 06 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) crossed his arms as he made his way forth, his pupiless eyes narrowing ahead at the lack of shinobi within the village.

"The war has started, I suppose assistance wouldn't be needed." He stated coldly under his mask.* - Sun Sep 06 21:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) simply turned around and made his way out of the village.* - Sun Sep 06 21:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) stayed seated upon the branch, eyes narrowing ahead.* - Sun Sep 06 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) approached the gates of Konohagakure, his hood shadowing his face as well as the mask that covered the lower half. His build was muscular, arm bands strapped around either wrists with crafted weapons seemingly kunais attached upon them connected by chains.* - Sun Sep 06 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) shifted his gaze forth as he took a couple of steps forward, clearly holding no fear.

"Why with Zetsumo when he will soon crumble? Join me and we will have vengeance on those who dare hurt our family." 

His fists tightly clenched as her stared at the two. He'd rather those who had skill not sacrifice their life for someone who was half dead already, he specificaly shifted his gaze towards Sabo. If he was able to persuade one of them, that was good enough for him.* - Sun Sep 06 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) didn't hold an amuse look on his face, rather he'd take a single step backwards and get into a battle stance. His eyes slightly narrowed forth until hearing the approach of others, he didn't dare shift his gaze away however from the corner of his eye he spotted an army. Due to the colors and vest they were wearing it was clear that the shinobi was from Kumogakure, meaning that they were an ally force to him-- he was prepared to take the two out by himself though it'd be much swifter with reinforcements.

"I won't ask you again, join me or die."* - Sun Sep 06 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) had noticed the reinforcements for Konohagakure come however it was only one man. The man's speed was nontheless amazing yet nothing that was foreseen. His hood further hid his emotionless expression as he stood his ground, he didn't dare move as the many clones seemed to appear from the ground somewhat-- yet Angetsu did not fear. He'd simply stare at the new comer, his right fist slightly clenching.* - Sun Sep 06 23:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) notes how he's immune to flames.* - Sun Sep 06 23:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) entered through the gates of Kumogakure ignoring the guards that had spoken to him to state his purpose for entering. He made his way to the tall mountain structure that stabalized the mansion on top. His features were muscular, it was clear that he had been working out, however what stood out the most was that he had absolutely no pupils neither iris, this lead people to believe that he was blind. The hood over his head successfully shadowed his face as well as the golden mask covering the lower half.

As he approached the two, he made no sound as his business wasn't with genin. He'd simply make his way to the mansion.* - Mon Sep 07 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) spared an emotionless glancee towards the green-haired for a split second before his attention returned to it's original place-- upon the mansion. He completely had ignored the boy's existance for the sole purpose of having nothing to do with him. His fists clenched tightly as the chains attached upon his arm bands began to make a clanking noise. The blacksmith for the man was certainly skilled, it seemed to be somewhat of an kunai ejecter.* - Mon Sep 07 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) walked up to the assumed Raikage.* - Mon Sep 07 12:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) placed his fist gently against his open palm and knealt in a respectful manner.

"What is my first mission?"* - Mon Sep 07 12:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Do you have any fire techniques you can teach me, any scrolls? - Mon Sep 07 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) whispers: I do not. - Mon Sep 07 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: I know you got some damn techniques nigga. (omit) - Mon Sep 07 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: How about any taijutsu techniques I can learn. - Mon Sep 07 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) settled his gaze ahead at the group of shinobi as he approached.* - Mon Sep 07 16:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) held no headband, however he wore a golden mask that covered the lower half of his face and a hood that casted a shadow over his eyes.

"I am looking for the Mizukage, I am not here to be questioned."* - Mon Sep 07 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes towards Tethys and nodded.* - Mon Sep 07 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) seemed to tense up at the title.

"I've found him." He thought to himself.* - Mon Sep 07 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) shrugged.* - Mon Sep 07 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he approached the beachside and within reach of the famous 'Black Blade Tethys'. He clenched his fist tightly, he was only a few steps closer to vengeance. 

"I was formerly a assassin from a small settlement outside the land of iron. I was paid to kill and bring the heads of those that were upon my hit list, however all things must come to an end. My village along with my clan was slaughtered by the tyrant you were speaking about, the one known as Zetsumo. I was also slaughtered by him, however I was given a second chance in life. I was resurrected by an unknown sorceror to allow me the chance to obtain my revenge. However grateful I am to him, I was revived in this body before my prime and so with the skill I currently have I am unable to defeat Zetsumo. Due to this reason, I wish to align myself with Kirigakure but foremost with you, Tethys. I believe with you I can obtain my revenge."* - Mon Sep 07 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) turned to face the white haired as he spoke, it caused him to remember the rumors and stories that he heard upon his travels about him-- he was exactly the one comrade he needed in this world of mess. Angetsu gave a nod of understanding and shifted his gaze ahead at the sea. Once he was revived from hell, he obtained a certain power yet ever since he did-- him and water didn't mix however as he spoke to Tethys he saw the awkwardness between them disappear.

"What was the aftermath of the war." * - Mon Sep 07 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) crossed his arms and displayed a sense of seriousness, the hood lowering further down and thus causing the shadow that was casted over his face to darken. He exhaled through his mask that covered the lower half of his face, he could almost hear the sound of victory.

"I inparticular don't have an army to go into battle with, even so I'll slay Zetsumo with my own two hands risen from hell itself." As he spoke, he raised his right hand in front of his chest and tensed up. He clenched his fist and suddenly it seemed as though his eyes combusted into flames as smoke was released from his mask. It only held this way for a couple of seconds until it soon disappeared as his eyes returned to normal.

"You wouldn't happen to have any fuuton techniques?"* - Mon Sep 07 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) expression remained the same.

"Is it possible for you to hand me the scrolls for me to learn?"* - Mon Sep 07 18:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) took both scrolls under his wing and gave a curt nod towards Tethys. 

"Appreciated."* - Mon Sep 07 18:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) decided. to. open. the. first. scroll. wind. lance.* - Mon Sep 07 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he took a look at the first scroll being wind lancer. He had opened it up and began reading the contents of the jutsu scroll. The first section he came across was the handseals of course, the technique couldn't be performed unless the man didn't know the seals for the jutsu. He wasn't paying full attention to Tethys however it would be rude enough to not show him a slight peak of interest. As the white haired was silent, he'd simply continue reading the scroll.* - Mon Sep 07 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) swiftly kicked forward as he began escaping the grasp of the shinobi chasing him. He reached into his holster and took out the scroll before unrolling it and viewing the contents of the technique. He decided it would be best if he was to learn the technique before someone stole it from him and such. His eyes scanned through the Wind Lancer techniques, reading each and every detail including the handseals of the technique.

"Hazo Family Secret Technique?"

Ketsueki mumbled as he landed on the grass, as they finally had lost sight of him-- fortunately his speed was something people shouldn't mess around him. He began walking through the forest until he found a perfect spot to take a seat against a tree. Once he did so, he went back to reading the contents of the scroll once again learning the handseals needed.

He performed a multitude of handseals for the technique corectly, first he did it as slowly as possible as if attempting to burn it into his mind. After doing so, he practiced performing handseals at a faster speed-- of course once he learnt to memorize the handseals and perform them consectively he could move on to further using his chakra to perform it.* - Tue Sep 08 09:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Keep my existence a secret, Tethys. - Tue Sep 08 13:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) motioned towards the skull infront of his feet.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he stood a distance away from Tethys. He knew how strong the white haired was and how much he was at a disadvantage, however he didn't fear. He outstretched his fists and placed his legs shoulders-width apart getting into a stance. It was a stance of one who knew his taijutsu as it was clear by how his hands were moving in a circular motion, Ketsueki's eyes soon scowled into Tethys' own.

"Vengeance will be mine."

As he spoke, his mask projected the voice causing it to hide the real one-- making it upto impossible to know his real voice.* - Sat Sep 12 16:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) wasn't perplexed at the slightest as Tethys maintained a casual posture, he believed that the white haired wasn't brought up to having specific taijutsu stances like others. He was use to seeing such, however him being in a stance gave him an advantage-- especially one that was meant for close ranged attacks. It was about time for one of them to make their move.

The assassin was going to make the first move however it seemed how Tethys had beat him to it, closing the distance at extreme speeds. In this case, Angetsu decided to change his attack plan into more of a defensive-counter, shifting his stance a little however at the speed Tethys was coming he was not able to complete it. As the kick came his way, Ketsueki leaned back attempting to escape the range of the attack.

If this was successful, he'd fall backwards placing both hands on the grass behind him. Once he did so, he'd propell both feet upwards attempting to collide them into Tethys's chin and send him airborne.* - Sat Sep 12 17:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as the boy began to move. Ketsueki was completely emotionless however he wasn't going to allow the boy to get away and escape from his grasp. He leant his body forward and kicked off with an extroadinary speed, closing the distance between himself and Keyshawn in a mere moment. His feet stuck out forth attempting to trip the boy up so that he'd fall forward, however Ketsueki wasn't to stop then. As the boy was falling, his hand launched forward grasping the back of the boy's head and slamming it onto the concrete.* - Mon Sep 14 10:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as the boy twisted his body swiftly. It was clear that the boy had reflex however Ketsueki had reflexes above average. As the fist came his way, he'd simply shift his body to the side avoding the fist while pressing off his right foot. This way he'd leap to the left even if it was by the slightest, noticing the boy being full of openings-- it was time to end this.

Ketsueki said nothing more, instead released a small exhale while launching his hands forward to grasp either side of his fist while Keyshawn was still off balance from the fist-- giving him the slight upperhand. If this was successful, he'd pull the boy's head down while extending his knee upwards causing them to collide with one another, the knee colliding into his forehead. As soon as it connected Ketsueki released the side of the boy's head in succession that he'd be launched upwards into the air and stunned due to the hit.

He'd proceed in further outstretching both of his hands while coursing chakra to the kunais he had concealed within his armbands thus propelling them forward attached to chains also. If the kunais were successfully able to come into contact with the boy's head and chest, they'd imaple in. "Come here." He'd mumble under his breath, pulling on the chains which were connected to the kunais. This successfully forced the boy to be yanked towards the ground and possibly colliding with a big impact.* - Mon Sep 14 10:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) says: "Come here." He'd mumble under his breath, pulling on the chains which were connected to the kunais. <<< what is life RN - Mon Sep 14 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) narrowed his eyes as he retracted both kunais back under his armband sleeves. As the boy spoke, he'd simply stare at him with an emotionless expression taking a single step backwards. Seeing as it was going to be the end for the child, he'd give him his wish.

"The Raikage."

As he spoke he launched his right hand forward propelling the kunai at an extroadinary speed having it pierce the very place it did before, which would cause it to go in even further. Swiftly, Ketsueki wrapped the chain around his wrist and tightly grasped onto the chain before yanking with extroadinary speed and strength. He attempted to use the preset-up as an advantage to rip off the boy's head from his shoulders. If successful, he'd launch it over at the tree retracting the chained kunai at the last second before reaching into his holster and pulling out an unchained kunai.

He'd swiftly launch it again at the very same place having it pierce straight through his skull and onto the trunk His head would be stuck to the trunk for all those to see.* - Mon Sep 14 11:31:24 2015

He knew the exact faces of those then were in Zetsumo's platoon and so he knew those in Konohagakure was also apart of it.

Angetsu's eyes began to flare in rage, performing a couple of handseals before slamming his hand onto the ground. As he did this a simple barrier of wind projected outwards from him aiming to knock the tree down but unfortunately it wasn't strong enough. His gaze shifted to the side slightly in complete and utter annoyance.

"Zetsumo, I'll come for your group."
