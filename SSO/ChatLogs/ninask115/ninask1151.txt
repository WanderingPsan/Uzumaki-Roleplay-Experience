<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alex(Ninask115) blinked as she was 'yelled' at by the girl. Ignoring this, she walked forward towards Asteroth, her animalistic nature taking over. Aiming to take the utensils from off of the table, she'd move quickly through the motions to cut the girls food in similar amounts as the first one that she did. It was simply in her nature to help people as generously as she could. After doing that, she'd look around to see anything else that needed help, and then move over to her corner.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alex(Ninask115) looked down and slide into the seat next to Asteroth, watching half of the food being slid over to her. Moving her hands up, she'd take out a few pieces that didn't even add up to one fourth of the -half-, then slid the remainder back to Asteroth so that she could eat it.* - Tue Dec  8 03:17:07 2015

And with it she could do all of this amazing stuff.

Focusing once again, she allowed it all to begin pooling in her eyes, waiting for something to happen with it. She closed her eyes super hard and wished that she may, wish that she might. After a while, it finally happened, her eyes burst open to reveal the Byakugan, letting her see the a whole new world! It kind of amazed her a little bit.* - Sat Dec 12 23:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) started walking to her mom, throwing her hands around all willy nilly. "Chakra! Chakra!" It seemed that she was trying to turn things into other things with this chakra of hers.* - Sun Dec 13 00:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) was still playing around, running over and smacking mommy in the leg. "Chakra!"* - Sun Dec 13 00:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) blinked as nothing happened to her, and threw her hand forward again, continuing to yell, "Chakra!"* - Sun Dec 13 00:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) frowned a little bit as she walked over to her poppa, trying to turn him into a unicorn instead. Throwing her hand towards him, she'd yell again, "Chakra!"* - Sun Dec 13 01:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's palm thrusts. - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Taku(Punkamainia) says: Hey. Is Gentle Fist that palm attack you were teaching me earlier? - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Have you been listening? - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yes. - Sun Dec 13 01:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: How about you two spar. - Sun Dec 13 01:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) felt the warmth of the steam that warmed her, and shook her head. She pointed her hand towards Sanoke again and yelled chakra once more. It as clear that she was trying to turn him into something.* - Sun Dec 13 01:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) shoved her arm forwrd once again. "Horsey!" As she said that, she pointed at him again, clearly trying to turn him into a horse? Could chakra even do such a thing!?* - Sun Dec 13 01:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) 's eyes widdened as her chakra had turned her dad into an animal. "Horsey!!!" She ran forward and jumped on his back, ready to ride around the house and have a lot of super fun.* - Sun Dec 13 01:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) says: Oh okay... - Sun Dec 13 01:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) waddled over to her dad as he opened his arms, wrapping her shorter arms around his body the best she could. She had grown a little more in that year, so she was growing up to be quite the young lady, and she was only at the age of four! It was quite amazing that the human body could grow.....but not really.

Her eyes looked up at her dad as he tried to pull back from the hug, throwing her arms up. "I want up!" She always got her way as the younger child, it was just something that happened, even when it was already happening. She didn't realize that she was already up in the air, so maybe she wanted to go up even higher.* - Sun Dec 13 14:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: No problem, I also wanted to thank you on pointing out that black dress for me. It looks amazing, though Mitsu rushed me out on our date. So, I didn't get a chance to wear it. - Sun Dec 13 14:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) scooped up some ice cream with her spoon, clearly not being able to use a spoon perfectly just yet. Turning her head towards Mirai and Chikyu, even with her mouth full of the chocolatey sweetness, she'd yell out to them. "I want date too!"* - Sun Dec 13 14:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hehehe.. you're too little for that Miaka. This is adult stuff.  - Sun Dec 13 14:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Your mother is busy. Let her handle a little training. - Sun Dec 13 14:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) looked up at the giant turtle that came out of nowhere, clapping her hands at it. It was pretty large and out of nowhere, however she clearly was amazed by it. She ran up to it, more of a waddle than a run, and started trying to climb up on it, her body barely even getting a grip on anything. She still, however, tried her best to continue climbing up on it.* - Sun Dec 13 15:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's possible due to chakra. Cool ain't it? - Sun Dec 13 15:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) slowly went from giggling to frowning, and then downright wailing loudly. Chikyu could probably feel the girls stomach rumbling in her hands, since the girls hands were right next to her stomach and underneath her armpits. The little baby was clearly hungry for some food.* - Sun Dec 13 17:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) continued wailing loudly as her stomach growled, her body starting to throw a fit as her arms and legs flung around with anger. Her mouth was spread wide open in the yelling, and her face was stained with the tears that was running down her face. When would this baby get some much needed food!?* - Sun Dec 13 17:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) 's tears and screaming quickly cut short, her body slipping out of Chikyu's hands. her shirt being peeled off to show her bare chest even though she hadn't developed anything. Food was more important. Moving forward, she'd throw her body towards the food, beginning to devour anything her little hands could wrap around.* - Sun Dec 13 17:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I can't just beat her by toying with her as I'd do normally. - Sun Dec 13 17:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) felt the shirt slipping on her body, not knowing when or how it happened in the blur of sudden speed and her craze for the food. Miaka continued to stuff her face with everything that was in front of her, chewing up and down on anything and everything. After a while, she would roll over and begin eating a piece of chocolate that was just laying out for her.* - Sun Dec 13 17:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) spun her body around with a full belly, reaching her hands up for the bottle or cup of water that was offered to her. After she drank enough to satisfy her, Miaka would turn back around and pick up a piece of ham that she had. She'd turn back and push it up to Chikyu's body, since she couldn't really reach the girls mouth, or even her stomach for that matter. "Eat."* - Sun Dec 13 18:04:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) was picked up and she pushes the piece of food into her mouth. Miaka would then turn around and grab another piece of food to be lifted up into Chikyu's mouth, this time instead of the ham it would be a piece of chocolate with some type of broccoli underneath it, maybe something that'd be good together, or utterly gross. She couldn't tell.* - Sun Dec 13 18:07:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oh. . It's still going?  Nice, I might learn something from this. . . - Sun Dec 13 18:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Miaka(Ninask115) turned her head over towards the food once more, going down to pick up something else. She wrapped her hands around a large leg from what seemed to be a chicken, and lifted up to push it towards Chikyu's mouth. If she was lifted up, then the food would be inserted into her mouth, bone and all.* - Sun Dec 13 18:24:09 2015
