When Geo's words were heard she sighed out and nodded against Yumiko's shoulder. The smell of flesh and ash became evident as she closed her eyes. "It's not about death or life, it's about that he was so tortured already and then they executed him anyway... and he doesn't even get a proper burial? What is that..." She sniffled a bit but when Geo spoke of leaving she released Yumiko and stood up looking over towards the older boy.---Course then she wasn't released but was instead guided from the building, which was probably better for her anyway.* - Mon Dec  7 06:09:04 2015

She shook her head towards Yumiko's question, she found torture an unnecessary action unless it was to receive information.* - Fri Dec 11 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded to Yumiko's order and then reached out and gripped the chains and the prisoner's arm on one side to lead him out of the cell and through the several checkpoint gates in the prison. She waited to assure that Anguo was ready and keeping an eye on the guys other side.* - Fri Dec 11 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) held the man steady as Anguo tried to punch him, although she didn't go through the effort to strike the prisoner herself she did hold him still for Anguo to get a good shot. She forced the man forward with a few stumbling steps after such was done and drug him along out the prison's main entrance and rolled her eyes at how someone who was about to face death could lack respect or  a humble personality.* - Fri Dec 11 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) rose a brow at the how he said a prayer to a lord, she wondered why so many who were about to die called out to an imaginary being. She herself was not at all religious, she believed what was there and in front of her eyes...those who did things for her and cared for her, had her back... that was the meaning of true love and friendship to her, not some omniscent being you couldn't see or hear. 

Leading the man the rest of the way to the mansion's courtyard, she forced a toe of her boot forward to press on the back of his calf to force him down onto his knee's in a hard fall. Keeping a hand on his shoulder for now as she waited for Anguo to step up aond take over.* - Fri Dec 11 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Anguo..? - Fri Dec 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) kept her gaze on Anguo, his sword, and the prisoner. She stepped off to the side and only was close enough to act if the prisoner tried to flee. She swallowed hard at what he was doing and sighed out just before he had commited the action. When he had sliced the man's head clean off she jumped faintly and looked away soon after. It was obvious after so many ears of her squad doing executions she was still not entirely okay with it... her humanity showing.* - Fri Dec 11 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Ugh.... - Fri Dec 11 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) shifted onto one hip with her weight and sighed out incomfortably, she was ready for this mission to be over since this whole execution bit was rather ...messy. Job wise and mentally.* - Fri Dec 11 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Was still not told his crimes. . - Fri Dec 11 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Murder... - Fri Dec 11 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does she always kill them that way? - Fri Dec 11 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) sighed out slowly and closed her eyes after the kill had been completed. She reopened her eyes and whispered to a few guards from the prison who took the bodies away and dealt with them accordingly.* - Fri Dec 11 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Is that all? - Fri Dec 11 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) turned to look over Rymei for a moment, the fact she had slow clapped bothered Kit a bit but she tried not to let it get to her. She clicked her tongue and Makkuro, with Kokoa on his back, came to her side and nudged her hand with his muzzle. "I think I'm going to head to the shelter, need to deal with some rounds there before heading home. You don't need me for the other missions, yeah?" It was regular for after the execution missions like this she normally went into seclusion for a day or two to recover.* - Fri Dec 11 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) glanced over towards Rymei again and rested a hand atop Makkuro's head. "Six for Makkuro... six months for Kokoa," the small dog lifted her head and sniffled the air with her tiny black nose wiggling back and forth towards Rymei. The older male german shepard inhaled Rymei's scent and clearly could get the feeling that they were not well liked.* - Fri Dec 11 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Cat gang. - Fri Dec 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) blinked a few times with her deep brown eyes. She wasn't used to being called a cutie by women like Rymei. She turned to face the woman and then clicked her tongue to the dogs and Makkuro left the area to return home without Kit. "I'm eleven, ma'am," she decided to keep things respectful and formal. The headband wrapped around her upper arm was clearly visible and she had several weapon pouches over her body, clearly weighing down such a small female due to age. "I like cats too... but dog breeding is part of my family line, I guess I like all animals really..."* - Fri Dec 11 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) || At the mention of how 'adorable' dog breeding was and a child doing it she drifted her eyes off to the side and nodded silently. The rest of the questions and statements said by Rymei caused the girl to sigh out as if this was a little too young for her. "Yes... I am a kunoichi of the village, ma'am," Rymei was probably insightful enough to tell that Kit was not enjoying how she was being fawned over even though she was tolerating it and being polite.* - Fri Dec 11 05:32:22 2015
