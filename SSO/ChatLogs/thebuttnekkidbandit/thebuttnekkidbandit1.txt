<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was the mission about? Why were there no guards brought with him? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Because to be frank, he was being stupid. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just a rumor I heard. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And the power vacuum starts again. There are only two candidates Liu would have in mind. - Mon Nov 30 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I wouldn't have been able to react fast enough to pull him out before the shars got him. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then again, it was only a jutsu used to defend the woman, not harm the Godaime. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He decided to punch through it, and then the crystals shattered. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I was just thinking the samething. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I think he was originally from this village as well. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it's that person he wasn't originally from Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's from Konohagakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He did reside here at one point or another, correct? - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's odd. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu offered him a transfer to the village on temporary probation. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He lost a fight and was criticized for his fighting style. Reacting negatively he stormed off - he was thereafter exiled from the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From the sounds of that he made a new technique, however. Finally took the advice I gave him to heart..in order to kill the Mizukage. - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Though I must say. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It seems as if that man never meant to kill Lord Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu put himself in that situation. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That's much easier to say than Lord Liu, or Lord Mizukage, or the Godaime. But that's disrespectful. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Regardless I should have killed him. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Why do you say that? - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because if I did then it might not have happen and he might be alive today. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The thing is, Yumiko, it's not quite Abraxes's fault. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Besides - Liu was unfit for the job. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori can attest to that. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A few months prior he handed us his hat and mentioned he was going to 'walk off into the woods and die.' - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then there is the matter of how he became Mizukage to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I still can't believe it though. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tells me to scout Konohagakure, and get a "feel" for it. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A feel for it? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Was he..intending to attack Konoha? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then he transforms into me, and waltzes right into the villages, trying to feel a woman's knockers. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, like the type of people, the environment. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's presence, whatever you may call it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He was -very- unfit. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: To think he made -me- his "bodyguard." - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I'm too weak for that type of stuff. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Regardless of how unfit he was, he at least prepared for the future.  - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fighting over who the Mizukage is won't be necessary. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are two candidates. One of which is the captain of the general military of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How come? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The other? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The other is the captain of the binding and genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other is the captain of the binding and the genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The two highest ranks made by the Mizukage before his death. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How will either of them be chosen? - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More by whomever fully chooses the title than anything.  - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that - well it depends on various other factors.  - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I predict it will go to the military captain - Kana. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana, I've heard of her. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The name sounds familiar. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a chunnin of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong fighter too. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I imagine she is, at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: She might be able to teach me a trick or two. - Mon Nov 30 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: From Chuunin, to Captain of the General Military, to Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's quite the jump. - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not nearly as large of a jump as some kages in the past. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Including Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Where did he start? - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fresh from the academy basically. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What!? - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Tha-That's crazy. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirigakure has not been in strong straits for the last couple of months.. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt Liu made much of an announcement of my rank. Beyond Yumiko and Nori at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That, I know. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's about time that we fix it, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. The people in Kiri deserve better than what we've had. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Agreed. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And I presume Geo Dude will be going to members of Anguo's squad more for aid than to me. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) just sort of watched in silence, she wasn't spoken to so she didn't speak up for now.* - Tue Dec  1 01:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, I'll have a radio for you in a little bit. - Tue Dec  1 01:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time, Tengoku, lets go get ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Are we going to go train? - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alrighty. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We are if you three are ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) stood up and put her book into her backpack and slung it over her shoulder before walking over towards Heiwa to follow them to the training area he had selected.* - Tue Dec  1 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: ...I don't know that word he just used. - Tue Dec  1 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe I should start off? - Tue Dec  1 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Go ahead. - Tue Dec  1 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) saw that it was apparently her turn, she found it weird that Ten had looked at her specifically for whatever reason but she was still dwelling on not knowing the word that Heiwa had used early on in his speech. She cleared her throat and then nudged her backpack some and spoke up. "I'm Sekitsui Meinu, eight years old. I use taijutsu almost always. Haven't figured out what else I want to use yet in combination." She peered back over her shoulder to her puppy that was now poking it's head out of her backpack and resting it's head on her shoulder. It was a cute black german shepard puppy, "This is Makkuro. He fights with me." This probably sounded absurd if none of them had ever seen nin-ken in combat before, due to him being a puppy.* - Tue Dec  1 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) rose her hand.* - Tue Dec  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes, Sekitsui? - Tue Dec  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The medic. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Precisely. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is the primary person to protect in most situations. - Tue Dec  1 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Other exceptions exist, such as a mission built around protecting a person, or a position where ones skills are suddenly elevated beyond where Nori's are useful - but in the most case our work will be cut out on protecting Nori while finishing our actions. - Tue Dec  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And this is why we've brought Tengoku here. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Please, if you would, step up. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because of his speed and use of shunshin? - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Closer, stand beside me. - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The three of you are on a mission. I've been seperated from the group. - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What does Heiwa have planned? - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You see the faint outline of a rogue shinobi infront of you.  - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You have one minute to get into position. - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Protect Nori, disable Tengoku, however you choose to play it. - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi.~ A mock mission encounter? - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is gonna be over rather quickly. I'll try to last as long as I could against them. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll just say this. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I tap you, let's say you've been assassinated. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just for the sake of the training. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have one better. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Wait, what? - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can still uh. . Defend myself though. . Right? - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) immediately started moving. She clicked her tongue at her dog and it jumped from her backpack onto the ground as she was crouching down and moving forward in front of the range attacker and the medic. As soon as she had gotten in front of the other two she converted her position into an all fours with her knee's slightly bent and her toes being the only part of her lower body on the ground with her palms spread out and focusing her weight onto her finger tips for quick movements. The child's upper lip snarled up on the right side and she took on a feral appearance by her stance and look in her eyes. She was waiting for someone to direct her since the other two had worked together and she had never worked with them before. To further focus in on the situation she inhaled deeply trying to take in Ten's scent so that she could keep a lock on him when he moved for better detection of his position. * - Tue Dec  1 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...Interesting. - Tue Dec  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Why did I do that if I can't see? - Tue Dec  1 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) darted to the South West and towards the male. Her dog on the other hand moved to the North West and was intentionally making a bit more noise than she was so that it could counter act his sense of direction in the fog. She was hoping that would throw him off enough if he didn't have sensory of sound down very well. As she headed towards his position in a dart south west and then back north west towards his position. She could tell that she was going to be able to reach his position easily enough based on his scent.

She only darted up North West at the last instant so she wasn't in the straight shot of the front of his body. As soon as she had done so, the girl lunged up towards Ten and aimed to begin spinning rapidly towards Ten to try and send a burst of damage to his upper torso and right arm. When she did so it would only be considered blunt damage but as soon as she had done so, her body contorted and wrapped around his body aiming to put him into a chokehold as the rest of her body literally clung to his form with her left leg snaking around to the front of his body and securing her heal against the inner edge of his groin and hip bone to lock into place and her other leg wrapped fully around his belly just above his belly button to keep ahold of him firmly as she gripped tighter and tighter with her arm wrapped around his neck and pulling upward with her other hand locking it into place and keeping him from being able to break the choke hold.

Of course, all of this is if he wasn't able to stop her.

(Tsuuga Attack: 23 / Grapple hold: 24)* - Tue Dec  1 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) did not continue on her path of attack since his position suddenly had changed, since he had acted before she event darted North West she would now take a deep inhale to determine his new position. Turning he head this way and that as she could smell Heiwa ahead of her and had a decision to make. Take him and dart, or attack the 'rogue' she was after. She could easily reach the boy again but decided to take a different route, the focus was saving her teammate and so she moved forward and instead of just grabbing Heiwa because she didn't want him to cry out and give away their position she placed a hand over his mouth and the other hand at the back of his neck and whispered directly into his ear.

"Move." 

With that she released her hand from his mouth and then began to rush North West away from the area as the dog continued on it's path to keep a smell out for the attacker so that she could be aware of his position if need be.* - Tue Dec  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If this was on me would any of you be the wiser? - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique itself could hinder you in many ways. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Be careful with that jutsu, Yumiko. - Tue Dec  1 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I would have acted differently, I only use it to make it harder to shunshin an attack as quickly as he could since Nori could have been the first target of such a stratagy. - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) stopped running and fell still at Heiwa's side. She looked at the pape with explosive on it and rose a brow, she hadn't even thought to check for it. "Since you weren't gagged, you would have said something. In the moment of me not seeing it you would have spoken up to deter me from moving you."* - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Can I come out now?! - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes. You can come out. - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps. Not every hostage will be a shinobi, however. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every hostage will be capable of stating they're tagged.  - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Around near any person it's a good idea to be careful. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or develop some sensory ability. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The situation was saving -you-, our squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not a civilian. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah, I screwed over your little lesson. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Nice try though. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This time - don't worry. Feeling around me would have been a mistake. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wasn't a chastisement of you. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lesson itself was rigged against Yumiko's usage of that technique. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) simply nodded.* - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't see why her using the technique was a bad thing. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong. Invaluable even. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't understand. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But it can have detriments. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Collateral..unintentional actions or results - the use of the mist blinds us as shinobis from being able to react. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ....oh that jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I thought you meant the other one. - Tue Dec  1 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Tengoku, you aren't hurt, right? - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Yes - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I feel like I could have fotten murdered in that mist. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You're lucky you moved. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) turned to look at Ten.* - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: OOC OFF - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Having her train against Yumiko or Nori could be hard. She'd likely even be capable of being me too. Especially in Taijutsu. - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Her using that jutsu helped me. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But I mean, she didn't know it would. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Just worked out. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Your sense of hearing synergized well. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Similar to mine. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) whistled and her puppy came running. She crouched down and picked the pup up and began to pet over it's ears and back with mild scratching.* - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No, smell. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Again - interesting. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll work well in the team then. Only one who still has difficulty from what I've seen if Nori herself.~ - Tue Dec  1 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks. - Tue Dec  1 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll do some together, but much of that is reliant on you personally. - Tue Dec  1 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded faintly to his words and continued to pet the puppy.* - Tue Dec  1 05:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Finding your way around the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:00:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What is pointless? Sparring me? - Tue Dec  1 20:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Allies make you weak, they make you rely on them. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) was reading from her taijutsu book and as Ryo coaxed the puppy it sniffed him to gain his scent and then looked up to Seki but she wasn't paying attention. The puppy determined she could chance it for once since he was right next to his Mistress and stood up from the sitting position while cautiously walking towards Ryo and sniffing his hand to see if there was any residual smell of food or treats.* - Tue Dec  1 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) turned a page in her book and Makkuro began to wag his tail as the first rub was given. He sat his bum down on the cement and then lulled his tongue out faintly with a light pant as he was rubbed and pet by Ryo. Seki's eyes glanced down to the two to check on her puppy to see what was happening but said nothing and continued reading.* - Tue Dec  1 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) || The puppy shook back and forth with a light groan of happiness and then it tried to flop over on it's side and roll onto it's back as his back legs kicked out against the bench trying to get Ryo to rub his belly. The vibration made Seki squint and look down at the silly puppy being a whore for pets. When Ryo spoke up she replied.

"He has me, that's about it though right now."* - Tue Dec  1 21:35:47 2015
