<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) || Makkuro jumped up and flipped over before barking loudly a single time.

She shook her head and then looked down to Makkuro who was whining some and looking up to Ryo with concern. A little too 'aware' for a normal dog.* - Tue Dec  1 22:30:24 2015

"Go out to eat? Uh, sure... I don't really eat candy though, it's bad for your training." She shrugged, "what did you have in mind?" She didn't catch on to his blushing because she was a child and didn't think of those sort of things hardly ever.* - Tue Dec  1 23:25:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) had fairly good reflexes but she was not fast enough to deal with that freaking arrow.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) squinted at the word 'pedo' and glared up at the male with her dark brown eyes that shown her intelligence and serious nature. She then looked back to her book and turned a page, the puppy simply slumbered on.* - Thu Dec  3 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) didn't like how he was talking, she had heard of the perverted kage and had avoided him like the plague. She closed her book and looked up to him as the puppy awoken and sniffed the male with a small curiousity. "...thank you," her voice was soft and young but clearly not amused.* - Thu Dec  3 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) closed the book entirely and sat it beside her on the bench, it looked like it was to give him her full attention but really it was to keep him from sitting beside her. The dog started to sniff heavily at all the new scents to figure out what they were but he was warry of the person and didn't let them touch him at all becuase of how Seki's tone of voice was currently. "Makkuro..." was all she would state.* - Thu Dec  3 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) || The dog sat it's head back down on it's Mistress's lap and then watched him Seki exhaled out and then spoke up in greeting, "Sekisui-san."* - Thu Dec  3 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) shrugged some, "you just seem a little creepy...you are trying to talk up a child just because she has a puppy. Red flags are going off."* - Thu Dec  3 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) then began to smile as he spoke of wolves in children's clothing. "I like that saying," she reached over and picked up her book off the bench and tucked it away into her backpack at the end of the bench. she then pulled her puppy up onto her lap with a little yip from the guy as he started to wag his tail.* - Thu Dec  3 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded towards him and shifted some as she reached up to adjust her scarf. She had no clue who he was, not even his name rung a bell. She heard talking in her ear from her radio but tried to ignore it. "You aren't from around here?" she noted his accent wasn't that of Kirigakure.* - Thu Dec  3 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded slowly to his words, "Gotcha.. so.... why are you back here again? Just visiting?"* - Thu Dec  3 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) pet over the ears of her puppy and stared down to him while the teenager spoke. "I mean you should do what you want, yeah? And this was my dog for about a year now, he's a ninken."* - Thu Dec  3 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) chuckled at his statements and question. "Things can be simple if you want them to be...and yes, of course I like him. I love him." She scratched behind the puppy's ears.* - Thu Dec  3 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) watched as he grew the figurine, granted it was rough, but it was rather nice looking and talented. "Woah... that's pretty cool, I've never seen anything like that before!" She shouted out excited like as she refrained from reaching out towards the dog figure. The puppy was not interested...it smelled like nothing.* - Thu Dec  3 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) reached out and took the figurine while pressing her lips together tightly and smiling wide as she ran her little fingers over the figure. "Thanks... I don't get gifts hardly ever..." She then peered up towards him while holding the crystal dog. "Hm? Are you someone special?" When he asked about fish she shook her head, "he's a beef boy.~" She pet over his head and at the mention of 'beef' the puppy perked up his ears and began to sniff for the meat but smelled none.* - Thu Dec  3 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) watched him from the side, "I mean is it good or bad that I don't know you?" Then she paused and listened out for what he said and spoke up again, "Mn...no collar, maybe a treat though.~ He doesn't like collars, I like him free.~"* - Thu Dec  3 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) shrugged lightly, "you are a nice stranger..." That is all he was to her. 

"Oh? that's pretty cool, I didn't know they had special places for treats."* - Thu Dec  3 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I wonder if Heiwa heard about it. . .he'd probably try to kill me. I believe he liked that particular Mizu. - Thu Dec  3 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded slowly, "oh... that makes a bit more sense. Hah." She looked down and Makkuro had fallen back asleep. * - Thu Dec  3 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . .I won't bother you any further. I'm sure you were enjoying you book. Plus the pup seems to be enjoying his rest. - Thu Dec  3 06:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I'll remember that, thank you for the gift! - Thu Dec  3 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) smiled brightly now and tucked the crystal figurine away into her backpack for safety and pulled her book back out.* - Thu Dec  3 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) waved to him as he left with a gentle childish smile. * - Thu Dec  3 06:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Whatever. - Thu Dec  3 19:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Don't acknowledge it. - Thu Dec  3 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) reached up to her ear and muttered into her radio.* - Thu Dec  3 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) walked off.* - Thu Dec  3 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) peered around the waterfall and finally up the cliffside with a hand at her forehead to block the sun out so she could see up at the top. "Oh."* - Thu Dec  3 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: How did you get up there?! - Thu Dec  3 23:14:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh. - Thu Dec  3 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) shrugged and then neared the rockface and began to manually climb the side. She wasn't perfect at climbing but she was reasonably good due to the strength of her body.* - Thu Dec  3 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I like the view up here.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah it's nice. - Thu Dec  3 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) turned around and faced out, "you just hanging out? Or training?"* - Thu Dec  3 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I was training earlier but for now I'm resting. - Thu Dec  3 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I might have a spar with someone soon. - Thu Dec  3 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Where's Heiwa at? - Thu Dec  3 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: We should do a mission soon. - Thu Dec  3 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ...I mean if you guys wanna. - Thu Dec  3 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I do I do.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What sort of missions do you guys do? - Thu Dec  3 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: One that's out of the village.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oooooh. - Thu Dec  3 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: So do you only use archery? - Thu Dec  3 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) turned to look over her shoulder and then fully turned and waved with a small smile towards Geo.* - Thu Dec  3 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) looked back out over the cliff to the water, "I'm doing well, we are just relaxing until Heiwa shows up.~"* - Fri Dec  4 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) saw that he got a little busy with his scrolls, she found it a little rude but decided not to say anything. "We are going to in a while if Heiwa shows up, but we really want a mission!"* - Fri Dec  4 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ...H-huh - Fri Dec  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) looked at the scrolls and then took them. "What are these for?" She wasn't sure why he was giving her scrolls for jutsu when they hardly knew each other that much. It was nice...but strange. "O-oh, but I'm sure your team will go on a mission soon!"* - Fri Dec  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks... uh.. see you around? - Fri Dec  4 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I hate that guy. - Fri Dec  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: .... - Fri Dec  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) pursed her lips but said nothing.* - Fri Dec  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: He threatened to kill me a few hours ago. - Fri Dec  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And pretty much anoy - Fri Dec  4 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And pretty much anyone he thinks is weak.* - Fri Dec  4 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Funny how people change from one demeanor to another so quickly. - Fri Dec  4 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded slowly but didnt' speak.* - Fri Dec  4 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) peered out over the water feeling rather bored currently since nothing was going on anymore.* - Fri Dec  4 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Zzzzzz. . . - Fri Dec  4 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) walked over to the side and peered down to Heiwa, "we were waiting for you so we can get a mission."* - Fri Dec  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh. Did you talk to the Mizukage about any available missions? - Fri Dec  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No we were waiting for you. - Fri Dec  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Well, I'm not sure if the Mizukage is up right now. Do you want to look? - Fri Dec  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah, let's go!~ - Fri Dec  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) began to manually climb down the cliff side and then straightened out her scarf and neck headband when she reached the ground. "Mkay!"* - Fri Dec  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Come one Nori! - Fri Dec  4 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Wake up! - Fri Dec  4 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're going to ask about a mission! Come on - and bring Yumiko with you too! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaake uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Alright, alright I'm coming! - Fri Dec  4 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hmph. - Fri Dec  4 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seems she's busy. - Fri Dec  4 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I still have some low ranking missions you three could go on and take the credit for - but I doubt you'd all want that. - Fri Dec  4 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hm... it's okay. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I'll wait. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Maybe training or no? - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Training can work - I have an idea in mind anyways. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets head out to the fields. - Fri Dec  4 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Alrighty.~ - Fri Dec  4 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. This spot should do. We'll be working on some physical training later on in the day, but with all things there is a balance needed. - Fri Dec  4 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong body is nothing without a strong mind. - Fri Dec  4 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, Yumiko, Nori - Can either of you explain what a genjutsu is?  - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope that's not taken as condescending. - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Jutsu that affect the mind only? - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: It's a chakra attack on the brain. - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. It's a type of jutsu that affects the mind - not the physical realm - through application of chakra on the nervous system of the brain causing the recipient's senses to reflect what the user intends for them to see. - Fri Dec  4 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In other words - what you've both said. It's not used by many as they favor the use of frontal attacks. - Fri Dec  4 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As it cannot kill it is often seen better to use a more physical sense of combat. - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, you may very well find someone who does use genjutsu. In that case are any of you aware of how to counteract that? - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) shook her head quickly after having listened to that whole little speech.* - Fri Dec  4 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) listened to his little lecture and looked pretty focused. Eventually Makkuro stumbled out of her backpack and rolled over on the ground as he started to rub his back for a scratch with a back and forth wiggle against the dirt. Thoroughly kicking up a little cloud of dirt around him and making Seki frown at how dirty he was getting but she ignored it.* - Fri Dec  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . . . What if we are in a genjutsu right now? And this village isn't real? - Fri Dec  4 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good question..There are some ways to discern whether you're in a genjutsu or not. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A genjutsu only affects the senses - it does not affect the world around you. Low leveled genjutsus often will have tells because of this. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If, say, a giant ball of fire is made and is hurling towards you? - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you can visibly see a large body of water appearing still cool to the touch and not reacting in any way against it? - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Of course, a strong enough genjutsu user would make you perceive that body of water also being boiling. - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Staying aware of your senses can keep you from falling into the traps of a genjutsu. - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded a few times in understanding of the lesson.* - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm going to use a low level genjutsu on you. Your objective is to dissipate it using only your chakra. - Fri Dec  4 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What are the handseals though? - Fri Dec  4 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The tiger hand seal. - Fri Dec  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) nodded and waited for him to freaking put her in the genjutsu so she could start. (:|)* - Fri Dec  4 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) watched the handseals being formed and then felt the genjutsu being thrust upon her from how weak it was. After a while of staring at the creature she pusred her lips and didn't find it scary at all as she growled at it and snarled her lips up. Forming the single seal she tried to release her chakra but realized she had done the jutsu in the wrong order.

She rolled her neck and eyes and then folded her hands into seals again and this time she managed to shut off her chakra and then easily enough she burst it back on and sent enough chakra through her system for her to break the very weak genjutsu. "Eh.... that feels funny," she had lingered for too long and it made her a little dizzy from her system struggling to restart.* - Fri Dec  4 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: As Genjutsu works by attacking the chakra nervous system it disrupts the senses. Dislodging this breaks the genjutsu as well. - Fri Dec  4 03:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) followed through with all the checks but was confused why they were at the prison. Maybe a transport? She never has seen a B rank mission scroll, nor did she know what kind of mission they were doing.* - Mon Dec  7 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: He's detained, malnourished, and deemed generally not a threat. - Mon Dec  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Much of his abilities have rusted over the near year of incarceration. - Mon Dec  7 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Our mission is a public execution. - Mon Dec  7 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: ...We are executing someone? - Mon Dec  7 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm? Alright. - Mon Dec  7 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Nori, stay further back while we escort him. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Just in case something happens. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Sekitsui and Yumiko - you'll both escort him. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: I'll be look out.  - Mon Dec  7 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) whispers: W-we are suppose to execute someone? - Mon Dec  7 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) was trembling slightly, she had never... even though about killing someone who wasn't in combat and she -had- to kill them. She walked forward with a lump in her throat and a ache in her belly as she waited for Yumiko to join her to grab the malnourished man in chains assumably?* - Mon Dec  7 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) walked through the gate after guards let her through and then to the cell number zero zero three. She waited for the guard to let her in and when she saw who they were to execute it made her tremble more but she tried to put up a front that she was strong and determined to be a cold shinobi tool for the moment. Reaching out for his arm she helped lift up the weakened man and started to pull him out of the cell if he didn't resist.* - Mon Dec  7 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mmmh. . - Mon Dec  7 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) undid the shackles and gave the key back to the guard as she helped the man out the gate. She glanced towards Yumiko with concerned eyes, Seki would always do her duty if it was right but this seemed... wrong. Look how badly they had treated this man, was that not punishment enough for what he did? Her eyes searched through the next check station towards Hiewa with her sorrowful gaze to try and see what any of them were possibly feeling about this situation.* - Mon Dec  7 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) || Everytime the man used her small frame as balance it made her cringe at the fact he was about to be executed when he was so weak... she felt her eyes burning with upset but squeezed her lids hard to stop from crying over the situation. When she saw the tags, the girl frowned heavily, "what are you doing? You aren't going to blow him up... it says execution not torture... what kind of animals are you?" Her voice sounded pained and she tried to get the boy walking further ahead as she kept close to him to lead him out of the building to wherever they were taking him for the execution.* - Mon Dec  7 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) walked the rest of the way out in silence with the man.* - Mon Dec  7 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..Yumiko, go gather anyone you can ahead of us. - Mon Dec  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) approached with a tallish man who looked extremely malnourished in hand. He had two explosive tags attached to his body, one on the front of his chest and one on his back. She led him to the center of the court yard and looked around. Then looked to Heiwa, "is this public enough?" Her voice sounded distressed.* - Mon Dec  7 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: This is the person I'm looking for. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I've got next. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Heiwa, do me a favor. - Mon Dec  7 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Pull out this spear from me? - Mon Dec  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Does he not see we are in the middle of something? - Mon Dec  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does Nori -want- to do it? - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But who? - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .......But why? - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) looked very unhappy as she stood there holding onto the prisoner and supporting him so he wouldn't fall over.* - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) lowered the man down to his knee's and then stepped back away from Nori since she had the situation handled now. Seki looked away and kept quiet with her fingers trembling as she tried to hold it together.* - Mon Dec  7 03:03:02 2015
