<br><font color=yellow>*Shodai(Phentom) His eyes focused on Suzy, who seemed to have been foreign to where he resided.. Due to him being extremely shy, he had no intentions on talking. Thererfore, the palm of his hand began to fill with chakra and his skin transformed into a paper like substance before folding a few times into a little butterfly.. As it flew over to the young woman, it unfolded slowly before landing directly in her palms... "The Amekage is standing right next to me, with orange hair.." it read.*

As it flew over to the young woman, it unfolded slowly before landing directly in her palms... "The Amekage is standing right next to me, with orange hair.." it read.

Once he was through answering the ladies's question, he quickly made his way over towards the shopkeeper to his north..."Hello." he stated as he reached for a little bag of ryo in his pockets.. "YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH!" the keeper yelled before a punch was swung directly for Shodai's face, sending him to the ground, dirtying his new clothing.. 

"NOO!" he yelled as chakra filled his body.. His entire skin completely turned to paper and rushed foward to encase the commoner.. Since Shodai basically practiced this way of fighting his whole life, he easily trapped the shopkeeper until only ihs nose and mouth could be seen.. "You should not have did that." he stated firmly once sending a shock of fear throughout his opponent.. 

The paper around the man began to loosen and fly over to where SHodai stood  previously, joining together peice by peice before his body was fully visible.. *

<br><font color=yellow>*Joutei, Fukyuu(Kyotoshien) was staring down his opponent before he watched them slumped over. Both he and his opponent was at their limits. He began to form hand signs trying to gather up enough chakra to form the next technique. His opponent began to dash towards him forming hand signs. He jumped into the air launching a fire ball towards Fukyuu but Fukyuu managed to roll to the left to move out of the way while the fireball clipped his clothing. "Damn it that was a little too close..." he thought to himself as he began to launch his technique. "Raiton: Raikyuu!" he said as he launched a ball of lightning right at his opponent who happened to be hit in the left shoulder. Because Fukyuu was at his limits his aim was a little bit off.

His opponent fell backwards and landed on the ground trying to gather his bearings. They both began forming hand signs at the same time rushing at each other. Fukyuu held his hand sign as he began to rush into the opponents attack. "Katon: Housenka no Jutsu!" his opponent uttered as Fukyuu was englufed in flames only to turn into a log while he would appear in a tree behind his opponent and a hissing sound could be heard from the log he substituted into. Fukyuu formed a hand seal and detonated the explosive tag he had on the log he substituted from and blasted his opponent back. Fukyuu began forming hand seals once again and began to run towards the opponent who was blasted backwards. "Raikiri!" he said as he rammed the Lightning Fang into his opponents midsection and pulled his arm out from within the opponent. He then dropped to one knee exaughsted and began to rest for a while before moving on.*
