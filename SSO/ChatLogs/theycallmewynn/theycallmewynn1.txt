<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Totoro(They.Call.Me.Wynn) Ohai~*
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Yuta(They.Call.Me.Wynn) <i>exits the Hokage's mansion after having successfully performed a mission for his liege. "I think I'll go train my Genjutsu a bit." He says as he walks to the southwestern part of the village where there was a small pond surrounded by a grove of trees. "I can't really practice Genjutsu as I normally do with my little brother, but I guess I can do that internal thing." He thinks to himself before quickly sitting on the edge of the pier that jutted out over the water and looking out into the trees.
<br><br>
Yuta's mind begins to slow down as he focuses on himself and nothing more. "Chakra manipulation via meditation." He says out loud over and over while his chakra flow steadily increases in speed. His chant slowly becomes less and less audible until he is only thinking the words over and over. "Manipu-" He begins before stopping suddenlly and opening his eyes. His eyes had become slightly crimsoned. He rubs his face, sort of feeling something odd about himself, his eyes turning back to their normal jet black.
<br><br>
"That was an odd feeling." He thinks to himself before going back to his meditation. His chakra begins to flow through his brain as he makes several handseals. "Magen.." He says as he prepares himself for the mental shock of the oncoming jutsu. "Narakumi." He says as he releases his hold on his chakra flow. The jutsu kicks in and begins to play out. It seems as if the water begins to mist up, similarly to an early morning dew. 
<br><br> 
Yuta turns around at the sound of Takeda, the Clan Leader walking up behind him. "Oh there Mr. Takeda!" Yuta says with a smile as he stands up and bows to the man. Takeda's face is one of disgust and displeasure. 
<br><br>
"Yuta you're nearly thirteen years old. It's time that you actually made some use of yourself." Takeda remarks as he pushes the young boy towards the edge of the pier. "Katon: Goukyayuu." He says simply pointing at the trees on the far side of the water. "Your younger twin brother already knows how to use the jutsu, that means you've had more than enough time to learn it yourself." Takeda says rather angrily.
<br><br>
With this said, Yuta simply turns and looks at the trees. He begins to tremble visciously. He didn't know how to use Katon: Goukyakyuu. He knew the handseals and the basic idea of the technique, but fire jutsu just were a bit beyond his skill level. Now if it were a Genjutsu, he'd be able to pull it off with ease just via a bit of BS'ing, but this..This was terrible.
<br><br>
"S-sir...I-I can't." He says as he turns back to Takeda. But as he does so, he realizes that Takeda isn't there. Yuta was just standing there by himself. "M-Mr. Takeda?" Yuta says quizzically. He turns back around to the edge of the pier and just stands there with a shocked look on his face. His brother was standing there with a katana held out. The blade was stuck between Yuta's fourth and fifth ribs on the left side. He was wearing a mask, but Yuta knew it was him.
<br><br>
"Wh-why?" Yuta asks as tears begin to stream down his face. 
<br><br>
"You call yourself an Uchiha...You are nothing." His brother says as he pulls the katana from Yuta's body and leaps back with a spin and a flourish, his feet landing on the surface of the water and adhering to it like a water strider. "Katon: Hibashiri!" He exclaims as a stream of fire is shot from his mouth and quickly spins around Yuta.
<br><br>
The fire quickly hits his right leg and begins to curl up and around his body. </i>
<br><br>
<b>Sitting on the edge of the pier, Yuta's eyes begin to water and flash with a deep crimson color.</b>
<br><br>
<i>Yuta begins to scream and cry, his eyes having flashed a bright red color, two dark swirl spins spinning within the red ocean of his eye. "I hate you! I hate you!!" He roars with anger and pain as his hands quickly fly into a handseal, the handseal that his brother had just used. Yuta wasn't sure how or why, but he knew he could.
<br><br>
"Fire Style: Fire Run!!" He yells as he breathes out four giant 'Os' through the air. They quickly descend upon his brother and surround him. 
<br><br>
"Crap.." His brother says as he is engulfed by the flames. He releases his chakra to his feet and sinks down into the water. He swims away through the water and comes up on the sand next to the trees. Meanwhile, Yuta is no longer screaming he has burned for an unnatural amount of time in agony. The young male has passed through pain and back into calm.</i>
<br><br>
<b>With a jolt, Yuta's eyes snap open. They are bright red, a single wheel spin therein. He places his hands on his face and releases his chakra flow to his head, essentially utilizing Kai no Jutsu. His eyes stay their bright red color for a few more moments before Yuta's chakra fails him. He looks over at the trees and realizes that two of them were aflame. "Wh-what?" He ponders before passing into unconsciousness.</b>
<br><br>
<i><b><font color=purple>Yuta stands stock still, watching his house burn with his little brother, both of them are crying but he is trying his hardest not to show it. Their parents had owed a great sum of money to a certain Loanshark who had hired a team of mercenaries to attack and kill them. Yuta and his brother were barely able to get out of their home. At that time, they didn't have the control or maturity to truly unlock the Sharingan, and even had they, they wouldn't understand what was happening to take advantage of it.
<br><br>
The two four year olds run away to the North to find someone to help them...</i></b></font>
<br><br>
<b>Yuta snaps awake, laying in a hospital bed and yawns. "How did I get here?" He wonders as he sits up and gets off the bed. The young man looks around the room and sighs. "It happened again, my eyes did that thing. I think it's the Sharingan, but it doesn't make sense...Why can't I activate it normally?" He wonders while walking out of the hospital room and directly into a nurse. The nurse exclaims and grabs onto the little boy.
<br><br>
"Where do you think you're going? You're in n-" She begins to say before Yuta breaks away. The boy had never really cared for hospitals, and he felt no need to stay longer than he needed to. 
<br><br>
"Thanks miss! But I'll get better before ya know it!" He exclaims as he does a spin move around a doctor and gets out of the building. Yuta makes his way away from the Hospital and rushes towards the village center. "Alright, time to go get the mission." He says as he walks into the Hokage's mansion and straight up to his desk.</b>*
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Yuta(They.Call.Me.Wynn) <b>'s face as he walks up to the Hokage was the same as it had been the last few hundred times that he had performed this same act. "Sir, I want to hunt down Hyuro the Loanshark." Yuta says with a voice and look of intense determination. He had been trying to take on a mission to hunt down the man who had killed his parents everyday since he had become a Genin, and everytime the answer was the same:
<br><br>
"No Yuta, you're not ready yet." The Hokage says before waving him off. "Now shoo, stop bugging me." He says without even looking up from his work. 
<br><br>
Yuta's face suddenlly puffs up and turns red. "S-sir! I refuse! Let me go on this mission! I have grown stron-" He begins to say before the Hokage cuts him off.
<br><br>
"Katon: Goukyakyuu...Use it now then." The Hokage says simply while sitting his head up and staring Yuta directly in the face. He knew that the boy had no skill with Fire Style jutsu and he knew that Yuta hadn't been practicing using his Fire Style jutsu. "You cannot use Katon Ninjutsu. If you run into someone who is a Genjutsu user just like you, but more skilled, then you're going to die." The Hokage says simply.
<br><br>
Yuta begins to cry once again. His fists are curled up and his head is hung low. It was just like his Genjutsu training all over again. This pain of failure, the sting of knowing that no matter how much he had grown, he was still inadequate. "Th-But..." He begins to stammer, but stops, knowing that nothing he says could help him in this situation.
<br><br>
"I understand your fear Yuta, but you need to overcome it. Learn the technique, I promise that nothing like that will happen. You won't hurt anyone like they hurt you. You're safe to learn the fire jutsu, and I won't let you go after Hyuro until you've done so." The Hokage says. While he initially seemed to just be pushing Yuta's buttons; it was quite obvious that he did so out of love. The reason that Yuta had failed to learn the signature Fire jutsu of his clan wasn't his inability to, but his fear of the destructive power of fire. His little brother had gotten off easily and wasn't as impacted by the entire affair, but he just couldn't get over it.
<br><br>
"Now, go out there and read this scroll. Learn the technique." He says tossing the Katon: Goukyakyuu scroll to Yuta. Yuta catches the scroll out of the air and nods. "Yes sir! I'll do it...I know I can." Yuta says as he turns and marches back out of the building. The young boy was determined to learn this technique, even if it meant facing his most intense fear and overcoming it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) walks up towards the young woman called Otome. Upon her target's back was a gourd. "A sand manipulator." Leera thinks to herself as she quickly rushes forth. The woman throws her hands together, creating a sort of chakra orb between her palms.

"Lightning Ball!" She exclaims before firing off an orb of lightning directly towards Otome, attempting to hit her cleanly in the chest, stunning and knocking her backward.* - Sat Nov 14 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) throws her hands together once more. This time a clone made of pure electricty appears directly in front of her. The clone takes off towards Otome with ease, quickly attempting to sweep her feet out from under her before standing over her and beginning to perform a series of punches toward her face and upper bottom.* - Sat Nov 14 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) 's clone suddenlly shoots to the left, its speed monstrous as it dashes out of the way of the sand. The raiton clone quickly aims to dash at Otome before quickly exploding into a shower of sparks which would be conducted well by the iron sand. The electric shower surrounding the girl would be intended to stun her as well as keeping her still.

The real Leera on the other hand throws her hands together as she watches the clone's attempt.

"Chains of Absolution..."

The Bandit says this before placing her hands flat against the ground. In doing so a sudden rumble occurs in the ground before, out of the ground, a grouping of chains shoots forth. These chains aim to quickly surround and incapacitate the young woman known as Otome. Wrapping around her body and keeping her held still via being tethered to the ground.* - Sat Nov 14 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) (*Otome couldn't possibly do anything against the speed which allowed the bandit to easily out-manuever the pace of Otome's sand, so when the lightning bunshin evaded her efforts, anxiety and anticipation drew her senses away from her attempt at departure and as a result she woudl trip over her own feet. Just then, the clone bursted.

Streaks of lightning, chaining with one another as it progressed through the iron sand and corased through her small, frail form. As a result, she shook without control and screamed loudly as the agony of the ninjutsu simply bypassed the iron sand and she was at the whim of the lightning-specialist completely.

As the restraints uprooted from the ground, sliding around her small stunned body--she would be stuck completely. By this time she was crying uncontrollably; screaming for someone to help her as she at this point would do anything to escape the pain. That being said, she was a phobic girl with deep trust and paranoia issues and this would only magnify an already socially disabling disease.*)* - Sat Nov 14 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) (*Otome looked back just in time to perceive the creation of lightning-based shadow clones. Their materialization was the last thing the young ninja wanted to see. After all, merely one foe induced fear which encompassed every nerve within her form that would burst with signals of fright and anxiety. 

She quickly pushed her hands forward, and with the cork now off the gourd, the iron sand would spill forward to intercept the two Bunshin. Because of her inability to form any other solid form other than the armor which she adorned, it would be as though a stream of iron sand that would attempt to encroach their throat and force iron sand into the bunshin's body to cause internal damage.

"Help..." She attempted to scream, but sheer fright had grasped her tongue and she could but whisper as the emotionally-broken girl could not control her own self.*)* - Sat Nov 14 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) chuckles as she walks closer to Otome. "You're going to taste delicious..." The bandit woman says, licking her lips as a chain moves to restrain the girl in such a way that she'd be unable to scream.* - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015

A sudden mist fills the area.

"Squadron Leader to Brother James, we're closing in."


A short period of time post the mist's rolling in, a relatively -large- group of individuals appears. 

"Drop all of your belongings and lay flat on your face now." Three voices call out from the mist. The Mist isn't Kirigakure no Jutsu, but it is still thick and seems to lower the efficacy of sensing abilities. * - Tue Nov 17 02:51:56 2015

"Resistance eh? Alright." The voice says as the clones begin to approach the individuals. Each time they attempt to strike, one of the hidden people in the trees throws a kunai towards them, attempting to draw their attention in one direction while striking from behind or above.

Three of the hidden individuals were actually hidden in the ground directly behind Mitsunara and Chikyu, waiting to attack.* - Tue Nov 17 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) ||

The three shinobi from behind the two individuals go into action.


Individual 1:
The first individual pops straight up from out of the ground behind Chikyu. He quickly aims to punch Chikyu in the back of the head. Assuming some level of success, he'd then perform a simple Raiton Flash which aims to paralyze the two girls in preperation for the other two's attacks. ( Attack Speed: 14.65 )

Individual 2:
The second individual quickly aims to perform a technique called Headhunter no Jutsu. He quickly aims to pull Chikyu down into the ground up to the neck, her head sticking out. He'd then pop up and aim a massive kick towards her head with the intent of knocking her unconscious. ( Strength: 12.34 + Taijutsu: 14.75 )

Individual 3:
The third invidual stays underground in a small bunker of sorts. He was coordinating the attack. His sensory abilities greatly extended over the area. "Be careful you two, they're pretty strong." He says through their radios. 

Ensemble:
The individuals stationed in the trees quickly fires off four kunai towards the girl Mitsunara. Each one was sent with about 13 points of force. They were all aimed for various non-vital but still crippling spots. One aimed at either leg, and two aimed at her back and midsection. The two aimed for her midsection would stab into her but not cause any serious damage besides light bleeding. The two aimed at her legs would cripple her ability to move, lowering her movement speed a great deal.* - Tue Nov 17 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) ||

Individual 3: The man that was hiding in the mini-bunker pulls Chikyu down into the alcove. He ties her up and sends out a message. "Retreat boys, we got what we wanted." He states.

Individuals 1 & 2 & Ensemble:
All of the individuals in these groups seem to dissipate as the mist grows thicker. The individual, individual 2, closest to Mitsunara actually suffers a lethal strike across his chest which causes him to drop, he's not dead but is bleeding badly.

The rest of the Ensemble and Individual 1 quickly leave the area, utilzing Shunshin and other speed enhancing techniques.* - Tue Nov 17 03:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) is sitting at a campfire, singing a campfire song. "My C-A-M-P F-I-R-" He sings before stopping and looking at the incoming shinobi. "Ho ho ho." He says as he grabs his bow next to him. "Dinner." He says as he raises his bow at Heiwa. It didn't seem to have a string on it. 

"Flaming Arrow..." He states before firing off a singular arrow directly towards the group, aiming moreso at the red-head than Heiwa himself.* - Fri Nov 20 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) 's arrow seems to simply melt straight through the Maneki Neko statue. It hits through the statue and hits the tree, causing it to immediately catch fire from the inside.

The man's eyes suddenlly begin to glow a bright green hue. "Maneki Neko...Adorable." He says as he shoots forward, letting loose three quick fire arrows. Each one was a simple chakra based arrow. ( nin + con vs Dur * 2)* - Fri Nov 20 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) chuckles as he rapidly spins. The individual lets loose a single arrow towards Yumiko, firing through all three of her smoke bombs, intending on them detonating prematurely.

He then spins his body toward Heiwa letting off two more quick fire arrows. He then stops back where he started. It was as if he hadn't moved from his position but his body blurred as he fired off arrows.* - Fri Nov 20 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) is wrapped around by chains. He's pulled down to the ground, his arms subdued. "The shit is this....FUCKING LEERA!" He exclaims as he bites down upon a pill hidden behind his teeth.* - Fri Nov 20 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) 's head is explodedas Yumiko ends him. His body slumps, his weapon falling to the side.* - Fri Nov 20 09:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) suddenlly looks as if he had seen a ghost. "M-Mengde!?" He exclaims as he suddenlly begins to roll his chair back slightly. "N-no! Don't harm me! I'm just an old man! Enfeebled and infirm! I don't want to die like this!" He cries out to the two children. "Whatever he's paying you..I-I'll double it! Triple it even!" He exclaims.* - Wed Nov 25 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) shakes like a leaf in the wind. "H-he's a-an...Old acquaintance of mine...." As the individual says this...He sighs. "What sort of deal little missy?"* - Wed Nov 25 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) looks incredelous. "M-me..K-kill Mengde? N-no! Never! Why would I do such a thing...Except in self-defence..." He says looking towards the ground, sadness upon his contenance.* - Wed Nov 25 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) sort of growls. "K-Kirigakure! M-Mengde owns a who-....The others! What of the Others!? Betty! Lerixus! Leera! Where are they!?" He exclaims.* - Wed Nov 25 07:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(They.Call.Me.Wynn) looks as if he were about to cry. "H-he drove them mad with his constant hunting...H-he's done it...He's go-He's going to kill us all..." The man says as he lifts a pill up from his pouch. "Good bye...." He says simply as he slowly moves towards his mouth to place it there. He was clearly extremely sad, and as he lifts his head back, his visage is fully noticible. He looked -exactly- like a slightly aged Mengde.* - Wed Nov 25 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) 's hand is caught. He stands there crying large, crocodile tears. "I-I can't go on...Not knowing that -monster- is still hunting me down..." He thinks, his breakdown near complete.* - Wed Nov 25 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) shakes his head. "There is no peace for me! Mengde will have me executed on the spot...He's a monster...You cannot trust him...He acts out a guise of Heroism and Virtue...Of Great Positive Ambition..." The man says, his sobs wracking his body. 

"But he's a beast...A dastardly fiend and a monster...He has been hunting us for years....He was once one of us..But he lost his mind and began hunting us down...Once our comrade...Now our judge, jury, and executioner..." The individual states with sadness.* - Wed Nov 25 08:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you aren't listening to her. - Wed Nov 25 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Our options are to kill you or bring you back to the village. - Wed Nov 25 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) shakes his head. "You children have no chance of killing me if I decide I want to leave this place...Your best bet is to tell Mengde that you killed me and go on with your life...If you don't...I cannot ensure your safety."* - Wed Nov 25 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) chuckles as his entire chakra signature disappears. "Where the hell do you think that technique came from?" He states, his voice seemingly coming from everywhere.* - Wed Nov 25 08:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) 's form suddenlly appears as he wheels past the three individuals. He swings at them with multiple blades. Each strike is aimed at cutting them across the body with the intent of causing a modicum of damage. No real lasting damage, just light cuts across their skin. The man was toying with his prey in the mist as he wheels in and out of seemingly existence. 

"You are in my pearly realm now..."* - Wed Nov 25 08:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Liu Fengxian(They.Call.Me.Wynn) chuckles after having attacked the two shinobi. "You kids are foolish if you believe Mengde is as virtuous as he pretends to be...Hopefully for your sake....You don't fall into his claws and fall before his blade as his friends and family did. "When you see him...Tell my little brother...He'll never claim my life."* - Wed Nov 25 09:13:23 2015
