<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) grunts in anger as he summons his mech from its scroll. Seithin gets inside of the machine and turns to the Mizukage's mansion. He would surge is chakra in it, this would cause the mech to activate to its full power. The boy then causes it to hold up its gun and aim at the Mizukage's mansion. 

"I hope you all burn in hell." He says as he pulls the trigger. The gun would fire about 500 senbon at the building. They would rip through it and tear through the place, damaging and destroying just about everything inside. 

As Seithin's gun begins to overheat, he stops firing and deactivates the mech. He leaps out and reseals it to its scroll. "Rose...If you have any respect for yourself or your village...You'll leave with me, right now." He says as he begins to run from the village.*

<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (some people argue whether he is really madara, but he has to be. Who else could he be)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (When he talked about his past, we seem him as a young Madara(
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He is someone from Madara's past)

<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He isn't Madara)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (If he was, Madara couldn't have been resurrected)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Why not? Perhaps he changed bodies like Orochimaru)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (or some kind of DNA clone)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Cause his soul would have to reside in the pure world...aka dead

<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Clone isn't the real one either.)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (However, Clone isn't too far-fetched)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He called himself a shell of his former self)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (With Zetsu subsitute ability)

<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (that he claimed to have given to Nagato)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Like I said. He is someone with CLOSE connections to madara)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Imo)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He is just a super Zetsu)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He showed Zetsu traits)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Even if he was Madara's best friend or relative, he couldnt get an EMS without having a brother with a mangekyou sharingan)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Unless he stole Madara's EMS)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Tobi doesn't have ems)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He doesnt?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He only has sharingan)

<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Did he lie?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Its a possibility. )
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (How could he phase through objects without EMS?)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Normal sharingan doesnt have such power)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (and teleport)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He isn't a normal person)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He experiments alot with sharingan)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He could have made a super sharingan with such an ability)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Which is why, i dnt really like to argue bout tobi)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Really?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Too many possibilities)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He is complicated)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (And that)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (So...I say people should just wait until his shiz is revealed)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (So we can all be happy naruto readers)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Yeah its so hard to predict this stuff)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Although I wonder if Sasuke will obtain Rinnegan and Naruto the physical body, and then when they confront the big bad, they merge their powers

<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Maybe they will show Naruto as Hokage in the epilogue)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Lol. I'd hope so. Unless something happens that is a legit reason for him not to be hokage)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (imma bbl...gotta do some HW)

After spending countless hours trying to master his Byakugan and his clan's gentle fist style, he was panting heavily.

He was confused at why a stray Shuriken just came flying out of nowhere until suddenly thousands of Shuriken came flying from every direction concievable and Taishi quickly went into a defensive stance and attempted to dodge as many as he could but there was just too many and he was beginning to recieve cuts and bruises all over his body as more and more begun to make contact. Taishi closed his eyes and focused, he knew that if he didn't do something soon, he would die. He began focusing all of his remaining chakra around his body and began to spin as fast as he could until the chakra became visible and formed a powerful barrier that deflected every attack. When the shuriken barrage had ceased, Taishi had stopped spinning and was breathing heavily, barely able to stand up. "What in the world...was that?"*

<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (and letting me know if it's good enough to learn the Jutsu
<br><font color=yellow>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) Damien Valde went off to the outskirts of the Village to see if he can create a new Jutsu before the Chuunins began. He sighed as he began to inhale and exhale; calming down his body and letting his Chakra run free inside him. Even though his Chakra had the ability to be used for the Water and Earth elements, he wanted to fully master one element before working towards the other. He reached into his bag and pulled out a quick outline of a Jutsu he had been working on for a while now.

He wasn't sure of the name but the basis of the Jutsu is that he goes underground which causes him to disappear from sight. Suddenly, he would travel through the ground to either escaoe from any harm or possibly launch a surprise attack onto the target. Even though this sounded simple, Damien was quite sure it would be tougher to do.

He walked over to where there was a large empty field of dirt and meditated in the center. He was letting his Chakra flow through him easily and build up in power. After a few minutes he got up and quickly went to work. He planted his feet solidly onto the ground and began to let his Chakra escape his body. After preforming some hand signs, his Chakra travelled through his legs and onto the ground below him. The dirt rumbled and Damien focused his Chakra so that it would force the dirt below him to seperate.

The dirt below him began to slowly part causing his body to sink inside the dirt. Just as he began to reach the halfway point, Damien broke his concentration and suddenly stopped moving. Frusterated, he got out of the hole and walked a few feet down to take a break. He took a few breaths again to regain the Chakra he had lost in the failed attempt. After about 15 minutes of break time, it was time to give it another try.

He got up and went near the area he had done his first attempt at the Jutsu. Like before he repeated the handsigns and let his Chakra flow through him and enter the ground. The ground under his feet began to part ways and his body began to sink into the ground slightly faster than before. After a few moments, his entire body was in a hole underground, bringing a smile to his lips. Part one of the jutsu was complete.

He used his Chakra to close the hole on top of him leaving himself in a dark hole 7 feet under the ground. He placed his right hand onto the dirt infront of him and he let his Chakra flow through his arms and into the dirt. Just like in the beginning, the dirt began to open a hole; a hole larg enough for Damien to crawl through. As he crawled through the hole, he made it so that the hole closed behind him.

As he crawled through the dirt, he was able to use his Chakra to sense what was going on above the surface and position himself above his opponent. Damien stopped and placed a hand on the Dirt above him and began to manipulate the dirt like he had been doing multiple amounts of time before. The dirt separated and he launched himself through the hole. Suddenly he bursted from the ground and into the surface above and landed on the grass nearby. Panting, Damien rolled over and smiled to himself. He had just completed the Jutsu. All he needed to do know was master it.*
