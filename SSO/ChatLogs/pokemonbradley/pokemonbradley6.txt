"You feign ignorance, you deny the true rulers by easily being fooled by a scroll. " A slam on the table with a closed fist was produced. "Not only has the audacious people of other countries come to wreak havoc among this country, not only has others come to this country, and killed my sibling. This fatuous letter you receive, I do not comprehend its authenticity nor do I want to believe it.  I've already accepted your proposal of one hundred percent control of the military, and then you change your mind." 

It was clear that Genesis had a mixture of anger from the previous events, and the present. Kojiro's will had been implanted into her own, to restore the glory of the Yamanshi Dynasty, and she will not be rejected that right. When ancients of her clan have ruled. * - Fri Oct  9 18:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) is somewhat surprized of the revelations of this event. Perhaps there was some form of fear due to the extreme combat taking place, that'd probably threaten Sabo's and her own life. She'd begin to flee away from the scene.* - Fri Oct  9 18:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) continued to flee. "T-This was what I was speaking about!--Comrades fighting amongst comrades, that is the downfall of this country!" She yelled out in a hesitant tone. This is a scary incident indeed, hopefully her life is still not taken from these brutes! * - Fri Oct  9 19:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) | Freedom. it was there, in front of her eyes . .She'd be able to make it out of this  hellhole. Instead, she's found with a foot across her head, the surge of pain is intense, major damage done to her head as her body is smashed into a wall. Blood squited outwards, but this brutality wasn't even the conclusion of Misa's assault. Picked up by the feet, shed be swinged around before tossed towards what would be the same person who killed Sabo. .

Her life seemed to be draining out of her. Her body trembled crazily, feeling herself slip into another realm. .  the realm of the dead. She couldn't die here. . she was so close, she needed to protect her siblings, she needed to do as Kojiro commanded of her. . To restore the glory of the Yamanshis. She couldn't feel anything. . . an eye glanced towards Hideki with ultimate scorn. "Y. .Y o . . . .u . . " She barely managed to utter out. .  

She was going to die thats for sure unless a miracle happend.* - Fri Oct  9 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) begins to crawl out of the structure, she isn't. .  weak as she is, she can't succumb. . . to this. she can't meet her downfall otherwise the clan. . will become extinct. . .* - Fri Oct  9 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) | This is the conclusion of their efforts. Blood drools out from the girl's mouth, the fragments of the mask stabbed into their cheeks, their face and head severely damaged as well with their body mangled. It brings curiosity as to how they're moving--or rather crawling with so much damages. . it's obvious given a few more hours, they will definitely succumb to death. Her clothes are tattered as if she's crawled through the lands to get to this civilization.

Her body ultimately finally fell harshly on the ground after her knees gave out from the crawling, and lack of nourishment. Her brain and head is crying out in the howls of agony. Her body aches. However her will to live is absurd.* - Fri Oct  9 20:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) | There seemed to be no hope, the remains of a dying civilization was all that is founded. Dead bodies, and the destruction of the village is all seen with the remains of her own strength. Is this to be her burial grounds? Weakly raising a single hand to hold onto Kirie. "K. .Koji. . . S. . Sabo. . . .  N . i za.  . Ki. .ll. .ed . . All . . Go. . ne. . " She felt . .  calm. . at this moment, as if the moments of death was slowly overlaying onto her form. This felt peaceful.

The hand started to rub on Kirie's cheek this time, feeling the softness of her face. However painful it may be to do this, Genesis still felt Kirie's cheek. * - Fri Oct  9 20:43:18 2015

" She managed to speak once more, however unhealthy it is. There is an ungodly amount of spite for those two individuals. . that is what it is developing into, at least, but what can such a feeble person such as herself do? She's dying anyway unless a medic can aid her. Kumogakure. . . really is meeting its end, it seems. Genesis failed Kojiro's wishes.* - Fri Oct  9 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) | The feeling of life finally continued to seep out from her soulcase. Genesis finally is dying as expected, her adversaries truly quiver in joy for their wishes to go answered. A final exhale made, she had no final words to give. To her, no one would care about them. 

The Yamanshi wanted to do what was right for her country, but in the end. . her own country is the one to drive their sword into her heart. Eyes begin to close slowly, her body became limp. Yamanshi, Genesis is hereby pronounced dead. . she has passed onto into the realm of the dead, perhaps maybe she'd get to have a drink with her brother, Kojiro.* - Fri Oct  9 21:48:09 2015
