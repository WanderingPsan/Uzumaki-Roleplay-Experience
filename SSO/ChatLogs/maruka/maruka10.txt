His eyes then turned crimson as his his from within his iris a tomoe appears, swirling at an fast pace. Then as it slowed down it stopped right above his pupil, sitting on a ring that surrounded his pupil. Then with his crimson eyes, he took both his blades that had chakra running through them and twirled them at his side slowly in a circle for about two times. After he'd do that, he would grip the handles firmly as they point forward. Then with the pivot of his foot, he turned his eyes onto the tree to his left. With that, he'd swing both of his katanas out to slash and hack at the tree. Leaving electrical burn marks onto the tree. After a few sets of combos, Mitarashi simply stopped the stream of lighting that ran through his sword, as well as cutting off the flow of chakra that was going towards his eyes. After that, he'd raise his katanas into the air above his head and does a vertical slash downwards at the ground with all his might, aiming to clean the blades a little bit from all the bark that might be on it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) sighed as he went to pick up a broom from one of the ultility closets in the Raikage Mansion. Afterwards he would walk towards the front entrance to the mansion and examine the walk way as there were no stairs for him to even sweep. How is he suppose to sweep stairs if all there is is pure dirt. But atleast even if he did a bad job, no one would notice at all. So half assing it wouldn't even make a difference.* - Wed Dec  2 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) then begins to start sweeping. Using a simple push, bring back, and repeat method to sweep it all down to the base of the walk way as he continued to sweep downwards. Keeping a good, quick, and easy pattern so that he wouldn't miss anything on his way down. Picking up and tossing rocks to the side as he comes across them as well. * - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) was now at the mid way point of sweeping the walk way to the Raikage Mansion. At this point, the only thing he had infront of him was just a couple of trash and pebbles. Though once Mitarashi had swept everything down to the base of the walk way, he'd pick up the trash that was on the floor and place them into the trash can. Then he went back and began to spread out the pebbles out so no one would really trip on them. After that was all done, he'd simply go back to the ultility closet and place the broom back into the closet before moving on to the next mission.* - Thu Dec  3 00:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) had then stood in a way so that his shoulders would be shoulder-width apart. Then rolling his shoulders forward, rounding his back, and reach out as if he was going to hug a tree. In the same motion, brings his arms slowly back to your sides. Next he simply brings one of his arms across his body at about chest-level. Locking that arm in place and really stretch it by using his other arm to do so. Holding it for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite arm. He then next decides to work on his legs, first by lowering his body he extremely spread out his legs and lean your weight onto one leg while keeping the opposite leg completely straight. Hold for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite leg. After doing these stretches he gets stands on both feet and runs in place lightly, slapping his face. Aiming to get himself a bit pummped for what was next.* - Tue Dec  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) then gets on the floor standing up on his hands and knees with his hands underneath his shoulders but slightly wider than his shoulders. Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position. Repeating this about five times, trying to not strain himself anymore then he needs to.* - Tue Dec  8 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) then pushed himself back up on the last set. He then moved his right hand across the floor to help prop himself onto the floor. His body was flat on the ground, He then moved his feet flat on the floor sliding them up close to his butt. There was about a 5 to 7 inch distance between his heel and his but creating a sort of V shape with his legs. He then placed his hands on opposing shoulders, so that his arms are crossed over your chest. Keeping his heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, he slowly lifts his head, followed by his shoulder blades. Focusing his eyes on his bent knees. Pulling up from the floor until he was at a ninety-degree angle. After holding for it for 2 seconds he lowers his upper body back down onto the floor. He then repeats this for about 9 more times, before he got up from the floor and dusted himself off.* - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) would then bring both of his hands together as he took a deep breath, before he preformed a single handseal an channeled his chakra throughout his entire body. Then molding and charging that chakra with his lightning affinity. Afterwards using that raiton charged chakra to surface and surround his entire body. This made a visable surge of electricity to show around his body. To execute the jutsu, he'd send a burst of chakra out. Causing the air around him to fill with Raiton, shocking anything that was within arms lengths.* - Tue Dec  8 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) writes onto a scroll with information of what he is doing, with the Raikages name on it. After he was done writing on the scroll, he'd scroll it up and place it into a shoot that the messenger bird had on its ankles, before sending it off the Kumogakure.* - Tue Dec  8 01:27:53 2015
