<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) drew out his sword from its sheathe and held it out towards his side with one hand. Then he would swing the sword out towards his front so that he may grasp it with both hands tightly. Gripping onto it tightly, Mitarashi slowly inhaled and exhaled as he begins to mold his chakra and lightning affinity. Then with a sudden burst of chakra, he'd flow his chakra and affinity into the katana blade. Allowing a steady stream of electricity to run through his blade. Afterwards, he'd bring his katana up into the air infront of him as he exams the electricity flowing through his blade.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) keeping his lightning affinity running through his sword as he brought it down towards his side with his right hand. Then with his left hand, he'd reach for his Mahiru Katana and drew it from its sheathe. Holding it firm with his left as he held it infront of him. He then tightened his grip even harder as he strained his muscles. Inhaling and Exhaling slowly as he molded his chakra and channeled his lightning affinity towards his left hand. Then with a burst of chakra, Mitarashi send a surge of lightning through his Mahiru Katana with the flow of chakra he was sending in it. The blade would have been covered with a steady stream of electricity in it as he held down towards his side with his left hand. Closing his eyes as he begins to take a deep breath, Mitarashi started to flow chakra into his eyes. His eyes then turned crimson as his his from within his iris a tomoe appears, swirling at an fast pace. Then as it slowed down it stopped right above his pupil, sitting on a ring that surrounded his pupil. Then with his crimson eyes, he took both his blades that had chakra running through them and twirled them at his side slowly in a circle for about two times. After he'd do that, he would grip the handles firmly as they point forward. Then with the pivot of his foot, he turned his eyes onto the tree to his left. With that, he'd swing both of his katanas out to slash and hack at the tree. Leaving electrical burn marks onto the tree. After a few sets of combos, Mitarashi simply stopped the stream of lighting that ran through his sword, as well as cutting off the flow of chakra that was going towards his eyes. After that, he'd raise his katanas into the air above his head and does a vertical slash downwards at the ground with all his might, aiming to clean the blades a little bit from all the bark that might be on it. Then finaly, Mitarashi twirled his katana into a rewerse grip before he slides them back into their respective sheathes.* - Sat Nov 28 20:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: You will...also see it in action.. - Sun Nov 29 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) gave Akito a firm nod before he'd bend his knees and place hand onto one of his katana. He then took off and ran at Akito as he began to draw his blade, holding onto it firmly with both hands.* - Sun Nov 29 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) thought to himself as Akito sent out the ball of raiton and spoke. "He wants unpredictable? I got you." he thought to himself, as he mold his own chakra and surrounds himself in it and poured his Doton affinity into it. While he did this he'd lean backwards as he used his heels to stop his momentum as he fell back. So that once his preperation for his jutsu was done, his body would just fall into the ground and reseal the entrace of where he came from. Then once he was undeground he'd begin to move closer to Akito from about 20 feet in the ground. 

[Mb, My aunt from florida came lol]* - Sun Nov 29 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) moved into position undergound so that he would be right beside Akito if he jumped out. Once he got into position, he'd begin to rise up to the surface he'd begin to think to himself and remembered that Akito did have a ball of Raiton in between his hands. At this point he'd think that if he popped up out the ground he'd be blasted with it and get shocked. "Alright, I'll do something about that jutsu before I consider attacking him upfront." he thought to himself. Mitarashi then popped out from the ground with his katana firmly gripped into his right hand, and his right arm being held across his chest to the point that his katana was pointing downwards behind his back. Then with no delay, Mitarashi would swing downwards with the handle of his blade towards Akito. Aiming to slam the bottom of the handle into his wrists.

While he was swinging his katana, Mitarashi would at the same time grab onto the handle of his Mahiru Katana and would begin to draw it from its sheathe.* - Sun Nov 29 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) whispers: -12 reflex- - Sun Nov 29 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) only thought was "Crap." as Akito turned to him and said 'To Slow.' and dodged his attack agaisnt him. But lucky for him, Akito didn't decide to attack him with his ball of Raiton. So right now, Mitarashi took this chance to fully draw his Mahiru katana and aimed to slam the back of the handle inbetween Akito's hands to stop him from making anymore handseals.

But if he had failed, Mitarashi would have been shocked by the ninjutsu. Causing his limbs to go numb and allowing Akito to easly take his katana out of his hand. Then falling onto the floor as the numbing slowly goes away.

But if he had succeeded, Mitarashi would land back onto both of his feet with both of his katana's in hand. He'd then flip them around with a quick spin of his Mahiru blade, so that he would be attacking with the back of the blade instead of the sharp edge. And while doing that, he'd take his main katana and swing it infront of him towards Akito. Aiming to only give him a slash strong and deep enough to only give him a fleash wound instead of a gash.* - Sun Nov 29 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) shaked his head as he steadly reach his hand out for Akito's to help himself up. "I already know that part." he said, standing back up onto his feet and fully resheathed his sword. "Though I just didn't want to do anything to get you out of my range." he stated, reaching for his katana that was embedded into the ground and picked it up. Then with a short but strong downwards strike to get the dirt off of it, Mitarashi placed it back into its sheathe.* - Sun Nov 29 21:25:32 2015
