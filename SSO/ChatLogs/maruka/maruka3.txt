<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) started by standing with his feet shoulder width apart. Rolling his shoulders forward, rounding his back, and reach out as if he was going to hug a tree. In the same motion, brings his arms slowly back to your sides. Next he simply brings one of his arms across his body at about chest-level. Locking that arm in place and really stretch it by using his other arm to do so. Holding it for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite arm. He then next decides to work on his legs, first by lowering his body he extremely spread out his legs and lean your weight onto one leg while keeping the opposite leg completely straight. Hold for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite leg. After doing these stretches he gets stands on both feet and runs in place lightly, slapping his face.* - Tue Oct 20 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) gets on the floor standing up on his hands and knees with his hands underneath his shoulders but slightly wider than his shoulders. Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position. He repeated this for 29 more times do to a total amount of 30 pushups.* - Tue Oct 20 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) pushed himself back up on the last set. He then moved his right hand across the floor to help prop himself onto the floor. His body was flat on the ground, He then moved his feet flat on the floor sliding them up close to his butt. There was about a 5 to 7 inch distance between his heel and his but creating a sort of V shape with his legs. He then placed his hands on opposing shoulders, so that his arms are crossed over your chest. Keeping his heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, he slowly lifts his head, followed by his shoulder blades. Focusing his eyes on his bent knees. Pulling up from the floor until he was at a ninety-degree angle. After holding for it for 2 seconds he lowers his upper body back down onto the floor. He then repeats this for 29 more times to a total of 30 sit ups.* - Tue Oct 20 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) bended his knees and then jumped up into the air as high as he could. Extending his arms out and reaching for the par above him. Gripping onto the bar, Kyushiki began to pull himself up using his arm strength. Keeping his arms bent and using his shoulders to hoist the rest of his body up. Lifting his body up, Kyushiki brought his head about the bar up until his chin was over it saying "One" then slowly reeling himself back down until the top of his head was below the bar. Afterwards pulling his body up once more, till his chin was above the bar. Then slowly back down again. Kyushiki would continue this with ease for about thirteen more times, doing fifteen perfect curl ups.

After the fifth curl up, Kyushiki began to feel the strain on his biceps. But this didn't stop him, slowly bringing his head down below the bar. Her begin to bring his body back up very slow compared to how he was doing it before. Straining his muscles to its limit, Kyushiki's veins would begin to pop out all over his neck and arms. He'd move his head upwards so that his face was facing the sky. Finally bringing his head above the bar, to the middle of his neck before allowing himself to go back downwards again. He'd continue this process for about nine more times. Each one getting slower and slower as he progressed, but this added up to twenty-four curl ups.

But Kyushiki's goal was to do ten this times. This was five more then he originally could do. Letting himself rest for a bit, having his arms bent in an obtuse angle and not straight. He knew that if he fully relaxed he wouldn't be able to do another curl up. So he kept his muscle strain to a minimum and brought his legs up so that they wouldn't touch the ground. Taking deep breaths in and out, resting for about five seconds with his eyes closed. After he was finish resting, Kyushiki opened up his eyes and was ready to finish his last curl up.

Sweating with determination, Kyushiki began to use every ounce of fiber in his body to pull himself up above the bar. Slowly and gradually rising, he'd struggle to the point that he was shaking. His biceps were screaming right now, wanting to rest. But he wouldn't allow them to. Pushing through the pain, Kyushiki would gain a bit more speed. Allowing his head to reach half way above the bar. But his shaking at this point became to the point that it was visible from a far distance. Slowly descending from the bar. Kyushiki's face would show distress on it. Trying his best to keep from not reaching the top of the bar. By the time the top of his head was about to reach the bottom of the bar, an image of his father popped up in his head. At that point, Kyushiki's eyes started to gleam of fire. Letting out a yell at the top of his lungs, he'd pull himself up once more. Moving an increase rate then he was moving at before. Bringing his chin past the bar, but he didn't there he'd continue to the point that his shoulder blades where at the same level as the bar.

After reaching that point, Kyushiki felt an overwhelming warmth of relief. Dropping down and hung by his arms, allowing the tip of his feet touch the ground. Once his feet had touched the ground, he'd let go of the bar and dropped onto his ass then his back. Laying down on the floor and breathing heavily.* - Tue Oct 20 22:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) walks up to address of the elderly lady that he was suppose to take to the market. Knocking on the door before openning, he calls out for the lady by her last name only to see her waiting on her couch for him. She gets up and walks towards the door and exits the building without a single word. Kyushiki then obediantly follows her as she leads him to market.* - Tue Oct 20 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) and the elderly lady finally arrive infront of the market, heading into the area where they hold all the fruits and veggies. She heads over towards the apples and checks for their quality before she randomly starts tossing them towards Kyushiki. Flinching, but catching in the proccess. He was about to question why the old lady did that for, but before he could say anything he was bombarded by even my apples. Having to go out of his way to catch all of them, Leaving him breathless after catching all twenty of them. He'd sit down with all of them in his arms as he took a minute to catch his breath. Then as the old lady walked pass him as he was resting on the floor she silently tossed a paper bag to him to put them in. Giving the old lady a small glare, he obediently placed the apples into the bag and followed along to the next stand* - Tue Oct 20 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) catchs up to the old lady at the watermelon stand. But before he could even come to a hault, she threw a watermelon right above him. So yet again he has to go out of his way to catch by first dropping the bag of apples, then jumping into the air and catching the watermelon with one hand and then bringing it into the to hold it with both hands as he came down. Once he landed again sighed in relief that he caught it. But as he was doing that he got smacked with another watermelon in the chest and fell to the ground. Layed out on the ground, the old lady walked by the fallen Kyushiki and tossed a net to him to place the watermelons in before she moved off to the next section of the market. Leaving Kyushiki to handle the watermelons and the apples.* - Tue Oct 20 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) had placed the watermelons into the net and arrived at the front of the shop that the elderly lady entered with not only the watermelons but the apples too. But right as he got to the front of the store, the lady tossed a stack of cloths ontop of the bag of apples that was in his arms. Causing him to lose his balance and sway around as he tried to regain his balance. Once he had regained his balance, Kyushiki paused for a second to recollect himself. But after only getting about 5 seconds to rest, the elderly lady called him out to follow her and that they are going back. This was a sign of releif as he followed the lady as she gave him directions on how to move.* - Tue Oct 20 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) and the old lady got infront of her house, entering the house and dropping all the cloths and apples onto the table while leaving the watermelons on the floor. Then finaly taking a seat on one of the chairs on the table to rest for a bit. "Your a crazy old lady." he said, while still taking his rest. The old lady stayed silent for a momment as she seats on her chair and begins to knit. Staring at her, Kyushiki was at lost for words at this point. All he knew is that he didn't want to deal with the old lady anymore, so he just walked out of the house and headed towards his next mission.* - Tue Oct 20 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) walks into the storage room. Going from row to row, looking for the followers that this man had ordered fro his lover. After going into the row where it was suppose to be, Kyushiki looked for the order number which was somewhere in the middle of the row, picking up the box and taking the flowers out of them. He'd then exit the storage room and made his way towards this ladys house.* - Tue Oct 20 22:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: You can take the first move. - Thu Oct 22 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) brought his hands together immideatly and performed the tiger handseal. Channeling his chakra towards his stomach and turning it into water within his belly. He then filled his cheeks up with that water as he stepped back a bit from Kyu'Mc, waiting for him to hop up into the air before he released a jet stream of water from his mouth towards Kyu'Mc. Aiming to push him away from Kyushiki and leave a good amount of water along the floor between him and his oppenet.* - Thu Oct 22 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) would only stop the flow of water from coming out of his mouth as he heard a sound that resembled a fish jumping out of the water. Having his cheeks still puff up with water, he spots Kyu'Mc running over at him again. So Kyushiki turned his head towards him and pointed his mouth at his mid section  and launched another jet of water again to stop his advancement and caught him off balance.

After firing the water gun for the second time for a short burst, Kyushiki would run at Kyu'Mc and throw a haymaker towards the side of his face. Followed by another straight punch towards his chest.* - Thu Oct 22 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) didn't preformed any extra handseals at all. All there was him stopping the flow and turning it back on as he repositioned his head. Though, Kyu'Mc would be able to pull up both of his hands to block the strike, Kyushiki would take this to his advantage and abuse it.

So after he shot out a quick burst of water from his mouth, Kyushiki dipped down immidtately and reached into his pocket to pull out a kunai. Lunging at Kyu'Mc, aiming to spear him down to the ground and hold the kunai up to his neck for a submission.

As for Kyu'Mc's side kick, Kyushiki didn't foresee this outcome at all. He didn't know his oppenent to be a kick boxer so this didn't really come to mind. He would have been hit on the side of the due to his new position, but he didn't stop with that due to his brute like physique, He'd still use this to spear the boy down since his one of his legs were up.* - Thu Oct 22 03:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) took a deep breath. Brought both of his hands together right infront fo his chest and preforming three handseals as he channels chakra towards his stomach. Kndeaing that same chakra into water within his stomach and filling his cheeks up with it. "Suiton Release: Mizuramppa!!" he thought to himself, allowing a huge amount of water to gush out of his mouth and smash into the wall infront of him. Causing the water to spash all over everywhere, like a firehose hitting agaisnt a brick wall. Drenching everying around it with cool water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) sighed as the events infront of him unfold. He'd just bring his hands infront of his chest and preformed two handseals, channeling his chakra towards his stomach and turning it into water. He then filled his cheeks up with water and clapped together his hands before he placed both of them infront of him. Then allowing the water to escape from his mouth and fanned out towards Shoji. The water would attempt in surrounding Shoji and incase him in a shpere of water. Restricting his movement and his speech if successful.* - Sun Oct 25 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: To bad they have no room for traps in heaven. - Sun Oct 25 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) had gotten off his jutsu off, but at the cost of being grapped by this guys tenticles. Though he would only allowed on of his hands to get captured by the mans tenticles and blocking his free hand with his body so it would have gotten caught with any the tenticles that were after him. Also standing his ground as he tried his best to absorbe the smack from the lash of the tenticles. So he'd immideatly reach into his back pocket and pull from it a three purple balls that had seemed to be wrapped with explosive tags. He then took his free hand and flinged the tag'd balls at this rando as he held his breath. On impact the balls would have exploded and let out a purple mist, leaving the tags  floating in mid air.

But, atleast this guy had to deal with being covered in water with a bunch of Kumo-nin attacking him with lightning ninjutsu. With that, Kyushiki knew he atleast had back up in case this guy was to much for him. 

As for the acid, Kyushiki's body should have been able to withstand the burns from it. As well as take the damage from the smack of this rando's tenticles. 

[23.3 Defence][19.64 Nin Defence]* - Sun Oct 25 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) saw as this rando just ran at him with his stomach opening up. He thought this guy was donezo from all the lightning and poison. He was going to try and escape from this rando if the lightning had effected him, while he left the posion mist. But alas, this guy didn't even budge and ran at him. Not only that, the poison mist was still here, he was going to have to breath at some point and time. Leaving him to either die by this guy or by the poison. So instead, Kyushiki thought to himself saying he'd die to neither.

Being gripped onto by the stomach and the claw digging into his chest, Kyushiki  tried his best to hold his breath and bare with the pain. While he did this, he'd reach into his pocket and bring out his kunai. Holding it at the read, he'd shoot his arm out with the kunai and tried to peirce the rando right in one of his eyes. Aiming to ram it as far as he could into his head. This wasn't Kyushiki's day to die, and he knew that himself.

Unless he was wrong and he would die within the next few second due to either being eaten, torn to shreads, or death my poison. Totaly not even caring about the attack that is happening right now.* - Sun Oct 25 01:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) falls onto the floor as the cuts on his chest begins to drip blood. Sitting himself up as he takes this time to relax a bit as he contiues to hold his breath in this poison mist. But this was only because Maloth had started to scream. He knew this rando would be taken care of.

After a few second, Kyushiki got up to his feet and left the mist.* - Sun Oct 25 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) heard a man zoon past himw ith some enhanced speed. He definatly wasn't going that way. He also heard maloth running in the same direction. So he was absolutly not going that way. So instead he walks the other way.* - Sun Oct 25 02:02:52 2015
