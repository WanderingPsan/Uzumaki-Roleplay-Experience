While he was flying towards the right, he had removed his bubble pipe from his mouth and pulled out from his pocket three shurikens. Throwing them at Aden's right hand side, aiming for his shoulder and the area he would be if he had desided to move towards the right. But as this happened, Kyushiki commanded his bubbles to flow from the trees and fly towards Aden from the left side.

So he might as well go first and start off light by putting up his guard and slowly inching forward towards Shiro. Once he got near her, He'd just throw a light jab out towards her chin just to feel her out a bit. He didn't want to just rush in randomly and get himself decked by a random drop kick.* - Sat Nov 14 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) could have probably blocked the attack, but he decided not to at all. Instead he'd take the blow to his right side and bring his right arm to quickly grab onto her leg. The blow to his side would have indeed cause pain to him, but the only thing that it gave him was grin on his face with a bit of a blush. The masochistic habits that Kyushiki had tried to stop and overcome with willpower and constant training had failed him. But the grin wasn't due to his masochist side, but from his love for fighting and ability to laugh at pain when recived. With that being said, Kyushiki takes the blow and shoots his right hand down towards Shiro's leg, aiming to lock it with his arms.

If he was successful in binding Shiro's leg, he'd use his left hand and bring it down towards his right hand as he began to preform handseals.* - Sat Nov 14 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) noticed the twist of the body Shiro was making to launch out a kick towards him. Reacting to it immideatly, Kysuhiki had turned his head towards Shiro's incoming kick and allowed water to spew from out of his mouth and at her foot. The water might have absorbed Shiro's kick as it gushed out his mouth, if not it would just simply lessen the damage that came from it. But either way, Kysuhiki's jutsu would have been stopped even as his face was kicked. The water would coil around Shiro as it started to shape into a sphere around her. While this was happening, Kyushiki would have moved his left arm out and placed it straight with his palms showing. As for his right arm that was trying to restrain Shiro's leg, it would have still held onto it untill the point where it would be caught in the water prison as well. So when it got to that point, Kyushiki would slide back so he was out of the spheres range and leave only his hand out inside of the sphere.

If all went well, Shiro would have been confinded inside of a sphere shaped water prison. Robbing her of her movement but still being allowed to speak. As for Kyushiki, he may or may have not been bleeding from the side of his head based on events that led or might not have leg towards Shiro's inprisionment.* - Sat Nov 14 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) || Though if the situation was right, Shiro could have broken out of it. But from this writers perspective, She would of had one of her legs caught in the current of the water. Not only that, she had no feet on the ground during the time the prison had started to form. But her leg movement was above average in all sorts. But at the same time, Kyushiki's jutsu was fast due to his control and mastery over his element. So when she would have tried to move out of the range of his sphere, she would have probably backed into water already.

But if she did escape his jutsu, Kyushiki would stop the jutsu and clap together his hands and channel his chakra out towards the water that was all around him. Which would then accumilate around him in a circle rapidly, untill it made a gaint vortex of water. Which would then implode on itself and send a huge wave of water towards Shiro.

But if Shiro had not escaped his jutsu, Kyushiki would exhale loudly as he rubbed the side of his head where Shiro had kicked on him. "Got damn..... Why does it hurt but feels good at the same time......" he thought to himself, still not being able to control his inner masochistic feelings. "So like..... Checkmate?" he would ask.* - Sat Nov 14 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||Update: Kyushiki has a fractured jaw and rib cage due to rape.

Shiro had succesfully broken out of Kyushiki's water prison and landed a clean blow onto his nuts. This was a sad day for him indeed.

As soon as the blow hits, Kyushiki would squil out in a silent tone as he fell onto his knees and then faced first into the ground. "She punched me in the dick..... Why? Why did she punch me in the dick....." he said in a high toned voice as he layed there all hurt and his face in the dirt to hide his blushes kicked in from his masochistic nature.* - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) had been turned onto his back and his chest stopped on to push him into the ground.

"Fuck you. Stop." he said, still in pain from the blow he recived.* - Sat Nov 14 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) pulled his hands up and formed a single handseal right as Shiro started to move her foot across his stomach. Then out of his mouth came a jet of water which would have pushed pushed Shiro up in the air and away from him if it had landed.

"Don't act all high and mighty when someone held back."* - Sat Nov 14 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) would have just simply stopped his jet as from spewing out and reangled his head back at Shiro's lower waist and or torso, right before he spewed it back out again and at her. Aiming to get her to back off of him entirely. And as for her foot that may or may have not still came at him, Kyushiki would simply bring his hands up from his chest and block the stomp from connecting to his neck.* - Sat Nov 14 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) jutsu had failed do to his OOC knowledge of how to jutsu actually works. But lucky for him he had more up his sleeve. 

As Shiro's trys to slam his hands into the ground, Kyushiki would use that momment to open up his hands and clap them together on impact of the ground as he channeled his chakra. This would have caused the water around them to begin to circle around and form into a water vortex. The vortex would have then closed up at the top and implode on itself, sweeping up Shiro with in the current of things but leaving Kyushiki safe inside  it. After it imploded the current would then keep its self flowing around and push Shiro all across the desert.* - Sun Nov 15 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||Update, Not only did he have a fractured ripcage and Jaw, but now his forearms are broken in half.

Couldn't do anything as he was repeatedly stomped on at his neck and stomach. Which would have literaly broken his neck at this point in time. All that Kyushiki could do is grunt in immense pain.* - Sun Nov 15 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) was basicly paralyzed from the waist down now. Only thing he could do was look at her and say. "Fuck." then after a brief pause "You."* - Sun Nov 15 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) drew out his sword from its sheathe and held it out towards his side with one hand. Then he would swing the sword out towards his front so that he may grasp it with both hands tightly. Gripping onto it tightly, Mitarashi slowly inhaled and exhaled as he begins to mold his chakra and lightning affinity. Then with a sudden burst of chakra, he'd flow his chakra and affinity into the katana blade. Allowing a steady stream of electricity to run through his blade. Afterwards, he'd bring his katana up into the air infront of him as he exams the electricity flowing through his blade.

"Alright good...... I'm able to use this jutsu now. But it would be nice to be able to use it fast enough for it to actually become a surprise to people I'm fighting." he thought to himself.* - Sun Nov 15 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) keeping his lightning affinity running through his sword as he brought it down towards his side with his right hand. Then with his left hand, he'd reach for his Mahiru Katana and drew it from its sheathe. Holding it firm with his left as he held it infront of him. He then tightened his grip even harder as he strained his muscles. Inhaling and Exhaling slowly as he molded his chakra and channeled his lightning affinity towards his left hand. Then with a burst of chakra, Mitarashi send a surge of lightning through his Mahiru Katana with the flow of chakra he was sending in it. The blade would have been covered with a steady stream of electricity in it as he held down towards his side with his left hand.

Closing his eyes as he begins to take a deep breath, Mitarashi started to flow chakra into his eyes. His eyes then turned crimson as his his from within his iris a tomoe appears, swirling at an fast pace. Then as it slowed down it stopped right above his pupil, sitting on a ring that surrounded his pupil. Then with his crimson eyes, he took both his blades that had chakra running through them and twirled them at his side slowly in a circle for about two times. After he'd do that, he would grip the handles firmly as they point forward. Then with the pivot of his foot, he turned his eyes onto the tree to his left. With that, he'd swing both of his katanas out to slash and hack at the tree. Leaving electrical burn marks onto the tree. After a few sets of combos, Mitarashi simply stopped the stream of lighting that ran through his sword, as well as cutting off the flow of chakra that was going towards his eyes. After that, he'd raise his katanas into the air above his head and does a vertical slash downwards at the ground with all his might, aiming to clean the blades a little bit from all the bark that might be on it. Then finaly, Mitarashi twirled his katana into a rewerse grip before he slides them back into their respective sheathes.* - Sun Nov 15 09:43:15 2015
