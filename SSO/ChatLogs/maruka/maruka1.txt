<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) started by standing with his feet shoulder width apart. Rolling his shoulders forward, rounding his back, and reach out as if he was going to hug a tree. In the same motion, brings his arms slowly back to your sides. Next he simply brings one of his arms across his body at about chest-level. Locking that arm in place and really stretch it by using his other arm to do so. Holding it for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite arm. He then next decides to work on his legs, first by lowering his body he extremely spread out his legs and lean your weight onto one leg while keeping the opposite leg completely straight. Hold for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite leg. After doing these stretches he gets stands on both feet and runs in place lightly, slapping his face.* - Sun Sep 06 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) gets on the floor standing up on his hands and knees with his hands underneath his shoulders but slightly wider than his shoulders. Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position. He repeated this for 29 more times do to a total amount of 30 pushups.* - Sun Sep 06 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) pushed himself back up on the last set. He then moved his right hand across the floor to help prop himself onto the floor. His body was flat on the ground, He then moved his feet flat on the floor sliding them up close to his butt. There was about a 5 to 7 inch distance between his heel and his but creating a sort of V shape with his legs. He then placed his hands on opposing shoulders, so that his arms are crossed over your chest. Keeping his heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, he slowly lifts his head, followed by his shoulder blades. Focusing his eyes on his bent knees. Pulling up from the floor until he was at a ninety-degree angle. After holding for it for 2 seconds he lowers his upper body back down onto the floor. He then repeats this for 29 more times to a total of 30 sit ups.* - Sun Sep 06 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) bended his knees and then jumped up into the air as high as he could. Extending his arms out and reaching for the par above him. Gripping onto the bar, Kyushiki began to pull himself up using his arm strength. Keeping his arms bent and using his shoulders to hoist the rest of his body up. Lifting his body up, Kyushiki brought his head about the bar up until his chin was over it saying "One" then slowly reeling himself back down until the top of his head was below the bar. Afterwards pulling his body up once more, till his chin was above the bar. Then slowly back down again. Kyushiki would continue this with ease for about thirteen more times, doing fifteen perfect curl ups.

After the fifth curl up, Kyushiki began to feel the strain on his biceps. But this didn't stop him, slowly bringing his head down below the bar. Her begin to bring his body back up very slow compared to how he was doing it before. Straining his muscles to its limit, Kyushiki's veins would begin to pop out all over his neck and arms. He'd move his head upwards so that his face was facing the sky. Finally bringing his head above the bar, to the middle of his neck before allowing himself to go back downwards again. He'd continue this process for about nine more times. Each one getting slower and slower as he progressed, but this added up to twenty-four curl ups.

But Kyushiki's goal was to do ten this times. This was five more then he originally could do. Letting himself rest for a bit, having his arms bent in an obtuse angle and not straight. He knew that if he fully relaxed he wouldn't be able to do another curl up. So he kept his muscle strain to a minimum and brought his legs up so that they wouldn't touch the ground. Taking deep breaths in and out, resting for about five seconds with his eyes closed. After he was finish resting, Kyushiki opened up his eyes and was ready to finish his last curl up.

Sweating with determination, Kyushiki began to use every ounce of fiber in his body to pull himself up above the bar. Slowly and gradually rising, he'd struggle to the point that he was shaking. His biceps were screaming right now, wanting to rest. But he wouldn't allow them to. Pushing through the pain, Kyushiki would gain a bit more speed. Allowing his head to reach half way above the bar. But his shaking at this point became to the point that it was visible from a far distance. Slowly descending from the bar. Kyushiki's face would show distress on it. Trying his best to keep from not reaching the top of the bar. By the time the top of his head was about to reach the bottom of the bar, an image of his father popped up in his head. At that point, Kyushiki's eyes started to gleam of fire. Letting out a yell at the top of his lungs, he'd pull himself up once more. Moving an increase rate then he was moving at before. Bringing his chin past the bar, but he didn't there he'd continue to the point that his shoulder blades where at the same level as the bar.

After reaching that point, Kyushiki felt an overwhelming warmth of relief. Dropping down and hung by his arms, allowing the tip of his feet touch the ground. Once his feet had touched the ground, he'd let go of the bar and dropped onto his ass then his back. Laying down on the floor and breathing heavily.* - Sun Sep 06 21:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The Kumogakure shinobi prepared for a fight as soon as they saw the Amgakure troops at konoha. The Doton Unit would have lined up together and made a file of two rows, and used Earth Style: Mud Wall. Having each wall being held up with another behind it, blocking the the path of the raging waves of the Suiton attack from the Amegakure troops.

As for the fire ball jutsu that was lauched towards them, it would have been stopped by the earth wall aswell. Even if the fire jutsu was amplyfied, there was only one person using the fire ball technique so the damage wouldn't have been alot in terms of quantity. But as the Doton Unit kept up their defenses, the Suiton Unit wayed in the back, using Baku to great larg amounts of water combined with the water that the Amegakure Suiton Unit made. Except for five soliders who instead began to preform handseals right in the middle of it. But that would remain unknown as this happened behind the Mud Wall.* - Mon Sep 07 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The Kumogakure forces mud wall was broken down by the Jibashi, but as soon as the first Layer of mud wall break, the 100 doton unit shinobi back up way from the mud wall in hopes to be out of the jibashi's range.

Kyushiki looked up at Osamu as he was ontop of the mud wall and spoke out to him. "Is this a cease fire momment? If not your stupid." The Doton unit stood ready with hand seals being formed and locked. Being ready to launch an attack towards Osamu at the ready.

As for the Suiton Unit, the five continued to preform handseals. But the remaining 95 stopped using baku and stood ready for defending.* - Mon Sep 07 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The Kumogakure Doton and the 95 Suiton Unit placed down their hands for a cease fire. But as for the 5 Suiton unit in the back, they continued to preform handseals. But they were hidden behind some of the other Shinobi so their handseals couldn't be noticed unless there was a sensor.

Kyushiki then spoke out among the rest. "Yup. What you need?"* - Mon Sep 07 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The 5 Suiton Unit Shinobi were still preforming handseals in the back.

Kyushiki raised an eye brow at this, "So what happens if we win? You guys gonna sit there and die?" he asked.* - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The 5 memebers of the suiton unit wouldn't stop at all.

Kyushiki would remain there  looking at him in slilence for a brief momment as he tilted his head. "Naw. Their fine. I don't want their hard work to be in vein. I'll pick low, so is it best two out of three?" he shouted, having a grin on his face.* - Mon Sep 07 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) laughed out loud before saying "Fire" in a soft tone but it was loud enough for the Osamu and his friends to hear it.

The five amegakure suiton units had successfuly finished what they have been preparing for. Kyushiki was only using that oppertunity to buy time for them, since Klaus had decided to part ways with them. Leaving Kyushiki the only one who could be an ace within the troops. The water that had been gathered up by the 95 Suiton Units and the water produced by the Amegakure shinobi, also including the water from the river next to them. They all were used for each of the 5 Kumogakure Shinobi's Water Dragon Technique. Both of the water dragons stood in alignment next to each other right before they soared overhead of Kyushiki and the other 195 Kumogakure shinobi. Making its way towards Osamu and the rest of the Amegakure and Zetsumo forces. Aiming to was them away with all five of the water dragons.

As for the rest of the Kumogakure shinobi, they proccedded to retreat and head back to Kumogakure amists the chaos brought by the water dragons.* - Mon Sep 07 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) ||
The Kumogakure troops were in retreat at this point. This wasn't a fight they could really win right now, even with the water dragon attempt. But as Kyushiki looked back to see how they faired agaisnt the water dragon. It had seemed as if it worked, even with their aces hurt and covered with water. With seeing that, Kyushiki ordered the 5 suiton users to fall back and told the 50 lightning unit shinobi to step up infront of them. They would wait untill everyone was out of the wet zone before they preformed 5 handseals and charged their hands with their lightning affinitys. They would use the jibashi ninjutsu and slam their palms onto the surface of the water, but before they did that the doton unit would use mud wall to give them a light boost above they water so that they wouldn't get caugh in it themselves. The 50 jibashi would electify the water and possibly roasting the Amegakure shinobi alive. Based on the out come of this attempt, it would decide if the Kumogakure shinobi would stay or not.* - Mon Sep 07 01:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) was always kind and helpful to everyone around him. Considering the village that he lived in this was very rare. He trained and practiced and always helped those that was around him grow strong with him. If there was someone weak in his class he would help them get stronger. Shiba was a star student some people admired him some didn't. 
But while he was still in the academy around the age of 11, His house was attacked by Konoha Shinobi. Right in front of his eyes his parents were tortured right in front of him and he was forced to watch. His father was ripped in half cut into pieces. His mother was brutally rapped and had her head sawed off with one of their kitchen knife. As the Shinobi did this they laughed diabolically, at that point Shiba had questioned the humanity of this world. Enraged at the Shinobi, one of them was about to grab Shiba by the head but suddenly his started to feel frost around his fingers pulling it back quickly. The Shinobi moved his hands to the front of his face to examine what happened to them. The Shinobi saw that the tip of his fingers had gotten frost bite. Attempting to touch them, on contact the fell off and the Shinobi began to scream. The rest of the band of Konoha Shinobi turned their eyes towards Shiba. But were stunned at seeing what had become of him. Shiba's hair was flowing as the draft of cool air blew towards the Shinobi, The floor started to frost up becoming cool Ice. 
The Shinobi was stunned at what Shiba was displaying. As they stood there Shiba would have slowly picked himself up silently keeping his head down toward the floor. As Shiba did this they would back up in fear of what was about to happen. Shiba then lifted up his head in an Instant letting out a huge Yell towards the Shinobi. As he yelled Ice would begin to spike up from the ground in a line towards the Shinobi. The Shinobi tried to run but the first two was impaled by the Ice. The rest of the Shinobi would have gotten away but their exit was sealed with Ice. They banged on the Ice wall but it wasn't breaking. The then turned their attention towards Shiba slowly. Shiba with rage in his eyes stared at them intensely. But then he started to laugh as if he was straight of the asylum. As he laughed he started to walk towards the Shinobi, and as he walked small spikes of ice would form as he walked. He then stopped and raised his hand slowly into the air. The Shinobi then just began to try and rush Shiba considering that he was just a little kid. His hand was raised straight right in front of him and his palm facing upward. He then gave the Shinobi that was running towards him a bright smile before saying "Die". After saying that he closed his fist unleashes giant spikes made of ice that could be seen from outside of his house. 
Having that happened it alerted the Village Shinobi and a group of them rushed towards his house only to see Shiba in the center of everything holding his hands up towards his sides laughing wickedly with a wide smile on his face, covered in blood. Around him was seen four body's two of them that looked to be His parents and the other two saw to be Shinobi from the Village Hidden in the Leaf. Out of the Shinobi that had come to check out Shiba household was one of his teachers. The teacher had called out to Shiba softly with a worried face. He then turned towards his Sensei and spoke to him. "Ahh Good Evening Sensei want some tea?"
After that Day Shiba was never the same he was cold and stopped talking to people turning them away. One day, two older Academy students confront Shiba saying that he thought that he was better then everyone and that he should have been taught a lesson. After they said that more students came and gathered around Shiba. With Shiba surrounded, he looked around then dropped his head down facing the floor, then picking it back up with a wicked smile on his face. "So you guys want to die too?" One of the students had escaped and had told the teachers something was going on. The teachers followed the students, but when they arrived all they saw was bodies all over the place surrounding Shiba. Some of the bodies had Ice Spikes impaling them while some had Ice needles in them. Shiba was then seen in the middle holding a student by his neck in the air with ice senbons in him. As he saw Sensei at the corner of his eyes, he dropped the dead student on the floor and waved to him. The teachers were stunned by the events, but they left Shiba alone so they wouldn't have been forced to kill him. The teachers had planned on expelling him and having him arrested. They confronted Shiba about to tell him what they decided, but before that happened a student name Ulto had told them that it wasn't his fault and that the older Academy students had tried to beat up Shiba but he defended himself. The teachers had conversation with each other's and decided to overlook the deaths considering that it wasn't his fault.
After those events Shiba was avoided by everyone no matter how much he tried to talk to them. But they were too afraid of him to talk to him. So for the rest of his life as an Academy Student he was shunned by the rest of the students. He graduated from the Academy and was placed in a squad with two other Genin. One of those Genin so happened to be the kid that helped Shiba be pardoned for killing all those students. With another student from his class but that student wasn't very friendly * - Fri Sep 18 22:53:13 2015
