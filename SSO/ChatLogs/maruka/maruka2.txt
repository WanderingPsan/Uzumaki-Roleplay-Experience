Not only did we lose our kage and a bunch of citizens and shinobi to a signle man, but Kumo also have a whole bunch of structural damage done to alot of the areas. Who would have thought a single man could have done all of this. Kyushiki though is glad that he didn't take part in the fight though, he probably could have done anything if he wanted too. Plus he didn't want to die like the other people that had their tomb stones infront of the crater. One things for sure though, he wanted to grow in strength so that he could be able to do damage like that. Only time will tell if he is able to or not though.* - Mon Oct 12 04:12:09 2015

Also that a mission request can be sent to the kage for anyones personal needs. Then stating thats where the academy classes take place in the east wing of the mansion.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) catchs up to the old lady at the cantaloupes stand. But before he could even come to a hault, she threw a cantaloupe right above him. So yet again he has to go out of his way to catch by first dropping the bag of pears, then jumping into the air and catching the cantaloupe with one hand and then bringing it into the to hold it with both hands as he came down. Once he landed again sighed in relief that he caught it. But as he was doing that he got smacked with another cantaloupe in the chest and fell to the ground. Layed out on the ground, the old lady walked by the fallen Kyushiki and tossed a net to him to place the cantaloupes in before she moved off to the next section of the market. Leaving Kyushiki to handle the cantaloupes and the pears.* - Tue Oct 13 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) had placed the cantaloupes into the net and and picked back up the bag of pears before he arrived at the front of the shop that the elderly lady entered with not only the watermelons but the apples too. But right as he got to the front of the store, the lady tossed a stack of towels ontop of the bag of pears that was in his arms. Causing him to lose his balance and sway around a bit as he tried to regain his balance. Once he had regained his balance, Kyushiki paused for a second to recollect himself. But after only getting about 5 seconds to rest, the elderly lady called him out to follow her and that they are going back. This was a sign of releif as he followed the lady as she gave him directions on how to move.* - Tue Oct 13 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) and the old lady got infront of her house, entering the house and dropping all the towels and pears onto the table while leaving the cantaloupes on the floor. Then finaly taking a seat on one of the chairs on the table to rest for a bit. "Your as crazy as the other old lady." he said, while still taking his rest. The old lady stayed silent for a momment as she seats on her chair and begins to knit. Staring at her, Kyushiki was at lost for words at this point. All he knew is that he didn't want to deal with the old lady anymore, so he just walked out of the house and headed towards his next mission.* - Tue Oct 13 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) folds his arms as she would begin to explain further "To be even more Specific, chakra can indeed make a new reality if the hand signs are performed correctly. The very first jutsu you all will be learning will be something that will help you from the genin years on up, this jutsu is known as Kawarimi, an ability made to replace one self with an object of equal mass. " 

He began to perform the hand signs for it, the three-four basic hand signs for the very jutsu, all in order to place herself with a log to show to the class. This was a quick lesson, she was not going to restrain the class because one person did not get it, and he knew she had to be hard on the kids, Mist students seemed to have been slacking ever since the times of the place becoming a great nation has passed.

"I want you all to study, each and every hand sign, practice them, and become faster and more accurate with each one. Focus on controlling your very chakra within, by using this very method. "He took out a glass jar, placing it on the table before her or behind him where he'd have an NPC shinobi sit down native style, placing the jar in the middle of his lap as he did the following steps.

now aside the open fields next to the manor that was in its' state of reconstruction , the young lad  had came to train by himself, alone and away from the others where he can fully concentrate, there was no other person around for now , no one with him but himself, no one who could distract him but himself, the young teen went to the near edge of the mountain to look down the running waterfall, he took a deep breath, watching the very air itself as it flowed past him. He came because he needed to improve in just about everything he has learned, he wanted to improve in his chakra for the most and with that in mind he took a jar along with him from his home. Why did he take a jar with him? He had a very method in mind that will help him with his chakra training in order to both build it up and to increase his control of it.

Step One Sit down with both legs folded and both hands on the jar while holding it in the center.

Step Two Focus, lose no concentration.

Step Three slowly pour your chakra into the jar with your right hand acting as the positive component .

Step Four, use your left hand as the negative component and pull that chakra you poured into the jar back into your body and chakra netwok.

Step Five, speed up the process .

Step Six, set the jar at a distance and recycle your chakra without direct contact.

He has thought of these six steps when he was at home studying about chakra, he had first went by step one, closing his eyes and breathing slowly as he done so, now slowly pouring his chakra into the jar he would use his left hand as the negative component to absorb his own chakra back into his chakra flow and over and over will he do it again until he got used to the sensation of his chakra rushing through his body, he knew that in the future he would have to use it more often on the field and when not on the field of his career. NPC wanted to lead his family and set an example for what they could truly do, what their skill was and what they were good at. He wanted to show the village his family's potential, with such motivation in mind he thought to himself, not trying to break any concentration but wondering. If he needed, who would truly be his sensei in the village and guide him to what he wishes to learn.


As time went back while he speeds up the process of the chakra flowing through his body and the jar, he took a small break to prepare for the next step which was to set the distance between him and the jar. At first it was an utter failure, without direct contact it was extremely difficult but soon the boy got it and was recycling the chakra just as well as he had done before, but this was extremely tiring for his part in the end, soon after the boy would take a break, a nap even. When he was done he'd return to the village to see what was going on. This was also good for his medical training because to use such they'd need great chakra control. 

As Tetsuo watched the Shinobi finish the example of Chakra control training, well, the both basic and advance version. He smiled, allowing him to leave if he wished to do so. Meanwhile she'd say to the class.

"Now I wish for you all to try, there is a tiny glass jar in each desk...Fill it up with chakra, then recycle that chakra back into your body..." he declared in a calm voice.* - Tue Oct 13 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) hoded his head at them all he said "I'm aware this was a first time for many of you and that it is difficult, however, the Shinobi life is not easy. It never is, human or not. "He says while staring off at the class of students." He'd then state.

"Now then, I want everyone to try again, those who have around gotten the hang of it I want for them to advance and speed the process. If those jars are not hot from the distribution of chakra, then you are not trying hard enough now are you? There are 365 chakra units within the body, use every single one of them, shouldn't be too hard, and shouldn't be too easy. This is a grade, and after this, we're going into a more physical method of training to see where you all stand right now..." he nods his head with a smile.* - Tue Oct 13 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) entered one of the rural areas of Kumogakure with his trashbags and tweezers. He scans the whole area for any trash that was on the floor for his mission. Finding a few pieces of paper on the ground and placing them into his trash bag. After that he'd move on to the next area in search of more trash on the floor.

Sighing in pain and boredom, Kyushiki continues to pick up even more trash. These missions that he was doing were just ones for fresh genin, but he needs the cash so it cant be helped. Also with the way the village is, there probably won't be any good missions sent to the kage. Only thing to do now is just earn more money for this village right now.

After cleaning up the trash in the second area, Kyushiki moves to the other area where there had some type of party or where people just hang out and throw all their bottles and trash on the floor. Picking up about over fifty pieces of trash and filling up about 4 large trash bags. After doing so, Kyushiki tied up the bags and tossed them into the dumbster before he moved on to the next thing.* - Thu Oct 15 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kyushiki(Maruka) took a deep breath. Clapping his hands together and preforming three handseals as he channels chakra towards his belly. Transforming that chakra into water within his stomach and filling his cheeks up with it.
