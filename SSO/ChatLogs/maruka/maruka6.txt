<br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) had then stood in a way so that his shoulders would be shoulder-width apart. Then rolling his shoulders forward, rounding his back, and reach out as if he was going to hug a tree. In the same motion, brings his arms slowly back to your sides. Next he simply brings one of his arms across his body at about chest-level. Locking that arm in place and really stretch it by using his other arm to do so. Holding it for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite arm. He then next decides to work on his legs, first by lowering his body he extremely spread out his legs and lean your weight onto one leg while keeping the opposite leg completely straight. Hold for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite leg. After doing these stretches he gets stands on both feet and runs in place lightly, slapping his face. Aiming to get himself a bit pummped for what was next.* - Sun Nov 15 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) then gets on the floor standing up on his hands and knees with his hands underneath his shoulders but slightly wider than his shoulders. Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position. Repeating this about five times, trying to not strain himself anymore then he needs to.* - Sun Nov 15 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) then pushed himself back up on the last set. He then moved his right hand across the floor to help prop himself onto the floor. His body was flat on the ground, He then moved his feet flat on the floor sliding them up close to his butt. There was about a 5 to 7 inch distance between his heel and his but creating a sort of V shape with his legs. He then placed his hands on opposing shoulders, so that his arms are crossed over your chest. Keeping his heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, he slowly lifts his head, followed by his shoulder blades. Focusing his eyes on his bent knees. Pulling up from the floor until he was at a ninety-degree angle. After holding for it for 2 seconds he lowers his upper body back down onto the floor. He then repeats this for about 9 more times, before he got up from the floor and dusted himself off.

"That should be it for today. Might as well go to bed." he thought to himself as he begins to walk back towards his village.* - Sun Nov 15 09:48:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Raiton chakra flow. - Tue Nov 17 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: okay sorry back - Tue Nov 17 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's it? - Tue Nov 17 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Pretty much. - Tue Nov 17 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then.. - Tue Nov 17 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sensei, you wanted me to learn that genjutsu diffusion thing right? - Tue Nov 17 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) examined the handseals for the he was being tought, rehearshing them in his head with his imagination. Afterwards, he began to listen attentivly as Ortho gives him information about about the jutsu. Making mental notes on how to use it and the properties of it. Then again paying attention to the second demonstration of the handseals needed for the jutsu before he would actually attempt at using the ninjutsu.

Bringing his hands towards his chest level, Mitarashi began to preform the handseals necessary for the Earth Flash Jutsu as he channeled his chakra throughout his body. Then focusing on his lightning affinity as he sends that chakra into his arms and begins to create a flew surges of lightning to show around his arms. The lightning around his arms became more and more transparant by the second. But after a few seconds of him channeling the jutsu, it shorted out and dissapeared completly. Leaving Mitarashi with a questionable expression on his face.* - Tue Nov 17 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) gave a firm nod towards Ortho as he explains to him what he did wrong. Though Mitarashi is pretty sure that it was more of his training with the raiton element, then his use of his chakra. Then his gaze was set apon Eri as she started to have some emotional confrontation or something. He could only question what was wrong with her, but that thought only stirred in his mind for a few seconds before he shruged it off and went back to focusing on the jutsu he was learning from Ortho. "Alright so more chakra. Don't hesitate. Smooth transition." He thought to himself as he prepares for his next try at the jutsu.

With those thoughts in his head stirring up, Mitarashi began to preform the handseals for the Earth Flash Ninjutsu as he channeled his chakra through out his body once more. He'd increase the ammount of chakra that he channeled this time and flowed that chakra into his arms as he focuses his lightning affinity into it. His arms then started to surge violently with electricity, making him stumble back a little bit as it gets a bit out of his control. He then quickly slams his hands agaisnt the ground and sends out a small surge of electricity that would end up shocking himself. But thankfully, his Ninjutsu isn't strong enough to really effect him that much that it would have if he trained it more.* - Tue Nov 17 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) allowed himself to recover from the shock that he gave himself. He'd then afterwards shaked his head and his limbs a bit before bringing his hands together back infront of his chest. Forming the handseals necessary for the Earth Flash Ninjutsu being taught to him as he channeled a lesser amount of chakra then he did on his last attempt to use the jutsu. Charging that chakra with his lightning affinity as he flows the chakra towards his arms. The chakra then turned into electricity that slowly surrounded his arms. Then with a sudden burst of chakra, Mitarashi released the surge of lighting out infront of him. Ripping through the ground as it traveled through it a bit before it was stopped when Mitarashi stopped the flow of chakra.

"Alright sweet." he said with a grin on his face, he sucessfuly learned the jutsu and added it to his arsenal. All thats left now is to practice the jutsu or learn another one from Ortho. "Is there any other Raiton Ninjustu you can teach?"* - Tue Nov 17 05:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Thank you for the scroll though. - Thu Nov 19 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) bended his knees and then jumped up into the air as high as he could. Extending his arms out and reaching for the par above him. Gripping onto the bar, Mitarashi began to pull himself up using his arm strength. Keeping his arms bent and using his shoulders to hoist the rest of his body up. Lifting his body up, Mitarashi brought his head about the bar up until his chin was over it saying "One" then slowly reeling himself back down until the top of his head was below the bar. Afterwards pulling his body up once more, till his chin was above the bar. Then slowly back down again. Mitarashi would continue this with ease for about five more times.

After the fifth curl up, Mitarashi began to feel the strain on his biceps. But this didn't stop him, slowly bringing his head down below the bar. Her begin to bring his body back up very slow compared to how he was doing it before. Straining his muscles to its limit, Mitarashi's veins would begin to pop out all over his neck and arms. He'd move his head upwards so that his face was facing the sky. Finally bringing his head above the bar, to the middle of his neck before allowing himself to go back downwards again. He'd continue this process for about four more times. Each one getting slower and slower as he progressed.

But Mitarashi's goal was to do ten this times. This was five more then he originally could do. Letting himself rest for a bit, having his arms bent in an obtuse angle and not straight. He knew that if he fully relaxed he wouldn't be able to do another curl up. So he kept his muscle strain to a minimum and brought his legs up so that they wouldn't touch the ground. Taking deep breaths in and out, resting for about five seconds with his eyes closed. After he was finish resting, Mitarashi opened up his eyes and was ready to finish his last curl up.

Sweating with determination, Mitarashi began to use every ounce of fiber in his body to pull himself up above the bar. Slowly and gradually rising, he'd struggle to the point that he was shaking. His biceps were screaming right now, wanting to rest. But he wouldn't allow them to. Pushing through the pain, Mitarashi would gain a bit more speed. Allowing his head to reach half way above the bar. But his shaking at this point became to the point that it was visible from a far distance. Slowly descending from the bar. Mitarashi's face would show distress on it. Trying his best to keep from not reaching the top of the bar. By the time the top of his head was about to reach the bottom of the bar, an image of his father popped up in his head. At that point, Mitarashi's eyes started to gleam of fire. Letting out a yell at the top of his lungs, he'd pull himself up once more. Moving an increase rate then he was moving at before. Bringing his chin past the bar, but he didn't there he'd continue to the point that his shoulder blades where at the same level as the bar.

After reaching that point, Kyushiki felt an overwhelming warmth of relief. Dropping down and hung by his arms, allowing the tip of his feet touch the ground. Once his feet had touched the ground, he'd let go of the bar and dropped onto his ass then his back. Laying down on the floor and breathing heavily.* - Fri Nov 20 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) drew out his sword from its sheathe and held it out towards his side with one hand. Then he would swing the sword out towards his front so that he may grasp it with both hands tightly. Gripping onto it tightly, Mitarashi slowly inhaled and exhaled as he begins to mold his chakra and lightning affinity. Then with a sudden burst of chakra, he'd flow his chakra and affinity into the katana blade. Allowing a steady stream of electricity to run through his blade. Afterwards, he'd bring his katana up into the air infront of him as he exams the electricity flowing through his blade. "Alright good...... I'm getting use to the jutsu little by little. But it would be nice to be able to use it fast enough for it to actually become a surprise to people I'm fighting." he thought to himself.* - Fri Nov 20 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mitarashi(Maruka) cuts off the chakra flow towards his blades and sits himself beside the tree he was next too. There he pulled out the scroll Ortho gave to him and began to read up on the jutsu "Hiding Like a Mole". He read about how the jutsu is used and the seals needed for the jutsu. Memorizing the contents of the scroll and all its advantages and disadvantages that the jutsu provides. Though Mitarashi knew he probably wouldn't use the jutsu ever in his life, but it would be nice to have this jutsu in his arsenal. With this he would be able to escape some fights or sneak up behind an enemy.* - Fri Nov 20 00:41:48 2015

This indeed peeked Mitarashi's interest and made him bring both his arms down to their respective sides as he listens attentively to his words. The name Uchiha was then given to him and all his kin, this brought a smirk on Mitarashi's face as his blood begins to boil. After Ortho had finished talking, he'd raise his right arm up and slams his fist into his chest. "Yes, Sir!" he said with a nod.* - Fri Nov 20 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) bowed his head with his eyes closed and clapped together his hands as he stood infront of Hatsujin's grave. Praying for his peaceful rest as he is in a better place now. "Damn who ever did this! They will pay for attack my family and my village!" he said in anger. Mitarashi always showed compassion and love towards his family members, he could only beat himself up about how he wasn't there to help with anything or to save anyone. He also felt as if he didn't get to know Hatsujin long enough to even have to right to be angry. But one things for sure, he wasn't going to let this happen to anyone else that was apart of his clan as long as he was still alive and kicking.

Then after praying over Hatsujin's grave, Mitarashi openned his eyes as he brought his hands back down towards his side as he stared at the grave for a breif momment with a saddened expression before he walked away.

"I will get stronger." he thought to himself. "No matter what."* - Tue Nov 24 00:13:39 2015

So with both hands gripped onto both of his katanas, Mitarashi stepped forward into the bath between Eri and Arihs with a pissed off look on his face.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) pulled out both of his katanas to the point that only about 3 inchs of the blade would show in response to Arihs whipping out the katana. His gaze then turns into a glare as he stares ferociously at Arihs. It would be as Ichiro says, he had full intent on killing Arihs if he made anymore assults on him or his two clansmen. Remaining silent as the conversation goes on around him, keeping his sights onto Arihs as the escorts pull her out of the area.* - Tue Nov 24 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) had a serious expression when he said that. Even though if the situation was different, he would have most definatly laughed. But after he heard that she wasn't hurt, Mitarashi gave Eri a light grin and a nod. "That good." he said, before turning around towards Menma who also stepped inbetween Eri and the trap. "And where do you get off acting all big and tough? Think you can upstage me huh?" he said with a energetic tone to his voice, taking his hand and pushing it down onto Menma's head as he messes up his hair.* - Tue Nov 24 01:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) stopped ruffling up Menma's hair for a brief second as he noticed his foul mood. Then in after staring at Menma for a few seconds silently, he removed his hand from his head and stared at him for a breif momment. Placing a hand onto one of his hips and tilting his head down a bit to get a better look at menma's face, Mitarashi said "What are you felling down and about for?"* - Tue Nov 24 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) 's facial expression became blank as he stood up straight. "Aye, Look at me." he said as he hits Menma softly on the cheek with the back of his fingers. "Getting all down about it won't solve or bring anyone back. What you should do now is make up for our lose and train harder so we don't lose anyone anymore." he said with a stern tone. "I wasn't there to do anything at all and for that, I felt worse then how you are feeling when I found out about it. But if we're down and not motivated, how will we stop someone from doing the same to anyone one of us. But the moral to what I'm saying is that we shouldn't allow another death within our clan to happen ever again." 

Mitarashi then balled up his fist with his thumb sticking out and poked himself in the chest with it. "I know for sure that on my watch, no one is going to die by anyone hands as long as I'm alive! And you should be thinking the same thing too!" he shouted. But one thing is for sure, Mitarashi wasn't a motivation speaker, but he follow his own ideals and tells them to all who would listen.* - Tue Nov 24 02:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Fine. - Tue Nov 24 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) walked away from the scene as he has no reason to be here right now.* - Tue Nov 24 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: A gift! - Tue Nov 24 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Whats up Menma? - Tue Nov 24 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) walks inside, his brother was taking to long for him to keep waiting like this.* - Wed Nov 25 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Ortho...I'm not strong...I'm not brave! Not any of those things! I'm a weakling that needs to be proteted....The thing...I fear the most....Isn't dying...It's living knowing I couldn't save any of you. - Wed Nov 25 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) rushed into the village as his brother was taking to long to return. Running past the grave of one of his clansmen, he sets his eyes apon Menma who had fell onto his hands and knees (?). His first instrict was to grab onto his katana and remove it from its sheathe as he ran towards Menma's side. "Menma! What happened!" he yelled, before noticing that his face was covered in tears. Then at the corner of his eyes, there it was. Two corpses layed ontop of each other with a black rod shoved through their torso. 

At first sight, he thought that his brother had killed some intruders. But that was only him denying the thruth of what was before him. "Haha..... Good job.... You killed some intruders r-right?" he said, with a little hint of saddness that he tried to cover up with a few chuckles. "Right?" he said once more, clearly he was trying to avoid the fact that those are clearly Ortho's and Eri's corpses. But he couldn't hide or hold back the tears anymore. A single tear would drop from both of his eyes as his katana dropps from his hand. His eyes still trained on Menma as his mouths opens back up again. "RIGHT!?!?!" he yelled, showing a mixture of hate and sorrow. And if Menma wouldn't answer him at all, Mitarashi would ball up both of his fists and grind together his teeth. Then turning away from Menma and closing his eyes. Letting the tears flow out from his eyes as if he was a child who was lost in a city.

Only thing Mitarashi would think is why was this happenening. First everything was going so well for them as a Clan. As a family. But now deaths door keeps appearing in front of his family. First Hatsujin, and now Ortho and Eri. What was to be next? His younger brother? At that thought, only anger would fill his thoughts. Now not only was he driven by hate for this so called Edge, but now the killers of Ortho adn Eri.

Mitarashi's fists began to ball up even tighter to the point that his palms began to leek blood. And if anyone were to look at his face now. Mitarashi's face wouldn't show an expression of a little boy lost in a city. But a Man who has just lost everything. Someone who is now driven by hatred and hatred alone. All this hatred built inside of him, but no one to target with his hatred. He doesn't even know how Edge looks like, or where to start looking. Not only that, but he doesn't even know who killed Ortho and Eri. Only thing he could do now is let out his anger in a loud cry. Bending his arms and lifting his head to face the sky. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" he yelled, doing the only thing he could do at this point and vent some of his anger out.

Mitarashi would yell untill he was completly out of breath. Which then he would begin to breath heavily. Giving himself a rest period before he would yell at the top of his lungs again. But before he could, he'd stop himself and remembered the speech he gave to Menma a few days ago. Yelling and crying about this wouldn't solve anything or any of his problems. So instead of yelling, Mitarashi turned towards the rod that was embedded into Eri and Ortho and walked towards it. Once he got near it, Mitarashi would grab onto it and pull it out from their corpse and held it up into the sky to get a better look at it.

After about a few seconds he would hold the black rod down towards his side and walk towards Menma. Mitarashi's face at this point would be covered in tried up tears and would show nothing but hatred on it. "Menma. We're going to find who ever did this, and that Edge person. And give them an agonizing death. But first, we will get stronger so that we don't die in vain. Are you with me Menma!?" he stated. Staring Menma directly in his eyes with his hand out for him to take, all while Mitarashi's eyes began to swirl and reveal the sharingan.* - Wed Nov 25 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) gripped firmly onto Menma's hand and pulled him up from the floor before giving him a nod. He wasn't  happy or sad either. This indirect vow that him and his brother made to each other to seek vengence apon their killer and Edge was exact. But as Menma looked towards the body's Mitarashi would look as well. "Your right. I'll get anyone thats left to come so we can all pay our respects. I'm sure most of them wouldn't even stay after this." he said, letting go of Menma's hand and walking around to gather what would be left of the villagers and guards that still remained.* - Wed Nov 25 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) ||All the villagers and guards would begin to circle around and surround Menma and the two corpses. Then from the crowd, Mitarashi and four guards would step out into the middle of the circle and walk towards Menma. Mitarashi would stand beside Menma, while two pairs of the four guards each carefully picked up the corpses and began to bring them down towards where Hatsujin's grave was. As the walk, the crowd would open up a path for them to walk. And as Hatsujin's grave became visable, there would be a priest with a bible(?) in his hand waiting there. The guards then layed the both the bodys into a hole that was dug up while the corpses were being brought, laying them both side by side next to Hatsujin. Once they were set inside the hole, the preist would begin to say a prayer over them and wish their souls a safe voyage towards the Shinobi heaven.

But before the prayer began the preist would wait for Mitarashi and Menma to step up to the front.* - Wed Nov 25 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) ||The villagers would look at Menma and then stare at each other. But they would just ignore him as they had no intention of staying after the burial. The priest would then begin to pray over the both of the corpses. Afterwards allowing the guards to fully bury the corpses with dirt before everyone in the village completly left.

Mitarashi stared at the graves and placed a hand onto Menma's shoulder. "They won't listen. most of them were only here to be protected by Ortho. Now that he is gone, none of them will stay." he stated.* - Wed Nov 25 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) removed his hand from Menma's shoulder. He did feel that we shouldn't abandon the village, but at this point there is nothing we could do for it. The both of them didn't have the strength Ortho had, nor the Yen to support a village by them selves. "We can't Menma. Not as we are now." he stated.* - Wed Nov 25 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) gave Menma a nod before he headed back into the village.* - Wed Nov 25 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) opens up infront of him a scroll and begins to read it and its contents. He made sure to memories the contents of the scroll carefully so that he would make no mistakes when he takes the next step in learning the jutsu. While reading it, Mitarashi practices the handseals a bit. Doing them carefully and slowly to get them down correctly. He did mess up a few times, but after the 5th set, he could match all the handseals perfectly as a slow pace.* - Wed Nov 25 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) stopped practicing the handseals for the jutsu and then moved on to the details of the jutsu. Reading carefully each word and letter to the bone. He reads on how the jutsu is made to make it seem like solid earth is sand. Allowing the user to move though the earth with ease. Not only that, it also allows you to figure out your own location even while under ground. Saying that its possible by sensing the magnetic forces. It also allows you to sense whats going on above ground to help one make a surpise attack on an enemy if they wanted too. Mitarashi was drilling this information into his brain as much as possible, but he closes up the scroll and saves the rest of it for another time to learn.* - Wed Nov 25 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) had then stood in a way so that his shoulders would be shoulder-width apart. Then rolling his shoulders forward, rounding his back, and reach out as if he was going to hug a tree. In the same motion, brings his arms slowly back to your sides. Next he simply brings one of his arms across his body at about chest-level. Locking that arm in place and really stretch it by using his other arm to do so. Holding it for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite arm. He then next decides to work on his legs, first by lowering his body he extremely spread out his legs and lean your weight onto one leg while keeping the opposite leg completely straight. Hold for a 10 second count and repeat on the opposite leg. After doing these stretches he gets stands on both feet and runs in place lightly, slapping his face. Aiming to get himself a bit pummped for what was next.* - Wed Nov 25 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) then gets on the floor standing up on his hands and knees with his hands underneath his shoulders but slightly wider than his shoulders. Come onto the tip of his toes and the heels of his hands, and then walks his feet back until his body is in the plank position. Keeping his hips lifted to avoid the lower back from forming a bowl. He then begins to bend his elbows, lowering his whole body down towards the floor. His elbows will bended out to his sides. His would head stay in line with his spinal cord. Lowering himself down until his chest is about an inch or two from the ground and then slowly push himself back up to the starting position. Repeating this about five times, trying to not strain himself anymore then he needs to.* - Wed Nov 25 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) then pushed himself back up on the last set. He then moved his right hand across the floor to help prop himself onto the floor. His body was flat on the ground, He then moved his feet flat on the floor sliding them up close to his butt. There was about a 5 to 7 inch distance between his heel and his but creating a sort of V shape with his legs. He then placed his hands on opposing shoulders, so that his arms are crossed over your chest. Keeping his heels on the ground and your toes flat to the ground, he slowly lifts his head, followed by his shoulder blades. Focusing his eyes on his bent knees. Pulling up from the floor until he was at a ninety-degree angle. After holding for it for 2 seconds he lowers his upper body back down onto the floor. He then repeats this for about 9 more times, before he got up from the floor and dusted himself off. "Alright now. Lets work on my Raiton Chakra Flow." he thought to himself.* - Wed Nov 25 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) drew out his sword from its sheathe and held it out towards his side with one hand. Then he would swing the sword out towards his front so that he may grasp it with both hands tightly. Gripping onto it tightly, Mitarashi slowly inhaled and exhaled as he begins to mold his chakra and lightning affinity. Then with a sudden burst of chakra, he'd flow his chakra and affinity into the katana blade. Allowing a steady stream of electricity to run through his blade. Afterwards, he'd bring his katana up into the air infront of him as he exams the electricity flowing through his blade. "Alright..... I guess thats a little better then before." he thought to himself.* - Wed Nov 25 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) pulls out from his clothing a black metal rod and holds it out for the Raikage to take from him. "Do you know anyone who uses this type of weapon?"* - Thu Nov 26 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) looked at his hand as the rod had turned into ash. "Wha?" he said, his face filling with anger as he suddenly balls up a fist with the ash in it. Causing it to make a bit of a ash to float in the air around it.* - Thu Nov 26 03:28:12 2015
