<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) let out a sigh. Was this not only a waste of time, but this also made the deaths of the shinobi that fought to take this place pointless. But atleast the shinobi of Kumogakure died for the freedom of the village and not in vain like the Sunagakure and Konoha troops. But in the end, thiss war was truly pointless in the end. Wasting away lives like its nothing for their own personal gain. These thoughts would run though Mitarashi's mind for a while as he began to walk away from the scene.* - Wed Dec  9 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) would shruge his shoulders, listening to Menma and Eiyu's words both. But it would seem that it wasn't towards him at all. So instead he would simply reply to Menma's statement. "Don't worry, I know your not giving up on Shinkogakure. I'm contemplating weather or not to rebuild Shinkogakure as well. So I theres a chance I might just sell Shinko and move the funds to Kumogakure. Ortho was planning on doing something to help out Kumo, so I think it would be alright if I did that." he said, not really sure if his decisions are the right one. But in his mind he thought it was.* - Wed Dec  9 20:52:16 2015
