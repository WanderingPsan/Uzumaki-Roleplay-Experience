"Hm..I don't recognize any of you guys," he mumbled to himself, as he removed the gourd on his back and placed it beside him before sitting down. * - Sat Sep 12 01:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) had nothing better to do than to just sit down in the dirt and do his thing. He looked up into the sky, making subtle hand gesture. The sand the rested in his gourd started to sprinkle out from the open lid.  The sand spread itself out in a thin layer, making it extremely difficult to see. With another hand gesture, the sand motioned itself infront of his face, and soon began to take shape.  One after another stars began to form out of thin air from the sand.  At first there was one, then two, and soon about ten or so. The stars hovered in the air, circling around his person before shooting out into the dirt infront of him.

The stars disapated upon impact, but soon enough they reformed infront of his face. "Hm..I wonder where Chiyari, Kronos, and everyone else is," he thought as he continued to generate star after star. * - Sat Sep 12 01:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) glanced over at Berith as he rested on the sand. He remained silent, and only focused on his own training. He rested his palm onto his lap, with the palm facing upwads. Slowly, a small swirl of sand started to form in the center of his palm, eventually taking a concrete shape of a shuriken.  The sand held it's form for a moment, then disapated into his palm.

A few seconds after, the sand took shape again into another shuriken. He'd repeat the process multiple times over and over, trying to keep a clear image of his technique.* - Sun Sep 27 22:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So they have some space. - Sun Oct  4 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) took a few steps back, allowing himself and Kang to have enough space to begin their spar, if he was ready anyway.  He stood still from his position, pouring chakra into the sand that rested inside of his gourd.  The sand began to trickle out from the gourd's opening, casting a faint mist around Ryuga's form.   He was sure to spread the sand out enough to make it difficult for his opponent to notice.* - Sun Oct  4 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) never seen a mud clone in action before. He raised a brow, examining it as he continued to control his own sand.  "Hm..That looks like an interesting jutsu. I bet it's helped you a lot," he spoke, sending a mist of sand towards Kang.  

The sand would travel along the ground, moving around as to not reveal itself, and to blend with the already surrounding sand of the area.  Once his sand reached the male's location, he motioned his fingers upwards, aiming to have the sand wrap around Kang's legs. "I suppose you can start," he spoke, smiling directly at Kang.* - Sun Oct  4 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I will teach them all Kai later. - Sun Oct  4 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) held his grip onto Kang's legs using his sand. He kept his smile on his face as he lifted up his hands once more, sending the sand that were placed at Kang's legs up into a frenzy. The sand began to take shape into countless shuriken, aiming to cut or penetrate into Kang's body. 

As for the incoming mud clone, Ryuga expelled more sand from his gourd forwards.  The sand launched out at the clone all with the intent to knock it down, or even stop it before it got close enough. * - Sun Oct  4 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Kang isn't that great of a fighter..he has power but lacks skill. - Sun Oct  4 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Well my brothers dont beat each other up too bad - Sun Oct  4 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) quickly found himself covered in the mud clone. His body's movements were becoming restricted from the density of the mud which clung to his body.  "Damn..This is annoying," he muttered to himself as he soon found the mud rising to his mouth and nose.  It was a smart plan in all honesty, but Ryuga wasn't going to give up just then. He took his last breaths, filling up his lungs before the mud had blocked both his mouth and nose.  

Now, he was pressed on time with limited combat ability at his disposal. The genin started to focus on what remained in his gourd, and what was already cast out onto the field.   Since his gourd was still at his disposal, he released a large density of sand from with in, wrapping it around his body like a planetary object.   

As time progressed, he could feel his chest burning for air, but he had to endure. Using what little oxygen at his disposal, he kept his hold on his consciousness, sending the mass of sand ,which was about proportial to his own body, at Kang in the form of numerous shuriken.  If he was going to go down, he'd rather go out in style.* - Sun Oct  4 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) was left defensless as his last resort was hurled forwards. The shuriken that were launched at his foe quickly became engulfed by flames. They continued to fly forwards with an even higher lethality. However, his intention was never for a lethal strike, but due to the added effects of the flames, the shurikens themselves became a bit more dangerous.

As for himself, he soon found his body covered in an immense heat as the flames washed over him.  He felt his skin peel and burn, all while a portion of his body remained cool due to the mud which squeezed around him. When the flames washed over him, he collapsed due to a mixture of low oxygen and from the damage that he'd recieved.   The shurikens by  now, had they not reach their destination would disapate into a lump of sand. * - Sun Oct  4 21:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) was unconscious, so he didn't feel anything that was going on. His skin began to rapidly regenerate, stitching and peeling itself off to reveal a new layer. The burns that he'd sustained were now gone, and his fatigue was washed away. The light that radiated around his body subsided upon the completion of the technique.  Ryuga however remained asleep, now in no pain.* - Sun Oct  4 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) awoke shortly after being transported back to the plaza. He leaned up from his seated position, glancing at the scene. "Huh?", he questioned, still feeling a bit dazed.* - Sun Oct  4 22:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) turned towards the south western side of the wall.  His eyes widened as he could see embers from afar.  Quickly, he turned his gaze towards the shinobi who were positioned in the square. "There should still be a safe house near the mansion.  Unless they changed it from a while ago, then I don't know." He paused for a moment.

"This is Edge we're talking about.  The man who led a revolution within Suna years ago. He's not someone who we can face lightly. We'll need more than a chuunins going after him.  Get some doton users to errect stronger, taller walls around the village.  That should buy us some time. In the mean time, those who are well with long range attacks, should help support the chuunins that are on the wall.  At least until we secure the villagers. Then we can go on a full attack," he suggested.  As he said those words, he began to focus his chakra, seeping it into the granuals of sand that rested in his gourd.* - Wed Nov 25 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) let out a sigh. "I guess it's going to be just like the last time we were attacked.  We don't have Kronos this time, or Kastya, or even the other power houses.  Welp, if I die today, then so be it," he spoke.  He'd place his hands into his pockets as he began to walk over towards the East.   

Just as he was about to walk, he turned his head towards those who remained. "Going to come?", he asked, not waiting for a response. He'd continue on with his stride.* - Wed Nov 25 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) rushed over towards the eastern wall of the village.  He'd pause upon seeing the forces, along with a man he'd never recognized before.  He may or may not have been an enemy, but it was war time. To him, anyone outside of the village was marked as a potential threat. He'd glance back towards the two who followed him, then back at the army.

"This is going to be a pain," he muttered. "Hey you two, got names?", he'd shout, as he prepared himself to join the battle.* - Wed Nov 25 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: O-Oh geez..T-This'll b-be tough.. - Wed Nov 25 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) was shocked. For a moment, his life flashed before his eyes, that was until he was protected by Hanai.  A cold sweat rolled over his body as he quickly jumped back to gain distance. "Be careful," he commented, as he allowed for his sand to pour out from his gourd. 

"That was a big mistake on my part..I'll just provide support," he thought to himself, fixating his sights onto Hanai and Ichiro.* - Wed Nov 25 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) didn't know what to expect from the male. Out of the blue, weird formations began to crawl all over his body.  It gave an ominous feeling, but he shrugged it off. This was a life or death situation.   

He took a deep breath, calming his nerves as he waved his hand. Sand began to follow his movements, rising up into the air.  With another hand gesture, the fine granuels began to clump together, one by one. taking shape.  In an instant, multiple shurikens materialized in the air, remaining still as if frozen by time.  

The shinobi twirled his finger once more, prompting the frozen shurikens to spin.  With another gesture, he launched the shurikens forwards towards their foe. A total of 6 were sent into his direction. 

"Let's hope this works," he muttered, maneuvering the shuriken to strike into Ichiro's chest.* - Wed Nov 25 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) was once again saved by the two. It somewhat angered him how weak he's gotten, but this is what happens when you neglect your training.  Just as he was about to meet death's door, he was tossed aside by Momura.  His body rolled along the ground, halting just a bit away.  

He'd quickly rise back up, back peddling a bit more to draw more distance between the two.  "This is more than I could take," he muttered, feeling his back against the wall.* - Wed Nov 25 21:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) felt as though all hope was lost, until Hassan arrived. A faint light of hope began to radiate through the situation. He let out a smile as he summoned even more sand from his gourd.  The sand would rise up into the air, fragmenting itself into thousands upon thousands of granuels.  They were parted enough to become difficult for one to see. 

"Here we go," he thought, hovering the sand above Ichiro.  He knew full well that his attacks were useless, but he was confident it would assist in the long run. With a single gesture, he allowed the granuels to form together, creating even more sand shurikens.   Quickly, he lowered his hand, causing the shurikens to rain upon the male.  Instead of the initial 6, he increased the amount to 15 shuriken.* - Wed Nov 25 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryuga(Kazuma12) refrained from sending any more projectiles after he witnessed Hassan lashing out his own assault.

Eventually, he'd make it to the battlefield, taking notice to a man fleeing and and a familar yet unfamilar silhouette from the distance.  Soon, his eyes widened, as he recalled prior events. "Another Kastya!?", he muttered, halting in his advance.  He'd stop and take a few steps back, trying to decide if he should fight or run.* - Thu Nov 26 00:14:30 2015
