<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) having focused on him before the battle had started she would sense as the chakra around his eyes would change as he had activated his doujutsu >Interesting.< she thought to herself as she then sensed chakra going up to his head in an excess amount and before she knew it he was already on the move. Keeping an eye on his feet as to not fall under any genjutsu effects she would be prepared to react to this as the male seemed to be moving slowly at least in her eyes. Quickly bringing boths hands up to her forehead with her palms facing outward she would quickly send chakra to them which created two fireballs on them that would begin to shine brighter and brighter as she controlled the intensity of the brightness untill she made them flash sending out a blinding light that was stronger than the avarage flash bomb directed at Koji who was making his way toward her.

If the jutsu had managed to blind him even momentarily she would quickly set out to meet him half way as she took advantage momentary blindness he was under and would quickly send a kick up to his face which was a feint for the second kick she would send to his stomatch causing the first kick to reduce his dodging margin alot more since she had just blinded him. It was clear by the execution of her abilities that she had taken her time to master them so the execution of these would be spot on. Also since one move is taijutsu and the other is ninjutsu she would not be hindered by anything so no need for the transitionist perk or anything along those lines.* - Fri Oct  2 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would have stopped in her tracks as she would sense the chakra build up after sending the flare strike which was actually just light being emitted off the two fire balls she had made in her hand so the rotation would have countered nothing but air. Sensing and seeing the chakra dome that was created before her eyes she would now be weary as to approach the male as she figured that it would not be good for her health if she got hit with whatever he had just done. >Hmmm, what to do next?< she questioned herself as she took several steps back as she was thinking of a strategy.

>I do not want to reveal anymore than I have to.< she thought to herself as she brought her her hand out with her fingers pressed against each other ready to be snapped as she sent chakra toward her fingertips. Still looking at Kojis feet she would wait for him to move as she held her right hand out with fingers pressed against each other >This guy must be a sensor if he stoped halfway through his movement when I began executing my jutsu...Hmmm...only one way to find out and also that stance he took..he must be planning on engaging in a taijutsu match up.<* - Fri Oct  2 06:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would see the shuriken and would hear him slapping on the explosive tag onto the weapon and she would also hear it flapping in the wind as it traveled through the distance that was created between them. Taking a couple of steps back she would avoid the explosion but the smoke still remained which under normal circumstances would have been a trouble for her but her senses were finely tunned. Sensing and hearing him approach her she would still have her arm extended outward with chakra focused on her fingertips but would also begin to focus chakra on her other arm which was resting calmly at her side.

>If her rotates again I will have time to get back, also his chakra pool is low so I have this one in the bag which is excellent.< she thought to herself calmly as she saw him brake through the smoke and approach her to engage in a taijutsu based battle just as she had predicted within her head. Moving her arm gracefully to dodge the strike she would bring out her left hand which had a concentrated amount of chakra on her finger tips and snapped them. As her fingers snapped it would ignite the chakra that was concentrated there which would result in a fire ball shooting out toward his torso as he was attacking her right arm. Given her mastery with the jutsu it would be a force to be wreckoned with as this would make the area that was impacted to catch on fire. Given the distance between them and the fact that this was done as he was attacking it woul be hard to dodge. She would also take three more steps back as this was done.* - Fri Oct  2 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) \\and so the battle continued. 

Watching as he dodged the ball by leaping over it she once again she heard that familiar flapping noise >Tch does he really think that same trick will work again?.< Side stepping to the right she would execute two handseals as he looked at him and focused chakra around her body Snake ---> Rat and would send it out toward him placing him in a genjutsu since she moved faster than the kunai traveled. Once under the spell of the genjutsu he would see a ring of leafs rise up from the ground surrounding him causing him to see his worst nightmare.

Boom the explotion would go off and she would charge foward to him as he was under the effects of the genjutsu she had placed on him and would reach for his headband that was around his waist with one had as she brought her other hand to reach for the tanto on her back and placed it against his throat with the sharp edge facing away from him so that she would not risk cutting him "You fought like a newly graduated genin." she told him as she took the headband off his waist "You are under the effects of a genjutsu. Use that information to break out of it. Also if you try anything like spinning I will not hesitate to end your life right here were you stand." she would press the dull edge of her tanto against his skin so that he could feel it while under the effect of the genjutsu she had casted on him.* - Fri Oct  2 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) stood ther placing her tanto back in its sheeth with one hand then used the same hand to bring down her forehead protector down to cover her left eye "Like I said, you fight like a gening out of the academy. Those tactics would not even scare a stray mut." She would bring her arms up to stretch as she looked up at the sky >Its fucking hot here.< she thought to herself as she opened her coat a bit revealing more of her black shirt and neckless that hung above her breats "Next we fight I will be taking the headband of your waist so do try to entrertain me more next time we battle." Was she trying to be a bitch? Or was she encouraging him to work harder to better his abilities? The world may never know.

She would begin walking toward the square of Sunagakure and glanced over at Sanoke "Show me the new technique sometime, I'll be staying here for some time as it is less boring than Kirigakure. I hope you can entertain me more than the newbie over there." She would have said this in her usual dry tone with her usual blank facial expression then would continue to walk toward the square.* - Fri Oct  2 07:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You might need a cane now - Sat Oct  3 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) grabed his hand and placed it on her shoulder and began to guide him to the bathroom "Well, now that I know you can lose your eye forever I might reconsider on going for those white eyes." she would comment toward him as she served as a guide for him.* - Sat Oct  3 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) for all intents and purposes arrived at the bathroom which led her to take his hand off her shoulder and left him standing there. She would walk over to the shower and turned it on "How do you like your water." she asked him as she played around with the settings of the shower. Once she got her answer she would execute the clone handseal and made a clone of herself which stayed inside the room as she exited it since she wanted to give him as much privacy as she could.* - Sat Oct  3 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would have already exited the bathroom but her clone would help him take off whatever clothing he had on him "At least now your other senses will get better as time goes on." she commented off-handedly as she helped him strip.* - Sat Oct  3 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) guided him to the shower as she was not phased by seeing him naked. She would instuct him where everything was so that he could have an easier time taking his bath "Who was the one that implanted and fucked up your eyes?" she asked him trying to make conversation as the water was running "Was it the medic you told me about? How good is she really? I am not scared of losing an eye and not gaining anything in return other than pain."* - Sat Oct  3 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) rolled up her sleeved and took off her boots "Shampoo please." she would tell him with an extended hand out to receive either the bottle or a squirt of the liquid. Once that was done she would begin washing his hair "Was it worth it though? Why didn't you stop when one of your eyes was lost? Now your potential has been reduced exponentially since you will only be able to see out of one eye and what eye did you get? Was it a white eye or a red eye? What can you do with it? Why is it special." She would continue the barage of questions as she extended her arm out "Shampoo." she simply said again hoping to get more shampoo.

Scrubbing his head he would massage the scalp like she did to her own head as she was an expert of taking care of her hair since she was very fond of it for a certain reason that I do not know if I have ever shown Seisuke so we will assume it will remain a secret for now. "What elemental affinites do you posses?" she would ask him curiously as she had only seen him use a wind wall of sorts "Can you only use Fuuton?"* - Sat Oct  3 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) continued to massage the scalp then went for a near by bucket/bowl that was something the japanese used to bathe themselves and would rinse his hair out "The original me took a shower before leaving Kirigakure so she will most like wait until its later on in the day since she has not trained today other than escaping Mizumis attack." Placing the bowl to collect water she would rince him off his hair again "So fuuton, raiton and katon? You are lucky. I can only use Suuiton and Katon but thanks to that I can use a good combo of abilities even though my natures are polar opposites."* - Sat Oct  3 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Koeki. - Sat Oct  3 04:45:52 2015
