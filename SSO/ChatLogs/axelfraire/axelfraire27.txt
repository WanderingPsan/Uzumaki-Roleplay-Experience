<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Arrived at the waterfall and unsealed the blade from her coat, grabbing onto it she would find it to be much lighter than before which was a surprise to her >Hmmm not bad.< she thought to herself as she swung the blade with one hand >It not longer feels as heavy...Is it because I have been practicing with it or has Hiramekarei accepted me as its master?< she would think to herself as she swung the blade horizontally then made a diagonal cuz >It has to be all the hours of practice I have with the blade. Like I have told myself many times in the past couple of days, this blade is not sentient. It does not chose its master so yeah.< She would switch hands and began swinging it again only this time with the opposite hand >This is great.< she said happily as her facial expression reflected this >I will be able to do many things now.<

Grabbing onto both handles of the balde she would turn the blade over by twisting her hands one above the other and grabed onto the respective handle so that her hands were not in an awkward position and did it several times  before she stopped and grabed the blade with one hand and swung it around to her back and continued the swing as she grabbed the other blade handle with her other hand, once the blade was continued she would pivot her body as she slowly crouched down causing her to swing in a spiral only stopping when her knees couldn't bend any more >Hmm this has gotten easy now.< she thought to herself as she rose to stand up >I got the blade handling part down, I just need to know how to unlock the secrets of this blade. How do I access the chakra stored inside the blade? I will have to send Fujitora a message soon.<

Sighing she shook her head because of the previous thought she had >No that wont do. Fujitora has been wierd ever since I showed him my Byakugan- Well it is not really mine per say since I did have to kill that white eyes in order to get it but anyway. Ever since I showed it to him he has been acting wierd which is completely understandable considering the past that the red eyes share with the white eyes.< She would sigh once again then focused on her task at hand and gripped the blade handle tightly and took a deep breath of air >Just focus on mastering this thing. You will figure out what the balde can do once you master it.< With that being said she would bring the sword up to her chest holding one blade handles >Back to training.< she thought as she swung the sword in a diagonal fashion then shifted its trajectory to slice horizontally infront of her.

Using the momentum from the strike she would pivot her body and slashes in a circle around her then brought the blade up in a vertical slice that continued up over her head and landed behind her hitting the water with force causing it to splash up >Faster.< she thought to herself as she brought the blade up and thrusted it infront ofher followed by a turn of one hundred and eighty degrees and thrusted the air again >Harder.< she thought to herself as she stood up straight and rested the blade on her shoulder >I get this uneasy feeling that something bad will happen..fuck I just do not know what it is and I cannot place a finger on it.< Bringing the blade foward again she would grab the handles with both hands and swung it diagonally then thrusted the blade foward mid swing.

Thrusting the blade foward the blade she would turn the blade sideways and did a horizontal slice. Letting go of one of the handles she would run foward holding the blade up with one hand and jumped foward doing a diagonal slash while she was jumping. Landing and rolling foward while keeping the blade out of her path she would come to a stop then ran foward slowly regaining her composture as she went foward. Bringing the blade down for a final swing she would place it on her back and took in a deep breath >That is enough for today.< she thought to herself as she sealed the blade into her coat now >I still cant shake that feeling of uneasiness off though.< Shaking her head she would bring a hand up to rub her face she would let out a soft exhale before going on with her day.* - Sat Oct 24 20:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) took out the blade that Violet had given her and examined it >Hmm this is a bone, Baens bone....why would he? You know what it does not even matter a blade is a blade no matter how you look at it....or what it is made of.< She would grab the hilt of the bone blade and found it to be very light as well compared to the Hiramekarei which would make things easier for her. Holding the blade with two hands she would get a feel for it >Hmm, the texture is obviously different since this is bone but I wonder how sharp it truely is, I could go stabbing at something but well that could end up backfiring as it could end up braking on me or I could injure myself.<

Bringing up the sword to give it a swing she would stop it as soon as her arms were by her stomatch then brought it up again >Hmmm, very light weight.< she thought to herself as she charged toward a near by tree and brought the blade up above her head and sliced at the tree in a diagonal fashion slashing into the bark of the tree. She would back off and examined the blade >Hmmmm, it is still sharp. I guess Baens bones as hard as he claims they are.< she would look up at the tree infront of her and examined the cut she had done from where he was standing >It is a decent cut. I need to be able to cut deeper though.< she thought to herself as she brought the sword up infront of her holding it with her two hands >I will cut it deeper.< she said to herself as she charged at the tree once again.

This time she lowered her blade and did a diagonal cut aiming to mark an X on the tree. Once she did she would move to the side and slashed again then backed off >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she panted >I guess training after having already done tiresome things with Hiramekarei was not a smart idea. Now I am tired, if I keep this up I will end up being exhausted...but then again. I do need to master both of these blades. So fuck it who cares. I will be exhausted if I have to but I will master these things, then I will move on to master the rest of the blades.< She would charge foward and thrusted the tip of the blade into the tree then brought the blade out and spun around to slash at the thing >Harder.< she said to herself as she brought the blade up and slashed vertically at the bark >Faster.< she said to herself again as she backed away and prepared another slash >Stronger, Deeper, Harder, Faster.<

Slashing at the tree again to the best of her abilities she would back off and drop to a knee heavily panting >Damn it.< she thought to herself as she collaps to the floor panting heavily >Damn it all to hell. I train for one thing and that is when my flaws show up next. Fuck fuck fuck.< She would let go of her bone blade and bring one hand up to her head "Fuck." she muttered to herself as she was exhausted >Damn blades, damn training, damn weakness.< It was clear that she was not used to being defeated specially not by something that she wanted to master >It is easier said than done.< she thought to herself as she slowly started to close her right eye.

Opening and closing her right eye she would find that it was hard to stay awake, specially after training with two different blades >I just need some rest..when was the last time I slept? I cant even remember.< she would continue to open and close her eye. With each blink her vision would become more blury than the last time >Just....need...some..rest.< she struggled to think as her mind was slowly going blank due to her body shutting down on its own because of her exhaustion >No...I ...must train.< she would attempt to stand up but her body would not respond >Fuck.< she thought once again as she closed her eye again and went to sleep.* - Sat Oct 24 23:01:58 2015
