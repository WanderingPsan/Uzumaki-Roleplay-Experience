<br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Exiting out of the academy she entered the courtyard and adjusted the blade that was on her back then stretched her hands upward to the sky. After a couple of seconds she would bring her hands down and prepared to set off tot he commercial district she had been in yesterday >Today seems like it will be a good day.< she thought to herself as she began walking out of the courtyard and onto the rest fo the village >Yesterdays truth or dare was going well untill things got out of hand....that reminds me, I need to regulate the alcohol consumption in this village. Maybe apply more stricts laws regarding the way people behave.< she would mentally sigh as she continued to make her way toward the commercial district but she did not travel as fast as she could but she did it slowly so that she could take in most of what she saw in the village.

Once she arrived at the commercial district she would stop and looked at the people going about their daily business >Hmm, a couple of months back this place was mostly deserted with only a couple of fishermen selling fish to feed their families. Granted the place was rebuilt from the ground up so that did help it out a lot but there is still Sunagakure to worry about. Thanks to them we are slowly suffering an economic downfall.< Pushing those thoughts to the back of her mind she would slowly begin moving forward to head deeper into the district. Picking up the pace she would dodge the people as best as she could since most of them were carrying crates and pushing carts it would be quite a task to do but she managed to do it without much trouble.

Arriving at a dead end she would send chakra to the bottom of her feet and began to run up the wall as fast as she could now since there were no obstacles in her way. Giving a quick glance around to the area she would hop off the wall and landed on the roof of a nearby establishment with a roll to keep her momentum going then would continue to run on the roof. Stopping the best she could she would slide a bit then shifted her direction to run off the roof, onto a cart that was not in movement and got onto the busy street once again. >So many people come and go.< she thought to herself as she slowed her pace down so that she wouldnt have to bump into people who were going about their daily life in the commercial district. >This is more annoying than I thought it would be.< she told herself as she dodged an incoming villager with a cart stocked with merchandise.

Made her way as fast as she could but as cautiously as she could so that no villagers would be distrubed or bumped into to the edge of the commercial district and looked back to get one last view of all the people going about their daily life. Once that was done she would turn around and ran back toward the center of the village using anything she could as an obstacle to her so that she could get used to dealing with these types of things in case she ever found herself in a combat situation that required her to be quick on her feet >Everything seems relatively peaceful now.< she thought to herself as she ran ontop of a roof and watched the villagers go on about their day >I hope things can remain like this for a while longer. I would be very saddened if something would to happen to this village while I am the one protecting it.<

Nearing the academy courtyard she would run down the wall of a house she was currently ontop off and made her way quickly to run along side the walls of the wall and went all the way along then the jumped onto the academy itself and stood on the roof overlooking the courtyard >All of these people count on me to protect them but I can only do so much for them. One day they will have to fend for themselves as I will not be around for long, I do have plans of my own so yeah. I hope that everything works out how it is supposed to.< she would hop down from the academy roof and entered the courtyard then made her way to the gym that was inside of the academy where she would proceed to teach the shinobi something.* - Tue Nov  3 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Running through the vast forest that resides within the land of fire she would use this opportunity to get two things done. One, to continue on traveling to where ever her next destination was and to continue on practicing her feet work since that is what she had been training for the past couple of days. Running up a tree trunk she would use one of the branches as a platform to jump to the next branch >I have really been away from this world for too long.< she thought to herself as she proceeded to run down the next tree trunk and continued her on her way via running but on the ground level >I wonder how long it will take me to get back into the saddle. A week? A couple of months? Years? Who knows I will have to see and find out for myself but I have to say I am excited for this to happen.< She now enter a road that she would quickly cross as she wanted to remain off the major paths that lead to any major village. Even minor villages were avoided as she did not want anyone to see her, at least without a henge.

Zig-zagging her way forward she would take cover with the tree trunks and would occasionally run up a tree to over look the area to see where she was heading >Hmmm.< she thought to herself as she scanned around >Maybe if I go that way I can avoid most of the population that can be roaming around these parts.< Hearing a creaking behind her she would quickly reach for Hiramekarei that hung on her back and pointed the blade at the sound which just happened to be a bird that had landed behind her >Heh.< she thought to herself >It seems that I have become too paranoid ever since I became the standing in Mizukage.< Holstering the blade onto her back again she would jump off the branch onto the next one and continued to make her way toward her final destination.

Jumping from branch to branch she would be keeping her senses tunned so that she could detect anyone trying to get to her >So far so good, this world seems highly baren now. Before there used to be people everywhere but with all the current things that have been going on with the world I guess it is understandable that the area would be mostly clear of them.< Running down the tree trunk she would continue zig-zagging through the trees quietly so that no one around the area if any could hear her footsteps, she really hoped that no one had extraordinary hearing because in that case she would be more than fucked since they would be able to pin-point her location without her doing much about it other than trying to run away which was more or less exactly what she was doing.

Arriving at a rocky area she decided to take a small brake as she needed to catch her breathe since she had been running and doing unnecessary movements that affected her stamina and greatly >Damn.< she thought to herself as she was panting >I really need to focus on keeping my stamina, I have definitely need to work on it, fuck.< Placing her arms over her head to open her airways a bit more she would take in three deep breaths of air and brought her arms down >I need to continue.< she told herself as she took off running yet again toward the unknown. Since she was in a rocky area she used this as an obstacle course so she jumped over the rocks that were jumpable, practiced her footing without suimen on some of the rocks with almost dangerous results as she almost fell several times but managed to barely hang on >Not doing that again.< she thought to herself as she moved on from the area

Entering into the forest again she would notice  that the trees were slowly decreasing in number as she was approaching the Kumogakure - Konohagakure border and the amount of rocks were increasing >Have I really ran this far?< she asked herself a bit skeptic about it since it had not seemed that long of a trip to her >Hmm, well this is sure to bring up memories.< she thought to herself as she found herself putting the forest behind her as she ventured deeper into the rocky terrain that was characteristic of the village of Kumogakure where she proceeded to use the rocky terrain to train being quick on her feet. This would pose a problem as the rocks would provide an uneven terrain to walk on making running a pain both literally and figuratively * - Wed Nov  4 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Took out the Camelia blade given to her by Baen and took advantage of her current situation since she was near the forest and some rocks that she could use as target practice >Might as well get this out of the way since training will not hurt me as it is something I can use later down the line if need be. It is somewhat useless since I have the Hiramekarei but it cant possibly hurt to know how to use short blades or katanas for that matter. I also need to develop a fighting style unique to me and the blades I carry. With Hiramekarei I need to be constantly spinning if I want to make use of the weaponry that I can create with it so yeah. I have alot to work on.< Focusing down on the blade she would see that it was visibly deteriorated because of the lack of chakra that Baen had provided >Damn.< she said to herself as she could feel the weight from the blade had shifted due to the deterioration.

>Doesn't matter.< she thought to herself as she twisted her wrist with the blade in it and prepared to do some swings so she would grab the blade with both hands and brought it up infront of her >Doing swings wont help me as much as I think it will so I must do what I did before in Kirigakure. I must develop my own fighting using what I know.< she would bright the blade up over her head and brought the blade down then pivoted her body letting go of the blade with one hand and extended the blade with the other in one swift motion >Not bad.< she thought to herself as she thrusted the blade like a rapier seven times infront of her moving forward with each thrust. >Faster.< she thought to herself as she droped to the floor to deliver a sweeping kick to the air infront of her followed by a kick that went straight up.

As she was doing this she imagined that there was an opponent infront of her to make her training that much more easier. >Visualize the opponent. Anticipate his movements, react accordingly.< She would do another series of thrusts aiming at her imaginary opponets chest >Each strike must be fast and lethal, aim for the general area where the heart would be, target the lungs, pierce the stomatch, cause as much damage as possible if not.< she would then jump up and delivered two quick kicks as she shifted the blade in her hand and brought it down imagening that she was sticking it down ontop of her opponents head >Not good enough.< she thought to herself as she shifted the blade yet again >I need to improve. I cant achieve nothing like this. I can hope to be strong like this. I must do better than this. I have accomplished so much. I will now slack off now.<

Standing upright she would be holding the blade down with one hand near her side > There must be something I am missing.< she thought to herself as she crouched down and stabbed the blade on the ground. As she did this she could her a crack coming from inside the blade which displeased her >The thing is running out of chakra. If only Baen would still be around, I would still be in Kirigakure teaching everyone like I told them I would. I guess one more sin for me to bare. I wonder how its going. Did Lera take over? Hmmm, I wonder.< Proceeding to stand up she would glance around the area then bent over and reached for the blade and pulled it off the ground >No point in worrying about the past now. This is now and that was then, I just hope that they could forgive me for what I did to them.< Bringing the blade up and grabing it with both hands she would take in a deep breath and stared forward.

Bringing the blade down she would shake her head and placed the blade inside of her jacket again >This is for a later time, for now I must get back to traveling. I do not know where I am going to end up but I know that I must get strong for my own self. For to long I have been neglecting my own training.< Shacking her head once again  and began to walk in the same direction she was originally going in. Placing her hands inside of her pockets she would keep her sensing abilities focused on the area around her to avoid any surprises that might be awaiting her in her journey.* - Wed Nov  4 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Grabed some of the decomposing bodies and arranged them in a way so that they could be used as target practice, since there was an abundance of skulls laying around Kumogakure she would grab them and place them in several places around the bodies >It fucking sticks.< she thougt to herself as she took off her jacket and folded it neatly and placed it on the ground beside her >Lets see, the arms are worth ten points, legs.....five, torso two and heads twenty points. That seems reasonable enough to me.< Reaching into her backpouch she pulled out several Kunai knifes and shuriken throwing stars and placed them ontop of her jacket >What should I use first? Shurikens? Kunais? Hmmm. I wonder which would be more effective, the kunais are heavier making them pack more of a punch but then again the shurikens are light and can be hard to spot as they travel through the air.<

Bending over to grab a few Kunai knifes she held them in her hand >They are heavy as I thought they would be, now to see the effect that they have on the body.< Placing a few kunai on her other hand she kept one on her main hand >I shall aim for the body first since my experience with throwing weaponry around is shit to none so aiming for the biggest part of the body should be easiest.< Tossing the extra Kunais she had on her other hand to the floor she would place her finger through the ring in the kunai and spun it around > So two points for each torso hit right? Seems simple enough. Five throws so that should be ten points if I hit them all, very well.< grabing the Kunai firmly in her hand she would focus on one of the bodies she had set up prior to all of the internat discussions she had with herself and prepared herself to throw the Kunai knife.

Cocking her right hand up she would extend it forward as fast as she could letting go of the Kunai knife. The knife would cut through the air and impact the headless body embedding itself in its chest >Not bad.< she thought to herself as she bent over to grab another kunai knife >Continue aiming for the chest do not try and do anything else as you will most likely fail, dont do any new shit untill you have mastered wha tyou are trying to do.< Spinning the Kunai around again she would grab it firmly like she did with the previous Kunai and prepared to throw it at the body >Hmm I wonder.< she would think to herself as she threw the kunai a bit lower causing the kunai to impact on the bodies stomach causing a green liquid to slowly begin to exit through the wound >God!< she exclaimed to herself as she brought her arm up to cover her nose >It fucking stinks!< she told herself as she took several steps back and turned around in an attempt to escape the putrid smell that she had unleashed.

>Ignore it.< she said to herself as she did her best to not throw up on the spot. You must get past this to continue on with your training, this is the real world now not the sheltered life you lived in Kirigakure. You knew that it was not going to be easy so sack the fuck up and continue on with the training.< In a way it was weird that she spoke to herself like this but considering the situation she was in where she was the living human in the village she really did not have anyone to talk to really so the conversations in her head only grew more and more lively. Turning around to face the body she would make a face of disgust as the smell clearly bothered her but she had to endure it and soon enough she would not notice it as she had grown accustomed to it >Throw the kunai at the chest this time.< she told herself as she bent over once again and grabed a kunai. Cocking her arm back she threw the kunai forward and stuck it on the right side ribs of the body >Not bad.< she thought to herself as she bent over once again to grab the last two remaining kunais.

Holding each kunai on each hand she would focus her gaze on the body she was using for target practice and prepared to throw both kunais at the same time toward the same target >So far three out of five kunais have hit. This will determine if I go with a perfect score or if I need to improve on my shurikenjutsu.< Grabing onto the kunais tightly she would cross her arms infront of her chest then extended them forward at the same time throwing the kunai knifes at the body that was infront of her >Come on.< she told herself as she knifes cut through the air and onto the body. One knife impacted the body on the lower abdoment region while the other one only cut the side of the body and went past it >Well four out of five, I need to imporove my shurikenjutsu and I will not rest untill I do so.< Walking over to the body she would pull out the kunai knifes out of the body and used her suiton release to make sure the knifes were clean. Once that was done she would go around looting all the bodies that had been laying there to pick up any weaponry that she could find.* - Wed Nov  4 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) poofs into the area with her hair hanging low and in a crouched position as she was looking at the floor. There was a blade with twin hilts on her back Yuudai would have been able to make out perfectly, slowly bringing her gaze up to look at the male he would be able to see that her face had a piece of someones skull covering most of her features only revealing the color of her eyes which to the untrained person would appear to be a case of heterochromia as her right eye was lavander in color and her left eye was crimson. Her jacket was adorned with bones as well, some would be visible but some would be hiden since she was crouching.

Training her sensing abilities on the male she would watch him carefully "You arent from around here." she said in a monotone voice as the color of his skin did not match those of the dead villagers and soldiers when they were alive "What are you doing here?" she questioned the male now expecting an answer "Why would you come to such a desolate place?"* - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015

He would have been able to see that there were several bone fragments around the wood and there was a place that had an extinguished fire place sorrounded by some rocks to keep the fire from spreading. Talking over to a chair she had pulled out of one of the abandoned houses she took off the large blade on her back and placed it next to her "Who are you?"* - Thu Nov  5 01:31:44 2015

Hmmm.< Shaking her head she went back to carving the skull cutting now deep into the cheek bone and brought the kunai back along the inital cut to make sure any imperfections would be cut away just like on the other side.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) walked up to the target practice range she had set up days before and repeated the process she had done just like before. She would take off the Hiramekarei from her backand set it on the ground carefully followed by her jacket that was folded and placed ontop of the blade. Bringing her arms up to stretch she would focus on the bodies and heads she had laid around >I went home with four hits on the body yesterday so there is clear room for improvement.< she thought to herself as she stopped stretching then reached into her holster to take out a couple of Kunai >Hmm lets see same thing as yesterday. Five throws and see how many I get.< Holding a single Kunai in her main hand she would cock it back and throw it at the body that was infront of her. The kunai cut through the air infront of her and impacted the body in the center of the chest.

>Lucky shot.< she thought to herself  as she passed over another Kunai from her off hand to her main hand and focused on the body again >Remember not to hit the body in the stomach. Remember what happened last time you did that and the putrid smell it unleashed, so avoid that at all cost.< Cocking her hand back she would hold the Kunai tightly and brought har hand forward to release the kunai aiming to hit the body in the chest or general torso reason which ever one came first she would be happy with it. The kunai cut through the sky once again and impacted the body on the left side of the ribs cutting through the fourth and fifth rib >Not bad but still not good enough.< she told herself as she moved another Kunai to her main hand getting ready to throw it again at her intended target.

Lacing her finger through the hole in the kunai she would spin it around a couple of times >lets see where else should I hit? If I keep aiming for the chest I wont improve on my abilities and I also need a moving target since those are harder to move. I will have Yuudai help me later on, maybe use him as a moving  target. Who knows maybe that will work.< she thought to herself as as she stopped spinning the Kunai on her finger and held it firmly on her hand >Very well I shall aim for the arm, it should be more difficult since it is a smaller target.< Setting her gaze on the right arm of the body she cocked her arm back and let the Kunai go aiming for the right arm of the body. Having the Kunai cut through the air once again she would have been off her target by a bit as the Kunai just cut the side of the arm instead of stabbing into it.

>For fucks sakes.< she said to herself as she realized that it was a bad idea to have switched things up a bit but she used this as a way to improve >What went wrong?< she thought to herself as she stared forward at the body >It couldn't move, my aim is not that greatest but it also isnt bad so there must be some sort of outside factor.< Glancing around she would try to pick up anything that might have affected it but did not find anything out of the ordinary, just the wind blowing which at the time she did not pay much attention to since it was such a naural thing that just happened so she did not notice it what so ever >Come on think.< she told herself as she really wanted to figure out why she had missed her throw.

Holding the final Kunai on her main hand now she looked over at the body that had the Kunai embedded in it >Aim for tha arm again and dont fuck up. All you have to do is focus on the target. You have it easy right now since the body is not moving but think about when it is. What excuse will you have then? None. You wont have an excuse. It is do or die. Remember it. Always give it your best at everything you do. It has always been that way so why stop now? Kirigakure made you soft, it made you neglect your training and now you are paying the price for it.< Returning back to the kunai now she would cock her arm back and threw that Kunai at the bodies arm. Expecting a better result she would be sorely disappointed as she ended up impacting the bodies shoulder >God damn it.< she thought to herself as she walked over and pulled out the Kunais from the body and washes them to make sure they were clean.* - Thu Nov  5 19:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Walked around the empty village and saw many opportunities to practice her running since most of the village had mountains or small mounds that would make the terrain in even >Very nice.< she thought to herself as she continued to glance around the village making her way through it >The bodies should add nice obstacles to the path I take so I think this will work out just fine, I can add more things like boxes and carts to make the travel more annoying for me. There is also the added bonus of the mountains so I will need to constantly have my Suimen technique and adjust my chakra control so that I dont end off sliding down the surface of the mountain.< Going to the proper spot to start her training.

Once she arrived at the proper spot she would begin to stretch her legs >Hmmm, you know running around is not as fun as I thought it would be, it was just the excitement I got back in Kirigakure but since I already started with it might as well see it through to the end.< Shifting to her other leg she would begin to stretch again >I wonder if Lera took over, she is probably in the mansion with Violet right now and Jirun is probably being lazy and not doing his missions. Mana is most likely doing the missions excessively, Heiwa is also most likely doing the missions that Lera gives him. I hope one day to come back and have them forgive me for what I have done to them. I will probably have to explain why I did what I did but I am sure they will forgive me and if they don't I well I do not know what I will do then.<

Finishing up her stretching she would get into a sprinters stance >On your mark.< she told herself as she looked up at the path she was going to go through >Get set.< she would raise her hips >Go.< she would take off as fast as she could running forward with very little to hold her back or stop her. >I am getting used to the stench.< she thought to herself as she ran past some bodies laying around in the street >It does not bother me as much but I can still detect it which is better than nothing I guees.< Jumping over a pile of bodies she continued on a straight path then began to slowly inch her way to the right untill she began to ran on a wall >This will surely save some time.< she thought to herself as she was making short work of the section of the path she was running through thanks to this action.

Running out of wall to run on she would be forced to go back to the path she was taking and encountered a cart standing there in the middle of the road with its owner laying on it without his head >Tch.< she thought to herself as she was probably the one that ended his life >Could I have done things differently? I could have only killed the soldiers that were fighting adn spared the rest. Why did I even kill them all? There was no need to, in the end it did not matter since I ended up leaving Kirigakure but for the short while it was worth it. Kirigakure saw growth that I only hope continues since well I do not plan on returning any time soon.< Making her way past the cart she would jump over several boxes that were stacked up on top of each other with spoiled products in them then she would continue to run forward.

Running up a rock wall she would use the Suimen technique to stick to the surface and jumped from one side to the other zig-zagging on the rocks surface >Keep your chakra in check at all times, do not lose focus on amount of chakra you have on your feet, the slightest fluctuation in my chakra can send my ass falling down to the floor and that will not be good for me.< Continueing with her zig-zagging she would begin running horizontaly along the wall then would push off the wall and and on a roof then rolled forward then came to a stop >Good enough.< she thought to herself as she patted herself a few times to get any dirt off her clothing >Back to the doc, I have a lot of bones to carve out.<* - Fri Nov  6 05:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) She went to the training field and looked around while her hands were on the nape of her neck, it seems empty for the most part so she used this time to get some training done. She walked toward the wooden target dummies that were set up there and took out a kunai.She readied it in her hand like she had been though in the academy and threw it at the target dummy having it bounce off as she did not throw it properly.

>Hmm.< She thought to herself as he walked over toward the dummy to pick up her kunai >Wonder what I did wrong.< she questioned herself as she was now walking back to where she had thrown the Kunai from. Examening the Kunai closely she could see no real defect with the weapon so she decided to give it another go, cocking back her arm she threw the kunai straight at the target only to have it bounce off once again giving out a loud THUD as the metal hit the wood.

"Fuck." she cursed silently in a muttered voice >What the hell am I doing wrong?< She questioned herself once again as she repeated the walk she had done to retreave the kunai. Crouching to grab the Kunai she looked at the wooden target dummy and stabbed it with the Kunai burring it into the wood >It does pierce making it sharp enough, so now why does it now pierce when I throw it.< She inhaled and exhaled slowly as she looked around her seeing the wind pick up some dirt that was in the training grounds and saw how the wind rustled the branches from some of the trees.

>Come on Kirie.< she said to herself as if to have some sort of motivation. Standing up and no longer seeing the backdrop she pulled the Kunai out of the target dummy and walked back to where she had been throwing the weapon from. Once there she looked at the Kunai and how it was in her hand, she moved it from hand to hand, spinning it with her index finger in an attempt to get a better feel for the weapon >It is heavy but at the same time it is light.< she continued to maneuver it in her hand untill she felt like she had gotten a better understanding for how it moved and flowed through the air.

She gave it one more spin with her index finger before securing it in her palm and focused on the target dummy before her and began to controll her breathing. She inhaled slowly and exhaled slowly through her nose trying to keep her heart rate in a calm state. Once she was ready she cocked her arm backwards and threw the Kunai letting it cut through the air between her and the target dummy. By the way it looked she was sure the kunai was going to hit its mark, but to her surprice she had completely missed the target dummy as she had thrown the kunai way above the dummies head.* - Sat Nov  7 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Returned to the training field after yesterdays failure to land a successful hit on the target dummy with a kunai so she tried her luck with some shuriken now. She reached into her pouch and took out five shuriken, holding them in her hands she looked at them >They are much smaller than the shuriken and much lighter.< she then poked one of the tips and drew blood from her finger >It sure is sharp.< she continued her train of thought as she brought up her finger to her mouth and sucked on the blood to make the bleeding stop.

Focusing on the task at hand she readied the shuriken in her hand tossing it up a couple of times making sure she catched it avoiding the sharp edges and once she was ready she threw it at the wooden target dummy. As the shuriken was flying through the air a strong wind gust sent it off course and caused it to slam  on the ground behind it. Cursing out loud she pulled out another shuriken "What the fuck! Come one! Am I ever going to catch a break!?" she cursed the heavens or well she just cursed out loud.

Thrown into a bit of rage from her lack of success she threw the shuriken as hard as she could not even bothering to measure her strength or where she threw it to nick the edge of the dummies arm. Tightening her lips she let out a very frustrated sound "Ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff!" Disappointed she pulled out another shuriken and threw it directly into the ground crouching right after. Controlling her breathing she looked at the shuriken and cursed softly as she breathing in nice and slowly.

Regaining her posture she pulled the shuriken out and held it in her hand >Father used to make this seem so easy.< she thought to herself as she was setting her vision down range "You got this Kirie, just focus." she reassured herself. With her vision now down range she began to observe the leaves as they were flying with the wind current, she watched the dirt being picked up by it as well and decided to try and throw it to where the wind was not going to fuck up the trajectory.

The shuriken flew threw the air and hit the target dummy in the lower part of the torso. Hearing a satisfactory THUD of vicotry Kirie jumped in the air proud of what she had done. Walking toward the target dummy she could see that the shuriken had struck the target far bellow the designated bullseye. This of course did not please her as she let out a heavy sigh as she pulled the shuriken out and went for the other one she had thrown placing both of them inside her pouch and calling it a day.* - Sat Nov  7 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Placed bottles of milk and honey buns in different locations of the cave near the entrance as there was more light in there than in the back. She took several steps back and reached into her back pouch and layed down all her Kunai and shuriken on the ground and spread them out in separated piles >I need to get this down if I want to acomplish something in my life.< she thought to herself clearly determined to accomplish become a marksman she had always wanted to be ever since she was a little kid that witness the skill from someone with expirience like her father.

She took of her protector that was wrapped around her neck and placed it on the ground followed by her backpouch and holster. The ambiance in the cave was moist with several stalagmines and stalactites with water dripping from them and onto them in a never ending cycle. Bending down to pick up a kunai she looked at the closest bottle of milk which was near the entrance and focused on it as she tossed the kunai in her hand being careful enough not to stab herself with it.

Holding the kunai steady in her hand she set her gaze upon bottle and brought her arm back preparing to through the kunai. She steadied her breathing to keep her pulse calm and eased her mind making hitting the bottle the only thing on her mind to try and ensure that she hit the bottle, bringing her arm foward she released the kunai sending it toward the bottle. Having the Kunai cut through the air it impacted the bottom part of the kunai having it impact the ground lifting up dirt making a "CLINK" followed by the sould of the bottle breaking.

"Well at least I hit it.< she thought to herself but then reprimended herself as she knew she had to do better than this >Come on Kirie, don't settle for this you know you can do better you just have to focus.< she would then picked up another kunai and focused on a honey bun that was relatively farther away from  the bottle of milk.Bringing her hand up with the kunai it in she decided to base herself on instinct and threw the Kunai as soon as her arm was all the way up cocked into position. A "CLANG" resonated through the cave an indication that she had missed her target which cause her to curse under her breath as she decided to take a break for the time being.

Clearly agitated by the fact that she couldn't get her aim to be as good as she would like it to be. She tried her luck with the shurikens now as she picked one up and as she had noticed some time ago it was lighter than the Kunai, she threw it at the same bottle that was in parallel to the ground and missed >For fucks sakes.< she thought to herself as she grabed a handful of shuriken now being careful not to cut herself while doing so and began to throw them one by one. A total of ten shuriken were thrown and out of those then only four hit their mark. Not satisfied with this she decided to give it a rest and called it a day.* - Sat Nov  7 05:37:29 2015
