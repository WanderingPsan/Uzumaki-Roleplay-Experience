<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) looked at Jirun and executed the required handseals to do the genjutsu. She would send yin release chakra toward Jirun's head as this was how genjutsu worked by disrupting the chakra flow that was located in his head, the technique would go off without a hitch as the mastery she had with the jutsu would have been considered mastered. He would see many kunoichi emerge out of the ground wearing the same clothing that Kirie wore but only they were black in color. One by one the kunoichi emerged from the ground and would reach for a kunai that was located in their back pouch and began to slowly advance toward Jirun.* - Sat Sep 26 00:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) did what she just told Jirun and would execute the Tiger handseal as she used her chakra to accelerate her metabolism which allowed her with all the practice that she had with the jutsu to poof from where she was and appeared at the end of the "See." she called toward Jirun with a loud enough voice for him to hear since the distance between them had increased considerably "At first you will only be able to teleport a small distance away.* - Sat Sep 26 01:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) watched the demonstration and would take mental notes from it >I see.< she told herself >Not much to it as it really just is a jump kick.< with that she would chase after Fujitora taking advantage of the situation and would jump toward him but would step on a large enough stick to make her lose her footing so the end result would be a very low jump that instead of having the kick aimed at Fujitora's head would end up being aimed toward his back since he had gone ahead and kicked the house.....(so much for the 'sacred' hozuki island lolololololololololol suck on that Tethy's)* - Sat Sep 26 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would regain her footing and looked over at Fujitora who was pist at this point "......" >Quickly think of something to say.< she would look around and stopped the stick that she had stepped on >Fuck it here goes nothing.< she told herself as she pointed to the stick "I....lost my footing..." she told him trying to think of a good enough excuse. >I thought we were going to spar....I guess I was wrong...whoops.<* - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) gave a fake laugh at what Fujitora said then would cross her arms and shook her head "Oh no, come on Tora you left me hanging for days on end when we had an agreement. Come on a little spar will not hurt you." >That much.< she thought to herself as she turned around and ran toward the wall. Jumping up she extended her right leg up with the palm of her foot facing the wall. She managed to land the kick but she had managed to land it in the exact same spot where Fujitora had kicked it and slammed against causing her foot to break through the wall kicking someone inside. >https://gyazo.com/4c8da7bf5e931af17599296ad4c4b758<* - Sat Sep 26 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) removing her foot out of the wall she would quickly apologize as she did not expect the structural weakness to be there "I'm sorry!" she would say with a slight vow as she pointed toward Fujitora "I was trying to learn something from him...it wont happen again." With that she would walk over toward Fujirota and got into a sparing stance focusing her gaze on his feet using "Ready when you are." she told him as she tried to not make it obvious that she was staring at his feet since he had already found a way to counter that in previous spars.* - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) running toward him she stared at his feet all the way toward him then she would quickly send a kick up to his face which was really a feint as she quickly twisted her body to bring in a low kick aimed at his left leg "Kirigakure Style: Twister!" she would say with a rather loud voice for the hell of it. It was clear that she had mastered the technique that Fujitora had thought him. >Let's see how you react to this.< she thought to herself as her leg traveled toward his left leg.* - Sat Sep 26 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would hear him and would have gotten her kick deflected which only served to leave her in a vouyant state that worked to her advantage. Using her reflexes she would twist her body and landed on the ground with her legs being flexed into ninty-degree angles and used a hand to further stop herself as one of her hands reached for her backpouch, all in all she would look like a full back from any football team. >I couldn't see his sword because I was staring at his feet....also I have one eye covered.< She would use her legs that were flexed as a sort of spring to gain additional speed as she took off toward him, using her free hand to lift up her headband to be able to see better she would jump and throw a kick that she had just learn toward his face (but no admins are on to unlock the jutsu). As she traveled that short distance she would pull out her hand from her backpouch and revealed some ninja wire that with a good enough sight would have been detectable due to the glimmering with the sun. She would swing her hand foward aiming to wrap the wires around Fujitora who had to deal with her kick.* - Sat Sep 26 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would have gotten her kicked blocked which was what she really wanted as her target was the Wire Bind that she had been thought. Using her chakra she would manipulate the wires to close in and immobilize his arms as she pulled on her hand and used her chakra to tighten it on him. The wires would have cut through his clothe and would make contact with his skin but would not break it as this was just a friendly spar after all. Once on the ground she would smirk at him as she stared at his feet "Got ch-" she would suddenly being to feel a sudden heat wave take over her body >...What...is happening..< she asked herself as she began to looked around the area quickly then went back to looking at his feet when she did not find anyhting unsual about the area >This is Kirigakure No Sato...the village hidden in the mist...how can I be this hot?< she asked herself before realizing that the only outside force that could cause such a thing was standing right infront of her.

Still looking at his feet she would her free hand to begin loosening up her clothes revealing a teal stone hanging near her breasts, of course they would be covered by her undershirt "W-What...did you do to me?" she asked him as she had began to sweat "How...is this happening?" she continued on with her questioning.* - Sat Sep 26 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would feel the tension on the wires and would use her chakra and her hand to tighten them a bit more "You must have done something." she would say with several pauses and pants as the heat seemed to only be getting worse with every action she took " Heat is rare in this village." she would begin explaining her thought process that lead her to that conclusion "The mist helps keep the village cool, I was fine untill this spar...I keep up with my training everyday...the only logical conclusion is you." she would then take off her coat and revealed her black undershirt and her neckless. When her coat was on the ground she would drop to a knee as she began to sweat more and more causing her to loosen the wires that were binding him causing him to break free. Still looking at his feet she would tell him "This was a friendly spar.."* - Sat Sep 26 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would see his hand and wanted to take it but the heat that had been generated within her body would have been great as it was shown by the sweat and the fact that her shirt was suck to her body. She would instead lay down on her coat hoping for the mist to help her body cool off "Give me a couple of minutes." she told him with several pants and pauses between words "That was dirty." she told him as she layed there trying to regulate her breathing.

She would her his comment but could not disregard it this time as more of her body had been exposed so she would bring her hand up to separate her wet shirt from her body >What was that.< she asked herself as she turned her scarlet gaze to meet him no longer looking at his feet "That was fuuinjutsu." she stated as it was the only thing that could have caused such a reaction on her body.* - Sat Sep 26 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would slowly stand up with his help and would get a rather confused look on her face "Those who survive the heat keep running and usually the ones who what?" she could not understand what he ment by that but what she did know is that her body temperature had began to return to normal "I thought that I know every fuuinjutsu you knew..guess I was wrong."* - Sat Sep 26 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) bent over for her coat that was on the ground then straightened up "I think I am done for the day." she told him as that technique of his had taken alot out of her "It is a fuuinjutsu..you placed a seal somewhere on my body...where is it?"* - Sat Sep 26 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) followed after him as she placed her cloak on and lowered her headband to cover her left eye "I am worried now. I do not know if the seal would reapear Tora." she expressed her honest concern.* - Sat Sep 26 03:48:16 2015

She would send out the chakra through her mouth making it a pearly white mist that would quickly cover the area and would intergrate itself with the existing mist that was naturally in the village. Given her level of mastery with the jutsu the mist would be thick and would make it hard for anyone to see more than a few feet infont of them.
