<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Walked over to the side of Zaen and pointed out to his ribs with her finger "Here. From what I have seen Baen do, he can extend every single one of his ribs out of his chest without suffering any consequences." she would move her hand up to his shoulder now with one hand as she reached for the Camelia blade that Baen had given her "This." she said as she brought the blade into full view for them to see "Came out of here." she would poke his shoulder with her finger "Only it came out of Baens shoulder of course." * - Tue Nov  3 01:12:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) she casually glances over at Zaen as she placed the Camelia blade back into her jacket "Hmm? I am simply teaching here." she responded to him as she turned around and stepped back to where she originally was "What I am also doing is giving people poiner for future team work, think about it Zaen. In the future you will be placed into a squad with two other gening and a ranking shinobi to take you out on missions. What I am doing is here is simply informing what your particular set of abilities are since they are unique to three shinobi of this village and several villagers." At that point she would quickly reach up with her right hand to grab one of the hilts of the Hiramekarei  and spun around "Hiramekarei: Release!" she would say.

The blade unraveled from it bandage confines as the chakra stored within the blade flared up and covered the blade in a coat made out of her chakra that would then transfrom into a hammer. Spinning in position she would use her other hand to grab onto the other hilt and brought the balde to impact Zaens causing him to be killed instantly as the strike was something to be feared. All his bones would break from the force of the impact and the blood within his body would splatter as he was being hit by an incoming truck. His body now mangled by the impact would fly toward the wall that he was facing "As I said I am teaching here." she commented as she glanced around at the shinobi infront of her "Let it be known that I will not tolerate anyone attempting to endanger my life. If you do not like the way I do things then suck it up. I try my best to give you guys the best possible treatment, the best possible village for you to thrive in so having someone attempting to end my life from this village -my- village that I payed out of my -own- money to repeair so that you guys can continue thriving in your homeland is a big fucking slap to the face." The chakra on the blade would return to its coat form as the hammer disappeared.* - Tue Nov  3 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) made her way to the grave yard and dug up the decomposing body of Vessuls bodyguard >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she tried not to breathe in the stench that the corpse was giving off >Fucking shit, why did he have to die?< she asked herself as she brought the body up from the grave and began to drag carry it as fast as she could toward the mansions and once she was inside she would take the body up to the bedroom and prepared the scene. She would tuck the body in the bed and placed the MIzukage hat on the stand next to the bed >Fucking stinks.< she thought to herself as she did her best not to throw up because of the smell. Moving along with her plan she would take out several Kunai knifes and stabbed them on the body to simulate an assassination so she would place them on key spots on the body to indicate so. Taking the final knife she would stab the right eye to simulate someone knowing about her byakugan. To finish it off she would place several explosive tags on the body and in the room to make sure it seemed like the assailant wanted to make sure to errase any to all evidence.

Just to be sure she would the Flame Dragon Bullet jutsu to burn the body to a crisp to make sure it was not recognizeable thus allowing her to fake her death. She would go every possible scenario in her head to make sure that the body was not recognized as someone elses since considering Kirigakures currect state they did not have any medical examiners of top quality. >I will return.< she thought to herself as she make her way out of the building and henged into a random person and detonated the explosive tags that were within the room. After that she would proceed to make her escape from Kirigakure no Sato.* - Tue Nov  3 06:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) made her escape from Kirigakure no Sato by swimming in the riven and crossed to the outside of the wall thanks to an pipe that let the water in from the sea >I hope that they will be alright.< she told herself as she emerged on the other side of the wall taking advantage of the confusion that was going on within the village. Using the suimen technique she would climb up onto the water and made a run for the shoreline then for the border. Taking her time to gather herself she ran up a tree and hid in the high ontop of the branches where the foliage was thickest to hide herself from view >I know that they will hate me for this and I know that I have forsaken the village but I must get my shit together first. There is too much going on right now.<

She would wait a couple of hours hiding in that tree before she decided to move onward with her journey >I do not know if what I did was the right call but I could not take it anymore. I wanted to stay there but everything changed when Edge showed up. Everything changed when I helped slaughter the people of Kumogakure.< By now she had reached the outskirts of Amegakure and made sure to look out for traps since the last thing she needed was to actually die >Not happening.< she thought to herself as she brought her hand up to execute the Tiger handseal and sent a burst of chakra to her left eye and turned on her byakugan as she closed her right eye so that her two visions wouldn't fuck with each other. Being able to detect many things around her she continued on her journey to a new place where she would spend the next couple of days as she had not thought of a plan >I really hope that Fujitora does not seal Hiramekarei up since I busted my ass to master the thing.< Stopping ontop of a tree branch she would crouch down as she realized that she had reached yet another border.

Scanning the area around her she would lean on the trunk to try and get some rest >The area seems clear but I cant let my guard down. All those months within the village have made me soft. I cannot allow that to continue. I need to hone my skills as a shinobi again. I swear I will be back stronger than before.< She would continue to rest against the tree trunk for a couple more minutes before she pushed herself off the tree trunk and continued on her way to a random destination of her choosing. >I need to focus on surviving first. I can make water thanks to the Suiton jutsus I know and I can cook food thanks to my Katon. All I need now is to catch the food. I can fish, hunt, scavange, anything really. Hmmm. I wonder what can I eat now since I have been away from this world for far too long.

Arriving at the vast forrest that belonged to the land of fire she would deactivate her byakugan and open left eye in order to start seeing things with that eye >Damn, my chakra is drained.< she thought to herself as she found herself to be panting due to the amount of chakra she had lost. Sitting down on the tree branch she began to meditate to regain her chakra, using her sensing abilities and her extraordinary hearing she would remain constantly watching out for anyone that might approach her by chance >I missed this.< she admited to herself as she gained a weak smile on her face >I do not know what is around the corner and I can be free here in a way. I no longer have to worry about anyone other than myself which is nice.< 

After regaining her chakra she would make her way toward the next border and found herself to be in Kumogakure >Tch.< she thought to herself  as she entered the place >I guess this place suits me, I am supposed to be dead anyway so what better place to be in than a dead village. Poetic justice in a way.< Walking along the village she could see that everything was like Kirigakure but only better since the village had no actually been totally wiped out in terms of infrastructure so the buildings were there but not the people of course since she had made sure of that >I will be fine here. No one will bother coming here and I will be able to do what I want when I want.< Looking for the "cleanest" home that she could find she would and made it her home after she had tossed out the decaying bodies and scrubbed the place clean >Here is to a new life.< * - Tue Nov  3 08:29:52 2015
