<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) followed after them without making a single noise as she moved through the sand.* - Sat Oct  3 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) followed Sanoke to his home without making a single sound which they would have noticed that even though she was right behind them she made no noise, only being able to hear her if they had extraordinary hearing. Once inside the house she would look around as she lifted up the headband covering her eye and followed Sanoke to the storage room. Unlike him and Noriko she did not bother with the old ways of doing things as she reached for her back pouch and pulled out a stack of papers which she then set on the table. She would remove her cloak revealing her black shirt and a collar that had a teal stone on it that hung above her breats.

Looking over at Sanoke she would ask him "What do I have to do? What's with all the ink and stuff?" clearly she was confused by this as she was not used to doing things the old fashioned way since she sorta just picked up fuuinjutsu along the years not really learning it from one person in particular.* - Sat Oct  3 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sanoke-kun. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm going to train. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Alright. I won't be long. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Take your time. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) shook her head "Never used ink before." she would then bring up her index finger and focused chakra onto it to the point where it became visible. Holding her finger up she would see the Kanji characters that Sanoke was painting onto the papers "Is there a specific seal I need to use or do I write my own?" she would ask him as she watched him do the Kanji character >Fuuinjutsu is soo tedious because of the preparation it takes unlike elemental ninjutsu that can be quickly casted...well at least I can cast it quickly I am not sure about the others.< 

Snapping back into the lesson she was receiving and looked intently at the now finished kanji filled page "Yeah I see it." she muttered as her eyes scanned the page up and down >So by placing that onto something I will be able to atract something with the other one?< she would question herself trying to remember what she saw with the demonstration Sanoke had given her with.

>So I do have to make my own seal.< she thought to herself as Sanoke had answered the question she had asked herself just moments ago "It doesn't matter what I place on the paper as long as I can make it react to my chakra right? It can be anything I want?" she would ask him as she stopped the focus of chakra to her finger as she placed her had on the table "In a way this is how a magnet works yes? One end hold a positive charge and the other hold a negative charge that well attract each other. Am I correct?" With that she hoped that Sanoke would know that she was actually paying attention to him and was not just there daydreaming.* - Sat Oct  3 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well. - Sat Oct  3 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: And understood. - Sat Oct  3 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Keep going. - Sat Oct  3 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) proceeded to put into action what Sanoke had just explained to her, she would grab a piece of paper as she focused chakra on her right index finger and when she had concentrated enough she would begin writing down the Kanji characters that he had written down for the Homing part of the jutsu and would do the necessary Fuuinjutsu related stuff to make sure that it was ready in accordance with what Sanoke told her. Grabing another piece of paper she would now begin doing the beacon seal part of the jutsu using her finger carving seal technique which was relatively more effective than the ink method used by Sanoke since there was considerably less mess on the page due to the controlled chakra.* - Sat Oct  3 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) smirked as he had abandoned the ink for the much more convenient method of using chakra to create Fuuinjutsu seals. She would watch and play close attention to the seal he was drawing on the page and listened intently to the instructions that were given along with the demonstration "So I need to write the instructions down within the seal right?" she asked him as she mimiced his but not as perfectly as he would have hoped as her writting style was different from his since not everyone writtes in the same way.

Writting the instructions down onto the paper she would go over the steps she was told to do >So I need to make the seal release chakra.< she would write that instruction down within the seal formula > The radious, according to him the better I get at using this the wider the radious will be so for now lets just go with this.< she would write a radious she thought was small enough for her first try at the jutsu then came the final step >I am guessing that the final step is activating it since well the jutsu would be useless if it werent for the formula so here goes nothing.< She would finish up writting the formula and would look at Sanoke "Is this correct?" she would ask him as she cut the chakra flow to her finger and would grab the paper to bring it close to him so that he could examine the formula.* - Sat Oct  3 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) walked over and placed the tag on a wall infront of her then would walk back to the table and grabed the brush "I'll be borrowing this." she told him as she just took it and wrapped the other formula onto it. She would then place the brush on the table and would execute the Tiger handseal to activate the seal which like Sanoke had explained before it gained a life of its 'own' as it sought out the Beacon part of the jutsu. Once it did it would just hit the wall and bounce back and onto the floor a couple of times which would bring a smile to her face as she had managed to get the jutsu down.* - Sat Oct  3 07:39:05 2015

She would look over at Lera who was asking about a large pizza the looked back at Zenaki once the bottle was filled and pulled away from her arm.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) exited the hospital and set out to a place that had a lot of cacti. She would take off her cloak as the sun made the temperature rather unbearable for her as she was used to being in the cool and misty climate of Kirigakure no Sato. She would look around to make sure that no one was in direct eye sight of her since she wanted to keep her abilities hidden but she knew that the technique she was going to use was going to cause unwanted attention because well it was a water related technique and in the desert that would stand out considering the lack of water.

She would execute three handseals Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger and began to kneed and mold her chakra inside of her stomatch then proceeded to open her mouth and expell a black mist that made its way lazily to the sky. Soon after enough mist had accumulated in the sky she would close her mouth as the water cycle began to take place, small black dropplets would begin to fall over a cactus that was near by. More and more black droplets would begin to fall at a faster rate covering the cactus for the most part, as this was going on she began to focus her chakra on the fingertips of her right hand and extended it out toward the cactus. Snapping her fingers she would make the chakra that was focused there spark which caused a fire ball to begin forming infront of her finger tips.* - Sat Oct  3 18:23:21 2015

When it impacted the cactus quickly caught on fire due to the nature of the of both the jutsus combination. She would gain a smirk on her face as she had managed to pull it off >Who know that I would be able to create oil from my Suiton release..I doubt anyone has been able to do this before which gives me an advantage. Of course there is the posibility that someone already has done this before but well as of now I will take credit for creating this jutsu.<

She would wait untill the cloud of oil had dispersed and began to weave the three handseals she had done before to create the jutsu again Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger and molded and kneeded her chakra inside of her stomatch then waited a bit more to release the technique now. Opening her mouth she would release the black mist that did the same thing as the previous mist only this time it did it above another cactus that was nearby to her relative location, having the mist form a cloud and cause precipitation to fall ontop of the cactus just like the one she had previous done it on.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: So... - Sun Oct  4 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) brought her hands up to execute the concealment handseal and let out a pearly white mist that began to cover the hall way quickly as she did not want to get surpriced attacked by the person she was supposed to fight. Moving silently she would stay low to the ground and hoped for the best as she kept her senses tunned on Rymei ready to react to anything she would throw her way.* - Sun Oct  4 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) had her mist blown back at her which was troublesome to say the least as she was counting of this jutsu for her next strategy but things never work out as planned so she would stand up and began molding and kneeding her chakra inside her stomatch as she did a single handseal Snake then opened her mouth. Quickly a jet of water began to eject from her mouth with great velocity covering the with of the hallway rushing toward Rymei as she did not know what else she could do as she relied greatly on her mist >Think Think.< she told to herself as the water rushed down the hallway >If she uses the thing that blow my mist back I am dead.< she told herself once again as she closed her mouth and stood there waiting for the result as she extended her right hand out with her fingers pressed together. If rymei was a sensor she would sense that there was chakra building up on her finger tips and she would also be able to tell that the same was going on in the opposite hand as well only this one rested at her side.* - Sun Oct  4 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) saw as Ryemei would climb up the walls of the hallway which in all honesty was smart of her and foolish of me not to specify the highet of the wave but oh well. She quickly retract her arm back as she had thought of a new idea on what to do with the situation at hand. Kneeding and molding her chakra inside of her stomatch she would quickly weave three handseals in a blur of movement Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger and opened her mouth to expell a black mist that began to rise up to the ceiling of the hallway and formed a black cloud above in the space between the approaching Rymei and herself. The mist would turn into a black cloud that started to drop black raindrops onto the left over water from her previous jutsu.

Taking several steps back and placing her back against a literal wall she would watch as the presipitaion coming down from the black cloud get faster and faster quickly turning the blue water that was on the ground black and this began to flow toward Rymei as that is how the water was flushing as it was following the jutsu >Here goes nothing.< she thought to herself as she once again extended her right hand out pressing her fingers against each other focusing chakra on them but also focused chakra on her left fingertips and on her stomatch as she wanted to keep her options open.* - Sun Oct  4 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would find herself unable to move as the black rain was helicoptered by her blade.* - Sun Oct  4 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: Damn her. - Sun Oct  4 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) took this defeat as motivation instead of letting it get her down >In a couple of days time that eye will be mine.< she told herself thinking that the operation would be a success as she wanted to mentaly prepare herself for success and remove any further defeats from her future. She would execute three handseals Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger as she kneeded and molded her chakra inside of her stomatch to execute the jutsu. When she had kneeded and molded her chakra enough she would open her mouth and released a black mist that was rise up to the sky to form a black cloud.* - Sun Oct  4 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) black droplets began to fall from the cloud as the water cycle kicked in, extending her right arm out she would focus chakra onto her fingertips as the rain continued to fall merging with the water bellow >Never again.< she thought to herself as she snapped her fingers and aimed the fireball that was created toward the water bellow causing the water that was merged with the oil in the waterfall to catch on fire. >Never again.< she thought to herself again in rage as she was not used to losing so she would snap her fingers ones again and sent another fire ball toward the water.

Noticing that the rain had stopped she would execute the same three handseals from before Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger and created another could that would rain down flamable oil down onto the waterfall infront of her. Extending her right arm again she would begin to focus her chakra onto her fingertips as she watched the rain fall >I will never be defeated again, never. This is why I wanted to get stronger. To avoid this humiliation< She would snap her fingers once again causing a fireball to begin forming from her fingertips.* - Sun Oct  4 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) shot the fireball and caused the surface of the water to catch on fire due to the oil but would quickly be extinguished as it fell from the waterfall "Fuck." she would yell out having the noise being practically muted thanks to the sound of the raging water coming from the waterfall. >I was unable to move...why what did she do? She used genjutsu? What type of genjutsu was it? I need to stop looking at them directly fuck. This is why I wanted to train with Fujitora. He owes me now.< She would snap her fingers once again in anger >I will not suffer defeat again. My potential has grown but I have thrown it all away.<

The cloud that was dropping droplets of oil would still be up there a clear indication that she had improved her skill with the jutsu. Under normal circumstances she would have been happy about this but given the recent failure she would not be contect with the progress >Foolish me, I should have stayed true to my plan but no. I had to go and do stupid shit. Now Kohaku might be alive and I do not know if she will make it to Kirigakure. I must disappear for some time..fuck.< she would be less than pleased with this as she was trying to stay unknown to avoid this type of situations. She would now snap her left fingers to creat the fireball as she wanted to continue on with her training.* - Sun Oct  4 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) executed the same three handseals that were characteristic of the technique she was using and would release the mist again >I will master this and anything else that is and any other technique I learn. I will not lose, I will not be defeated. I will get my white eye when Zenaki is ready and I will train harder than I have ever worked before. I will accomplish everything I want to accomplish and I will live my life free of defeat.< While she was thinking this her cloud of oil had formed again and repeated the process that it had been doing. >Harder, harder, harder, push yourself harder.< she thought to herself as she brough both hands up this time and snapped the fingers of each hand.

Two fireballs began to form infront of her fingers as she looked at the oil covered water >I need to work harder, push myself harder, train harder. I will defeat everyone and anyone that gets in my way. No longer will I be afraid of the beast that appeared before me. No longer will I get defeated by genjutsu. No longer shall I be weak.< Her timing using the jutsus had increased by a small amount but it was nowhere near fast enough to where she would have liked it to be >Harder.< she thought to herself as she struggled to get the fireballs to come out faster >Harder!< she told herself as she poured more chakra into the emerging fire that was coming out of her fingertips.* - Sun Oct  4 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) sitting down on the bridge she was standing in she would begin to meditate and gather her the chakra she had lost as she had been training >What could I have done different? I need to stare at the persons feet that way I will not fall for any genjutsu triggers. If I can learn to fight while watching the persons feet I wont fall for any genjutsu. Speaking of genjutsu I need to learn some myself as it seems like and easy way out to a battle. Do I want to take the easy way out? I wouldn't have to work so hard for the power I seek...No...No No No No No...I will not take the easy way out. I will train hard and when I am done with my training I will pick up genjutsu along the way.<

She would remain in the seated position as she gathered her thoughts on the battle she had just partaked in >When I get done with this I will begin training on what Nozumi showed me. I will banish within the mist. That being said I have to stop relying on my mist since I just saw it could easily be countered by swordsmen. What can I do to counter swordsmen? What technique can I create to keep them from countering me so easily? A water blade? No the resistance of it would be shit considering the consistency of it would not be very durable....My tanto? No.. it would never work against a blade...hmmm fuck.< She would open her eyes and stand up as she had gathered all of her lost chakra.* - Sun Oct  4 05:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) was placed under medication and went to sleep.

She would run through one of the many alley ways that existed in Kirigakure chasing after her missing brother, turning around she could see that her sister was trying to catch up with her which possed a moral decision. Either chase after a lost cause or stay with someone who she cared for.

After many things had happened within her dream she would open her eye that was not operated on and would blink several times as her eyes were getting adjusted to the light. She would glance around trying to spot Zenaki "Z-Zenaki." she would say with a slur due to the effects of the drugs slowly wearing out "W-What happened?" she asked as she could only see out of one eye due to the other one being patched up.* - Sun Oct  4 18:43:24 2015
