<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) found herself being surrounded by a circle of rising leafs as she was placed under the genjutsu, of course she had still yet to know this. She would be listening to Fujitora as she would be similinly waiting to be thought the genjutsus that they had practiced several days ago when she noticed the area around her had changed to the way things where back when she was a little girl. It is worth noting that Kirigakure has changed considerably as she was growing up but all of this was pressed to the back of her mind since she payed no real importance to it.

When Fujitora mentioned the trust building she would turn to look at him only to see the last known memory he had of her brother standing behind him which caused her to enter an alarmed state "Domon." she muttered as she saw him turn and walk away. Alarmed she walked past Fujitora and followed after her brother who seemed to be getting farther and farther away with out her being able to catch up. Of course she would be standing next to Fujitora as all of this was happening since all the action was taking place within her mind.* - Thu Sep 17 20:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) heard Fujitoras voice and it was honestly what she needed at the moment since well she would get worried after not having seen her brother in a long time. Even though she had been told it was a genjutsu she could not get rid of the uneasiness and pain she felt after seeing the illusion of her brother. >How could this be a genjutsu?< she asked herself >We are in the village we were born in, he might still be here.< she told herself then shook her head >No, something is off he should be older than what he is now that is not him. This is just like Fujitora said.< with the fact that she was told it was a genjutsu and that she had logic on her side she would execute the Tiger handseal and send a burst of chakra into her brain to release her from the genjutsu.* - Thu Sep 17 20:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Genjutsu loses its effectivness if the person knows that they are in a genjutsu. - Thu Sep 17 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So practicing it would not be as effective on the same person. - Thu Sep 17 21:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: To first channel your chakra towards them and create the illusion hidden within their minds. - Thu Sep 17 21:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: We will see. - Thu Sep 17 21:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) looked at Fujitora and executed two handseal Snake ---> Rat and focused her chakra on her body and tried to send it toward Fujitora. Since this was her first time using genjutsu she did not know if anything was happening to Fujitora or not. She would look at him and examined his posture as he was sitting down >He does not look like he is under the effects of genjutsu...but then again..I do not know if he actually is under any genjutsu or not since this is my first time doing it.< Shook her head and broke the seal then took in a deep breath and slowly exhaled it.

"Again." she said out loud as she executed the handseals again Snake ---> Rat and sent more chakra than she had sent last time toward Fujitora who was sitting down >It has to word this time.< she told herself as she kept a constant flow of chakra aimed at Fujitora. If succesful he would see a circle of leafs rise up from the ground and would have visions of his worst nightmare.* - Thu Sep 17 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) watched him take out a kunai "......." >I probably should not touch him< she thought to herself as she took several steps back incase things went south "It is only a genjutsu." she told him not sure if it would help him or not "Whatever you are seeing is not real."* - Thu Sep 17 22:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would widen her stance as she brought her hands up infront of her body as she looked at Fujitora waiting for him to make his move. She would be focusing her chakra on her head as this was going on.* - Thu Sep 17 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Ready when you are. - Thu Sep 17 22:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) \\If Fujitora was a sensor he would be able to detec the chakra build up on her head.* - Thu Sep 17 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would watch as Fujitora quickly closed the distance between them. Had she not been focusin her chakra she would have been in a touch situation but since she was prepared she reacted quickly by sending her chakra toward each and every single strand of hair that was on her head and quickly manipulated it to take a hold of Fijutoras fist and foot. Since the technique greatly benefited from her hair being long and maleable it was no joke. Taking a hold of Fujitora she would retract her hair making her move toward him and brought her knee up taking advantage of the situation to knee the man in the groin.

Her hair would be contricting his hand and leg making it nearly impossible to move since her mastery over it was impecable and also the added fact that well the man was going to take a knee to the groin "Like I said I grew up in the streets, dirt poor. My fighting style is not noble in any way shape or form since I had to use what was available to me." She would have a smirk painted across her face as she said this.* - Thu Sep 17 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) having the mans hand and feet under the control of her hair she would see as his hand reached out for her chest and was not having any of it, using another portion of her hair she quickly sent it toward the hand and took control over its movement since her hair was that strong while under the influence of her chakra. She did not know about the chakra build up since she had the sensing capabilities of a dead cat which were none. 

With both her hands under her control and one of his legs she would reach out with her right hand to grab and squeeze the living shit out of his groin since she knew where a man felt the worst pain possible without having to cut them "You see, the last time someone tried to grab my chest I was still a teen and it resulted in that person raping me." she would turn her hand to the right squeezing as she went "I fight dirty as this is how I have survived all this time." she told him as her demeanor had changed from her having to remember her past.* - Thu Sep 17 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) snickered as she would most likely feel his groin move around in his hand from being squeezed. As long as she had control over his groin she controlled the man, at least that is how it went in the past. "Hell hath no furry like mine." she would say in a deep voice then began to chuckle a bit as she tossed Fujitora over to the nearest wall with her hair like if it was no big deal. Retracting her hair back to her head she would cease the chakra flow toward it and it would fall limp just like it was before the spar had started.

"A femme fatale is what I am to become." she admitted to him as she widened her stance ones again waiting for him to recovered from the groin grab and being thrown like a rag doll "Growing up on your own can be rough so I had to develop this technique to help me out." she revealed information of her past for some reason, was it to try and gain Fujitoras trust? Who knew.* - Thu Sep 17 23:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was rather amazed by the fire that had been formed right before he impacted the wall but that amazement quickly went away as she instinctively collected her hair and rolled it up into a bun ".....Try to avoid the hair and I'll avoid your balls." she told him as a form of a spoken agreement between them "Also if you could keep my hair a secret that would be nice."

She would widen her stance again as she looked at Fujitora waiting for him to make his move yet again only this time she was not concentrating her chakra anywhere as this was going to be purely taijutsu from her part from this point onward "Ready when you are ones again....and please avoid the har." she requested.* - Thu Sep 17 23:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: OH NOW I SEE WHY SHE REALLY HATES KATANAS! - Thu Sep 17 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Can't have anyone cutting the hair! - Thu Sep 17 23:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was no fool as she had been waiting for his attack to come. Watching close the distance she focused on his feet as he was moving since she knew that Genjutsu could be activated by looking at a person and this way the risk of being caught in one. As he got closer he observed his foot come up to kick her presumably in the stomatch as her hair was no where near it.This would have been fine and all but his shoe suddenly lit up and now there was no doubt about it, she had to dodge it.

Jumping back as quickly as she could she would dodge the succession of flaming kicks that were being thrown her way. As soon as the last kick ended she charged foward aiming to do a sweep across his leg (or legs depending if both of his feet are on the ground or not) with intentions of having him topple over. Of course she knew just how easily this was able to dodge so she would have her knee ready for a counter attack in case he decided to attack her with something.* - Fri Sep 18 00:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: I had no idea that technique could be used like that. - Fri Sep 18 00:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: Interesting. - Fri Sep 18 00:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was mainly focusing her gaze on his feet but could still see his hands as they formed the handseal then heard him speak trying to deceive her but it would not work as she would recognize the handseal since she herself knew the Shunshin no Jutsu but decided she would play along as far as she could to make him drop his guard. Stood there motionless for a bit before she realized that her plan would most likely back fire since she did not know the extent of Fujitoras jutsu repertoire and could very well be casting a genjutsu on her in which case it would be bad news bears for her.

Since she stood there motionless she would now have to deal with him with his elbow which made its way into her stomatch which caused her to arch foward in pain as she stumbled back a bit due to this. Feeling the pain she knew that she would be at a disadvantage for a moment since she had to deal with it so she tried to put the pain in the back of her mind as she brought her hands up to form the Clone handseal and quickly split her chakra in half and made a shadow clone of herself who would appear next to her in a puff of white smoke.* - Fri Sep 18 00:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) watched as he got closer to her >Damn why did this have to be a taijutsu fight.< he asked her self as she prepared evasive action >Focus.< she told herself as she aimed to side step the punch letting him pass through where she was previously standing in. All the while she had been looking at his feet which made it hard for her to really know what was going on as a great deal of focus was on his feet and the floor so she was kinda screwed by taking this action. Hearing his words made her feel somewhat at ease dispite the situation "I will not fall for that!" she said in return as she waited for him to move far along enough and threw a quick punch at his ribs.

It was more than obvious that she was still a rookie when it came to using her clones as she had learned the technique but had not used it enough to even be a novice at it so the clone would be looking like something Naruto would come make but relatively sturdier but not sturdy enough to handle the punch. As soon as Fujitoras fist made contact with the clone it just went up in a puff of white smoke which would greatly disappoint Kirie since well she was used to being good at everything she did except for this since she had not used the jutsu enough.* - Fri Sep 18 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) fougth a brave battle but in the end he had figured out that her staring at his feet was not without its drawbacks. He she felt him grab her arm she tried to react but by doing this she had to raise her eyesight since his feet were not moving and her peripheral view would not really help her due to the proximity of the two >Fuck.< was the only thought that passed through her head as he had grabed her .

Looking at his eyes she would answer his question as she had been placed in a genjutsu "Lucky break, I only reacted from what I was able to see." she told him as she stood there relatively motionless "I looked at your feet and legs and went off from that. I could have been hit by your moves if I had made an unlucky guess." she admitted to him due to the effects of the genjutsu she had been placed in.* - Fri Sep 18 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was released from the genjutsu and looked at him >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she brought her arm across her chest to grab onto her other arm >I was placed under a genjutsus again.< She looked up at him and nodded "I wish to become many things." she admitted to him as she dropped to the floor to sit down to begin meditating " I am trying my hardest to better myself to stay alive by adapting to my enviorment..you know.. Femme Fatale and all."* - Fri Sep 18 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would reach for the nearest food item and would much down on it "A Femme Fatale is a deadly kunoichi." she told him as she was done chewing and swallowing the bite of food she had taken "And don't worry I've past the point of starvation when I was a kid, I know how to take when the taking is good." she told him refering to the food, however she did stay away from the sake since she had never really taken a liking to it.
* - Fri Sep 18 01:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would get her canteen from her back and would drink water from it "Well, I have progressed with things to a certain degree but I have yet to achieve what I want." she would take another sip from her canteen before she placed the cap on it and set it on the ground beside her "Out of a one hundred percent I would say I have progressed at ten percent so I still need to work hard to achieve my goal."

She would be flattered by his comment but she would not show it as she remained with her usual facial expression "You know you are the second guy that tells me that today." she commented as she took a bite out of her dumpling >Something is weird...two guys in one day..<* - Fri Sep 18 01:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) stopped chewing as the word voyage was mentioned, swallowing her food she would look at him and comtemplated telling him what she had planned for her future but decided against it at least for now. "I have learned enough by leec- I mean by being thought jutsus here in the village, usually under normal circumstances I would have never reached out for help but the situation I was in demanded I adapted and that required me to seek for help." she would stop a moment to think " What I want to accomplish is more in terms or skill other than jutsus, I wish to better my body so that I could be ready incase well anything happened. Take the seige for example, I am more than hopeless against a situation like that." she hoped that the example was great enough as that was the only thing she could think of.

Taking another bite of her food she could not helped but to be flattered by Fujitoras words but she would still remain with her usual facial expression as she knew that a show of emotion could tip the scales of any conversation. "So you were born in Amegakure but moved to Sunagakure? That is interesting..I have never been out of this village so I guess any 'voyague' I take will be insightful I guess."* - Fri Sep 18 01:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) looked down at his hand then looked up at his black hues >......I knew that something was wrong today.< she told to herself as she began to think on the best course of action to take since she did not want to offend the guy but at the same time she was not all that comfortable being touched >Think....Think....think...All my jutsus require handseal..well except for my hair but then I would need to release it from the bun...ugghhhhnnnn.< it was clear that she did not know how to react to this movement of his so she would just remain quiet as she shifted her gaze toward the horizon.* - Fri Sep 18 02:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) eyes would widen as she entered full on panic mode. Whe she saw him move in closer and closer she would begin to freak out internally >Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit.< was all she could think to herself as she quickly scanned the area to see if there was anything that could be used to help her out of the situation but she had no luck finding it so she did the next best thing. She would slightly cock her head back and headbut Fujitora as he was closing in for the kiss and hoped to play it off as if she had been extremely tired.

Bringing her hands up her her forehead she would press on it "Ouch!" she would say as she beagn to rub her forehead "I-I'm sorry." she said rather flustered "I must have snoozed for an instant or something...he..ehehe...he." she would try to paint a smile on her face to accompany her words but she was not all that great at making facial expression so it would be tough for her >First and last time I am letting my hair down from a pony tail.< she told herself as she attributed to everything happening at the moment to that event in the start of the day.* - Fri Sep 18 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) shook her head as she placed her canteen near her backpouch and stood up "Thank you but I have somewhere to stay." she told him as she clearly did not think she could take much more of this close proximity thing very long without 'accidentaly' breaking one of his fingers or something. Also it is worth nothing that most of the abuse was well a spar and that she had a certain fighting style that was the bane of any male combatant she would fight.

Looking at Fujitora she would pat herself down to remove any dirt that might have been on her coat "Thank you for the food and the training session, I look foward to tomorrow." >Just do not try anything else or I swear I will pop one off.< she warned him inside her head which really would not to him any good since he was not aware of what she was thinking unless he could read her mind. With that she began to walk toward the gate that belonged to the Hozuki/Hogos with intentions of going into the village.* - Fri Sep 18 02:35:31 2015

The mist would mix in with the natural mist that was naturally produced in Kirigakure, waiting for the mist that she produced to spread through a larger area she would prepare the Clone handseal and molded her chakra getting it ready to be divided in an equal half to produce a shadow clone of herself.* - Sat Sep 19 00:29:39 2015

I do not like playing hide and seek." she told Nozumi with a raised voice as she did not know where he was exactly since she couldnt see, hear, smell or sense him at all. Bringing her hands up to form the Clone handseal and divided her chakra into another equal part and made a clone of herself which appeared beside her. The clone would look rather sick as well she was no master at the jutsu.* - Sat Sep 19 00:50:08 2015

Of course she did not intend to strike him since he had revealed himself to her and the clone was more of a deterant more than anything since she still lacked mastery with the jutsu. Releasing the clone and gaining back her chakra she would look at the male rather amazed "I know the mist is thick...but I could not see you until..you were close enough...how did you do it?" she would ask with more than curiosity in her voice as she herself was trying to achieve what he had done for the past few day.* - Sat Sep 19 00:57:48 2015
