<br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Had left the Kunai and shuriken where she had left them the day before as well as the same target set up and grabed a kunai and threw it not caring if she hit it or not. Repeating the same process three more times she would let out a scream of frustration as she could not seem to hit the target where she wanted them to >Why?< she asked herself >Why can't I do it like him? Why did he make it seem so easy and more importantly how?< She just couldn't see how to better her technique.

Taking a deep breath she decided to take a seat in the cold and musky cave. She palced her palms on the ground and looked up at the ceiling trying to remember memories of the time she went hunting with her father. She remembered how her father stalked the deer with out making any noise moving from tree to tree untill it was the right time to strike, this is what she hoped she would be able to do by now but clearly she was missing something as well her plans where not really moving along the way she would like them to.

Bringing herself back to reality snapping out of the day dream she was having about her father's hunting techniques she brought her gaze foward to the entrance fo the cave where she had set her targets >He always did things on a whim, never really stoping to focus.< she told herself >How could he not have taken his time to focus his aim? Well he must have as he always hit his mark.< she continued on with having a conversation with herself when it suddenly dawned on her. She recalled her father telling her to 'feel' it, that he only went after the deer when it 'felt' right.

>What could he have ment?< she asked herself as she stood up and walked toward the pile of Kunai and shuriken >How can something 'feel' right?< she continued on asking as she bent over to grab a kunai holding it in her hand. Once again she began to examine the weapon >Now that I think about it he did have a very peculiar way of holding it.< she said to herself as she tried to imitate the way her father used to hold the Kunai in his hand. >So if I grab it like this it should-.< she then stopped as she realized that she had been holding the Kunai wrong all along as she had been holding it like a throwing knife instead of by the handle.

Realizing her mistake she bumped her head twice with her own fist >Stupid,Stupid,Stupid,Stupid.< she said to herself as she realized that the Kunai felt much better this way and it reduced the chances of her getting cuz in the process of throwing it.Tossing the kunai in her hand a couple of times in her hand she grabed it and passed her finger through the loop in the handle and spun it around >Well lets see if this works.< she said to herself as she walked back and forth looking at the Honey bun and threw it when she 'felt' it was the right moment just as her father mentioned before. The kunai cut through the air and impacted the Honey bun near the center which brought a smile to her face* - Sat Nov  7 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) Walking through the forest she was crossing through she decided to get some target practice in as she had nothing better to do with her time. She would reach for some bottles of milk that she had in her backpouch and placed them around the area as targets for her to hit with her ninja weaponry >Hmm this should be good enough.< she told herself as she had placed several bottles here and there, each one in an even more difficult place to hit than the previous one >Well I hope I can hit them.< she thought to herself once again as she looked at the bottles she had set up in that particular section of the forest she found herself in.

She pulled out a kunai and tossed it up catching it with her hand as it came down, she repeated this process several times as she focused on a bottle of milk that was on the base of the trunk of a tree. She closed her eyes as she paced back and forth waiting for the right moment to present itself to her and when it finally did when it finally felt right she threw the kunai aiming at the center of the bottle. Watching the kunai sore through the air she could tell it was blown of course by a sudden gust of wind, cursing her luck she took out another kunai and threw it aiming for the same spot as before.

Watching the kunai sore through the air like the previous kunai with the difference being that this kunai did not get blown of course by the wind a hit its target. Growing more and more confident she began to more complicated shots. She grabed two kunai now holding one in each hand and spun them both at the same time being careful to not let them go as she did not want to stab herself with them. Once she felt confident enough she threw the first kunai up in the air and waited several seconds then threw the second one trying to get a them on a collision course with each other.

The kunais flew and missed themselves completely because to be honest she was getting ahead of yourself. Letting out a small sigh she sat down and counted her kunais >Hmmm.< she said as she was counting them >I still have a few kunai.< she said to herself as she placed them beside her and checked to see how many shurikens she had left. Counting them one by one she realized that she had way too many shurikens >Why did I get so many?< she aked herself as she continued counting them one by one setting them into nice little stacks then when she was done she placed everything back into her backpouch and stood up.

Focusing on her targets set up infront of her she decided to try her luck with shurikens now instead of kunais. She grabed five shurikens with each hand and prepared to throw them. She looked at her targets and and threw the first five shurikens then waited a few seconds as the shurikens flew through the air to their intended target destination and threw the other five. The first volley made its way and three out of the five hit their mark, while the second volley only got two hits out of the five. >Hmm.< she said to herself all not that sure if she wanted to continue trying or calling it a day. She decided to call it a day as she decided to train with something else.* - Sat Nov  7 05:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: All genjutsu does is disrupt your opponents chakra so by causing pain it somehow brings you back to 'normal' - Sun Nov  8 18:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: From what I understand genjutsus need triggers. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: This is going to be difficult.. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: That's a good thing, I'd assume. - Tue Nov 10 05:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: What do you think that developing your hearing would be good for? - Tue Nov 10 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: People that are good at sneaking up behind you. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Or if people are good at concealing weapons, if your hears are tuned enough, you could hear them draw the weapon. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Correct. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And also what will you do if you cant see? - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Use hearing... - Tue Nov 10 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) brought her hands up, one infront of her chest and the other one directly above her head to execute the Concealment handseal. Kneeding and molding her chakra inside of her stomach she would release it through her mouth turning it into a pearly white mist that quickly covered the area cutting down the amount of things one would be able to see due to mist. Taking enough steps forward she would soon banish from Yuudais sight, if Yuudai would to notice, she did not make a single sound as she moved forward so there was no way he could have detected her by hearing "You see, Shounen." she began "Hearing can help you detect people like me, assassins that use stealth to their advantage. If you can hear them comming you can react or prepare for what is to come." 

Of course that by talking she would have given away her location so she silently moved to another location always knowing where Yuudai was since she had her sensing abilities focused on him and she could hear him if he decided to make a single movement >Let us see how you react to this.< she thought to herself as she stood still in the mist waiting for Yuudai to make a move >Will you surprice me? Or will you not know what to do? The spot light is on you, Shounen.< It was clear that she was testing the young male on what to do in this situation since there were some people out there in the world that used the technique she had used for assassination purposes or as a means to escape considering that the mist cut down the visibility down to almost zero.* - Tue Nov 10 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) heard the holster opening and the kunai being grabed and spun around >I see.< she thought to herself as she remained where she was "Careful, Shounen. Training has already begun, remember that I told you that this forest contains deadly creatures. Wonder off in the wrong direction and you might get killed by them. Analyze the situation. You can see, hear,sense or even smell me, what do you do in this situation? Think." Moving again from her location since she had spoken she found herself a new spot to be in as she quickly sensed around her to see if she sense or hear anything around her to make sure that Yuudai wouldn't end up being an animals lunch. Once she made sure that the area was clear she would go back to focusing on him.

>You have your kunai out now but you still do not know where I am. How do you begin to search Shounen? What do you do? Visibility is zero, your hearing is useless and your sense of smell is questionable. Taking all of that into consideration what do you do?< It was clear that she was putting him through some sort of test that had nothing to do with genjutsu for that matter but it was still a test none the less that would help him out down the line. At least that is what she figured it would do. >You have yet to surprise me, Shounen.< she thought to herself as she continue to be a spectator in this for the moment.* - Tue Nov 10 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Konami(AxelFraire) heard the rustling of the paper and sighed >Baaakaaa.< she thought to herself as she brought her hands up to execute several handseals as she molded and kneeded her chakra inside of her stomach >Triggering an explosion would only draw attention to this area, you are clearly not thinking straight, Shounen.< After thinking that she would then run forward and released a stream of water from her mouth that would soak the explosive tag rendering it useless since it could not catch on fire anymore to be detonated "You are not using your head, Shounen. If you blow that explosive trap what would happen? Not only would we get Konoha troops to begin doing a search of this area causing us to have to flee the scene." Soon enough the mist would slowly being to banish from the area returning visibility to its normal levels.* - Tue Nov 10 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Do not drop your head, Shounen. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I told you thiw was a learning experience. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yeah.. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You know know what not to do. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So keep your head up. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You did, decent. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And followed through with it. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: But, what if this was a life or death situation though, I would've already died.. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Which is why we are doing this, Shounen. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: To prepare you for what is to come. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Get some rest. - Tue Nov 10 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I will keep watch. - Tue Nov 10 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very well. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Safe travels, Shouenen. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
