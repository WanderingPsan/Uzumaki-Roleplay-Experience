Burrying the shovel onto the floor again she would continue this process for several more moments.

>How many more bodies will I have to burry? I burried Koeki, that one ginger and Genesis and now I am burrying people I never knew. Women, children and men. Some of them were soldiers most of them were civilians.< Sighing she shook her head as she continued to dig the hole and was digging through it quite nicely as she was now used to digging holes for dead bodies considering what she had been doing for the past couple of days. Several moments later she had almost finished digging the hole to the proper depth for a body to be burried.

finishing the hole to burry the body in she would get out of the grave and patted herself off then rolled the body over to the grave letting it fall the until it hit the ground >Not the best way to place a body down but I mean I do have other things to do so yeah. On the other hand...I am someone who like to work hard for things but then again I am not going to spend my whole day placing bodies gently onto the ground.< She would then begin burrying the bodies with the dirt she had dug up and when she was done she would move a couple of feet over so that she could start digging another whole for another body.* - Sat Oct 10 21:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) sensed as his chakra flared up to release the Ninja Art: Watergun technique that she was used to using when she first started as a shinobi. Moving to the side to dodge the stream of water she would aim to get closer to Elon as she knew that ain a battle of ninjutsu no one would have won thanks to them having the same techniques since they both leeched off Tethys at one point in their life. Moving to the right she would stay low to the water in case Elon wanted to move the stream of water to the side to get her she would be ready to react to it.

Once get got up close she would throw a right punch aimed at his jaw to stop the flow of water that was coming from it >I cant use that here because of the water. So I shot myself in the foot and gave myself an advantage at the same time. What a hastle.< Regardless of the punch connecting or not she would follow it up with a sweep to his legs to make him fall to the water where she could then proceed to use one of her many Suiton techniques against Elon. Of course he would be able to sense this so he would have time to react to anything she did.* - Sun Oct 11 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) watched as he swam to the bottom of the lake and sighed >I guess he wasn't kidding when he said that fighting was not his thing.< She would bring up her hands up to her chest and performed the Tiger handseal then sent a quick burst of chakra to her left right eye activating her doujutsu. If it werent for the Mizukage hat and the headband that covered her eye Elon would have been able to see the lateral veins on her right eye bulge up as the chakra was being sent to it. Of course he would have needed to be infront of her in order to have been able to see that, however his sensing abilities would have been able to pick up what was going on.

With her doujutsu active now her sensing rage grew tenfold allowing her to see Elon underground thanks to his chakra network. Remaining still where she stood she would be able to see his chakra and would be ready to react to anything he might have thrown her way as she was now able to see where the chakra was flowing to and how much chakra was being build up as well as how much chakra he had over all >Well now that I have used this better make the most of it.< she thought to herself as she brought her hands down and looked down at where Elon was currently located.* - Sun Oct 11 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm... - Sun Oct 11 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) was standing there yes but she could have been able to pinpoint his exact location as he moved through ground to his finaly destination. Not being one to wait she would have moved along with him as he traveled through the ground and before he emerge she would stop to give him time to prepare his defense. Seeing the handseals being made she closed her left eye and relied solely on her left eye that was covered >What will you do.< she asked herself as she prepared a series of handseals that he would be able to recognize as they both used the same technique.

Kneeding and molding her chakra within her stomatch she would open her mouth and spat it out at Elon. Given the nature of the technique it would be like her splashing a glass of water onto him but it would still be a force to be reconned with since she knew a thing or two about the Suiton element. Holding the stream aimed toward Elon she would be ready to pivot to either the left or right in case he wanted to avoid it and would be expecting him to dive underground once again since that was a good technique to use.* - Sun Oct 11 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I would not have taken this position if I was not confident in my abilities Fujitora. - Sun Oct 11 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) picked up the flaring of chakra coursing through his chakra network which gave her time to react to whatever he was doing but when the the doton began going her way she would get worried since the Doton technique would have been enhanced by the water so she would quickly jump back as the wave was coming her way. Bringing her hands up to form the Snake handseal as she kneeded and molded her chakra then opened her mouth and spat out a torrent of water that would quickly wipe away the doton technique that was making her way toward her.

Once the Doton technique would have been suppressed she would let the wave travel a bit toward him then would allow it to die down to save him from being swept away. "It is about the business we talked about when we went to Kumo." she would tell Fujitora as she charged behind her wave making her way toward Elon getting near him jumping up to deliver a quick kick to the face which Fujitora would recognize as the technique was thought to her by him.* - Sun Oct 11 06:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) reached up to grab her hat with one hand then undid her pony tail with the other letting her hair drop to its full length. Sending chakra up to her head she would channel it to every single one of her hairstrands and had it shoot out to grab Elon. She would wrap her hair around his wrists, ankles, waist and neck so that she could have an easier time carrying him around. Using her hair to actually pick him up she would turn and walked toward Fujitora, if he would to notice she had her only exposed eye closed but it did not really matter as she could see just perfectly fine.

"So, about that thing." she simply told him as she stood there carrying Elon with her hair like if it was nothing "I'll drop this guy off at the ruble then we can get down to business."* - Sun Oct 11 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) walked toward the waterfall and leaned against the side of the wall then slid down untill she was completely seating down. She would take off her hat and undid he hair from its ponytail and sent chakra to it getting it maleable and ready to carry the large blade given to her yesterday by Fujitora. >Tch. I was hoping I would have gotten the needle like one...it looks like its one hundred times lighter than this hulking blade..Also what the actual fuck..he just said it stores chakra but what did he mean by that? I do like a challenge but a small one or at least one where I have an advantage.< She would take a deep breath and sigh as she brought her hand up to her coat and unsealed the blade.

Sending her hair out to grab said blade she would use her hands to grab it as well and brought it down to the ground to probide further support >Shit.< she thought to herself as the weight of the blade was really a bit too much for her to handle >How the fuck am I supposed to wield this? That perv just dumped this on me and did not really give me an explination. What did he mean by "I know for a fact you would be good with"? Fuck.< Using her hair and her strenght she would push the blade back a bit to examine it only to notice it was wrapped up by a bandage and had two hilts.

>Odd.< she thought to herself as she went and grabed one of the hilts >Doesn't feel any different from any other blade....Why does it have two hilts? Is it because of its size? Ugh, I will really have to find out for my own since Fujitora was nice enough to not tell me anything. That perv.< Once again she would take in a deep breath of air and released it as a long and loud sigh >Well if I want to uncover its secrets I'll have to learn how to wield it, so might as well get started with it.< Using her hair and her strenght she would use it as an anchor point to stand up since the blades tip would have most likely pierced the ground  allowing her to stand up because of it.

>What did he say its name was? Hira....Hira what? Hiramekarei? I think that sounds about right. Well Hiramekarei hopefully you and I will be together for a long time to come.< She would walk away from the wall dragging the blade a bit and and used her hair and her strength to lift it up a bit off the ground then placed it back >Fuck you are heavy Hiramekarei, Fujitora said you were built out of an ancient material but I do not know what that means...I do not know about materials over all so yeah I am going to have to take his word for it.< She would give it another go using her hair to its fullest potential to lift up the blade. Adding her full strength into the equation and she managed to hold it up to the height of her chest but did not manage to keep it there for long as the blade was heavy and she did not want the sharp edge to cut her hair so she was more or less forced to let it drop.

>One more try.< she told herself as she readied her self to lift up the blade one more time. Using her strength and hair she would lift the blade up one more time trying to hold it for as long as possible >One.. two...three...four....five...six...seven...eight....nine.....ten....eleven....twelve.< she would begin counting to see how long she would be able to hold the blade up since well she was strong but not strong enough to be able to carry the blade without a problem. >Twenty...twenty one...twenty two..< then she let the blade drop a bit to have it rest on the ground >Twenty two seconds only...fuck.< Suddenly she realized that this was going to be much more of a challenge than she had originally thought it was going to be. Bringing the blade closer to her body she would seal the blade back into her cloak and went back to the destroyed courtyard of the village.* - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) watched as Lera performed the clone handseal which she was all too familiar with and watched as five clones were fromed infront of her >Interesitng.< she thought to herself as she brought her hands up to perform the Tiger handseal and sent a quick burst of chakra to her right eye that was covered by the headband she wore >With this I wont have trouble picking out which one is the real one, which is going to make this that much more easier.< Thinking to herself she would stand there waiting for Lera to make her move as she could now see the chakra pathways of all the clones and herself allowing her to determine which one was the real one by the amount of chakra running through her body.

Reading her stance she would close her left exposed crimson eye as she could see anything around her in a 360 degree radious >Lets see what she could do. I know she can use Doton techniques as well as Katon...wait can she use Katon? Well doesn't matter either way we are in the water where I have the homefield advantage over her so I have to make the most of it.< With a smirk on her face she would tell Lera "Is that all you are going to do? Make five clones?" she hoped that saying this would make a move since she could see what she was going to do as she could see the chakra flowing through each body infront of her.* - Sun Oct 11 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) sadly enough for Lera she was not staring at her directly as she had her left exposed eye closed and her Byakugan was being covered by the headband she wore so she did pick up the handseals and the chakra being channeled through her body that was being sent toward her. Just as a precuationary measure she would bring her hands up to perform the Tiger handseal to execute the Kai technique to prevent her from falling into the genjutsu technique she had just used.

After that she would quickly cut the chakra that was holding her above the water allowing her to sink to the water to avoid the incoming Fuuton techniques that were passing overhead. Swimming quickly toward the Lera that had used genjutsu she would assume that was the real one as she was the one that spoke and the one that attempted to use a different technique so it was more than an educated guess. Breaking the waters surface she would quickly attempt to sweep at her legs in hopes of making her fall into the water.* - Sun Oct 11 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) detected the handseals that the clones were doing and cursed under her breath as she recognized the handseals since Ortho used that exact same technique against her when they had sparred. Quickly reaching to untie her pony tail she would send chakra to her each individual hair strand and controlled it to shoot it up toward Lera who had dodged her quick by floating up in the air aiming to grab onto her ankles and pull herself up thanks to the control and the technique itself. Once she was off the water and grabing onto her ankles she would use more of her hair to grab onto her hands to prevent her from doing hanseals.

Since the clones were in the water they would have been affected by the other clones techniques since they were in the water when the tecniques were going off simultaneously resulting in some zapping going on among the clones.* - Sun Oct 11 20:18:33 2015
