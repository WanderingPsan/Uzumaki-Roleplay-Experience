<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) arrived at the waterfall and moved to the side where she had been leaning last time she had decided to carry Hiramekarei and unsealed said blade. Using her hair and her arms to hold onto the balde she would look at it once again examining it closely again >I seriously wish that Fujitora would have giving me a smaller blade that would go along with my capabilities but well I cant do about it now that I have the blade.< She would then grab a hold of the two handles with her hands and used her hair to lift up the blade and began counting to see how long she could hold it up.

>One.....Two......Three....Four.....Five......Six.....Seven......Eight......Nine......Ten......Eleven.....Twelve.< she would keep count struggling to hold the blade up >Fifteen...Sixteen...Seventeen....eighteen....nineteen....< By this point in time it was more than obvious that she would need to drop the blade since she did not have the strenght to carry the blade by herself and she did not want to risk the blade tearing her hair off since her hair was only controlled by the chakra and not enhanced. >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she retracted her hair form the blade letting it hit the floor >I need to gain more strenght...fuck...that means good ol physical labor...and here I was making Index do push ups and crunches when it was I that needed to do them.<

breathing in deeply she would exhale slowly, suddenly she had an idea that she had not though of before >Why dont I just use that.< she told herself as she attempted to lower the blade but would just end up dropping it because of her lack of strength. Bringing her hands up to form the Clone handseal she split her chakra in half and made a clone of herself that apeared next to her, she would turn to look at her clone and told her "Here is the game plan, we will carry this blade together and sometime down the line I will be able to do it without your help." The clone nodded and looked at the blade which was on the ground "I mean, we both know that the blade is heavy as fuck. Why didn't Fujitora give us a smaller more lighter blade?" 

Sighing and looking at her clone was all she could do as she had asked herself that question many times before but could not find a proper answer to her question. Lifting the blade up with the assistance of her hair and her clone she would count how many seconds she could hold the balde up as it had proven to be too heavy for her. >One...two....three....four..< she counted as she had her clones help with the process making it a bit easier for her to hold the blade up since the weight was being distributed among several places since she was also using the strength of her hair to lift it up. >Ten.....eleven....twelve....thirteen...fourteen.< she continued as she seemed to be better off by doing things this way than in her previous attempts.

>Twenty one....twenty two.....twenty three....twenty four....twenty five......twenty six.....twenty seven.....twenty eight.....twenty nine..< she kept count as she was pleased that she had passed her previous record but knew that she was only able to do so because of the fact that she had her clone assisting her with the job. Once she reached the thrity second count she would lower the blade with her clones help she would seal the blade back into her coat and dispelled the clone >Well that went well.< she thought to herself as she cut the chakra flow to her hair and tied it back up into a ponytail and placed her hat on >Better get started on training with the other blade now.<* - Tue Oct 20 18:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) watched as he executed the barage of handseals keeping track of every one of them taking mental notes of each and every one of them then senses his chakra flare up and then saw as the stream of water raced toward her at great speeds. She would remain standing there with her suimen technique as she watched the technique come toward her >How do I want to play this out?< she asked herself as the wave got closer and closer "Fuck it." she muttered as she brought her hand up to hold her hat in place as the technique hit her head on.

Under normal circumstances the technique would pack quite the punch but as Ikaro can see she had only been pushed back due to the force of the technique. Spitting out some water she would bring her hands up to form the Concealment handseal as she kneeded and molded her chakra inside of her stomatch then released it as a pearly white mist that began to cover the area as it mixed in with the natural mist that was within the village. Soon visibility would be limited as the mist would cover the palce up. Once in cover of the mist she would move foward making no noise as she moved aiming to get behind Ikaro.* - Tue Oct 20 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) brought her hands up to perfom the Tiger handseal and send a quick burst of chakra to her right eye activating her doujutus. Closing her right eye as she did this she would now focus on her new vision which was all around 360 vision that allowed her to pick up the chakra signatures of people around her as she had heard Ikaro do what his clan did best which was to turn into water. Reaching up for her tanto she would unsheeth it making as much noise as possible then reached for her holster and pulled out a kunai knife with her left hand.

Moving backwards she would throw the kunai to where she was previously standing in hopes of him falling for the bait. Of course the movement would have been silent as she did not want him to know exactly here she was since well it was a trap after all.* - Tue Oct 20 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) heard the handseals and saw as his chakra network flared up >Tch.< she thought to herself as she ran foward holding her tanto on her right hand. As the waved approached she would deactivate her Suimen technique to pass harmlessly under it and would emerge on the other side of it making noise as she got out of the water. Once on her feet she charged foward toward Ikaros location getting behind him and pressed her tantos dull end against his neck "Move and you will recieve a discharge of raiton chakra. I know you are part of Tethy's clan so I know what you can do and I also know that raiton is your natural enemy." She would bring up her hand to perform a handseal as she held the tanto to his neck.

The strike would have been silent due to her technique but he would most certainly feel the cold steel against his skin "I can see you chakra network so I know when you will turn into water." she told him as a means to stop him from turning into a puddle of water since she wanted to end the spar here and now "Up to you really. Take a discharge of raiton or stay where you are."* - Tue Oct 20 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) NO ONE IS GETTING KILLED....just to clarify.* - Tue Oct 20 20:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: White eyes. - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) cringed as he had called out her bluff since she did not have any Raiton in her >Shit.<she thought to herself as she saw the chakra in his arm build up and saw it grow in size as well >Fuck.< she thought once again as it reached for the blade >What do I do?< she asked herself as she saw the blade come her way. Ducking down to barely avoid the massive arm and blade her hat would be taken off since well they were just about the same in terms of attack speed and reflex which made her cringe once again. >He was holding out on me.< she thought to herself as she brought her hands up to her forehead with opened palms as chakra focused on them.

Two fireballs would form on each palm which she used to send a flash toward Ikaro who was at point blank range so there was no escaping the technique. Once again since Ikaro was directly infront of her the mist would not affect her technique that much considering the mistance and the mastery she had over the jutsu. If the technique had successfuly gone off without a hitch she would bring her right leg up to deliver a kick to Ikaros face which was more of a feint as she twisted her body to deliver a kick to his abdomen. If the technique would not have worked then the battle would rage on.* - Tue Oct 20 20:52:16 2015

I would like to talk to you about your clan as well seeing as how you are one of two remaining members of it, the other being Mizumi." She would bring her hand up to put her tanto away "He has gone insane and even has attacked this village. It has nothing to do with anything but I thought you should be aware of it. Also there is the matter of helping the people of this village out, I am not asking you to share all your techniques but I am asking you to share some of them."* - Tue Oct 20 21:11:02 2015
