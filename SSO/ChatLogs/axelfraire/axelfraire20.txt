<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) speed foward as she performed seven handseals Snake ---> Ram ---> Horse ---> Hare ---> Ram ---> Horse ---> Hare ---> Hands spread in front palms out ---> Ox ---> Clap Hands as she molded and kneeded her chakr inside of her stomatch. Once she was close enough to Yoshiko she would spew out a great amount of water that would encase Yoshiko in a prison made out of water that made it hard to move and impossible to break out due to the waters consistency. "I dont benefit? Who the fuck do you think you are to tell me I do not benefit from a single shinobi learning a summon? Please tell me!" it was pretty obvious that she was beyond pist at this point considering the position she was in and the things that had happened several days ago "I do not know what your answer to the options was but I went ahead and decided you chose option number one."

In accordance with the technique she would have needed to be in direct contact with the water so she would extend her right arm out to maintain her in the watery prison. Soon enough Yoshiko would find out that she would be quickly running out of air.* - Mon Oct 12 23:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) continued to hold the water prison in place as she looked over at Nozumi "A refugee? You had better odds of going to Sunagakure or Kumogakure. As you can see the village is a deadman wonderland, our village has been reduced to rubble by a tailed beast going rampant when the previous Mizukage died. How ever you are welcomed to stay here as long as you pull your own weight around here." She would look down at the water prison she had in place and saw that Yoshiko had been knocked out by the lack of oxygen "You see Yoshiko, I do not end up losing at all. I can handle Mizumi and Hideki as I know them both since one used to live in this village and the other is a red eyes. Now whatever information you may have about Mizumi I have as well considering he came a couple of days ago and attacked a friend of mine. So I ask you this now, How do I end up losing? Oh wait you can't answer can you? Oh my bad I forgot for a second there that I decided when it was time for you to leave prison."

Focusing her gaze on Nozumi once again she took in a deep breath of air and exhaled it slowly "I apologize for adressing you in a harsh tone Nozumi, this person here has pushed me over the edge but like I said you are welcomed here to this deadman wonderland as long as you pull your weight. It may not look like it but we are slowly recovering."* - Mon Oct 12 23:54:52 2015
