She would look over to the right as she sensed Zenaki  and stared at her for a while "Hmmm." she hummed as she was channeling chakra into the blade "What brings you to my humble village." she asked her as she held the blade with both hands. If Zenaki was a sensor she would have been able to tell that the blade had a relative big amount of chakra stored up inside of it and that chakra was running through her hands onto the blade handles and into the blade itself.

Unsealing the blade from her back again she would bring it foward holding one of the handles >I lied to Fujitora in order to get another blade...What is going on with me? I pride myself in not lying to him but aside from the other lie I told him this one makes me feel the worst.< Holding the blade up with one hand she would reach for the other handle and continued channeling chakra into the blade >No matter. This world is rotten anyway, and I have helped make it that way. I am no better than Edge. I am no better than everyone else before me that had their way into making the world the way it is.< It was clear that she was becoming more used to the fact that she had slaughtered an entire army along with several villagers >Fuck it all to hell.< she continued on with her train of thought as she slowly continued on channeling chakra into the blade.

Stopping the chakra flow to the blade she would crouch down and rested the blade on her shoulders as she entered a meditative state to regain her lost chakra >I am not the same I was before, I curse the moment I became Mizukage. Why did I have to do it? Everything was going fine. Everything was going fine according to my plan, a plan that I had set up for myself to stop me from entering situations like this.< she would exhale loudly and then took a big breath of air >My actions are my own and only I can stand behind them because only I know the reason behind them.< Bringing one of her hands to grab one of the blade handles she would slowly beging to rise to her feet and when she did she would extend the blade out with one hand and prepared to begin the train she usually did.

Cocking her arm back she would step foward and thrust the blade foward followed by a vertical slash over her head which would be followed by another thrust. Turning the blade she would do a circular swing that caused her body to pivot. Panting a bit she would begin running foward holding the blade with one hand slightly behind her so that when she would about to make the swing she would bring up her other hand to grab onto the second handle and put more force into the swing causing the water bellow the blade to be sent in the same direction the swing was going >I do not know what the future holds for me and my actions, but what I do know is that I will stand behind them as I am doing them to protect this village.< Lowering the blade she would begin walking to her point of start and brought the blade up to examine it as she needed to remove any evidence of her involvement with Kumogakure.

Kneeling down with the blade she would begin to examine every inch of it starting at the tip. The bandages around the blade were that of a crimson hue instead of the white color they originally were >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she thought of a way to get the color back to normal >No matter how many time I wash it, it will take a very long time to get the blood out.< Shaking her head she would begin dipping the blade into the water and began scrubbing the bandages as best she could so that the blood would leave the fabric >If anyone had an acute sense of smell I would be fucked as well since I cant really wash off the scent of blood unless I put the blade through hell so that the smell can disappear. Looking around the place as she washed her blade she would make sure that no one saw the action since it would raise suspicion at least in her mind.* - Mon Oct 26 22:03:05 2015

Edge showed up and threatened to destroy the village if I did not help him...I am scared Baen..I was scared when he showed up..I was scared when I helped slaughter those people... I am scared now."

We will have to merge with the bank. I do not want that for Kirigakure. I want it to be a sovereing village like it always has been." She would grip on of the hilts of the blade tightly and shook her head once again "I didn't kill any bandits with your blade. I thrusted it through a kids chest Baen.. I murdered him."* - Tue Oct 27 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Arrived at the waterfall and unsealed the blade from her back and examined it once again. The washing she had given it a couple of days ago only seemed to have helped to a certain extent as there was still a hue of crimson imbbeded into the fabric of the bandages. Shaking her head she would extend the blade out with one hand and grasped the blade firmly >I am amazed at how much I have progressed with this thing. Months ago I was not able to pick the thing up and look me now. Wielding it to such degree of mastery, soon enough I will be able to master this blade and continue on with the rest.< She would bring up her other hand to grab onto the other handle and began to channel chakra into the blade like she is accustumed to doing so since she wanted to find out why the thing could store chakra.

Bringing the blade down while she still held both handles she would look around seeing Heiwa and sensing Arata in the near by area >I told Fujitora and Lera that I wanted to establish the seven ninja swordsmen on the mist but the more the time goes by the more I want to keep the blades for myself. I saw Edge ROOT seal Maloth so I could probably ask him to remove any and all seals on the blades and thus stopping him from deactivating them or whatever he did to Violets Kiba blades.<  Her thought process progressively got darker and darker and honestly who could blame her? She was resposible for taking the lifes of thousands of people. Shaking her head she would attempt to clear her head >No. Stop thinking like that, you will not go down a dark road. Everything you are doing is for the good of the village and for the good of the people that serve under me....everybody has a secret life.< she thought to herself as she continued to channel chakra into the blade.

Raised the blade using both hands, holding onto both hilts she would turn the blade sideways and began to do a series of slow movements with it. >Just focus on mastering the blade.< she thought to herslef as she slowly thrusted the sword forward then slowly pivoted her body to the right dragging the blade slowly against the wind >Remove everything from your mind and focus on the Hiramekarei, think only about the Hiramekarei. Feel it in your hands, feel its weight, feel the way it cuts through the wind. Also try to figure out why it can store chakra...yeah...focus on that first....no wait just focus on that...< He facial expression would be that of conflict as she was having a debate with herself. After several moments of an internal debate she would stop moving and shook her head and let go of one of the blade handles and brought that hand up to rub her face >I can't even make up my own mind.<

Bringing her blade back to place it on her back, holding the blade with one hand she would look around the waterfall >Hmm, that is a first. No one is around. At least now I can have a moment of peace or at least quiet. Also speaking to Baen really helped me vent out things which is really helpfull.< Focusing her gaze on the tree that she used to practice her kenjutsu with she would bring the blade up and point it at the tree >I am so close I can feel it.< she thought to herself as she shifted her gaze toward the waterfall that was behind her >Violet already mastered her blade, I need to master mine so that I can get started on the other blade Fujitora gave me the helmet splitter. I wonder how hard it will be to master that weapon.<

 Turning around to look at the trees again she would thrust her blade foward followed by a tilt in the blade that was then turned into a downward diagonal slash then was then turning into a vertical slash that would bring the blade up over her head and ended up behind her. Thrusting the blade again she would spin around slicing the air around her then she would thurst again and repeat the same process several more times untill she would spin again and face the opposite way she had been facing before and charged foward holding the blade with one hand draging the blade behind her. Jumping up she would bring the blade over her head grabing onto the other handle with her other hand and brough the swing down onto the water causing it to react to the slice like any water would. Panting a bit she would bring the balde back to her back and sealed it in there then brought her hand to wipe her face as water had splashed on her because of the previous swing she took at that water.* - Tue Oct 27 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Arriving at the waterfall again she would look around and found that once again just like the day before there was no one around which brought her a bit of joy as the past couple of days had been more than hectic for her. >Now that I have said what I had stuck in my chest to someone I am much more relaxed.< she thought to herself as she brought her hand to her back and unsealed the blade >My actions will speak for themselves. I want Sunagakure to fall but I do not want my friends to die in the process.< Bringing the blade infront of her she would bring her other hand up to grab onto the other handle and began to channel her chakra slowly into the blade >I must do what is right.< she told herself as she was channeling chakra into the blade >I will inform them of the attack and we will figure out a way to defeat Edge.<

Channeling her chakra into the blade she would keep a constant watch on her charkra pools as the first times she had poured chakra into the thing she had to sleep to regain her chakra as she had poured way to much without knowing it > One day and I can feel it I will figure out why you store chakra inside of you Hiramekarei, and when that happens I will truely have the right to be called the "Hiramekarei God"  that was given to me with my actions in Kumogakure.< Looking down at the blade she could see the crimson hued bandages and decided to keep them there as a grim reminder to the things she had to do to keep the village safe > I wont let anything happen to the village but I will also not let anything bad happen to my friends in Sunagakure.<

Pouring well over half her chakra into the blade she would begin to pant >This is like a bottomless barrel. No matter how much chakra I place into it I do not know if it is overflowing with chakra or if it barely has any. I mean for how long can it store chakra? Does it last hours? days? weeks? months? There is still so much I do not know about this blade and at this point I cannot ask Fujitora since I told him I had mastered it so if I ask him he will know that I was lying and might take both blades away.< Slowly she would drop to her knees as she still held the blade with both hands channeling chakra into it. Her panting progressively became heavier and heavier as her chakra slowly drained into the blade >No matter what, I will master you Hiramekarei.< she said in her mind as well it did not matter because Hiramekarei was an inanimate object.

Cutting off the chakra flow to the balde she would let go of one of the handles as she places the balde to herside while she still held onto the handle so that it wouldnt sink to the bottom of the lake and laid down. Using what chakra she had left she would create a layer around her body using the suiment technique and remained laying there panting heavily due to the amount of chakra she had lost so she closed her left eye and began to meditate >These past months have changed me and made me stronger. Slowly I will unravel into what I have to become be it a cold blooded killer, or the Mizukage this village needs and wants.< Remaining in the meditative state she would be laying there on the water holding onto the Hiramekarei with one hand keeping it from falling into the water.

 Opening her eye occasionally she would look at the sky for a brief moment and closed her eye again as she continued to regain her chakra >I can feel it. I do not know how or why but I will figure out the secret to this blade and when I do I will know how much chakra to pour into this thing and when that happens I will no longer feel exhausted when do I do pour chakra into this thing...on that note I need to figure out a way to expand my chakra pool but I will cross that mountain when I get there since there is no point in trying to do something before I accomplish this training.< Slowly begining to rise to her feet she would bring the blade to her back and sealed it into her coat > I need to get some rest before I hand out missions.< she thought to herself as she slowy stumbled her way to the mansion.* - Tue Oct 27 23:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Arriving at the waterfall like she always does when she trains and unsealed the blade from her back >Today is the day, I can feel it.< Holding the blade with one hand she would look at it and tried to see if there was anything that she could do to it like a secret mechanism withint the blade to access the chakra inside of it >Hmmm this is not a mechanical blade so i would not expect threre to be a switch or anything and I have been swinging this thing for a long time and even killed people with it and still have not figured out why I cant access the chakra inside of the blade. So how to access this things secrets....What haven't I tried?< She would bring the blade up from her back and swung the blade forward and splashed it into the water then brought it up to thrust it into the air infront of her followed by a spinning cut that would finish the combo >Hmm think.<

Bringing the blade closer to her body she would hold both handles again "Hmmm come one Hiramekarei, release your secrets to me." as soon as she finished saying that something happened that was rather unexpected. The bandages on the blade began to unravel as it began to glow a light blue color as the blade began to use the chakra that she had stored up in the blade. The chakra would quickly form a hammer out of the chakra that was stored up in it which caused her to become surprised and startled by this causing her to drop the blade to the water bellow. By doing this the blade would have wrapped itself back with the bandage causing the chakra to return to the inside of the blade where it continued being stored.

>What the fuck just happened?< she asked herself as she looked at the blade that was sinking to the bottom of the lake. Quickly reaching out for it she would grab the wearest handle and pulled the blade back to the surface >What the fuck?< she still asked herself as she could not make sense as to what had happened before her eyes >What did the blade just do? Why did the bandages just suddenly spring up? Why was there a light blue glow? I could sense and see that it was chakra but it wasn't just any chakra it was mine...damn...what.....how....like..how did I even do that?< She would grab the blade with both hand, one hand on each hilt and looked at it >What did I do to make it turn that way? Think Kirie think. What did you do? All I did was hold it and told it to reveal its secrets to me< She would frown a bit then sighed >I can try and tell it again see if that works.< gripping the hilts tightly she would open her mouth and said very slowly "Hiramekarei, release your secrets to me?"

Once again just like before the bandages on the blade would unravel as the chakra stored inside of it came to life. The bandages would wrap around her wrists and worked its way up her arms and wrapping around her neck, as for the blade itself it would be glowing with a light blue aura around it. She would blink twice as she was not expecting this to happen >What in the world? Was that all I had to say all this time? I have been busting my head over this and all I had to do was ask it to reveal its secrets to me? That was just way too easy.< she thought to herself as she focused on the blade again >Wait... the blade.. it is not like before... it just has the light blue aura but nothing else. Before I saw it become hammer like.< at that moment when she thought that the chakra would form a hammer like extremity on one of its sides which would once again take her by surprice.

 Letting go of one of the blade hilts the bandages would go back to wrapping themselves onto the blade causing the chakra to go back into the blade > So I have to give it a command in order for it to activate? But what command is it? I said fewer words the second time I activated it so the command must be simple, Hiramekarei: Release.< Looking at the blade she could not help but smile for the first time in a long time as she had accomplished what she had set out to do since she got the blade >Well I am one step closer to master this thing. I just need to figure out how much chakra it uses up when I materialize the hammer. I wonder if I can make other things out of it, will Fujitora tell me? No. I cant, he will know that I lied to him. What a drag.< Bringing the blade up to her back and sealed the blade in there and went back to the academy courtuard* - Thu Oct 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Walking into the mansion she breathed in deeply and exhaled it slowly >I knew I felt it.< she told herself as she remembered the events that has trasnpired several days ago > I was able to access Hiramekareis secrets. I now know why it stores chakra inside of it.< she would chuckle a bit >Now I know that all those days nearly draining my chakra into the thing were not for nothing. I know now that they were actually fruitful.< Reaching for her back she would unseal the blade and hed the blade once it was unsealed with one hand "Time to get to work." she muttered to herself as she reached for the other handle and channeled a little bit of chakra into the blade before heading toward the main event. "Hiramekarei: Release." she would say in a low toned voice so that no one that was near the area would hear her.

Molding the chakra of the blade into a hammer she would stare in awe of it for a few seconds before she returned tha chakra back to its normal state on the blade having it form a shroud of light blue around it > Since I am guessing that the blade will run out of chakra I must use it conservatively like if it was my own chakra, well in a way it is my chakra but it is out of my body and inside the blade  so I am guessing that it runs out of chakra.< she would sigh and shake her head >I am going to need to keep pouring more and more chakra into it so it would be better to do it preemptively to avoid chakra exhaustion while I am in combat.< Letting go of one of the hilts she would begin to practice her swings. Bringing the blade out infront of her she would thrust it foward then twisted the blade to swing in a circle around her the grabbed onto the other blade handle and ran foward "Hiramekarei: Release!" When she said this the bandages around the blade would begin to unravel and the chakra coat would appear on the blade, turning that chakra into a hammer she would jump into the air and brought the blade over her head then smalled it into the water bellow her with force.

Displacing the water all around her she would deactivate the hammer and spun around as she was comming down to gather momentum. Putting as much force as she could behind the swing she would activate the hammer again "Hiramekarei: Release!" which would promptly change and mold the chakra into the hammer that was characteristic with the blade and slammed into the water causing even more water to be displaced. Removing one of her hands from the handle she would make sure not to sink to the bottom of the lake and began to move forward as she dragged the blade behind her getting it ready for a swing >Be conservative of the chakra within the blade, but how can I do that when I cant sense anything. For all I know this thing has already used up all of the chakra I have poured into it, well there is only one way to find out.<

Bringing the blade up over her head she would grab it with both hands and poured some chakra into the blade to make sure that if it had consumed all of the chakra inside of it, it would have enough juice to do at least one more swing. "Hiramekarei: Release!" bringing the blade down from over her head the blade would light up with the chakra cloak it would get when the hammer was not in use and it would mold into the hammer which was then brought down against the water surface once again >Excellent!< she thought to herself with joy as hammer quickly changed back into the chakra coating that was around the blade then it died down as she did not want to continue using the chakra any more so the blade became wrapped in the bandages that it was usually wrapped it and walked back toward the point where she had started her training.

Once at the spot she would sit on the water as she held the blade with both hands and took in a deep breath >Now I have to refill this thing.< she thought to herself as she slowly began to pour chakra into the blade >I can feel it. I can call myself a master of this blade now. I deserve the title of the Hiramekarei God. I have discovered this blades secrets and I am sure I am the first one to do so, I will check the records later...thats if there are any sice the village was destroyed and all but yeah. I am feeling confident with myself now that I know how this blade works and what it can do.< Closing her left eye for a bit she began to go deeper into thought as she channeled chakra into the blade >I will have to writte a report of sorts so that the next person who comes after me know how to use the blade, I will do that for every blade I master.< Opening her eye again she would stop the chakra flow to the blade and brought it to her back and sealed it there.* - Thu Oct 29 05:57:32 2015
