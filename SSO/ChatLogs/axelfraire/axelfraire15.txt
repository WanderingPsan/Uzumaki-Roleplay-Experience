Kirie commented as she crouched down to remove her shoes, backpouch and holster "I do not get easily flustered as you may have noticed so I believe you decided to step things up to see just how far it would take to fluster me, am I correct?" she asks with curiosity in her voice as she placed her shoes beside the basket then placed her holster and backpouch inside of the basket while she still had her eyes closed.* - Tue Oct  6 02:10:08 2015

Well I ever since my defeat in the private exams I made a vow to myself never to be defeated again so I wish you luck." she would tell him with confidense in her voice. Standing up she would bring her arms to take off her shirt carefully as to not take off the teal stone necklace that hung right above her breasts then proceeded to take off her bra and folded each article of clothing and placed them in the basket where she had placed her other things. Stretching her arms upward she would twist her upper body to each side to get a good stretch off then would bring her hands down to revome her pants and panties folding each article once again and repeated the same procees she had been doing with all her clothing. Once that was done she would reach for her hair and untied the pony tail she had which caused her hair to fall to its full covering her back and glutes.* - Tue Oct  6 02:24:38 2015

Controlling her hair she would raise his hands up as more hair shot out to wrap around his waist "You see I do not get flustered easy but I do not allow any man to touch me." she told him as she was staring at the wall infront of her being fully aware what was going on behind her "Things have happened in my past that have made me this way so I would suggest you do not lay your hands on me." she warned him as she still held both his hands wrapped with her hair.* - Tue Oct  6 03:26:04 2015

Before you had that eye you were passive now you are actively seeking to destroy the Gezo for whatever reason when you were talking about reigning over us 'peasants'.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) pushed off the wall and took several steps foward then stated at the male who had challenged her and zeroed in her sensing abilities on him watching the way his chakra flowed withing his body and taking notes of his facial features and chakra signature. "Ready when you are." she would tell him as she brough he right hand out with her fingers pressed against each as she sent chakra to her fingertips on both hands. If the male was a sensor he would be able to detect the build up of chakra on both her fingertips.* - Tue Oct  6 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) detected the chakra build up in his body which gave her ample time to react to it. Using her speed she would rush toward the male while avoiding the incoming Raiton based technique since it was coming at an angle, bringing her hands up to her forehead with opened palms she would tranfer the chakra that was being focused on her fingertips and passed it down to the palms where two fireballs would form one in each hand. Using her chakra to control the intensity of light being emitted she would send a surge of chakra to creat a flash that was stronger than the avarage flash bomb in hopes of blinding his target for a brief instant.

Assuming that Orthos had fallen for the technique she would pull out her tanto and held it infront of her with her left hand as she brough out her right hand with fingers pressed against each other. Sending chakra to her fingertips she would close her only exposed eye in hopes of making her opponent believe that she had left herself open for an attack but in reallity she would have been able to see him just fine as she could see the chakra that was flowing through his body as she had been focusing on him ever since the spar had started.* - Tue Oct  6 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) recognized the first set of handseals that were strung up as she herself as a Suiton user so she would know how to react to said technique. When he released the stream of water out of his mouth she was debating on what course of action to take but then he began to do another set of handseals >What is he up to?< she asked herself as she watched with her eyes closed as the set of handseals had gone off >Shit.< she thought to herself as she realized it was the same set of handseals he had done with his first move.

Sending chakra to her feet to activate the suimen technique she would pivot and run up the wall that was behind her using her speed to get away from the combination Orthos had used. >That is interesting.< she told herself as she could see what was going on behind her even though she was currently running up the wall giving her back to Orthos. Turning around she focused on Orthos once again "Interesting combination guy, what else do you have up your sleeve?" asked Kirie as she weaved three handseals (Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger) as she molded and kneeded her chakra inside of her stomatch, upon complition she would release a black mist that would rise up to the air and settled above Orthos. This black mist would turn into a black cloud that would begin the water cycle as it went form a condensating black mist to a condensated black cloud which in turn followed the next step which was precipitation. Black rain droplets would begin to fall on and a small area around Orthos.* - Tue Oct  6 15:57:52 2015

Taking in a big breath of air she would exhale it and infuse it with her chakra creating a volley of six fireballs that would travel toward the two Orthos moving in unpredictable ways as she was controlling each fireball with her chakra.

As she shot the fireballs she would have ran out of wall to run onto so he would just simply leap down onto the floor bellow crouching as she landed to avoid any type of damage to her legs. Standing up she would focus on Orthos and his clone being aware of what each one of them would do as she could see the  way chakra flowed through both their bodies and would be ready to react like she had been doing before.* - Tue Oct  6 16:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) was not about to have her fireballs be extinguished by the flames as she was able to control the individual fireballs thanks to the chakra that had been placed as the fireballs were being formed and shot. Moving each fireball to avoid the turrent of water that emerged from one of the Orthos mouth the fireballs conitnued to move in an unpredictable way as they traveled to forward toward the two males. Splitting the fireballs into two groups of three she would spread the group of fireballs into a wide triangle that would being to rotate as it traveled toward the males only tightening the triangle when they got close to their targets with intentions of slamming into each of thier respective chests.

Since she had casted the jutsu as she was running on the wall she would not be in any danger as the torrent of water would be nowhere near her. Since the cancelation via water turrent did not happen due to her controlling the fireballs to avoid the water stream the clone would either be struck by the fireballs or he would have to take evasive actions to prevent him from dispelling due to the damage would have taken and since the purpose of the water stream was to protect the clone he would have to avoid the stream of be struck as well by the fireballs.* - Tue Oct  6 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) ran forward using her speed as the fireballs impacted on their intended targets causing the clone to dispell and the original to barrel roll back. Arriving infront of him he would withdraw her tanto and pointed it at him "I win." she simply said as she was watching every single one of his movements even thought she had one eye closed and one eye covered by her headband "Nice spar." she would tell him as she offered her other hand to help him up which in turn caused her to lower her tanto a bit "Those are some very nice jutsu combinations, What is your name guy?"

Opening her closed eye she would be now staring at him but still kept her senses focused on him just incase he wanted to do something foolish. It is worth noting that the flames where NON LETHAL AND SHOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THE TARGET but it is ultimately up to the player. She would have also focused her other senses on the area around her as she had pretty good situational awareness.* - Tue Oct  6 17:12:06 2015

The water that came out of her body would quickly flood the floor and encase Sabo in a watery prison that would make it impossible to move due to the water consistency and unless he drew a big breath of air he would find that his oxygen supply would be dwindling fast. Of course in accordance with the technique she would have to be physically touching the water so her left arm was used to sustain the technique to keep him there trapped in a watery prison.* - Wed Oct  7 01:51:47 2015

If you excuse me I need to take this man to the hospital."

Having excellent situational awareness thanks to ther implanted byakugan which was hidden by her headband she would be able to see what Sabo and everyone in the room was doing so she would be ready to react to any danger coming her way, even resorting to ditching Amon in order to save her own life.* - Wed Oct  7 02:15:40 2015
