She would dissolve her water clones as she would be moving forward and would be out of range out of two of the three clones she had created. Her shadow clone however would still be searching the water way with Kohakus clone. Approching the pinned Kohaku she would look at Seisuke with a smirk on her face since when she got close enough she would deliver a kick toward Kohakus head/face which ever was facing her at the moment.

"This is not how I pictured it but it is one way of doing it." she commented toward Seisuke who was pinning and sealing Kohaku up "What is the next step?" she would ask Seisuke as this was not the way she had planned things out in her head but things has still worked out in the end.* - Tue Sep 29 22:24:51 2015

She would then bring her foot up and stomped on the side of Kohaku's head/face which ever had been facing her due to the sturggle she was putting up "Oi Seisuke."* - Tue Sep 29 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) \\Kohaku forgets that Kirie had a shadow clone of herself underwater as well and would not have easily let the clone who was moving underwater which is difficult enough due to the water resistance. As soon as the clone saw Kohaku's clone go on the move she would move to intercept it but if that did not work and the clone somehow by the grace of whatever diety she believed in holy Kirie would heard the splashing of the water which caused her to turn toward the clone who would need to make handseals to shot out the Phoenix flower jutsu and simply did a barage of handseals herself as she molded and kneeded her chakra inside her stomatch then brought it out of her mouth as a stream of water that would intercept the fireballs.

Knowing the jutsus herself she would know that the fireballs could be controlled by the users chakra so she would be ready to move her head to where the fireballs would move.* - Tue Sep 29 22:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) pulls out some ninja wire from her backpouch and would throw it up in the air toward Kohaku. She would use chakra to control the ninja wire to wrap around Kohaku even though she was already binded and sealed up she wanted to be extra cautious about it. Once the wires had been secured tightly around her body she would then proceed to tie her to the cave wall as she kept her sensing abilities focused on Seisuke and Kohaku as a precautionary measure.* - Tue Sep 29 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) reached for ninja wire in her backpouch and threw it up in the air above Kohaku, she did not know if Kohaku had been fully released from her previous bindings nor did she care as she sent chakra running through the wire and would wrap it around Kohaku.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Whatever. - Wed Sep 30 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Finger? - Wed Sep 30 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Alright then. - Wed Sep 30 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) placed her right foot up against her head to bend her foward exposing her back. She would grab the wire ends with one hand and would tighten them a bit more causing them to cut deeper into her skin. Extending out her right hand and index finger she would begin to focus chakra onto it then pressed it down onto Kohaku's back when enough chakra had been focused causing her skin to become branded where her finger was passing by "Hmmm." hummed Kirie as she moved her finger ro the right "What do you want me to write on your back? Your name? Any specific word? Tell me."* - Wed Sep 30 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) wasn't about to write her name on her back so she just begin carving it up the word 'B' 'I' 'T' 'C' 'H' on her back taking her sweet time carving out all the letters "So what else? Do you have a message for your new owner? Would you want me to carve anything for him to read as he probably will be fucking you over and over so he will need something to read." she would chuckle a bit then began focusing more chakra into her finger.

Bringing it down once again she would begin to carve straight lines down her back avoiding to hit the wires that were binding her down as she did not want to cut her loose on accident. "Tell me Kohaku, do you have any family? Anyone you care for?"* - Wed Sep 30 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) pushed her with her foot further to make her bend foward to the point where her ass was up in the air "Family all dead huh? Well that sucks I am not really sorry to do that as I am sure they all died to get away from you." she would then focus chakra onto her finger and would begin carving the words "No" "Entry" above her ass cheeks as a fun little joke at least it was fun for her since she was not the one getting the words carved into her body. "So Kenshin, Fujitora and Sanoke huh why those three huh? Kenshin is your teacher from what I can see but why Sanoke and Fujitora? Was it because Fujitora treated you to a meal? What about Sanako? Was it because he saw you naked? That is really perverted you know just like when you masturbated infront of Seisuke. Tell me did it turn you on? Did you enjoy it? I am sure you did."* - Wed Sep 30 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) finished carving the words and spanked her ass "Oh yes he was telling me something about those red eyes of yours being in his clan, so that would make you relatives of sorts meaning that you lied to me." she would then proceed to spank her again as punishment "You know lying is a bad thing to do." she would tease at her as she pulled tighter on the ninja wires that were coiled around her body "And as for the relationships you say you have let me tell you that I stoped myself from forming bonds with people because they only turn into pain. Think about it. How will Kenshin feel if he no longer saw you again? He would be sad I imagined which is why if I go missing no one will bother looking for me to save them the pain you know."

She would slap her ass once again "So that is the reason why I do not bother with relationships like those. The closest thing I've gotten to forming a bond is with Fujitora and even then I would not really expect him to go looking for me. Kinda sad don't you?" with that she would spank her other ass cheek "Did you parents even spank you as a child? Is that why you are so annoying? I think that is why you are so annoying dont you?" she would proceed to slap her ass once again "Yeah you know I think we are starting to know each other very well don't you?"* - Wed Sep 30 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Tilted her head as she looked at Kohakus face riddled with pain, she would feel her body shaking due to the pain that was being inflicted "Oh? Did I hit you too hard?" she would ask teasingly at her as she brought her hand up to spank her once again "So I wont understand huh? Why not? Explain to me why I wont understand?  What don't I know? Please explain to me what I do not know and or understand I really want to see things from your point of view but if you do not tell me I will not be able to do so." She would then bring her hand down once again and slapped her ass again then held it there as she squeezed it and pulled it to the side a bit.

Letting go of her ass cheek she would then bring her hand up to Kohakus back and focused chakra onto her finger and began carving on her back once again "I am sure you were thinking about Kenshin, Fujitora or Sanoke when you were fingering yourself right? Man you sure are perverted for such a young girl." she would say this even though she herself was doing something that could have been considered perverted but she really did not care as once again this was not affecting her in any way shape or from "My bet is on Kenshin since he is your teacher."* - Wed Sep 30 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) stoped carving into her back as she saw what Kohaku was doing "Hmm? You know the tough girl act wont really work on me, as much as you might try to say that they are beauty marks we both know that you are hurting and I can tell this by the way your body is trembling so you have two options here. I can continue doing more things to you to prove that I can hurt you in more ways than you could imagine or you could submit and the suffering could possibly come to a halt. Up to you really." she would then reach for her tanto using the hand that was not holding the wires and unsheethed it.

With her other hand she would pull on the wires having them now actually cut into her skin all at ones probably causing her to feel inmense pain. She would then use the hilt of her tanto and began to slowly shove it up her ass to prove her point "You will not believe the amount of ways I can cause pain to you Kohaku, this is just one of them and I do hope that you tell me that you are enjoying it because that way I know that you are full of shit both figuratively and literally." The tanto began to slowly made its way inside of Kohakus body.* - Wed Sep 30 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: . . . - Wed Sep 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) released the wire a bit to where it was not cutting more into her skin and left the tanto where it was no longer pushing it in "See I knew you were full of shit Kohaku, you can act as tough as you want but we both know that well you are no where near being tough. Do you think being fast is going to help you out? Well news flash it wont as you can see here." Standing up she would walk around Kohaku still holding the wire endings on her left hand to make sure she could tighten them if she needed to "Now I will ask you again Kohaku, tell me what I do not know or what I do not undestand. It is as simple as that. Do it and I might stop this."

Finishing her walk around her she would once again begin to push the tanto in nice and slowly and would stop as it went a couple of centimeters in "To think that the day turned out like this is kind of surpricing don't you think? I mean here I thought I was going to kill you and dump your body into the ocean tied with a couple of rocks so that you would sink to the bottom but nope, here I am shoving a tanto up your ass after you have masturbated infront of Seisukes clone. Funny how life works huh?"* - Wed Sep 30 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) walked to the side of Kohaku to look at her face and kneeled down "There is no hope for you. There never was really." She would make two two handseal Snake ---> Rat and would send out her chakra toward Kohaku's head in an attempt to place her inside of a genjutsu. If the genjutsu would go off she would be experiencing her worst nightmare right before her eyes without her being able to do much do to the fact that she would not form handseal thanks to the ninja wire binding her body down.* - Wed Sep 30 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) notes that Kohaku was right so the genjutsu would not have gone off because of the pain she would have been feeling so that was a dumb move on her own part.* - Wed Sep 30 04:36:03 2015
