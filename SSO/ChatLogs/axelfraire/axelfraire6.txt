<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would be sitting on the dock swinging her legs above the water as her boots layed next to her >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AeDR5Zcwso<.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) continued to look at Sanoke "Hmmm well I got here and one thing lead to the other but this is a very good spot to train." she would raise her hands to form the Concealment handseal as she began to mold and kneed her chakra inside her stomatch then would slowly start to release it through her mouth in the form of a pearly white mist that would begin to cover the area and would intergrate itself with the existing mist that was within Kirigakure. Given her mastery over the jutsu the mist would be thick and made it hard to see a few feet ahead of you "I came here and practiced this jutsu every day untill I had mastered it." she told him as she felt the mist cares her exposed skin sending a slight shiver down her spine.* - Wed Sep 23 02:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would be sitting there talking to Sanoke having a relatively good time when some asshole had decided to strike. She feel as something constricted against her and would feel the cold wire against her arms as they had cut through her clothing and what was worse she found herself being dragged into the water against her will, of course feeling that she was being pulled foward and considering where she was she would take in a big gulp of air before impacting into the water at the mercy at whatever was dragging her into the water.* - Wed Sep 23 02:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would push her arms outward and would get loose from the wires. Swimming up to the surface of the water she would focus her chakra on her hands and every part of her body that was slowly making its way out of the water. Her wair would have been covering her face and her pony tail would be flat against her back due to it being wet. She would finish getting out of the water and began sending chakra to her head as she slowly walked over to the shore and layed down "W-Why..are you laughing." she would ask him as she sat upright and brought her hand up to undo her pony tail "D-id.. you see who pulled me in?" she would ask him knowing that the answer was probably no since the mist was thick "Fuck.."* - Wed Sep 23 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would listen to his explination as to what had happened >Liar.< she thought to herself as she would take his hand and grasped it firmly "You see, I was sitting down when I used the jutsu." she told him with a serious tone of voice as she continued to send chakra up to her hair "When one is sitting down you cannot trip..also I felt my movement be contricted and I have been placed under that same type of constriction a few days ago." by now her tone had turned very displeasing as more chakra was being sent up to her head "So I could not have tripped and the fact that you are laughing tell me you had something to do with this." With that she would send chakra to each indivial strand of hair and sent it out to restrain Sanoke's movements. Fisrt her hair would target the forearm of the hand she was grabing, then the led under the arm then the other leg and finally the last arm. If he had any sensing capabilities he would be able to tell that she was focusing chakra on her head and would be able to make the necesarry evasive maneuvers to avoid it, but if he didn't he would be in a lot of trouble as he had manage to piss her off.* - Wed Sep 23 02:54:43 2015

"So...Sanoke." she would say in not the friendliest of tones "You see my hair is a special tool to me and when something happens to it like I don't know...get wet out of nowhere without a specific cause I tend to get rather upset." She would use her hair to lift the boy up a bit and used some more of her hair to wrap around his waist and neck, or course the hair around his neck would not be tightened as she did not want to deprive him of air. Having lifted him up with her hair she would begin walking toward the water using Suimen to walk on it "You have three seconds to answer before you get the same treatment I got." she would tell knowing it was him who had caused her hair to get wet given his explination of how things had happened.* - Wed Sep 23 03:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) was walking toward the water "Three." she counted down and she stepped on the water "Tw-" she was suddenly interrupted by an explotion, instictively she retracted her precious hair back towad her head and sent it backwards as she jumped back since she was not about the getting her hair blown up or herself for that matter so the end result was her letting go of Sanoke who was left to his own devices as he fell toward the water. "Oi!." she would exclaim "That just made you even more guilty you know!" She would cut the chakra flow to her hair and it would go limp falling down around her following the natural way her hair flowed.

"I was not really going to do much." she admitted to him as she stood up straight watching the mist slowly begin to disappear "I gotta hand it to you it was a good prank. I still have not figured out how exactly you did it but hey good job." She would reach up to her hair and would begin to squeeze it to begin removing the excess water from it.* - Wed Sep 23 03:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) would give him an "are you fucking serious" look as her hair suffered for someone entertainment ".....For future reference do not mess with the hair and do not tell anyone about this ability." she woudl continue to squeeze and twist her hair to let the excess water drip "Anyway, now I have to go shower so yeah. I'll catch you later." she told him as she waited for his reply and once she heard it she would bring her hands to the front of her chest letting her wet hair fall and would execute a single handseal and poofed away.* - Wed Sep 23 03:46:46 2015

Placing the wire in her hands and between her fingers she would look at the tree and sent the wires toward it aiming to wrap it around the tree trunk but would not accomplish it as she lacked the skill to do it.

Bothered by this she would step foward a few times to reduce the distance between her and the tree and would try again. She would send the wires foward then would twist her hands allowing her to change the direction that the wire was treveling. Pulling her hand back she would wrap the wire around the tree and would be satisfied with her accomplishment and turned to face Setsuna "Thanks." she simply told her as she turned her head to gaze at the departing trio she was just with.* - Wed Sep 23 17:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) had her clones go into the cave as fast as her body would allow them to run and made extra sure that the clones would run in a zig zagging motion trying to set off any traps that might have been laid like trip wires, explosive traps, pungabi holes etc etc. Of course there was a limit as to how far her clones could travel as they were just mere water clones so they lacked the solidification that the shadow clones had. Once they reached their limit they would stop and if one or both of the clones would fall for a trap they would try to avoid it but if they couldn't then it would not matter as the clones were sent to trigger them in the first place to protect the children.* - Wed Sep 23 22:42:33 2015

Opening her mouth she would release a pearly white mist that would begin to merge with the existing mist that lingered throughout Kirigakure, given the mastery of the jutsu the mist would be thick making it difficult for anyone with enhanced senses or sensing abilities to see who was were or who went were. After deploying the mist she would take a couple of steps diagonally and would wait for Kohaku to make a move...not that it would have mattered really since she did not have any enhanced senses.* - Fri Sep 25 00:31:34 2015
