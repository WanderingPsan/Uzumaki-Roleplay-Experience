I know the subject must be taboo with you red eyes because well you were almost hunted to extinction along with the white eyes but it is something that has already happened and that can only be changed by removing this eye of mine which I will fight to protect." she would close her eye and wrapped it up with the eye wrap and placed her headband on to cover the eye wrap.

"Right or wrong does not matter at the moment Fujitora. I am the current leader of a country, I will do whatever it takes to make sure that my villagers and shinobi do not have to suffer. Even if I have to do questionable things you know?

It has one tail and looked like a cat, all hell broke loose and the white eyes was impaled by a piece of wood that came off the wall, at first I regreted fighting him at first when I saw him laying there in a pool of blood because I knew that if he had not been distracted he would have lived but things work out in a funny way.
