<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) heard his instructions and was confused by the first few words as he told her she had to bathe >I was about to say.< she thought to herself as she hear the rest of his explination and began to think about what he had asked her to do >So...what now? I need it to conform to me? Well fuck it I have nothing to lose and much to gain from this so here goes nothing.< She would take a seat on the dock and looked at Nozumi "How long do I have to meditate for? What am I to do to let the mist conform to me?" she had many questions but decided to only ask those two as they were the most important questions that were going through her mind at the moment.* - Sat Sep 19 01:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) closed her eyes and began to try and feel what he was talking about but well she really could not feel anything other than the mist occasionally drifting along with the wind as she would feel it on her skin >Hmm, what the hell am I even supposed to do? How am I going to feel this or accomplish this? If he means that it comes naturally then it is easy for him to say since well he was born with it.< she would gain a different expression on her face as it was clear that her thoughts were really bothering her >I will get this down, this is vital for my plans.< she thought to herself as she continued to meditate ontop of the dock letting the mist continue to flow freely along with the wind.* - Sat Sep 19 01:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) continued to remain in her meditative state as she would keep her ears opened in a figurative way to listen to what Nozumi had to say >I do not think I can afford to wait days, I need to get this down faster since I am on a schedule here but ughhh why must this be hard? Why couldn't I have been born with it like he did?< she would show clear signs of distress on her face as her thoughts would really be taking a lot more of her attention than she would have been giving them. She would continue sit there meditating letting the mist flow through the area having it brush around her as it moved through.* - Sat Sep 19 01:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: any let us start with a basic jutsu. - Sat Sep 19 18:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) took a couple of steps away from Niza and focused her chakra inside her body then sent it out of her body onto the nearby grass that was aroud them A small circle of fire would form and it would get larger and smaller according to how much chakra she would pour into the jutsu "This is the Ninja Art: Fire run it is one of the most basic Katon jutsus out there. It should be fairly easy to do since all you need to do is to send chakra out and have it start a fire then you manipulate that fire into a circle." She would cut the chakra flow toward the jutsu and turned to look at Niza "Think you can handle it?"* - Sat Sep 19 18:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 19 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: It might take a while. - Sat Sep 19 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So I'll give it to you when have actually done the deed. - Sat Sep 19 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright, I can wait. Patience is one of my best qualities after all. - Sat Sep 19 20:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: ^ - Sat Sep 19 20:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) still being several steps away from Niza she focused on the task of mastering the jutsu. She would focus the chakra inside of her and sent it out of her body to a spot infront of her, that spot would errupt in a fiery circle that was smaller than the circle of fire she used to demonstrate the jutsus that slowly begin to get bigger as she poured more chakra into the technique.* - Sat Sep 19 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) took several steps back then began to pour more chakra into the fiery circle as it began to expend in the area before him >I should have mastered this before I offered to teach it.< she thought to herself rather displeased by this because now she has to spend time mastering said jutsu instead of doing other much needed training that she had planned to do for the day. Sighed she watched the circle grow larger and larger then would shirnk it in size when the circle was getting big and out of control.* - Sat Sep 19 20:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: When did you stop being the Raikage? - Sat Sep 19 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: When I went to Konohagakure and....lost. - Sat Sep 19 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Did the person you lost to become Raikage..? - Sat Sep 19 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes...That's what they challenged me for. - Sat Sep 19 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Was it Ushinawa? - Sat Sep 19 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. It was. - Sat Sep 19 21:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You need to come with me right now. - Sat Sep 19 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) watched as she had improved with the jutsu as the asthetics of the fiery circle became more refined as the flames were no longer bursting everywhere >Well that is encouraging.< she told to herself as she glanced to the side to look at Himura then returned it toward the fiery circle before her >Well I mean I least I now get information out of this so I might not be a bad thing I did not master this.< she thought to herself as she poured more chakra into the fire making it expand.* - Sat Sep 19 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I have something to show you in private. - Sat Sep 19 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 19 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Lead the way. - Sat Sep 19 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was very pleased with herself since she had gotten even better with the jutsu now "I should master this soon." she commented toward Niza as he left >Well now I was left alone, I wonder if Fujitora will have time to train with me today.< She would decrease the size of the circle then exting it completely.* - Sat Sep 19 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Mmm. - Sat Sep 19 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: In any case we need to wait for Niza, he's going to see if this is all true and if it is, he's going to try and sway Ushinawa to our side. - Sat Sep 19 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He told me if he didn't come back or doesn't send a message, we should evacutate. - Sat Sep 19 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Did he now? - Sat Sep 19 22:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also if this turns out to be true, the plan we formulated earlier will not work. - Sat Sep 19 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Evacuation and allowing for the enemy to take over our land would be extremely bad.  - Sat Sep 19 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Then again if we dont evacuate and get wiped out it will be bad aswell - Sat Sep 19 22:14:24 2015

When she reached the center of the lake she would execute the Concealment handseal and begin kneeding and molding her chakra within her stomatch then realease it in the form of a pearly white mist that quickly began to cover the area and blend in with the existing mist that existed within Kirigakure. She would sit on the water and began to meditate >Ok so I have to feel the mist.< she began to think about what Nozumi had told her yesterday >Feel the mist around me, try to blend in.<* - Sun Sep 20 01:30:40 2015

At this rate I should be done in a couple of years time but then again that is not a good thing since many things can happen in that time.< she would let her train of though take her where ever it needed to as she would be sitting there for a long time trying to accomplish what she had seen someone do.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) she would feel a certain chill as the mist brushed past her exposed skin which would feel odd at first but as time went by she would get used to the sensation >Hmm If only Fijutora would train me like he said he would I could have maybe moved up the progress a bit. So far I only have about a ten percent give or take a few percentages which is not bad but I should be progressing faster than I am. I am used to working hard and working untill I accomplish my objective but there are so many unknowns.< she would continue to sit there meditating for the time being as she really did not feel anything changing other than the fact that she no longer felt the chilly mist since she had gotten used to the sensation.* - Sun Sep 20 01:48:35 2015

It was really all an inconvenience as she really wanted to focus solely on meditating and getting this done and over with but she knew that it would take a long time and that she could not ignore her bodily functions but she tried her best to ignore them untill she could not ignore them anymore. Scratching her body where it itched she opened her eyes to see the pearly white mist still there all around her >Hmm I wonder how long this would actually take..I guess I can thank my luck to have meet him as he was the person I was looking for.<* - Sun Sep 20 01:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) closing her eyes she began to meditate again >I have to take this one day at a time, like Nozumi said I have to feel the mist around me. I have to move with it instead of trying to cover myself in it, so in other words I need to become one with the mist one way or another but in order do that I need to take it slowly. It does not matter that my progression becomes extended as it will be worht it. I will be ready, my body will be ready.< she thought to herself as she meditated in the mist.* - Sun Sep 20 02:09:55 2015
