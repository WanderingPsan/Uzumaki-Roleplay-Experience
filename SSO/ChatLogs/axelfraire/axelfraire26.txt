<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Unsealed the blade from her coat and grabed the handles holding the blade up with relative ease >Well it is not as heavy as before.< she thought to herself as she looked at the blade >I know I have not mastered a single blade but I would like access to all the blades. I really dislike fuuinjutsu but well I can't do much about it.< she continued her train of thought as she brought the blade up holding it by both handles. >Fujitora said something about storing chakra into it...I am guessing that the chakra will enter through the handles..Hmm.< she would begin channeling her chakra into the blade but would not really know if anything was going on since well she did not have the proper skill to know what the hell was going on with the blade.

Stopping the chakra flow to the blade handles and began to swing it. This was no easy did however as she found that her arms grew tired with each swing >Damn.< she thought to herself as she swung it horizontally >This is still heavy...Fuck.< She would lower the blade as she had began to pant >I need to get master this as soon as possible. I need to become stronger. I need to protect the village and I need to be able to protect myself.< she thought as she brought the blade once again and moved foward toward a nearby tree. Holding one of the handels she cocked her arm back then used the other to grab onto the other handle as swung it at the tree cutting into it but did not cut it completely.

"Fuck." she muttered as she struggled to pull the blade out of the tree >I got scared, I held back at the last moment.< she said to herself as she pulled the blade out >I need to cut through it like if it was nothing, I cant hold back. That can be the difference between life and death and I am sure as hell I will chose life over death.< She would back up and walk back as she held the blade up with her hands resting the balde on her shoulder as she walked to where she was previously standing >Come one Kirie, no excuses. Cut through that tree like if it was nothing.< She would grip the blade tightly and began to charged foward  gainig speed as she went and when she was near she would bring the blade back.

>Do not hesitate.< she told herself as she closed her eyes and swung the blade against the same tree she had initially cut into and slammed the balde against the wood cutting cleanly through it. Opening her eyes she could see that she had cut through the wood and now had to stop the blade which she did by contracting her arm muscles and pulled the blade back. Directing the blade toward the ground the tree fell before her >Not bad.< she told herself as she look up toward the tree that had been cut in half >Not bad at all but fuck am I tired, channeling some chakra into this thing did not help either.< Sitting down and gaining her breath she would look at the blade "Well Hiramekarei." she said in a low tone of voice "It will just be me and you for some time so if you take care of me I will take care of you, agreed?"

She would shake her head and chuckle a bit as she realized that she was talking to a piece of steel >Tch, pathetic.< she thought to herself as she laid down on the ground resting the blade beside her >One day I will be sure to master this and when that happens I will be a force to be reckoned with. I can guarantee that. I will protect everyone serving under me and I will become a sergeant so that this village can be recognized as an official village. When that happens I will truely be happy.< She would seal the balde into her coat and slowly started to rise up as she reached into her backpouch and unsealed the balde that Violet had given her >Now to start training with this.< she told herself as she gripped the blade with both hands.* - Thu Oct 22 23:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) took out the blade that Violet had given her and examined it >Hmm this is a bone, Baens bone....why would he? You know what it does not even matter a blade is a blade no matter how you look at it....or what it is made of.< She would grab the hilt of the bone blade and found it to be very light as well compared to the Hiramekarei which would make things easier for her. Holding the blade with two hands she would get a feel for it >Hmm, the texture is obviously different since this is bone but I wonder how sharp it truely is, I could go stabbing at something but well that could end up backfiring as it could end up braking on me or I could injure myself.<

Bringing up the sword to give it a swing she would stop it as soon as her arms were by her stomatch then brought it up again >Hmmm, very light weight.< she thought to herself as she charged toward a near by tree and brought the blade up above her head and sliced at the tree in a diagonal fashion slashing into the bark of the tree. She would back off and examined the blade >Hmmmm, it is still sharp. I guess Baens bones as hard as he claims they are.< she would look up at the tree infront of her and examined the cut she had done from where he was standing >It is a decent cut. I need to be able to cut deeper though.< she thought to herself as she brought the sword up infront of her holding it with her two hands >I will cut it deeper.< she said to herself as she charged at the tree once again.

This time she lowered her blade and did a diagonal cut aiming to mark an X on the tree. Once she did she would move to the side and slashed again then backed off >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she panted >I guess training after having already done tiresome things with Hiramekarei was not a smart idea. Now I am tired, if I keep this up I will end up being exhausted...but then again. I do need to master both of these blades. So fuck it who cares. I will be exhausted if I have to but I will master these things, then I will move on to master the rest of the blades.< She would charge foward and thrusted the tip of the blade into the tree then brought the blade out and spun around to slash at the thing >Harder.< she said to herself as she brought the blade up and slashed vertically at the bark >Faster.< she said to herself again as she backed away and prepared another slash >Stronger, Deeper, Harder, Faster.<

Slashing at the tree again to the best of her abilities she would back off and drop to a knee heavily panting >Damn it.< she thought to herself as she collaps to the floor panting heavily >Damn it all to hell. I train for one thing and that is when my flaws show up next. Fuck fuck fuck.< She would let go of her bone blade and bring one hand up to her head "Fuck." she muttered to herself as she was exhausted >Damn blades, damn training, damn weakness.< It was clear that she was not used to being defeated specially not by something that she wanted to master >It is easier said than done.< she thought to herself as she slowly started to close her right eye.

Opening and closing her right eye she would find that it was hard to stay awake, specially after training with two different blades >I just need some rest..when was the last time I slept? I cant even remember.< she would continue to open and close her eye. With each blink her vision would become more blury than the last time >Just....need...some..rest.< she struggled to think as her mind was slowly going blank due to her body shutting down on its own because of her exhaustion >No...I ...must train.< she would attempt to stand up but her body would not respond >Fuck.< she thought once again as she closed her eye again and went to sleep.* - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Woke up form her nap and looked around in confusion >How long was I out?< she thought to herself as she continued to look around the area >Well nothing has changed.< she told herself once again as she looked at the bone blade >I remember being exhausted...I feel groggy... did I oversleep? I must have...yeah fuck.<  She would slowly begin to rise up and walked toward the lake and looked at her own reflection >.....Hmmm.< she said to herself as she looked at her crimson eye > I have done some questionable things in my life but all of them have served a purpose.< Removing her headband she would open her right eye and looked at her reflection now >I do not regret any of them.< she told herself as she submerged her hands into the water splashed some on her face and placed her headband on and unsealed the Hiramekarei.

Grabbing onto one of the handles of the blade and walked toward the lake using the suimen technique to prevent her from sinking to the bottom of the lake . Resting the blade against her shoulder she moved to swing the blade across in a horizontal way then brought it back and used her other hand to grab onto the other handle allowing her to continue on with the motion. Once the blade reached the front of her body she would hold both handles with her hands and brought the blade up over her head >I have to be careful with this.< she told herself as she brought the blade down in a vertical slice and thrusted it foward then pivoted her body to do a horizontal slice >I wont be placing chakra into this for now untill I know what it does exactly as the information on it is vague at the most .<

Bringing the balde down from her seriest of swings she would hold the handles of the blade as the tip of it rested over the water >Keep calm Kirie.< she told herself as she focused on a near by tree and pointed Hiramekarei toward it >Cut fast and cut deep.< she told herself as she shot foward toward the tree holding her blade back with one hand. Once near enough the tree she would bring her other hand to grab onto the handle and swung it across to make contact with the tree.>There has to be more to this weapon than this.< she thought to herself as she swung the blade across the tree bark >I need to figure out how to use the chakra I store into this. I mean why would anyone store chakra into the blade in the first place, what was the person that built this blade thinking?< It wasa obvious that she was curious as to the functions of the blade but at the moment she needed to be able to handle it properly as it still tired her arms when she swung it.

Using the momentum of the swing she would pivot and turn her body to swing the balde again using the same momentum from the first slice. >Strike fast.< she told herself as her arms tired from the swings >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she finished slicing across the tree >I need more strength, I am far too weak.< she told herself as she rested the tip of the blade on the ground and began to pant. "My arms." she muttered as she looked over at the blade and her arms "They feel sore.. I did not expect for the blade to conitnue being this heavy even dispite my training." she would sigh and shake her head "I need to continue doing this, its for my own good and the good of the village." 

Slowly sat down and rested the blade on her shoulder >Hmm, I know I said that I would not do it again but I need to know what this does exactly and why I can store chakra into it. I can rack my brain around all day if I really wanted to but I do not have a clue as to why this blade can store chakra.< She would slowly start to channel her chakra into the handle of the blade in hopes of finding out what was going to happen once she did >Maybe I need to channel more into it since last time it was only a tiny bit of chakra.< Channeling her chakra into the blade she would make sure to only channel what she thought was enough as to not leave her exhausted like before. >Hmm.< she thought to herself >Nothing happened again.< Disappointed with the result she would seal the blade back into her coat and began to meditate to regain the chakra she had channeled into the blade.* - Fri Oct 23 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) reached into her backpouch and unleased a white blade which she held with one hand at first then looked at Arata "Are you just going to stand there white?" she questioned him as she began to walk toward him but it was clear that she wanted to get to the shore. Assuming she made it past Arata she would begin charging toward a nearby tree that had alot of cut markings on it >This blade should always feel lighter after every time practice with Hiramekarei.< she thought to herself as she thrusted the blade into the tree bark right at the center of an X marking she had previously made on it.

Pulling the blade out she pivoted to the right causing her to spin which allowed for a quick slash against the tree trunk then brought her blade up in a diagonal slash then jumped back twice and looked at the work she had done on the tree >Sloppy.< she thought to herself as she brought the blade up again infront of her and took in a deep breath. >Contol your breathing, watch the target. Anticipate any movements that the opponent might make. Pay attention to the enviorment, focus your senses. Then strike.< She would move fast toward the tree and aimed to bring the blade down on one of the branches and once the blade made contact she added in extra amounts of strength to make the blow cut through the branch.

Once the branch was cut from the tree she quickly shifted the blade in her hands to the point where it was pointing toward the tree and brought it in for a thrust into the tree itself. Using suimen to latch onto the tree she retracted the blade and slashed twice in a diagonal way forming another X on the tree. Once she had done that she would push off the tree doing a backflip and landing on her feet, using the downward momentum from the drop she would crouch and used her legs as springs to rush at the tree again. Slashing twice horizontaly  she would jump back twice once again and examined the blade to see if it was still sharp. Carefully she ran her finger through the edge of the balde to inspect its sharpness.

Once the balde had cut into her glove she knew that the blade just like Baen had said was 'sharp as shit.' >Impressive.< she thought to herself as she looked up at the tree as she breathed in steadily >I need to watch my stamina, I am getting very tired from doing this so I figure I only have about two more attacks.< she told herself as she gripped the sword with both hands and adjusted her grip on the blade >Go.< she told herself as she charged at the tree again. She knew that the tree was not going to fight back but she wanted to get a feel for how the blade felt in her hand as she knew that she could develop a fighting style from this as she blade was light, durable and very sharp from what she could tell with the tests she was putting the blade through.

Once at the tree she arrived with a thrust which was followed by a horizontal slice then a vertical one >Faster.< she told herself as she used suimen to stick to the tree >You need to do this faster, stronger, harder!< It was at that moment when she realized that just using the blade wouldn't be enough as that is what the opponents would be looking at so she jumped off the tree and spun around holding the blade up with one hand as every spin cut into the tree. When she landed she would deliver a sweeping kick toward the tree followed by a horizontal slice ther another kick. Under normal circumstances she would have been injured by kicking something as solid as a tree but her body was tougher than it seemed and this would be proven by the fact that she did not even wince in pain as her feet impacted the tree. Once she ran out of stamina she would topple over and layed on the ground staring at the sky panting heavily >Fuck, it would seem that I only had enough in me for one more try.< she thought to herself as she layed there with her eye closed panting heavily.* - Fri Oct 23 04:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Arrived at the waterfall again and unsealed the Hiramekarei from her coat >Today will be a good day.< she told herself as she took a deep breath of fresh air and turned her body to look at the tree that had multiple markings on it from her pracitce with the Carmelia blade that Baen had given him. Bringing the blade about she would hold both handles of the blade and began to channel her chakra slowly into the balde >I still don't know why I am doing this for but I guess I will find out eventually.< Continueing to channel her chakra into the blade she could feel that her body slowly becoming more and more exhausted as she was slowly but surely placing most of her chakra into the blade >Damn.< she thought to herself as she stopped the chakra flow.

Panting heavily she brough the blade down resting the tip of the blade on the water >Fuck I over did it.< she said to herself as she slowly walked toward the shore. Once at the shore she sat down on a path of grass and rested the balde on her shoulder and began to meditate >One day I will figure you out Hiramekarei and when that day comes I swear we will both be happy. If I am happy you are happy. You take care of me and I take care of you.< Chuckling once again she would shake her head and tapped Hiramekarei twice as she continued to meditate as she regained her chakra slowly >I may be losing my mind if I am talking to a blade that does not have a mind of its own like that one blade that Fujitora told me about but who cares. Hiramekarei is mine.<

After several moments of meditating and having a converstion with herself about the blade that was resting on her shoulder she would slowly push the blade away from her body and used it to stand up >I am not back at full strength but I can at least do more than I could have before.< Slowly bringing the blade up to chest height and breathed in slowly >Violet does pose a good point, fighting the enemy without looking at them is a good thing. Keeps me from falling pray to genjutsu and that is more than helpfull.< Clearing her mind of any throught she would slowly make her way toward the tree with Hiramekarei in hand and picked up speed as she went >Strike fast and hard. Do not give any sign of weakness, be ruthless with you strikes.< She would bring the blade up over her shoulder and prepared to swing at a nearby branch.

Bringing the blade down diagonally she would cut the tree branch then pivoted her body in a spining motion to cut the branch again only this time as it was falling. Dragging the tip of the blade on the ground she would come to a stop to look at her handy work then looked down at the blade itself >I would seriously like to understand how you work, why can you store chakra and if I could access said chakra. I will ask fujitora more about you when I see him again, I would really like to know what the purpose for your ability to store chakra.< She would pick up the blade and rested it on her shoulder >My arms are still killing me but at least I can now pick it up and give it a couple of swings which is nice and very convenient.<

Grabbing onto the blade handles she would sit down and began meditating for a few more moments before she began to slowly channel chakra into the blade again via the handles only this time she wouldn't channel a lot of chakra into the blade since well her previous attempts had resulted in her being exhausted to the point where she had to sleep to regain her strenght back >I should have asked Fujitora for more information before I took the blade. I am sure that I did ask him what the blade could do but he told me that I had to find out..that perv, if I would had more information on this I am sure that the use of this blade would be that much more easier.< She would let go of the handles and sealed the balde back into her coat.* - Fri Oct 23 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) Used Hiramekarei to slipt these niggers in half "Hiramekarei release!" by saying this she would cause the blade to release the chakra she had stored up and turned it into a long sword which she then proceeded to use to slipt these niggers in half.* - Fri Oct 23 16:49:29 2015
