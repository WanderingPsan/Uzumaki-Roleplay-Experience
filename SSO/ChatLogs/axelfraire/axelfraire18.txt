Then a bird landed on her shoulder with a message, she would reach up for it and read then closed it and placed it on her backpouch "Rebuilding this place will not be easy. Whatever destroyed it made a fine job at doing it so I do not expect you to return if you do not want to take in the work load required to do this job." she would scan around with her sensing capabilities around the area then continued "If we rebuild this place it will be different from what it was when the previous Mizukage's were in place. I will try to the best of my abilities to rebuild it so that this village was what it once was."* - Fri Oct  9 03:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) looked at the girl who had fallen before her and stood there staring at her. The girl would have thought that she found civilazation but inreality all she found was what was left of a village. As she crawled her way to the spot where she had landed she would have noticed that the streets and buildings were all in shambles, that there were decaying corpses on the streets due to the tailed beast going to town on the village so the girl chose the wrong place to crawl to.

Approaching the girl she would crouched down before her as she focused her sensing abilities on her and just really stared at her since she was no medic and there was not even a hospital the village thanks to the tailed beast that was unleashed when Koeki had died. "It must have been a hell of a journey." she commented to the girl as she continued to crouch "I wish I could help you, I really do but I am not a medical shinobi and at the moment the hospital has been destroyed so all I can really do is attempt to provide comfort to you with my word Genesis."

Kneeling down now she would attempt to place the girls head on her lap and wiped away the blood that was drooling from the girls mouth as she just stared at her waiting for her to pass in a quiet enviorment "I wish that I could do something to help you but I cannot." she repeated as she did not want the girls last moments to be of hate since she most likely came here to get some sort of treatment for her injuries. "You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went. You could swear, curse the fates, but when it comes to the end, you have to let go. "* - Fri Oct  9 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) brought her hand up to grab onto Genesis hand and held it as it touched her cheek as she could nothing but stare at her  >The world has really gone to shit.< she thought to herself as Elon entered her sensing range. "Elon." she called out to him as she continued to look at Genesis "Are you a medical shinobi?" she would ask him with sadness in her voice as she knew Genesis since her brother would always hit on her and miserably fail.* - Fri Oct  9 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) brought her hands down and grabed Genesis hands and brought them to her chest placing them one over the other as Elon spoke "Conserve your energy Genesis." she told her in an attempt to make her feel better since she could do nothing much for her at the moment "You will meet Kojiro where ever you are going Genesis. Save your strength for when you see him again. I am sure he will ask you to drink with him." She would take in a deep breath of air and exhaled it slowly as there was nothing that could be done for her at all unless someone decided to make a medic in Kirigakure and even then that was a long shot as they would not be expert medics or anything.* - Fri Oct  9 20:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) kneeled there waiting for that moment to come and when it did she simply sighed as Genesis had died on her lap >Fuck.< she thought to herself as yet another person she knew died. She would slowly move back grabing Genesis head carefully placing it down on the ground then stood up and walked to the side to pick up the body. Walking out of the destoryed academy yard she would make her way to where some of the bodies had been burried and began to dig a hole for her with a nearby shovel that was leaning on a tombstone >I have to burry yet another body.< she thought to herself as she made progress with the hole.

Once the grave was deep enough she would get out of the hole and pick up the body then proceeded to palce it in the hole she had just dug up "You are in a better place now Genesis, may Kojiro and you have peace." she said trying to sound deep and caring but nothing really came to mind as she had grown rather cold when it came to these things. Once the body was placed inside the whole she would climb out and began filling it up untill all the dirt that was dug up was back inside of the hole "Rest in peace Genesis." she muttered as she kept the shovel in her hand and turned around from the unmarked grave she had just dug up.* - Fri Oct  9 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Walked over and picked up what could be considered a makeshift shovel made out of some wooden and steel parts she had gathered in the piles of rubble from several days ago. Taking the shovel into her hand she would walk over to the nearest crater and began to slowly shovel sand and grabble back inside of it >What a mess.< she thought to herself as she pushed the shovel with her foot onto the pile of dirt and lifted it up to pour it into the crater >The world is a fucked up place, I have known this for a while but now even more so.<

Continueing with the process of pushing the shovel into the dirt then taking the dirt over to the crater and dumping it in she would begin to break into a sweat as she was not really used to doing physical labor but continued on doing it because well she was the Mizukage of a ruined village which may not have been the first thing for her to do but it was the right thing to do at least in her mind. As she continued to pour the sand and rubble into the crater she would step on the layers she had already set so that it would flatten a bit so that she could settle the next layer ontop of it.

>I really need to hire outside help...this is taking forever and it is just one crater...fuuuuckk.< Regardless of what she was thinking she would continue repeating the process she had been doing of placing sand into the hole, stepping on said sand and rock then dumping more sand and rocks into it. Soon she had entered a certain rythim that allowed her to do the job with relative ease as her body was now used to flowing through the motions of filling the hole up.

Once she was near completing her task she would stop to wipe the seat off her forehead and looked around the village to see it was still in much disrepair >When I get enough money I will hire people to come and fix this and to burry the bodies of the people that were killed.< Returning to filling the hole she would step on the final layer of sand and rock and walked over to the nearest pile of rocks and sat down on it to take a break from what she had been doing >Damn.< she thought to herself as she did not know it would be this hard to do a simple task * - Fri Oct  9 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) saw Misa as she entered her sensing range and stood up from where she was leaning against. She walked up to Hideki and looked at Misa "Resolve this peacefully." she told Misa who was aiming an arrow at Hideki "There has been wide spread death and destruction here already. I do not want to have to burry any more bodies." She would motion with her hands so that Misa could see the state the village was in as it was covered in rubble and bodies thanks to the tailed beast rampaging through the village "I know what Hideki has done, Genesis told me so please lower your bow."

She would keep her sensing abilities trained on the woman so that in the case that Misa would decide to release her arrow she would be able to react by either dodging or sending an ability to stop the arrow if need be as she did not want any more dead people in Kirigakure as the graveyard was already reaching its limits "Solve this peacefully please."* - Fri Oct  9 22:53:52 2015
