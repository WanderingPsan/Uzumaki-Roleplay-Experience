<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lulu(AxelFraire) brought her hands up to perform the Concealment handseals as she kneeded and molded her chakra inside of her stomatch. Bringing up the chakra through her stomach she would release it out of her mouth as a pearly white mist that would quickly cover the area dropping visibility by a considerable amount. She would reach into her coat and unsealed the Hiramekarei blade that she had sealed in there and waited for the enemies to enter the mist. She would wait there using her sensing abilities and extraordinary hearing to to wait for the enemy army to approach the area >Hold them off he said, kill as many troops as you please he said.< she would shake her head and waited for the enemy reinforcements to come to the aid of the village.

Once someone entered her sensing range she would wait for them to venture deep into the mist, once she was certain that there were enough people within the mist she would spring into attack mode and moved silently through the mist with Hiramekarei in hand. Using the assassination technique of her village she would thrust Hiramekarei into an unsuspecting soldiers back leaving a considerable gash on his body severing the spinal cord. Moving to keep on killing the men she would work as fast as she could given the current condition she was presented with >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she sliced the head off from another soldier >Why must things be this way.< she thought to herself as she jumped and stabbed another soldier in the chest leaving again a considerable gash where his chest was most likely rendering him useless.

After a few kills she would return to take cover within the mist as she was no one man army so the best she could do was resort to guerilla tactics with hit and run operations >Damn it.< she thought to herself as she tried to catch her breath >Fuck, fuck it all to hell.< she thought once again as she used her sensing abilities and extraordinary hearing to detect how many men were left alive and how many men were coming toward the misty area >I will get this done and make sure my village does not suffer any more.< she thought to herself trying to justify her actions >Another sin I must bare with.< She would look down at the bloodied Hiramekarei and shook her head >The least I could do is provide them with a swift death. They are only defending their country.<

After several moments of hiding in the mist she would once again engage in the guerilla tactics she was doing >Strike fast and strike hard.< she told herself >This is just like cutting into the wood of the tree back by the waterfall.< It was clear that she was looking for a way to make this more bareable for her since she was more or less dragged into this since her village was being threatened by Edge, the man who had killed koeki and caused Kirigakures distruction in the not to distant past. >Just get through this.< she told herself as she decapitated another unsuspecting soldier >Just get through this.<* - Sun Oct 25 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lulu(AxelFraire) hears the Kumogakure shinobi speak the name of her blade and makes sure to hunt them down first. Travelling through the mist she would use the Silent killing technique to make sure they would never speak the name of her blade again. Decapitating them, slicing them in half and splitting them in half she would jump on them like a cougar on the hunt of its prey >Why.< she thought to herself as she slashed her next victim >Why must things be like this?< it was at that moment that she snapped as her mind was trying to block out much of the senseless slaughter that was happening all around her. Hiding in the mist she would wait again to get the perfect opportunity to slaughter more Kumogakure soldiers jumping from one to the next leaving nothing but mingeled bodies in her wake.

pulling the blade out of a young Kumogakure soldier she would jump back into the mist and controlled her breathing and remained silent as this was what she did best. She was an assassin by trade and this was honing her skills more and more with each Kumogakure shinobi she killed. Deciding to switch things up a bit she would execute three handseals Ram ---> Snake ---> Tiger as she kneeded and molded her chakra inside of her stomatch. Opening her mouth she would expell the a black mist that would quickly intergrate itself with the existing mist and would follow the water cycle forming a cloud that would soon drop black rain droplets upon the Kumogakure Shinobi that were fighting. Moving the cloud around she would make sure that a large number of shinobi were drenched with the black liquid that those unfamiliar with the Suiton element would not know what it was as this technique was not common to anyone outside Kirigakure.

Closing her mouth she would back away a considerable distance and brought her hands out with her fingers pressed against each other and focused chakra onto them "Burn." she simply said in a cold hearted voice as she snapped her fingers causing the chakra that was focusing on them to ignite. Two fireballs formed from this action and these fireballs would shoot out toward the nearest area drenched with the black droplets resulting in a chain reaction as that black liquid turned out to be oil and if anyone know what happens to oil when lit on fire they would know that it would case a fire. Burning anything that had the oil on them she would continue snapping her fingers causing more fireballs to come out of them

Ceasing the barage of fireballs she would remain dormant in the mist as she entered a pseudo meditative state so that she could regain some of her lost chakra and stamina. With her mind gone blank there was nothing she could of thought of other than killing as her body entered an automated fight or flight trance since her basic insticts over rode logic. Once she had regained enough chakra she would move through the mist and smoke from the fire to continue beheading people using her villages special assassination technique and the blade that had been given to her by Fujitora. One after another the soldiers fell as they were unaware of her presense due to the fact that she was moving silentely throughout the comotion. Reaching into her back now she would pull out a white blade that was made out of Baen bone structure. The balde would be short in nature so it allowed her to dual wield the weapons without a problem only this blade was made for thrusting instead of cutting so as she would cut one soldier with the Hiramekarei she would thrust the Camelia blade into another increasing her killing rate exponentially.

Running back to hide in the mist she would focus her sensing abilities on the area around her to determine who her next targets should be. Idealy she would attack the reinforcements but they had not arrived yet so she would focus down the Raiton users. Taking advantage of the cover of the mist she would regain her stamina and chakra bit by bit before she decided to strike at the Raiton users. Beheading a soldier from behind  she would stab another one through the chest and continue on with the carnage. Being a sensory type shinobi she would be aware when someone was about to use a technique so she would target them as she did not want two things to happen. One, have them use ninjutsu. Two, have them use ninjutsu that could potentially damage her and cause injury.* - Sun Oct 25 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lulu(AxelFraire) gathered up the remaining troops using the troops that Edge had left her with and made a circle around them trapping where they were preventing their escape. She would point the Hiramekarei at them and the shinobi around her would attack the corraled shinobi "Remember, No Mercy." she would say cold heartedly as she joined in the attack using Hiramekarei and the Camelia blade to kill them with. Slashing one after another Kumogakure shinobi she would get splattered with blood as her weaponry continued to cut down Kumogakure troops left and right. Bringing Hiramekarei to rest on her shoulder as she pulled the Camelia blade from a Kumogakure Shinobi's eye she would look around her as she focused her sensing abilities on the area where she was and on the area  around her looking for more shinobi to slaughter. The troops around her would continue to mercilessly kill the beaten shinobi without any trouble at all since well they were winning and she had given the no mercy order to them.

"Cry Havoc' said he who fought chaos with chaos 'And let slip the dogs of war." was all she said as she moved to join in on the hunt attempting to wipe out the beaten shinobi as she was kicking them when they were down. Holstering her Camelia blade away she focused solely on using the Hiramekarei again using it to behead, slash, maim and thrust people ending their life be it on the spot or by blood loss. Once she would no more shinobi to slaughter she would begin dragging the mangled bodies of the shinobi she had killed and would make a pile out of them, sitting on the pile when it was big enough she would rest the bloodied Hiramekarei blade on her shoulder and awaited the reinforcements to arrive through the mist. Keeping her senses on full alert she would wait for them to come as that is the instruction she had been told.* - Sun Oct 25 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lulu(AxelFraire) walked into the Area with her clothing full of blood as well as the blade she carried on her back. She would stare blankly at the two and appochaed them as she did a barage of handseals "Cry Havoc." she told them as she looked at Maloth getting ready to unleash her jutsu "Get away from him." she instructed as she kneeded and molded chakra inside of her stomach. Anyone with sensing abilities would be able to tell that she was molding her chakra.* - Sun Oct 25 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lulu(AxelFraire) spat out water from her mouth that began to encase Maloth in a sphere of water. Holding her right hand out she would touch the water holding the jutsu inplace as she kept her sensing abilities focused on those around the area since she did not want to get killed, at least not today. Considering that Maloth was asleep he would have no time to hold his breath so he would slowly begin to drown in his sleep and given the consistency of the water he would be unable to move.* - Sun Oct 25 04:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) Reached the waterfall and unsealed the blade from her coat and held the blade in her hand and just stared at the blade >I have sold Kirigakure to the devil...I had no choice. If I did not go along with him he would have destroyed Kirigakure like he said he would. He killed Koeki for fucks sakes.< she would extend the blade out infront of her and sighed >I need to contact someone. Hassan? Fujitora? Who? I cannot go along with this man. We will be severely out maned by the villages.< she would take a vertical swing with her blade then turned it sideways to do a horizontal cut through the air. Bringing the blade back she would swap hands and continued the swing and she brought the blade up over her hand and pivoted to the right continueing the swing with one swift and fluid motion.

Continueing along with the motion she would stop the blade infront of her with her arm extended foward >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she was more than displeased with the situation at hand >Why now? Why now of all times? I knew that something bad was coming my way and now I know what it was.< she would shake head and continues on with the motions of her swings. Bringing the blade up over her head she would grab both hilts and brought the blade down to splash against the water then would bring it up over hear head again and repeated the same slice she had just done >Why.< she thought to herself >Why, why, why, why, why!< she repeated as she swung the blade over and over again in frustration >I don't want to have to do this. I don't want to see anyone suffer. I don't want my village or my villagers to suffer any more.<

Breathing heavily and rapidly she would drop to her knees as she focused her chaka on her knees so that she would not sink to the bottom of the lake. >Why..why couldn't things be peaceful. Why couldn't things stay the same? Why did they have to be like this? I do not understand any of it.< it was clear that she would be struggling to understand why things were happening the way they were happening >I had no choice, they will surely understand that I did it for them. I cannot let anyone know.< Slowly bringing her head up she would start to rise up onto her feet and held the blade tightly with one hand as she brought her other hand up to rub her eye as she sensed two people near her. Bringing the blade up over her head she would seal the balde onto the back of her coat and looked at the two people that were at the edge of the lake.* - Sun Oct 25 18:01:10 2015

If you can catch them off guard then that is the best time to use this technique."

Using her other hand to grab onto the other handle she would begin to channel her chakra into the blade slowly as she did not want to pass out from chakra exhaustion. She would look over to the right as she sensed Zenaki  and stared at her for a while "Hmmm." she hummed as she was channeling chakra into the blade "What brings you to my humble village." she asked her as she held the blade with both hands. If Zenaki was a sensor she would have been able to tell that the blade had a relative big amount of chakra stored up inside of it and that chakra was running through her hands onto the blade handles and into the blade itself.* - Mon Oct 26 15:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) (*Lulu brought her hands up to perform the Concealment handseals as she kneeded and molded her chakra inside of her stomatch. Bringing up the chakra through her stomach she would release it out of her mouth as a pearly white mist that would quickly cover the area dropping visibility by a considerable amount. She would reach into her coat and unsealed the Hiramekarei blade that she had sealed in there and waited for the enemies to enter the mist. She would wait there using her sensing abilities and extraordinary hearing to to wait for the enemy army to approach the area >Hold them off he said, kill as many troops as you please he said.< she would shake her head and waited for the enemy reinforcements to come to the aid of the village.

Once someone entered her sensing range she would wait for them to venture deep into the mist, once she was certain that there were enough people within the mist she would spring into attack mode and moved silently through the mist with Hiramekarei in hand. Using the assassination technique of her village she would thrust Hiramekarei into an unsuspecting soldiers back leaving a considerable gash on his body severing the spinal cord. Moving to keep on killing the men she would work as fast as she could given the current condition she was presented with >Fuck.< she thought to herself as she sliced the head off from another soldier >Why must things be this way.< she thought to herself as she jumped and stabbed another soldier in the chest leaving again a considerable gash where his chest was most likely rendering him useless.

After a few kills she would return to take cover within the mist as she was no one man army so the best she could do was resort to guerilla tactics with hit and run operations >Damn it.< she thought to herself as she tried to catch her breath >Fuck, fuck it all to hell.< she thought once again as she used her sensing abilities and extraordinary hearing to detect how many men were left alive and how many men were coming toward the misty area >I will get this done and make sure my village does not suffer any more.< she thought to herself trying to justify her actions >Another sin I must bare with.< She would look down at the bloodied Hiramekarei and shook her head >The least I could do is provide them with a swift death. They are only defending their country.<

After several moments of hiding in the mist she would once again engage in the guerilla tactics she was doing >Strike fast and strike hard.< she told herself >This is just like cutting into the wood of the tree back by the waterfall.< It was clear that she was looking for a way to make this more bareable for her since she was more or less dragged into this since her village was being threatened by Edge, the man who had killed koeki and caused Kirigakures distruction in the not to distant past. >Just get through this.< she told herself as she decapitated another unsuspecting soldier >Just get through this.<*) (REPOST OIR)* - Mon Oct 26 16:47:21 2015
