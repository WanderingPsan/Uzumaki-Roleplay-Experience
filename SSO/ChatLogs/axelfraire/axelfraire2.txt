<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) With the siege on Kirigakure and all that had happened in the village she was more determined to get what she needed and leave the village since she felt she did not owe anything to it, with that being said she would make her way down to the dock she used to always hang around in as silently as she could only to see that it was not the same as the water had been poisoned. >Tch.< she thought to herself as she stood on the edge of the dock >Bastards ruined my favorite spot.< she would say to herself and turned around to find a new spot.* - Tue Sep 15 11:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Having spent the past days walking on the balls of her feet she was used to it now and no longer had balance issues but she was still by no means good at making no sound as she traveled along the area. >Why must this happen?< she asked herself as she was rather bothered that this would affect her even though she knew it was a war and that is what happens in wars >Ones I get what I need out of this village I will leave without even looking back, and I will make sure to make no sound as I am leaving.< * - Tue Sep 15 11:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) With more motivation to achieve her goal she decided to use that hard working characteristic she used to learn and master her jutsus. Running down the streets she avoided the rubble if any to avoid making noise as she went along >I will leave this village and go off on my own, people are just too untrust worthy being selfish people. Why must there be war? Why must people die over another persons ideals? I am sure that there are easy answers to these questions but I refuse to hear or know them as I do not want to be involved with any of this. Just get what you need a leave, walk right out of the village."* - Tue Sep 15 11:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Counting each noise she would make she noticed that it had reduced by a small amount but even then that showed improvement and this added more fuel to her burning fire motivating her even more to continue making progress >When I get out of here I will live a quiet life, interact only when I need the bare essentials that way I reduce the risk of being dragged into conflict I do not necesarily want to participate in. If I am going to risk my life I will risk it for something that is worth while not some petty ideals.<* - Tue Sep 15 11:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After running around zig-zagging and jumping from one place to the other she decided to take a break for the day as she did not know if there would be another attack or not and she was sure as hell not going to stay out in the open in case there was one >Tch, pisses me off.< she thought to herself as she looked around the village >Just a couple more weeks and I am long gone out of here.< she told herself trying to convince herself that what she was doing was the best thing she could do for her own good.* - Tue Sep 15 11:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) still on the look out for the continuation of the siege she made her way out of where she was staying and looked at the sky then looked in all four general directions as one could never be too sure or too cautions when it came to a siege. >I should probably help these people but then I would be involving myself further into this villages afairs.< she told herself so she made her way down the street making very little noise by this point in time as she had gotten used to walking on the balls of her feet and she had gained a better situational awareness.* - Tue Sep 15 16:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Making her way down toward the academy she would stop and looked around >Staying inland is the best choice as well the waters are poisoned, that being said if there is an aerial bombardment staying near the shore or unpopulated areas would be best since those are less likely to get targeted.< she brought her hand up to her chin and thought for a moment then decided to make her way to a less populated area of Kirigakure. As she moved she would keep count of every noise she would make as she traveled along.* - Tue Sep 15 16:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Passing through the farmlands she would shake her head as they would most likely be withering away due to the lack of water thanks to the attack that Amegakure had done >Such a waste.< she thought to herself as she jumped to avoid stepping on a patch of leafs >All of these war efforts should be focused on peace and prosperity. Well not even that since there can be no true peace, it should be focused on something else other than this.< It was more than clear that she disliked being in a situation like this since it affected her in terms of potentially shortening her life span.* - Tue Sep 15 16:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Ran across a bridge but ran on the safely guard using suimen to get through as this would make a considerable less noise than crossing it the conventional way. Roaming around the village only helped her to be more determined to get accomplish her goals as fast as possible, she was making progress in the stealth department but she was by no means near the level she wanted to be at  but it was still better than nothing as she would much rather be where she was currently at than back at where she had started >You gotta take what you have and move foward.< she told herself as she continued to make her way around the village using Suimen to run up a wall stopping on a rooftop watching over some of the village.* - Tue Sep 15 16:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Making her way across the rooftops of the village provided a challenge since there were some rooftop tiles that would get lose and fall off to the ground causing noise as they fell and when they hit the floor but she quickly worked her way around this problem as she simply walked though the center of the roof where the tiles were relatively more secure and could be caught or stoped in case the tile actually did loosen up. After making her way across a large number of housed she decided to hop down onto the street and decided to call it a day as she had grown tired of running around the village.* - Tue Sep 15 16:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) exited the place where she had been staying and looked up again to make sure nothing was dropping on her general area and ones she was satisfied that she was safe she would proceed to head toward the academy making very little to no noise at all as she went foward. With her new found lightness she was more confindent with the way she walked as she was pleased with her progress, she had set out to better herself and she accomplished it which really fed her ego and her hard working attitude.* - Tue Sep 15 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >This is good.< she thought to herself as she had no problem dodging the noise hazards that were in her way >This is just a small stepping stone in the grand scheme I have planed for myself, next up is to master the Suiton and Katon element. I know it is more easily said than done but I have proven that it is possible with a lot of effort and dedication.< Arriving at the square she saw that there was hardly anyone there >Odd.< she thought to herself as she turned around and headed for the dock she always hung around in.* - Tue Sep 15 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arriving at the bridge she had very little trouble crossing it without making a single sound as she passed through the wooden safety rail with Suimen and her newly aquired lightness >Tch I remember when I was unable to cross this bridge without making a single sound, feels soooo good to know that I have progressed and that I can now cross this bridge as silently as I want.< After crossing the bridge she went down the street moving gracefuly across the street dodging all the noise hazards until she arrived at the dock and stood infront of it looking at the water.* - Tue Sep 15 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) sighing heavily she turned around and went toward the center of the village as the sight of the poisoned water really seemed to upset her. Climbing up a tree using suiment she reached the highest branch with relative ease as she looked over some of the village then jumped to the nearest rooftop and made her way to where she had been staying >Hmm I wonder why the square was empty, it usually never is but now there was not a single soul there.< she would make her way across the rooftops avoiding to make sound.* - Tue Sep 15 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) jumping from rooftop to rooftop she made her way toward the palce she had been staying in >I should really set up some sort of water supply to help out the people or something, but then again, if I do that then well I will be involved with them and I really do not want to be associated any more than I have to with this village since I plan on leaving it and if someone would to miss me that would be a problem.< Sighing she shook her head and entered her home locking the door behind her.* - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015

With her index finger she engraved a seal into the backpouch and placed the kunai on it and sealed it inside. She clearly was a strong independant woman that don't need no man to seal her things for her....She would place the backpouch back on and continued to glare at him.* - Tue Sep 15 17:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) watched from a distance as she saw the fiery dragon head form >Impressive.< she thought to herself as she stepped closer to Ozui "I see, that can really come in handy." she commented as she walked up next to him and did the six handseals it takes to execute the Fire Ball Jutsu Tiger ---> Ram ----> Monkey ---> Boar ---> Horse ---> Tiger and inhaled in a vast amount of air then exhaled it mixing it in with her Katon natured chakra causing a giant Fire Ball to shoot foward crashing down into the lake far away from them.* - Tue Sep 15 23:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) formed the Tiger handseal and inhaled a vast amount of air untill her lung capacity was full. While this was going on she kneeded her chakra inside her stomatch then sent it up toward her trachea then exhaled the air out causing it to ignite and form a badly mishapen thing. Since this was her first time trying it she could not get the shape of the dragons head down beacuse well she was no Katon elemental user master but none the less she did not let this stop her from trying as she was used to always getting what she wanted whenever she put her mind into it.

After the fire ball she had created exploded in the distance she would try one more time. >Get it right this time Kirie, visualize the dragon's head before you and send it foward just like he did.< Inhaling air one more time she would she repeated the same process she did a few minutes ago and exhaled the air causing it to ignite infront of her forming a dragons head that shot out foward. Given the speed and general ability were lacking but she had done it and was rather pleased with herself for it.* - Tue Sep 15 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) watched as he did the handseal that was associated with the technique >So that is the handseal.< she thought to herself as she watched as a stream of flames would shot from his mouth and was impressed "Interesting." she commented as she watched the flames displace the water "Ok my turn." she commented yet again as she did the handseal Ozui had done and held it as she breathed in. Holding the Tiger Handseal she would exhale the air after she had kneeded her chakra inside her stomatch and shot out a flame but it was no where near the same intesity as the flame Ozui had demonstrated.

>Hmm.< she thought to herself rather displeased "Ok one more time." she muttered to herself as she held the Tiger handseal and breathed in air until her lungs were ful then exhaled it after kneeding her chakra. The end result would be a that of a compressed flame shooting outward stoping a short distance away from them, feeling please with herself she would let out a smile then looked at Ozui "I did it." she said rather happily as she waited for him to demonstrate what else he had to offer her.* - Tue Sep 15 23:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) stood a little bit back as she saw this since it was the first time she saw something like this "Ohhhh." she said amazed by the feat Ozui had done "What is that?" she asked with a voice full of curiocity.* - Tue Sep 15 23:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) reached into her backpouch and unleased the Kunai she had sealed in there and extended it out infront of her. She would look at Ozui then looked down at the kunai and began to focus her chakra into the weapon >So visualize it going up in flames.< she thought to herself as she focused more and more chakra into it trying to replicate what Ozui had done. >Damn.< she thought to herself as she seemed to be struggling reproducing what had Ozui did "This is harder than it looks." she commented as she stopped the chakra flow into the kunai and took in a deep breath.

Exhaling out the air she was more determined to accomplish the task at hand. She would focus her chakra into the weapon focusing more and more into it >Focus more into it.< she thought to herself >Just make it go up in flames.< she thought to herself yet again as the chakra that was being poured into the weapon began to manifest itself as the metal began to turn red then sowly but surely small flames would begin to manifest themselves, first in the tip then it began to spread throughout the kunai.* - Tue Sep 15 23:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) nodded ones then went around placing the tags near the corners of the house placing them on the ground. >So place these down around the house then place the last one on the house...Hmm.< She would make her way around the house placing each tag near the corner of the house then walked up to the front door and placed the tag on it "So now that do I do?" she asked him rather confused "Do I emit my chakra through all the tags? Or just this one? Is it going to transmit it to the other ones?" it was clear that she had a lot of questions but still decided to give it a try. Extending her palm out she sent chakra onto the tag but nothing seemed to be happening "Is this normal?" she asked him.

Waiting for her answer she decided to give it one more try >Hmm just emit my chakra through the tag.< she told herself over and over again as she brought her hand closer to the tag to see if that would help out with the situation.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) stood there waiting for somehting to happen.* - Wed Sep 16 01:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: These jutsu are not very detailed.. - Wed Sep 16 01:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I think you both would want for me to master these first. - Wed Sep 16 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) turned her head to look at Yan who had called her name and winked at her "Huh?" she would be rather confused by this but then she became startled as she saw many Yans suddenly start poping up from the ground around her "..What the fuck?" she muttered to herself as she took a couple of steps back. When she noticed them lunging at her she would quickly execute the Tiger handseal and breathed in as much air as her lungs would allow her to, this of course would serve to execute her jutsu. Letting the air escape her she would create a steady stream of flames that she would direct in a semi circle infront of her. Of course she did not intend to hurt anyone it was just a natural reaction she had to being attacked by a lot of Yans.* - Wed Sep 16 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) saw that they were multiplying so she decided to stop the stream of flames as this was only really making the situation worse >How can this be.< she thought to herself as she avoided any incoming Yans >I know I am not proficient with the Katon element but they should have at least been burnt...instead they multiplied...Which one is the real one? Do they multiply by simply touching the-< and just like that her train of thought was disrupted as she saw beasts among the crowd of shinobi >When did they get there?< she asked herself as she found it extremely odd that beasts would be among the shinobi in a closed off island.

She would stop what she was doing and executed the Tiger handseal and send a quick burst of chakra into her head trying to get rid of the genjutsus she had been placed under since she came to the deduction that the sudden appearance of beasts was odd and highly unlikely considering the location they all were in.* - Wed Sep 16 02:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: And to make a fire proof glove, you'd need leather..Clay, some more clay...Steel...Another glove for the layer..Soak into water for a few days before applying the final layer, then seal it with tree sap.. - Wed Sep 16 02:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's been a very long day. - Wed Sep 16 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) executed a single handseal and poofed away.* - Wed Sep 16 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arrived at the dock she used to always hang out in and would stand on the edge of it looking at the water that was infront of her >After a successful day of leeching I now need to start improving my abilities.< she thought to herself as she was so so very pleased at the amount of jutsus she had leeched yesterday.She brought one hand up to her chest with two fingers up as she did the same with the other hand but this one was placed above her head forming the Concealment handseal, kneeding and molding her chakra inside of her stomatch she would turn it into a pearly white mist that would exit through her mouth.* - Wed Sep 16 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Releasing the pearly white mist she would wait untill most of the area was covered in a thick mist >Hmmm now I need to work on staying concealed.< she told herself as she would try and blend in if you will with the mist but this was no easy task since she was just a regular person and not someone born with a certain cunning for this type of situation. She would move silently through the mist but well she really did not know if she was doing it properly or not so she stopped moving and brought her hands up infront of her to form the Clone handseal and split her chakra evenly to form a clone of herself.* - Wed Sep 16 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) "Very well me, you will help me out with this. If you can see me let me know that was I can see if I am improving or not ok?" it was kind of wierd and odd to be talking to herself but it was a necessary thing to do since well she would only really trust herself in this situation. Her clone nodded and stood there watching her activating Suimen to stand in the water to get a better view of her movements "Ready when you are." said the clone to Kirie who now began to move silently through the mist and hoped that her clone would not detect her as she moved.* - Wed Sep 16 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) "You are moving too fast." said the clone as she saw a disturbance in the mist as she moved along "You need to think of how the mist is moving and how the wind if affecting it." she would give out pointers to her original self "Think about it this way, if the mist is going right you do not want to be going left." which was an obvious statement since well that is the easiest way to be discovered. Hearing her clone speak she decided to take her advice for it and looked at the way her own mist was moving through the place she had casted it.* - Wed Sep 16 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >So watch the movement of the mist, move accordingly...move fast and silently.< Looking down at her clothing she did not know if it was the right type of clothing for the situation as it was blue with white fur. In a way it might be able to help her blend in due to the water related color but that would have to be seen in battlle to see if her clothing would actually work against her. Dissipating the mist she would walk over to her clone "Thanks, that was a lot of help actually." Releasing the clone having it go up in a puff of smoke she regained the chakra that the clone didnt use and would head home as she was calling it a day.* - Wed Sep 16 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..... - Wed Sep 16 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arriving at the lake again she would execute the clone handseal and made a clone of herself "Same thing as yesterday." she told the clone as she did the Concealment handseal and sent out a pearly white mist that quickly covered the area where she and her clone stood "Remember point out anything and everything you find wrong." The clone moved foward onto the water using Suimen to stand ontop of it and watched as her original self prepared to move around in the mist and see if her abilities while within the mist had gotten better.* - Wed Sep 16 19:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Stood still as she thought about how to properly achieve the objective at hand. She would close her eyes and begin thinking >Take the mist density into consideration, observe the way the mist moves and move along with it. Move silently without making any rash movements, study the layout of the field.< Her clone standing there waiting to spot something within the mist would continue to stand there as her original self continued to think about how she could remain undetected within the mist. >There are several problems here, if any sensors were around they would be able to spot me without a problem so I have to do something about my chakra signature.<* - Wed Sep 16 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) As she stood there she would be thinking of many ways to improve on her technique as she listed everything that she thought she would need. It would be a rather extensive list of things to do and get but she knew that given enough time she would accomplish them as she had accomplished everything she had set out to do so far. Opening her eyes she began to move through the mist carefully as to not cause any noise trying to stay near the thickest parts of the mist. It is also worth noting that the fog would be aided by the natural fog that existed within the Hiden Mist Village.* - Wed Sep 16 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Her clone would be standing in the middle of the fog keeping her eyes peeled to try and spot her original self and to be honest it was not that hard to do since she was no stealth expert yet. "You are moving to fast." said the clone "You are going against the flow of the mist, You made noise there." she would give her constructive criticism on how to improve her abilities of traveling within the mist and the most effective way she could remain hidden within it. It would have probably been easier for her to get someone to teach her but she honestly did not know many people that used this jutsu other than Tethys whom she had given the jutsu to.* - Wed Sep 16 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Calling it a day she made the mist she had created disapper then dispelled her clone gaining everything that her clone had seen and done. >Hmmmm.< she thought to herself as she began walking back to her home >So I still have a long way to go before I can properly do this.< she continued thinking to herself as she slowly made her way toward her home reviewing everything the clone had gathered while she was doing this with her >I need to get the a better feel for this.< she thought to herself a final time as she opened the door to her home and entered it.* - Wed Sep 16 19:12:12 2015

Once she realized who it was she would sigh and bring them back toward the dock letting them go "Don't ever do that again." she warned him as she really did not want anyone touching her specially not her head or hair.* - Wed Sep 16 22:00:19 2015
