<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Stand there watching since there is nothing much to do really.* - Mon Sep 07 15:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) arrives at the gate and stands there staring foward as she watches people come and go into the village >Hmm I've never noticed how many people come and go.< she thought to herself as she watched other shinobi giving inspections to the arriving people >I guess its so that they wont sneak anything in?< she thought to herself as the train of thought began to roll as she stood there watching the people.

>It seems like a nice peaceful village specially now that Tethys has collected four of the seven legendary blade. I wonder where the other three are? Are they lost somewhere in the world? Or are they in possession of someone from another village? Hmm so many questions so little answers.< she thought to herself as she continued to watch people leaving and entering the village and watched as the people entering the village were getting inspected to make sure that they would not be smuggling something into the village.

She would continue to stand there at the gate watching people go in and out over and over again since Kiragakure was one of the safest villages out there so there really wouldn't be any attack or anyone trying anything since it would be guaranteed suicide for them if they did which even though it was good for her made the mission all that much more boring since she would not be able to test out her skills in actual combat or a combat like situation.

As time went by she stood there at the gate making small talk with the soldiers and some people that she thought were interesting but aside from that nothing really happened while she was there >Hmm what a boring mission, I would much rather be chasing down someones pet than be here doing nothing. I could be practicing my jutsu but nope I am stuck here on gate duty doing nothing and I do not want to reveal my jutsu since well yeah I dont want anyone knowing what I can or cant do.< she thought to herself as she let out a long and rather loud sigh.

Letting her hair down from the pony tail she had it in she would begin to examine her it more specifically she began to examine the tips of her hair to make sure they did not have split ends >So far so good, if this keeps up I wont have to get it cut which is a good thing.< she thought to herself as she continued to examine it since this had becomed more interesting than standing guard since I mean really who is going to attack the most prosperous village out there. Only a fool or someone that had a very large army would there to attempt such a feat.

When she was done examening her hair she would tie it up in a pony tail ones more and returned to stand there doing nothing but the only difference now was that she had grown hungry. Placing a hand over her stomatch she would look around trying to spot a place where she could get something to eat >Hmm.. well I mean it would only make sense for there to be a place to get something to eat near the entrance to the village right? I mean if someone comes in hungry you would expect them to be able to eat something right?< she would look around for a while more from where she stood since she did not want to abandon her post.

Spotting a Takoyaki stand relatively near her position she walked over there taking her sweet time since well nothing was going to happen on this mission and she just really wanted nothing more than to get it over with. Arriving at the stand she ordered two orders of Takoyaki and turned to look at the gate in case anything happened she could there quickly. After several minutes had gone by the stand owner handed an order then began to prepare the other batch.

Taking a bite out of one of the Takoyaki balls she would continue to watch the gate "Hmm these are quite good." she commented so that the owner of the stand could hear he "Really good actually." she continued saying as she was eating another ball "They also smell delicious by the way I am sure that you have alot of clients." she would begin to make small talk with the shop owner for a long time as she actually did enjoy the Takoyaki balls and since the conversation was more interesting that the actual mission she stayed there for a long time enjoying several more orders of Takoyaki before she returned to the gate.

Once she returned to the gate well she went back to doing what she was doing before, nothing. She really did nothing other than stand there waiting for Tethtys to come and get her but he seemed to be taking his sweet time getting to her >Damn this is a very boring mission I mean why do we even need to guard the gate? This is the safest village out there and unless someone wants to march an army to the front gate then yes send people to guard it but not when there is literally nothing to do other than just stand here doing nothing watching people go in and out of the village.

Alas after what seemed to be an eternity Tethys came to take her post and she went back to where everyone liked to gather as she wanted to meet her quota for social interaction >Hmm I should ask that guy to teach me Suiton jutsus.< she thought to herself as she was making her way toward the hang out spot. Once she arrived the she would look for him, if he was there she would approach him and ask for lessons and if not then it would have to wait untill she found him again.* - Mon Sep 07 22:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arrived at the dock and kneeled down to take her shoes off, when she did she sat on the dock with her legs hanging over the edge >Hmm well better get started since I have nothing better to really do.< she told to herself as she watched the way the water moved >Hmm.< she thought to herself as she continued watching >Water is a really wonderful thing.< she continued on with her train of thought as she sat there swinging her legs over the dock.* - Tue Sep 08 00:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After several moments of watching how the water flowed withing the space it was confined in she brought her hands together infront og her chest and began to focus her chakra >Hmmm the only liquid I have within my body that can be used as a substitute for water is my saliva.< she told herself as she was a rather smart girl >Now I just have to manage to change and enhance my saliva in a way so that I can be able to create water to execute water related jutsus.< she stated what seemed to be the obvious to her.* - Tue Sep 08 00:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >Now the only question is how to do that? How would I go about that? Do I just focuse my chakra on my salivia? Will that do the trick? Hmm this will honestly be better if I had a teach. I am pretty sure I would be able to get it down in no time.< She continued to focus her chakra and started sending some to her mouth where she would focus it on her saliva but would not really know what to do next as she was rather inexperienced with the elemental affinity she wanted to do.* - Tue Sep 08 00:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After several moments had gone by she still had her chakra inside her mouth trying to do something to her saliva but well it was not doing anything >God damn it.< she thought to herself as she broke the Tiger handseal and continued to watch the water >What are your secrets.< she thought to herself pretty much asking the water >One day I will be able to use you whenever I feel like it.< it would look rather pathetic if she would to say that outloud as she really did not want people seeing her talking to the water.* - Tue Sep 08 00:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Bringing her legs back up to the dock she placed her shoes on and stood up bringing her hands up over her head to stretch her arms as she watched the water one last time >I swear I will master you.< she told herself as she turned around and walked toward the nearest tree and leaned against it. This tree would give her a perfect view of the lake/sea/river that was located by the dock >I really need a teacher.< she told herself before she moved onto another thing she had to do.* - Tue Sep 08 00:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After she left the dock she went into a near by forest >Hmmm now onto fire.< she told herself as she looked around spotting several fallen leafs and picked one up and observed it >If I can manage to set this on fire that would be great.< she said to herself as she sat down on the grass >Now think what can cause fire? There is lightning that can cause fire if it strikes something, ummmm what else friction that can cause fire as well umm intense heat that can burn some dried up plants.< the train of thought would go on for several moments more.* - Tue Sep 08 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After she was done thinking of all the things that could possibly cause a fire she discarted most of them as out of all those things as there was no possible way she could conduct a lightning strike to cause a fire. She opted for trying to generate enough heat using her chakra to start a fire using several of the dried up plants that were around the area and gathered them up in a nice little pile infront of her >Hmmm now what to do? I really need a teacher for this as well.< she told herself as she looked at the pile of plants and began thinking.* - Tue Sep 08 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Opting for the most convenient solution to the task at hand she would extend her palms out and began to focus her chakra onto the on them. She hoped to heat up the air around her palms to the point where they would begin to burn the driend up plants but that was a long shot as she was just starting out >Hmmm how much chakra do I even need to place into this? I am guessing that if I do not place enough chakra into it I will not be able to heat the air up but then if I place too much I might end up over heating it and just well I mean that might work.< * - Tue Sep 08 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Sending more chakra into her palms she would hope that would do the trick but after several minutes had gone by she did not noticed a change with anything >Hmmm.< she said to herself as she brought her hands down as her arms grew tired >Well fuck this will take a very long time.< Resting her arms against her legs she looked at the plants in hopes of finding something that indicated that what she did was not just wasted effort but the plants still remained the same.* - Tue Sep 08 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >Better call it a day and try again tomorrow.< she thought to herself as she pushed herself off the ground and patted herself down and sighed. Everything so far had been either boring or a failure which was a bit of a hit to her moral >Tomorrow will be better.< she tried to cheer herself up because today had been a disappointing day >I really need to find teachers though.< * - Tue Sep 08 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) went to the weapons shop and bought several Kunais and explosive tags and ones she paid for them she left the shop and went back to the dock as she did not seem to want to see other people. More specifically she did not want people to see her practice her sealing as she wanted to maintain her abilities a secret from the rest of them as she had no intention of staying in the village for a long time anyway. She would take the Kunai and drew a seal on the handle then inserted an explosive tag and sealed away inside the kunai handle.* - Tue Sep 08 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) After she was done sealing that one explosive tag she would place another explosive tag onto the seal and would execute the Tiger handseal and seal the explosive tag away >Hmmm, this is actually kinda straining.< she thought to herself as she felt her chakra pools diminish a considerable amount >I guess I better make this quick then.< she thought to herself. Looking around the area she made sure she was alone and there was no one in sight, once that was done she would place another explosive tag onto the handle and prepared the Tiger handseal but before she would seal it away she watched the surrounding area.* - Tue Sep 08 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) once she made sure that the coast was clear she would focus her chakra onto the seal and sealed the explosive tag into the Kunai handle >Hmm I wonder how many should I place?< she would think to herself as she looked at the other weaponry she had bought >Maybe five on each for now would be fine.< She would reach over for another Explosive Tag and placed it on the handle and prepared the Tiger handseal then sent chakra into the seal and had the Explosive Tag disappear into the handle of the Kunai.* - Tue Sep 08 01:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) ||>Just one more.< she thought to herself as she reached over for the last Explosive Tag and set it on the handle of the Kunai. Making sure that the coast was clear before she sealed the tag into the handle she would take a deep breath then let it out slowly as she began to gather and send her chakra into the seal. Sealing the final Explosive tag into the Kunai handle she placed the Kunai in her backpouch and layed down on the dock >Well that was exhausting.< she thought to herself as she closed her eyes and began to meditate to gather her lost chakra >I really need to expand my chakra pools.< she thought to herself as she drifter off in though.* - Tue Sep 08 01:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) sitting down again she realized that she had missed one explosive tag >Ugh.< she said to herself as she reached back into her backpouch and removed the kunai. Placing the explosive tag onto the handle she executed the Tiger handseal and sealed the fifth and final explosive tag into the kunai handle then checked to see if she might have missed something else. After a brief instant of searching she became satisfied that she was not missing anything else and got placed the Kunai into her backpouch yet again and layed down on the dock staring at the sky.* - Tue Sep 08 01:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was walking up toward the usual hang out spot looking down at a scroll she seemed to be studying >Hmm I still need to find a teacher.< she thought to herself as she was paying no attention to where she was going since she was more interested in learning the contents of the scroll. Since she was not really looking where she was going it was more than likely that she would end up bumping into someone somewhere down the line.* - Tue Sep 08 16:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would be caught by surprice as she suddenly felt contact against someone else. Her scroll would have been sent flying as she would have been knocked to the ground but not beacuse she was weak but because she honestly did not expect anyone to be roaming around the village since just about everyone liked to hang out in the courtyard of that one mansion type thing. She would look up "Oi! Careful!" she said rather surpriced as she focused her gaze on Sanoke then shook her head "Sorry, it was my fault I was reading a scroll and did not see where I was going." she admitted to him.* - Tue Sep 08 16:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) takes the scroll then begins to stand up as she looks at him "Hmm? Retiring as a shinobi? You are no older than me and you want to retire already? Why?" that tiny bit that he said had sparked her interest as it seemed unusual for someone to want to retire at a very young age "What will you do then?" she asks out of curiosity as she slowly began to roll the scroll up as she had found something much more interesting than what she was reading.

Placing the scroll away in her backpouch she extended her other hand foward "Kirie." she simply said meaning to introduce herself to the young male before him.* - Tue Sep 08 17:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) shook his hand then retracted hers "Well it does not mean you are a coward, I was just surpriced because you seem younger than I do you know?" she would then look around for a bit as she was thinking of what to ask "You said something about turtles?" she questioned as that is what struck her attention next "How does one become student of turtles? and why would you want to be a hermit?" It was clear that she was a rather curious person when it came to things that she had never been exposed to before.

"I mean you do not have to fight for your village if you do not want to." she would tell him as she brought her hand up to her chin to think "Like well it is your village but well if you do not want to waste your life for something you don't agree with then that is your decision you know? I am sure that there are a lot of war happy idiots that would love to take your place." * - Tue Sep 08 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) looked at the trutle summon and begins walk around examening the creature "How did this get here?" she asked him "Was he sealed somewhere? Do you know fuuinjutsu by any chance?" It would seem that all she was doing was asking questions left and right but it was really because she wanted to know things specially things she had no knowledge of "What did you do to get this turtle here? Does your blood have anything to do with it? Or are you just a masochist that needs to feel pain?" Even more rapid fire questions were asked toward Sanoke.

She would slowly reach out touch the turtles shell if allowed then retracted it quickly "Hmm it feels real enough and you are sitting on it so it is not an illusion." she muttered to herself loud enough for Sanoke to hear if he would to be paying attention "If it is Fuuinjutsu you must be very proficient at it in order to be able to seal living things into scroll." she made a comment toward him now as she walked back infront of him and the turtle.* - Tue Sep 08 18:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) would lean over to get closer to the turtles head "It talks." she said rathr surpriced before she stood up straight and looked at Sanoke "How does one learn summoning ninjutsu?" she asked him then looked at the turtle again "You are not the nicest turtle out there are you now." she told him as she had just refered to her as a skinny human girl "I will let you know that my weight is more than appropriate for my height so suck on that you grouchy turtle."

Looking back at Sanoke she would shake her head "He was day dreaming when I went to turn in the mission so I went down by the docks, I do not think he is back to this realm of reality yet so might as well just wait around for a while longer you know." she would galnce around the area ones again and spotted the water that was passing under the bridge "You wouldn't by any chance know any Suiton jutsus would you?"* - Tue Sep 08 18:18:27 2015

What a mean turtle." she said as she looked on as it went up in a puff of smoke "You should really get another one, maybe one that is not so pist off at life that it has to take out its anger on someone else." she said rather bothered at the fact that it was the first time she had spoken to an animal "Anyway how good are you are at Fuuinjutsu? I know the basics but I would like to learn more if possible and everyone else in the village seems rather agressive." 

She would reach for a kunai that was in her backpouch and showed it to him. This was done in a none threatning way as she did not want him to think that she was going to attack or anything "I have sealed five explosive tags to the handle of this Kunai." she told him as she began to spin the kunai around with her finger "I hope to get more Fuuinjutsu training done today but well yeah I would need a teacher to teach me the ways."* - Tue Sep 08 18:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arrived at the dock and took off her shoes then sat down with her legs swinging over the edge, reaching for one of the scrolls Tethys had given her she took one out and began to study it. Opening the scroll she could it it was for a technique called -Syrup Trap- which made her wonder if she had to take the name in its literal meaning or if the name was misleading. Either way she would begin to read the scroll and absorb its contents as she wanted to be able to use Suiten related techniques as soon as possible and given her hardworking nature that would be very soon.* - Tue Sep 08 19:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) continued reading the scroll intently re reading every paragraph she would finish just to get a better understanding for the element and the jutsu itself. >Hmmm so that is what I have to do with my chakra.< she would comment to herself as she returned to reading the scroll. Examening the scroll she would look up at the water then imagined the jutsu in her mind but it was somehow way off the mark as to what the actual jutsu was so she returned to reading it as she still had alot left to read >This does not seem so hard but then again I am unfamiliar with this element so it might seem easy but I get the feeling that it will be the opposite.<* - Tue Sep 08 19:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) went over what she had memorized and once again tried to visualize it in her head as she stared at the water ahead of her seeing how it would flow with the natural order of things in a rather peaceful grace. >So this jutsu makes the water become jelly like which in turn makes anything that comes into contact with it gets stuck in. In other words it is a way better glue used out of a very abundant source in nature.< She would continue watching the water as it flowed infinitely  in its confined space >Well better get back to reading this then.< she told herself as she brought her gaze down toward the scroll.* - Tue Sep 08 19:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) read a new section of the scroll over and over again untill it was engraved into her brain then she would move onto another paragraph and gave it the same treatment. Slowly but surely she would memorize every single bit of information that was written on the scroll as she went along with the reading, every now and again she would look up at the water infront of her and would remain watching it for a while before returning to reading the scroll as well reading could get kind of boring specially if you were just re-reading the same paragraph over and over again.* - Tue Sep 08 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) almost finishing with the scroll she placed it down on her lap and reviewed everything she had learned from it >Hmm well this jutsu uses water but not just any type of water but water with chakra that has changed its composition to become like glue making anything that come into contact with it. The only way to avoid it is to use Katon natured jutsus and even then it would have to be a very powerful one at that or if there is very little syrup I guess it can be evaporated instantly...hmm who knows.< After reviewing what she had learned she would get back to reading the scroll.* - Tue Sep 08 20:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) ||>Hnnnggg< she thought to herself as she grew bored of reading >How much more is there?< she asked herself as she opened the scroll to its full lenght and sighed. Placing the scroll on her lap she layed against the wood and stared at the sky >Hang in there, this is for the greater good...well at least for my own good, as soon as I learn enough I will ditch this village and go off on my own.< she thought to herself then sat back up and read the scroll with a great determination as she wanted to finish reading the scroll and learn the technique.* - Tue Sep 08 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) rolled up the scroll and placed it back in her backpouch when she was done reading the jutsu >Hmm well that was a pain but I am glad I did it, I now have a better understanding of the Suiton element and I know a new jutsu now which is very nice.< she thought to herself as she pulled out another scroll >Hmmm, well I guess it is time to learn this.< she told herself as she began to open the scroll and had her eyes scan the surface to get a hint as to what she was going to read next. The title of the scroll said -Finger Carving Seal- which indicated that it would be a scroll about a Fuuinjutsu technique.* - Tue Sep 08 21:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) read the first few paragraphs and memorized them fairly quick >Hmm why does this seem easier?< she asked herself as she continued to read the scroll scanning every word that was on it memorizing it into her brain > So I just focus my chakra to the tip of my finger any given finger and use it as a pen or pencil.< This really seem to be a very easy jutsu to learn as well she was rather well versed when it came to Fuuinjutsu so it came as no surprice to her that this was an easy concept for her to graps and execute.* - Tue Sep 08 21:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) finished reading the scroll and placed it in her backpouch >Well that was easy.< she thought to herself then pulled out another Kunai with three Explosive tags >Might as well continue working on my Fuuinjutsu since I have gotten started leaning a new jutsu.< She would draw a seal in the handle and placed an Explosive Tag and looked around to make sure that no one would see her seal the Explosive Tag into the handle.When she made sure that no one was around she would execute the Tiger handseal and sent her chakra into the seal causing the Explosive Tag to disappear into the handle.* - Tue Sep 08 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) placed another explosive tag on the seal that was drawn onto the kunai handle and took in a deep breath >This is still very straining on my chakra pools, I really need to master this or find of a better way to do this.< she told herself as she executed and held the Tiger Handseal infront of her as she was staring at the kunai handle that had an explosive tag layed over it. She would send another burst of chakra into the seal and would have the explosive tag disappear into the handle >I just have to do this one more time.< she told herself as motivation.* - Tue Sep 08 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) sighed as she felt her chakra pools take a dive >Fuck this is bothersome, now I need to rest to get my chakra back.< She would place the kunai and the explosive tag beside her then layed down on the dock staring at the sky ones again. She would see some clouds pass by above her as she began to drift in thought >Damn it, this village is boring. I need some real action I need more than this.< she thought to herself as she turned her head left and right >Yeah, I will just leech the most I can out of this village then I am leaving it.< After she was done with that train of thought she would sit up strait and seal the explosive tag into the handle of the kunai and placed it away.* - Tue Sep 08 22:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Walked around the village and looked around as she was crossing the wooden bridge to get to the dock when she suddenly noticed the creaking noises and looked down >Well that will certainly be a problem if anyone if I was trying to assassinate someone or sneak up on them.< she thought to herself then took another step foward and noticed that the wood did not creak >So it is just certain woodent board that creak.< She would take another step only this time it was toward the side trying to see if there were certain points of the wood that would creak.* - Wed Sep 09 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) examined each wodden board that was used to build that bridge and found out that evey board would creak but only if stepped on certain parts of it. She also found out that the only parts where the boards wouldnt creak was where there were under beams supporting the superior boards >Interesting.< she thought to herself as she made her way of the bridge and noticed that her foot steps also caused a loud noise as soon as the heel of her feet would make contact againt the wood >Well I guess I have to change the way I walk if I want to be stealthy.< she told herself as she continued walking toward the souther dock.* - Wed Sep 09 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) along the way she noticed that there were many leafs and sticks that would give away her position in case she was trying to sneak up on someone >Damn...I guess that there is a potential noise hazard everywhere I go, I'll have to pay more attention where I place my next step.< With this being present in her mind she would walk on the balls of her feet and looked at the ground before her were she was going to take her next step as she wanted to avoid steping on a crunchy leaf or on a twig or stick that would snap under her weight as they were rather frail things that were already dead which is why they were on the floor in the first place.* - Wed Sep 09 01:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Zigging and zagging as she made her way to the souther dock making sure to not step on anything that might make noise >There has to be a better way to go around the village without looking like an idiot.< she told herself as she began to walk normally now only she continued using the balls on her feet instead of stepping with her heel. She also took her time walking now as she really did not have to get there fast, this would ensure she looked where she was stepping next that way she could correct the location where her foot was going to land.* - Wed Sep 09 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) as she continued to walk toward the dock she noticed that even though she was walking slowly and using the balls of her feet there was another problem which was her balance. The longer she would take to complete the step the more difficult it became for her to maintain her balance >Well shit, I have to do this fast enough but at the same time I need to do this slow enough so that I dont crunch anything...this sucks.< she thought to herself as she decided to call it a day with trying to make less noise as she walked and just made her way over to the dock and sat down and stared at the water.* - Wed Sep 09 01:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) turned around and crouched down to take off her shoes and sat on the dock with her legs dangling over the edge.* - Wed Sep 09 13:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) looked up at him then looked at the water >I specifically came here because no one ever comes here.< she thought to herself before she repeated what he said "So.."* - Wed Sep 09 13:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) decided to pay no attention to the male that was near her and instead focused on getting something done. She would extend out her index finger and focused her chakra on the finger tip and once enough chakra was focused on it she would bring her finger down toward the word and began carving something onto the wood. If the male next to her would be be a sensor he could tell that there was a build up of chakra on her finger but if he wasnt then he would have to try and figure out how she was doing the carving.* - Wed Sep 09 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) continued carving something that started to look like a capital -K- then looked up at the male "What? No my nails have nothing to do with this." she told him as she continued carving out more wood with her chakra. >I really thought this place would be good to be alone but I guess that it is suddenly popular.< she told herself rather annoyed that someone would be at the dock at the same time she was >I wonder if he is going to leave soon? What can I do to make him leave? I mean I do not own this dock or anything but still this is -my- quiet place.< she would continue on with the train of thought as she carved out a lower case -I- into the wood.* - Wed Sep 09 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) decided to just really zone out the male who had just jumped into the water and continued carving the wood. She would begin making a lower case -r- and passed her finger over it several times to make sure that the carving would be deep enough and repeated the same process for the other letters she had previously carved out before hand. >If this guy continued to hang around I'll just go and do the mission and never come back here again.< she told herself as she now began to carve out another lower case -i- into the wood next to the -r-.* - Wed Sep 09 14:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) whispers: Is there anything in particular that I have to do to learn it? - Wed Sep 09 18:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) walked over toward the nearest three that was available since she did not want to get in anyones way nor did she want to disturb anyones training. Looking up at the tree she would do what Himura told her about applying chakra to her feet so she executed the Tiger handseal and began to channel chakra into the soles of her feet "What happens if I channel way too much chakra?< she asked Himura before she would send an excess amount of chakra to her feet then began to walk toward the nearest tree trunk and planted one foot on it feeling a certain grip on the trunk then brought her other foot up then took a step. Little did she know that thanks to the excess amount of chakra that she had channeled into her feet she would be sent flying back thanks to her chakra.

Landing on her ass she skidding along the floor and cursed under her breath then looked over at Himura "Well that answers that." she told herself and Himura. Standing up she patted herself off and walked over to the nearest tree again and executed the Tiger handseal and sent a considerable less amount of chakra to the soles of her feet. Each step she took felt considerably different as there was much less chakra on the soles of her feet this time >Well here goes nothing.< she told herself as she planted a foot on the tree trunk and as she was going to place the other she would slide off the tree trunk and slam against the floor.

"Fuck!" she said in outrage as she glanced around as she was aware that the other people that were around would most likely laugh at her >Well I tried using too much chakra and now I used much less and both ended in failure so I need to find out which is the right amount of chakra.< she told herself as she began to stand up and patted herself off. Taking in a deep breath she executed the Tiger handseal and focused an inbetween amount of chakra between her first and second attempt >This should be enough.< she told herself then placed a foot on the tree trunk. Hesitating to place the other foot on the tree she looked around once again then went for it as she figured that it was better to make an ass out of herself fast than draw it out any longer.

With both feet on the she began to take quick steps as the instructions that she was given was to get as far up in the tree as possible before she moved onto the water. A couple of steps in she jumped back and landed on her feet >Well that was good.< she told herself as she gave it another go. She executed the Tiger handseal  and focused a little bit more chakra into her feet and ran toward the tree and shot straight up taking even more steps than she took on her previous attempt. Jumping back ones again she looked over at Himura "Close enough." she said as she was pleased with her efforts in the task she was given "What else do I hade to do.?"* - Wed Sep 09 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) looked at the water and sighed >If I fall in I will get wet and if that happens well I would need to dry off, ugh.< she would kneel down to take off her shoes and placed them aside away from the shore so that they would not get wet. Staking several steps foward she would execute the Tiger handseal to focus the exact same amount of chakra she had used on the tree and placed one foot on the water. She would apply a little weight onto her foot and expected to sink but she didn't >Hmm do not get cocky.< she told herself as there was still a chance that she would sink down to the bottom and get wet.

She would take a step back and took in a deep breath as she dispersed her chakra  from the soles of her feet. >Focus and do not fall into the water.< she told herself as she executed the Tiger hanseal and sent chakra into the soles of her feet ones again >Very well here goes nothing.< she told herself as she took a step into the water then took another and another >Do not fall down, do not fall down.< she repeated to herself as she focused on a steady stream of chakra into the soles of her bare feet. The amount of chakra was not an excessive amount since she did not want to get blown back and it was not a small amount as she did not want to fall in.

Taking more steps inward she did it nice and slowly taking her sweet time as she was focused on keeping the correct amount of chakra on her feet. Gaining more confidence in her abilities she began to walk at a faster yet cautious step as she could still fall in and that would have not been fun for anyone. Making her way back to the shore she looked at Himura "What now?" she asked him as she grabed her shoes and put them on "Was that all the training we needed to do?" she asked ones again as she looked at the other two males that were either finishing their stroll on the water or were still training.* - Wed Sep 09 22:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Made her way back down to the dock ones again this time a bit faster while she watched the ground >Avoid stepping on the branches and leafs, avoid anything that can cause noise and give away your location.< she used her balls of her feet and moved along. She would count how many times she would step on something that made noise >That is five.< she told herself then stoped and looked back >I have only traversed a small amount of terrain, if this keeps up and if this was a situation where I needed to be stealthy I would most likely be dead.<* - Wed Sep 09 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Arrived at the begining of the bridge and shook her head >Damn it.< she told herself then focused on the bridge >I can do this two ways, I can run straight to the middle and jump around to where there are nails in the wood to avoid making noises or I can zig zag through the wood counting how many times I make noise as I go along.< she would raise her hand up to her chin and began to think >Hmmm I mean I want to challenge myself since this will only help me out in the future so why the hell not.< she would crouch down and entered a sprinter stance and looked foward.* - Wed Sep 09 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >On your mark.< she told herself as she raised her back >Get set< she would lean foward a bit >Go!< she would take off running foward stepping onto the wood with the balls of her feet as she continued to make her way foward. >One...two....three....four.< she counted as she went along jumping from left to right making her way across the bridge. When she was done she would finish crossing over the bridge she would turn around a took in a deep breath >I lost count after thrity noises that was not a good run, I need to get better. I need to make myself lighter, I need to keep working hard like I always do as I am sure I will get this down in no time.<* - Wed Sep 09 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) continued to walk down the path walking on the balls of her feet taking big steps from left to right trying to avoid anything that can make noise >Damn now that I think about it...Why is the street full of leafs and twigs? Doesn't anyone clean it? I mean I know that outside of this village the geography is way different...hmmm I need to go outside of this village to see what kind of things I will have to avoid. Im sure that in a place like Sunagakure where it is mostly sand I will have a harder time getting this down since well its sand and I am sure that when you step on sand it makes noise.< she would continue on with her train of thought as she made her way down the street avoiding anything that would make noise.* - Wed Sep 09 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) >Damn...I totally forgot on what number I was...hmm I need to do a better job at paying attention, I also need to get lighter on my feet ones I do that I am sure the noise I make when I walk will be significantly reduced.< She continued down the street and looked around seeing people go too and from minding their own business going about their dayly life >I should maybe follow somebody, that can be useful. If they notice me then I am doing a bad job but if they don't then that means I am doing something right...but that will have to wait untill tomorrow since I have a pretty busy schedule.< she would arrive at the dock and took a seat after taking off her shoes setting them beside her.* - Wed Sep 09 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) Focused her chakra on the tip of her finger ones again as was now alone with no one around her to distract her and or watch her doing her jutsus. She brought her finger down next to the lower case -i- she had carved into the wood and began to carve out another letter which would be a lower case -e-. Once she had done that she looked at the carving of her name on the wood and smiled a bit >Well I mean its a start.< she told herself as she cut the chakra flow into her finger and stretched her arms upward then took in a deed breath of air.* - Wed Sep 09 23:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) crossed her arms and focused her faze upon the new blonde hair male "Tch, who the hell are you?" She asked rather bothered at the males tone "What business do you have with our leader anyway?" she would ask him not really giving an answer back to him.* - Thu Sep 10 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) spat on the floor infront of the male "Excuse me? Who the fuck are you to be ordering me around?" she would begin to focus her chakra on her head and unless he was a sensor or there were other sensors around they could tell what she was doing but if not then she would just be standing there focusing her gaze on the male with the snotty and spoiled attitude.* - Thu Sep 10 21:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) felt Tethy's hand on her shoulder and gave a quick glance at him then returned her eyes toward the male, she would spit on the ground ones again not hitting Tethys with her spit clearly bothered. She would continue to focus her chakra on her hair incase the male wanted to try something or order her around again >Fucking snotty brat who the fuck does he think he is.< she thought to herself not taking her eyes of him anymore.* - Thu Sep 10 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) imagines her self spitting on the ground and then stepping and smearing it on the floor >Fucking brat.< she thought to herself as she continued to look at the Gezo male keeping her eyes on him and chakra focused on her head just in case it needed to be used >Just piss me off one more time.< she told herself as she continued watching on.* - Thu Sep 10 21:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) clenched her fist tightly as she focused more and more chakra into her head >This mother fucker.< she thought to herself as she began to breath heavily.* - Thu Sep 10 23:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: ( (*Ossa, Baen his jaw dropped to the floor as he contemplated the insult. It was clear that Tethys wouldn't just let this slide, and if he did...well Baen would probably be too shocked to even say a word. In the meantime, he glanced towards Jin, and maintained his stupified look. "Yo...." He took a step to the left as shit was about to get hectic. "He about to kill a Gezo heir. He about to become the most infamous man alive. He's about to pull a luffy." He thought to himself. *) ) - Thu Sep 10 23:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) saw that Tethys went on full on attack mode so she would join in after him. Taking a few steps to the side she would bring up her hand to untie her hair from its pony tail and began to channel the chakra she had been focusing on her head and sent it to her hair. Her hair would shoot out aiming to stop any movements that might have been made by the Gezo brat. The hair would aim to wrap around his hands and legs holding them in a mighty hair grip >Welcome to Kirigakure.< she thought to herself as she gained a smirk on her face. Given her mastery with the jutsu the control over he hair would be impressive to say the least.* - Thu Sep 10 23:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirie(AxelFraire) was not about to get a hair cut when she did not want one so she would quickly control her hair to dodge the strike but the shinobi with the sword had managed to cut some of it. Ones it had returned to her head she would look at it and became more than enraged at the fact that someone had cut her hair but she was not about to lose her temper over this as she knew that getting past that blade of his would be something rather hard to do >These mother fuckers.< she thought to herself as she reached for her Kunai and stood at a defensive stance taking a couple of steps back then focused on the Gezo brat and his guards.* - Thu Sep 10 23:50:24 2015
