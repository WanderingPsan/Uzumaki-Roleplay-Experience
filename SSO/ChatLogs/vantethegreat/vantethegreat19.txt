<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) he would listen to Tor-tata's explaination whole heartedly.The kid felt that this brand of justu would greatly fit his style his self trainning lately made him realize a great deal of things about himself. He would walk over to the table and become excited. For some reason or another Trill liked to learn stuff. It must have been a trait he had gotten from his farther and grandfather,He would shake of his random thoughts  once he started to reach for the brush.

He would dip it in the ink just as Tor-tata had done taking smooth calming breaths. Trillaim would then grab a piece of the paper and slowly begin to make the glyph that he had been shown. He would deliclatly move his hand along the paper trying to replicate the image shown to him. After having it half way down he would dip the brush in ink once more and contine to replicate it. While doing this his A.D.D would Flare up but he would force himself to calm down and continue this exercise. Finllay he had finshed the glyph that read the world "Contain" he would look at it curiosly surely there was more to it than that 

He turns his head and looks over to Sanoke.... "How is that." he would ask showing  his current teacher whom would note due to Trilliams facination with art would be some what better than most newbies....... "Oh yeah and whats next." he would state excitement clearly in his eyes.* - Sat Oct 10 05:50:17 2015

He would pull his noon elemental chakra foward and disturbiute it evenaly amongst the seal and the Kunia he was supposed to be testing on. He would then will for the Kunai to go inside the scroll, There would be a faint glow and the Kunia would dissapeare... 

"Ahhhhhh so thats how it is done." he said looking over at Tor-tata.* - Sat Oct 10 06:19:18 2015

As the bird regained  its correct postioning he would then  go nit ot hsi bag and pull out his spider scroll un wraping and and making 40 spiders as the approched the ground they would be come animaited and fall upon the woman and her bandits he would then snap his fingers as he did this all  of the spiders would detonote. Some of them would have attatched to the bandits. * - Sun Oct 11 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) since the wire  would be tranclucent the wing would be snaged and the woman would have succed in snatching the bird to her it was pulled to her trill  would grap izas hand and jump off  as they did hed use his free hand to reach in his sachal pulling out another of his rider birds annimating it  would catch the duo. The woman would be some what scwerd due to trilliam snaping his fingers to detonite the 1st rider bird. The explosin would surely take out some of her goons .since the fire tech clashed  he didnt have to worry about them the tree lightning balls would hit 10 of his 40 spiders rendring thier anniamted bodies useless the other 25 would yes 25 would land upon the bandits and detonate the other 5 would scurry along the ground as a suirpise for the crazy woman. For once he was having fun doing waht he did best Being Viscous.* - Sun Oct 11 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) due to the fact the trillaim wore a vest long selve and additonal vest combo the wire would only graze cloth  on his shoulder , The clay Falcon due to the proxmity in which it was annimoited would succcfuly pick up iza and trill while diving in a barrel roll like motion making the flames and lightning miss them. Trill would grin as he made a seal and spit out two of his Earth Shadow clones.' 
Clone Number one would make the Snake seal as it did the area around the crazy woman and her goons would tera foarm catching them in a giant dome with a hole only big enough for clay spiders to fit in.  Trillaim was no dummy he had seen that some of the womans goons used lightning and he planned for it by making the second clone make the tiger seal  it would be on stand by for the off chance that the shinobi bandits had destroyed his dome it would surly be the last thing they ever got to do.* - Sun Oct 11 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) as the woman had wapped the wires around him foolsihly and try to stab him he would surge lightnign chakra from his torso on up surly hitting the woman with  raition flash due to the him sending the current into the wires and evaporting any blood that may have been on the wires . He would then throw out a clay spider that would attatch to the womans face. Due to natural human reaction the woman would surely step back and when she did his bird would barrel roll to throw her off.


Clone 2 who had been waitng for the dome to break would stomp his foot all of the rocks and debrie would left up as tho the clone where the earth version of magneto and they would then propel  themselves  and pelt the stupid bandits. 

clone one would be on stand bye.

As miss Vio rachet self fell withthe spider on her face Trill would snap his fingers whcih yould casue the creature to detonate at point plank range.* - Sun Oct 11 08:34:33 2015
