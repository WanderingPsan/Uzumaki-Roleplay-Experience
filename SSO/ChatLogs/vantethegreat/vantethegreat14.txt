Why more than what Yan had mentioned in his display. It showed a tone of charts drawings and batlle stratgies. As the learned more about the justu he could see it would indeed be a great teachnique to weild. Earth justu were truely versital. It was noted that this justu could also be activated with a foot stomp rather than a hand slanming on the ground. it all  deepended on the user.

He had so much to learn but he was willing to get it done not only to prove his worth to Hassan but also he knew he would need this to help follow is way that Koji had taught him as a necessary key for surivial <Be Vicous.> and that he would.. and that he would.

He would get up off the ground make the set of seals he was taught andcand channle earth based chakra into his foot. He would then lift it and stopm it down. Two rock like tiles would jump up from the earth one would crash into a shop keepers stand the other flew and hit a random kid. he would thing <Danag this thing his hard to aim gezze> he would htn call out "Hey im am soooo sorry Mr. shop keeper and kid you have learned your first lesson from a shinobi....Dodge!!!!!!" he would yell like piccalo.* - Tue Sep 29 18:12:16 2015
