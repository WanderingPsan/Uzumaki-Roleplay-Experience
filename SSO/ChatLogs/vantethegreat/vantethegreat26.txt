<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) the clones would fall over but due to the lighting being charged lready in there hands it would touch the mud rivers and travel up it to the clones and or the real hiro.

Trillaim himsel would cough a liitle bit due to the smoke bomb at that point his bi polar alter ego Realiam started to kick in and his planned ideals and actions were not what was up... Lets just say he wanted trillaim to remove the scroll from his back and put it to use damn psych freak. Trillaim would fall on his Knees cluthing his head and the shout of "No No No No." could be herd in the smoke he was not worried about Hiro or the smoke now he was worried about what Realiam had planned 

Real would then speak "I told you Be Viscous and look at you playing games with your opponete that his so disrecptful Trilliam.

Trilliam//"Go away just stop please to many people."

Hopefully some one would see that Trillaim was indeed in turmuil with himself. And try to help him.* - Tue Oct 20 06:07:21 2015

He would pull from his chakra center both earth and lightning chakra and mix them together. He would then channel the mix using his chakra control  to send through his chakra network and into his left hand. He would then think <Ohhh kay nice and flat thin thin thin.> he would curl his hands into a fist. Not trusting him slef t o actaully hit any thing with this chakra and possibly blow his hand off he would turn his body away from his mentors and throw a jab at the air  while simotaneouly releasing the chakra he had built up a small bang could be herd.

"Ummmmm Like that?" he would look back at Katsune with a questioning glance.* - Tue Oct 20 20:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) He would nod his head and once again apply the special mix to his hand curling it into a fist. This time becuase he had gotten the basics of it he would apply more chakra to it. He would let the chakra swarm in it natural chaotic way while still reining some controll over it. 

Trilliam would then thrust his fist forward  in a jab like motion and let his chakra run rampet the air would distort heavily and a loud bang could be herd .
