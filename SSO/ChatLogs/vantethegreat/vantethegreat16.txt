<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) he would shurg seemed like no one wished to speak to him and Jumpman was off being Jumpman so he would post up on the backside of ths kage statue sit down and begin to read a scroll labled Earth Flash.

The title alone confused him this better not be the same he then reads the intro paragragh scriblled in Klims hand writting he would then laugh out loud "This guy writes like a princess." he would then fixate his eyes back on the scroll it would state.

This technique allows the user to create a wave of electricity from their hands.  The user can vary its power from a small surge to shock an opponent to a powerful stream of lightning capable of ripping through solid rock.  It is ideal to use in conjunction with a water technique. 

"Hmmm ok its a little differnt I think ill add my own little tweek to it for theartical effect yeah." he would say out loud then begin to think <Yeah insted of doing the hand clap like thing I'll just supercharke my hands and let the lighting arc off my finger tips......Yeah be all like run up boom bang zap pew pew ayeeeeeeee.> At this point his A.D.D would have flared up he had done his best to keep it underwarps to seem cool but then again his grandfater was batshit crazy and everyone seemd to love him.

He would slowly take deep breaths and count to 10 over and over in his head.

After regaining focus he would once again return to reading the scroll he would look at the charts and graphs and take note of the recomended chakra raitos. he would hold his left hand up toward the sky and begin to supercharge the particales in the air around hand. The sound of electricy crackling could be herd through out the air. he would sight "Ughhhhh so noisey."  His hand would be coated in what would seem to be pure blue  he would yell "RavenScrotum." as loud as he could as he did this he would surge all of the chakra into his finger tips and sure enough it would be like some crazy light show spewing from his hand.* - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) he would look at his tag partner and strug he would then make a set of seals making 2 clones of him self a technique Yan had made infamous but his AUnt Lera had shown him. Trill took note that Tetu called his gramps gramps so he assumed that in some weird way he was family he knew that testu would try to push him to his limit the fact he was fighting to people at once made him  weary he would send one of his clones to rush foward like a crash dummy unsheathing its tanto the other would hang back while The real trill formed a plan.* - Tue Oct  6 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) he would see the hole and send his clones through it once in side  one clone would slam its hand down on the ground making all teh rocks and debie inside the dome lift up into the air like he was some sort of rock bender they would then fly towards Testu the other would make the snake seal and spit out a river of mud towards his oppenet while The real trill reached in his bag to create one of his trusty lighting gernades.* - Tue Oct  6 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) after he the explolosion he realized that these two where on a completely differnt level compared to them he was mere fodder but he would not give up his surley crushed clones would refrom he would see that Testu used sand just like alstor so as he still made his lightning gernade with his right hand he would take his left hand hold it out and take aim a Testu. 

A sharp crackle  could be herd as orb would from in his hand and begin to expand. It was though he was on some dbz type stuff after it reached critcle mass he would launch it at Tetsu. The ball of lightning would rip through the air.

the two clones would both once again slam their hands down on the ground to launch all the newly created rocks due to the dome being blown to bits at  Testu. It would become quite obvouis that Trill  was mid to long range fighter.* - Tue Oct  6 04:22:24 2015

From What he had been told it was and even quicker version of Hiding like mole he would sight "Where....Is....The...Lightninng!" he would yell out in fustration so far all he had learned where tons of earth justu which where just minute  varations. he would rup his temple. 

He would open the scroll and begin to read it and it was indeed fact true this teachninque was like his previous one with one exception instead of making the earth soft it turned it into liquid and he would be able to move faster.......  he would roll up the scroll but then sit back down and open it again Klim told him he had to  learn it before he got to know of another technique.
