He would then begin to read the introductory paragrpah which contained the specifics of the justu it would state. This technique can create a dragon-like head to shoot fire balls of mud at an opponent. This can also be combined with a fire technique to shoot searing hot rock towards an opponent.

"Wow that sounds like it will hurt alot. Man this is going to talk alot of attepmts it looks no where near as easy as the other stuff. But eh you live and tou learn this might be able to Hit that White Eyed Devil tooo...." He woud go back to reading the scroll.

Sevrel things are needed to be able to prefrom this justu one being of course earth.... The Second would be the seals for this Earth natured techqniue. The hand Seals are as Follows Ram followed by Horse followed By Dragon. he would sit the scrool down and start to make the Ram horse and dragon seals. Young Trill would repate this over and over untill he had the seals memorised.

He would then exclaim out loud. "Hmmm I wonder whats for lunch to day." he would shurg it off and continue to read his scrooll, Mid way through his gaze his A.D.D would flare up which he did a very good job of covering up but it was starting to get to him. He wanted run around do some jumping jacks maybe a couple cartwheels and then a stratling revilation happend "Oh God no no no no I don;t wanna be jumpman." He sceremend rolling on the ground he then took a deep breath and hoped no one noticed.

His eyes would then drift back down to the scroll. He would continue to read the list of requirements. The thrid think you need is  a far amount of chakra and control. After aquring and or fulling these requirments you may stomp or  slam your hand down to inatie this technique. 

Upon Technique Iniation  a dragon head shall form. Upoon formation it shall begin to spit out High impact Balls of earth at different quanties depending on how adept the user is with the technique in question. 

Trill would stand up and dust himself off he was becoming quite the scholar latley all the reading going on.. He then began to wonder where in the world Sesiskue was. He really had a lot of stuff to sell him... He would shurg "Man this sounds simple in concept but .... eh wont hurt to try." He loooked at the hand drawn diagram of how it should look"Aliright Alirght Alright I'm going to learn today Step one Be Viscous.> he would then clap his hands to his face lightly.

Standing steady and with his feet apart he youd make the Ram horse and dragon seals while cicrualting and molding his earth natured chakra he was really beginning to wonder where the other lightning users where he knew so many earth techniques but very few lightning ones. He would shake the thought off.

After he had made the seals and felt as though he had contracted with the correct chakra Ratios he would stomp his foor down. As he did this a Slab of earth would bust forth and rapidaly change shape the head would form but a few of the Dragons teach would be missing and only one mud ball would shoot out. "Aww Man that...Just I have to Do better like that was.: He would sigh deeply  reach in his bag and pull out his favortie consumable food item.. Red Koolaid. He would begin to rapidly drink the liquid he would look up..Today for some reason his felt hotter than usual.* - Fri Oct  9 21:23:24 2015
