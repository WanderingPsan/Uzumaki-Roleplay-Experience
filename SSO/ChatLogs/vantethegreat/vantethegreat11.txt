Inhale some air and then mix it with the chakra in his cest. The young boy wound then exhale due to his size  "A giant torrent of pressurised water would aim to hit the girl." he had his trusty tree ready in a defensive stance in casue she tried oto do any crazy wind stuff. he assumed that after she seen him utlize a tree for a weapon she would know to concide because if she showed Flexus no signs of being worried aout his tree then he would just assume she could take it.* - Sat Sep 26 23:28:25 2015

Raven would think once again he was going to use his water gun justu but she would be saidly Mistaken. Flexus wasn't a respected young ninja because of his size changing ablites no. It was also due to the fact he was capable of using many elements. He would infuse the air with fire nature chakra and exhale with as much force as he could. Due to his current size a huge Flamethower would dispurse from his mouth he would fire it in a sweeping motion tryin to limit Ravens option for escape he was sure she would realize that fighting Flexus was a very dangurous thing to do that was the reason no one in the village wanted to fight him he endagered lives doing things he though were normal.

Flexus would throw the tree at Raven. he would then pick up another and  leap into the air as he did this he would take aim at the surly fleaing Ravaen can do something new he had been meaning to try he would use his chakra flow technique to coat the tree in a layer of fire chakra "Flex Art: Flex Mode Burning Forest." he would yell as he through the 2nd now flaming tree at Raven.

"Lets go back to lady Hokages house. I need to get my reward for this and Master Malsoth better be ready to train me." As he say this he make the tiger seal and exhales winis his water gun technique to put out the fire he had cause. He would then begin to shrink. Maybe after his show fo strength and cunning Raven would see why he was chossen to be the Leader of the Boss Hogg Outlawz "Welp I served now its time to collect lets move out." the 10 yr old would say happily.* - Sun Sep 27 00:04:16 2015
