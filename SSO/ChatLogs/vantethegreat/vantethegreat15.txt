Trilliam would close his eyes and take a deep breath and begin to focus drawing his lightning based chakra. He would clap his hands together and begin to channel the chakra into his hands.The kid knew he had to be careful it didn't take a genuis to know if he screwed this up he might blow of his hands. This sorta of made him uneasy but he had to aleast try. 

Sharp Crackles could be herd throughout the air. He was slowly changing and charging the negitve and postive particles in the atmosphere making his lightning manifest. He was more than sure Lera would look at him crazy with the way he was trying to attempt this.Sparks could be seen emmtiing from his hands and wrap around his hand.He would enviosion a ball forming in his hand and beign to utilize his chakra control. He would compress the lightninig Chakra in to a ball molding and shapeing it, 

After he felt it form he would then feed it with evenmore chakra. Trilliam would then replicate Lera's actions and spread his  hands apart slowly. He would try to make sure he kept the chakra mantained and in shape. The craclking of lightinig could be heard, As his hands spread a ball could be seen inbetween his two palms surging and rippiling with lightning chakra . Trillaim would then take aim and Larunch the teaccnique at a rock formation. He would then ask his teacher "So how was that?"

 The kid would then wal ove to the mud and add even more chakra to it. he would once again follow Lera's commands he then thought to himself <Man Sesikue will be pleased next time we are on a mission I'll be much more useful. He than began to wonder. Hmm speaking of which I haven't seen him in a few days.> he would shake his head to snap out of his deep innder thoughts once again his ADD (attention Defecet Disorder) wouldmake him temporaly lose focus on the task at hand he knew it was something he had to work on.

Making the seal Lera showed him he envision the mud taking shape of him self. The Mud would react and begin to swril and build itself up. Slowly a replica of him. Well almost the thing about it was the hair color was off and one of its eyebros would be missing. He would sigh deeply "Oh man does this bring back memories." he would recall a moment from his acadamy days. he would once again shake his head the clone would fall into mud once more.

He would then after gathering his bearings make the seal once more.The mud would swril shift and move as though it had life of its. Trilliam made sure to envionsion him self clearly with as much clarity as possible. The Trill clone would form and it would look just like the real one. He would have the clone wiggle its eye brows and they would bothe speak like twins at lera "How's this."* - Sun Oct  4 06:52:35 2015

He chose to read that one because it sounded cool. Plus the fight earlier inspired him even more.

He would unroll the scroll and begin to read Lera's hand writing.It stated that the HeadHunter technqiue is a justu in which the user burrows undeground and begins to travel towards thier opponet. Once the aformentiond destination is reached the user then grabs ahold of the target and pulls them underground to the point of where their head is the only body part above ground. Upon doing this the ground then re-solidfies around the target and contricts thus keeping them in place. After the sucessful capture the opponet is then at the users mercy.

Yrill rubs his  chin and speaks aloud. "So i see its used to keep them place very useful greaat job lera." he would then go back to reading the scroll

This technique is actived via ram handseal and or being used in conjuction with the hiding like a mole technique. At the mentioning of that he would laugh. "So thats how she is teaching me huh? She's like giving the next varinet of justu ok ok,,,,this is intresting indeed." He then takes a look at the charts and diagrams drawn on to the scroll. He would also see sidenotes and battles stragies this was going to be easy to learn because it was just like another one of his techniques.* - Sun Oct  4 22:56:51 2015
