Trilliam would emerge on the back of the Giant White Falcon through the smoke. he would then look down  at yan and drop 3 small clay spiders he would also pull out 2 of his small clay Falcons he would drop the spiders down to the ground as the got close he would annimite them they would crawl and jump around the 2 birds would fly around in tangum with Trill.

As the earth combo had been stoped Clone one would smrik because it realized Yan could no see the seal it was about to do . It would amke the ram seal and stomp its foot down the earth around yan woul begin to teraform  and enclose him with only  a whole at the top that the spiders would fall through.

Clone number  Two thorw 3 exploding Kunia into Yans wall and detonate them as the rubble broke free it would make a set of seals and stomp its foot down like a earth bender. All the rubble and surronding Debrie would lift into the air like he was the rock version of magneto it would be on stand by waiting for any sighn of trouble and pelt it with the rocks boulders and what not.

He would then reach in his bag and pull out some of his special clay moles he figured being a earth user him self he figured yann would be under ground he would drop the moles that would borrow into the ground he was no senoory ninja so it was like a a hit and miss apporch to it. he would theen think <Hmmm i need to get like thermal googles so i can detect heat signutres of people after they do stuff like this like man.> he would continue to fly around dropping moles basicly playing battle ship he made sure the borrowed deep before the denoted he figured he was pushing yan into a corner.

His second clone reach inside its bag and pull out another scroll this one had 40 clay spiders in it the clone would unseal the scroll withthe 40 pre animaited spiders in side they whould hop out the scroll littier the ground  of the whole arena and be like Bruh..
