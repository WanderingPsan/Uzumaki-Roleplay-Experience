As Yan made sure the coast was clear and made them re-accend above ground he would concentrate.After amassing the chakra he felt he needed he would surge it through the ground and Scream "You stupid dirty excauses for insects of worms bring your sorry butts here now Foood food tons of food." He hoped the worms would get the meesge and reek havoc on his .He would see Kronos die and leap for joy on the inside.

He would ask them is they had seen ay strange new aniamals in the area 3 were discrpied as giant Black cats and 2 were called Big Hairy over sized humans who roared and ate banans. He thought of Smitth. he would ask where would they be at . They would tell him they all hung out together up north from here. He would unleash 700 more of his Dokuchu and infromed them of where to go and to have a nice time working their magic on the beast.He was sure he was getting cuirous looks from Ikarus. "Alright these animals are all friends with each other and sound like quite a hastle 3 big black coated cats and 2 what I've come to belive fool grown Gorillas.

Arms legs heads and bodys would seemingly spwan out of Dravae as He made 3 Insects clones he was always one for theatrics against another shinobi the way he formed his clones would probaly stop them in their tracks the clones would dash foward with a sudden burts of speed and begin to combat each of the Jaguars that advanced upon them.

The finail clone  would catch the Jaguar and twist its neck making sure if that is was indeed dead. His other insects would be enjouing the feast going on inside the gorrilas as they hadn't had a new type of chakra to eat in while they keep relaying the mesage to hi of soooo god over and over again.

* - Fri Sep 11 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) Seeing as he was back home he would take of his black coat and sit down and begin to feel out his chakra natures to make them manifest easier with half a honey bun in his mouth he would sit down on the ground and close his eyes He knew from the chakra paper test back at the acadmey that he could utilize Fire Water and Earth  The top part of the paper crumbled in to dirt while the the water and fire signs reacted a little different than usaual. That Half of the paper had gotten wet and damp while the other side was ingnited with flame and turing to ash the two would meet dead in the center and begin to steam. At the time his acadamy teacher had no explantion of way the two natures mixed and truthfully young Flexus hadn't given it a thought all he knew was he wanted to be the coolest Shinioibi ever and if that ment getting a better grasp at his elements then so be it.

Flexus was never afriad of a little hardwork heck he thrived off it. It was one of the reason he was able to eat so much and seem so muscluarly fit . He would close his eyes and begin to concentrait takeing a deep breath and focusing  on the chkara lines that contained his Fire chakra he had already establisheced preety medicore usage of fire with his flame thower teachnique but after watch that liile girl make a huge fire ball he knew there was so much more to it. He had to get better at drawing his Fire chakara.

Then he thought about Yan and his water gun technique now with water he had absolutly no expriecne in drawing it out but he figured it wouldn't be to hard. He would practice amassing his fire natured Chakra Releasing it then he would focus on his water chakra and try to replicate the same thing. Slowly and steadly he would swap between the two the amount of focus was causing him to sweat. He didn't mind because this was to help him make sure he lived long enough to enjoy the future.

In mid training after hours of doing the meditaion and elemental cycling he would fall a sleep indian style with another half eaten honey bun in his mouth. He really did need some rest his trip to leaf and back had really worn him out.* - Fri Sep 11 05:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) His eyes would snap open he would snap open he would chew his half honey bun and spit it out"Ewwwwww its so Old and soggy did it like rain or something." He would let out a yarn and look over to see Yan " Oh hey there must a fell asleep  in meditation I've been working on manfiesting my elements but that trip to and from leaf must have tuker me out. He would take out his travel tooth paste and bursh and begine brushing his teeth it was somethinge he did on the regular no telling how is breath smelled after eating so man different foods he then pull out a bottle of water and rinse' Ahhhh  nice and clean" Haveing have had sweat laced on the brow he would wet the hankerchif he kept and place it on his forhead letting the luke warm water rest on his face he then would rub it around trying to clear his face of the sweat still unaware of the drawing done by yan.
