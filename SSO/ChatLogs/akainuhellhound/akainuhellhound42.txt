<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What are you up to? - Fri Dec 11 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have paused his training as he caught Mirai's presence, but his training would have consisted of fighting two clones at once. He was striking quickly attempting to get a large amount of strikes in while also being nimbe on his toes. If he was to emulate anything it would be a house fly. zipping and zapping all around the place. Unable to be touched by the opposition before him. The clone would disperse upon the arrival of Mirai, and this is when Koji would speak to her.* - Fri Dec 11 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Just doing some training trying to get quixker in my motions. - Fri Dec 11 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) before begining his grueling regime again Koji would respond to Mirai, 
"Yeah it's nice I'm glad you were able to visit it. Hopefully we can get some members to reside there as well as here. But, time will tell what will happen. And, thanks you improved as well over the years haha. I'm glad we were able to meet." 

Koji summons two clones and takes his stance while also activatiing his Byakugan in the process, thus the tenketsu points of the clones were visible to him. However, Koji's point would be visible to them as well! This made Koji much more antsy and agile on his toes. Taking hits from them decreases the longevity of the training regime. Now as the clones approached Koji they would be seeking to both strike his abdomen region, and follow up with going for his chest neart the heart. This would be fast but half the speed at which Koji applies his strikes. So, he would perceive their intention instantly, thus he would move to cut them off halfway into the motion. 

Now on the offensive Koji wouln't seek to cut in between but in front to where the clones aligned thus ruining there symbiotic attack plan toward the abdomen. This would also allow Koji to strike the first clone's arm up and to make contact with its abdoment instead! Thhis would knock back the first clone into the one behind it due to a studder step after the attack. After this the clones woulld regain their composure. Seeking to strike again as they ran up the clone would both unleash a body blow! Koji would fall to the floor recognizing the flow of chakra from his own. THhus causing a collision of both attacks. 

Standing up swiftly Koji bum rushes on clonse and unleashes a fury of chakra swipes from protective palms causing the clone to be slashed up to the point it couln't maintain itself. The second clone would be bum rushing Koji as he finished but Koji would rotate knocking it back into the distance.* - Fri Dec 11 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be sparring right alongside Mirai and he would be enjoying the moments as it was great for the family man. Bonding time doesn't come often, but it seems that everything was going good sense being chosen for Kage. As the fmaily was always around and the shinobis all flocked, but this could simply be due to the rank, but that wouldn't waver Koji at all. He was happy to be blessed with their presence. These thoughts all crossed Koji's mind as he trained and it gave him endurance to continue his training through. As he needed to protect his own. The ninja summons another couple of clones and begins the spar. 
As he flung for a strike Mirai would speak and Koji would say, 
"Mmm." As he was in the middle of a strike to hit his clone. He sought to send his right arm under for a belly strike and his left over for a pectorial strike. In the meantime the second Clone would be coming in on his backside to jyuken him from behind.Upon success of thte original Koji's strike he'd immediately rotate blowing back the clone seeking to wreck his back side.

After this Koji would remark, 
"Of course my main focus is to secure us. I feel accomplished in making it a family but I can't lie. I hope to see us bigger and better than we are now. There is still alot of work needed, so that we can establish ourselves her in Sunagakure." This sentence would be rather long and Koji was a bit absent minded as he spoke, so one clone would get the upper hand. coming in with a dyanmic entry! Throwing him to the ground!

His clone would say, 
"Keep ya guard up, yo!" 
Koji woud rush the clone and slice it with his protective palm technique. As for the second clone the same motion would follow wthout hesitation. * - Fri Dec 11 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) following the execution of his clone would hear Mirai and her worries and say,
"It is a hassle and sadly it's the cards we've been dealt.... If we're able to unite ourselves with each other I'm sure we can erase even that fear, but that will take time. Of course that fact is saddening in itself. You teaching them of their sacred blessing is the smartest thing you can do.. Heh, if we can do anything together easily it's worry."  

Koji would create yet another couple as he finished his words. Thus, begining the traiing him and Mirai had endured for the passing months. This would be accompanied by loads of proper rest and renourishing of the body which is an important part of training. Koji would then charge them quickly as he said, 

"I'll have to make a formal appearance myself sense they rejected us so harshly. I'm sure we can resolve whatever issue they had with us." 

PCKT! PCKT! PKCT! is the sound made as Koji made contact with clones. They would also attempt to make contact with him, but Koji wouldn't allow it. As he would swivle left, right, back, forward. As this is done the teen would also be strike in unison. He would tag each thrown limb his way in the gentle fist art. * - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 's clones wouldn't be quick enough to dodge so they would suffer from these strikes, but not severly. Once their stature is regained the three figures would engage each other fiercly a game of dodge and strike, or rather tag! This was increasing the teen's tai-jutsu skill greatly as he trained. It would be slow but not unnoticed that's for sure. As he was learning his limits as a fighter. Koji makes more strikes on his clone being nimble and quick in his motion. Koji was really progressing in beoming a toe-fighter. But, only time would tell if he will make it. * - Fri Dec 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) progresses as time passes and he would be training religiously! He wouldn't use his clones this time, but train his strikes and jukes now. This was necessary to focus highly on the cores and not just the broad, so Koji would set up his palming bag and begin palming. Koji would strike in a rapid succession! Connecting on the bag it would starting to be riddled but softly to the hand, but the bag itself would be flinging back due to the force of the chakra. * - Fri Dec 11 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would rest his training and return to rest and for upcomng events.* - Fri Dec 11 05:17:52 2015

"The taking of life is a serious ordeal, and from what I heard from Trilliam sacrifices can lead to immortality. I can't risk the safety of my family on the wickedly immortal. However, I don't disriminate as Mitsunara is my secretary and I've enacted a public law on issue of sacrificing or malpractice (for our head doctors in the village). If I don't treat everyone equally how can I call them family. The souls sacrificed will be avenged not in the name of the Holy. As I don't wish to sully the name of my Heavenly father but in the name of Sunagakure. After this anyone may see me about their concern. I always keep an open mind, but for now this will be it."

Koji meant this it could be seen he ain't wavering.
