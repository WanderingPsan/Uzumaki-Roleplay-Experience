<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing Yan beckon to his Former Lord Fuji would accept his help, but want a second choice as this was the man that abandoned him and Flexus. Though he didn't hold a grudge he would be about making wise decisions when it came to covering his back... He speaks, "Yan, Fuji is a masterful ninja but I would like to see if there is another option as well.  would also ot like for himto abandon the city in its most fragile state." He would sa this with the upmost respect.* - Fri Oct  2 03:36:19 2015

No need to kill only slow but he didn't. I would like to go on a mission with people I know will have my back." But, I dont judge him he is a political leader and may had his reasons.* - Fri Oct  2 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Koji activating his Byakugan and taking his stance would block off Yan's progression. And rotate him to the ground enough to just throw him in the dirt. "It's not wise to attack our own. Especially if we are going after terrorist. Suna is about standing together. It separates us from Kiri and the other villages. We are in union here I can forgive Fuji so can you. He wasn't the one that ordered his death."* - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015

Fuji being human made a mistake in his eyes, but that wouldn't be anything he held against his Former Lord. Though, his heart would feel a bit tight at times when he gazed at him.

I wish to restore our people anyway possible, and that starts by empowering each other." Sticking out his hand to help the woman up he would  wait her response. * - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015

Stopping in his tracks he would be hesitant of a counter. He would begin to imagine kunais would be thrown not knowing the shinobi's skill. He would instinctly activate his clan's special move. 
Activating his rotation it would stop and blow back any attack made at this point. Bystanders would have to watch out as his vision would be blurred until he finished the 360 degree spin. Blowing away the flames due to the high wind speed. Upon completetion he would take his Gentle Fist stance and await his opponets move. * - Fri Oct  2 06:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) the  youg shinobi would deactivate his Gate power, and whip out a his giant shuriken for fun. But not really, slapping an explosive tag on his kunai he would throw this directly at the woman. It would land a few inches in front of her. Due to the fact that he isn't master thrower, but he compensated with the explosive tag. This would ignite as it hit the ground, and smoke would for sure envelope her sight. Allowing Koji to act without his feet being read by the ninja! 
Using his doujutsu he would also notice a surge of chakra being built into her right hand. If the concentration wasn't broken during the explosion of her backing up, and she charged forward Koji would for sure flip over her strike. Gentle Fisting the hell out of her right arm closing the chakra flow.* - Fri Oct  2 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) noticing Kirie moving backwards and didn't charge forward he would stray from pursuit.But, keep the idea to jump as a large dose of chakra built into her finger! He would, say "My dou-jutsu is a blessing." Leaping over the fire ball he would throw a kunai with an explosive tag rolled on it. This would fall inches in front of her as well. Implementing the same strategy once more he would follow up accordingly.

 If the woman sent out the exact attack again instantly Koji would have no defense for it. Though it seems the ninja shot out a blast expecting that to do him in. He was quite offended by this. She must have known the ninja would not engage the woman backing up behind smoke. Especially knowing she has built up chakra.


With the smoke once again up, and Koji charging if the ninja Kirie had nothing ready he would shoot to palm her in the Kidney. Thus she would urinate herself on the spot. This was for insulting him but he was quite confident in her ability to dodge. * - Fri Oct  2 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing the alter-reality chakra would back up out of the range of its move, and say, "I don't know what you were trying there, but it ain't happening." Koji out range of her and her tai-jutsu would become tired. He has enjoyed his spar not ever sparring with someone as talented and experienced as her before. 

He would say, "I can recognized when I'm out classed so I'm done for the day. I must return to Lord Hassan's side. Its been far too long." * - Fri Oct  2 07:36:06 2015

As you know one of the feared abilities of our Clan is the Heavenly Rotation. You will need to feel for this. So, after your mileage train yourself within this canyon behind me. There are sandworm that scurry about in there, and tend to swarm those who enter. Strike them as you pivot three hundred and sixty degrees. I did this for two weeks if you are persistent enough you can even unlock the Gate of Opening. "* - Sat Oct  3 00:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would began training his ninjutsu Heavenly Rotation by stepping into the cavern of the village. Sitting there he would activate his dou-jutsu, and see the beings lying in wait underneath the sand. As they became agitated he would take his stance, and use rotation.* - Sun Oct  4 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Beating them back from whence they came the beings would reform, and prepare for another strike. More viscous than the last time he would again release a savage chakra to repel their attack, and once more send them flying with rotation. into the dirt.* - Sun Oct  4 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) normally feels tired at this time due to his small chakra pool, but training has granted him power. Koji is now able to continue his training and even take it a step forward. Taking his stance while fousing his Byakugan would sense out the numerous of beings surfacing around him. He counts hundreds in the vacinity, but this would not fret! Waiting for them approach a certain range the ninja would seem to be hopeless in this situation. 

Until he unleashes yet again another surge of chakra! This would explode out his body in a single instant! Catching and spinning the object away from the ninja. All in the same motion acting as a shield, but these beast would be savagely thrown into the dirt as they are slashed by the spinning chakra!

The beast would return with more numbers, but this wouldn't scare Koji one bit as he prepares hs next defense. This shinobi was determined to execute this move with perfection. He needed to if he were going to restore his clan one day. As the beasts yet again form for another time to attack the young ninja. Koji would use his Byakugan to cover his blind spots, and when he secured it he would again unleash a savage Heavenly Rotation. * - Sun Oct  4 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) not backing down from the threats that present themselves to him. The ninja begins again to peer into the area, and see that the beasts still come and in great numbers. Using over half of his chakra the shinobi would now feel the fatigue set into his body. He wouldn't let this be the end however! Taking his stance, and activating his Byakugan once more to scope the area and attacks to defend. Shouting, "Rotation!."
