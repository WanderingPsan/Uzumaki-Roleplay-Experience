<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doesn't know what to expect from these individual, but he'd make distance. For the sake of himself and the cause he came for. As he backed he'd flow the chakra into his eyes, thus activating his dou-jutsu. This would give him visual prowess over the area in a range of three hundred and sixty degrees. Koji was bent on helping his village and his family, so he would collect the heads of enemies to the village. Nothing more nothing less. In this time of pondering the young Kage about Jiki. 

(He's quiet as usual but his alignment isn't with us clearly I should be careful. Though he is like family to me maybe we won't come into conflict. But..... those taxes only fair that he pays them.) 

"I accept the conditions will you allow me the head of Shin, or must the heads be of bodied I've personally slaid?" 

Koji when he asked would be respectful in nature. As he wanted to show that he does have some intellect about him and that was a free head just laying there. The rules were as stated bring ten heads of  fighters and Shin did fight alongside him many times. Koji as he asked this would stop on his trek to Shin to await the answer of Chen.* - Sat Dec 12 17:58:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have been peering through the walls with his Byakugan. As he was on alert ever sense the lady Chen gave them fair warning, and once dropped off into an unknown place this created even more anxiety. As he approached what appeared to be a person due their chakra being exposed to the Byakugan. 

Koji would shout, 

"Show yourself!" As he shouts he'd make haste to make his hand into a cross shape, thus spawing a clone be his side. The stats of this clone would be half the original's. Koji didn't like to take life uneccesarily but this was for the prosperity of his family. He had to at least try to make their living comfortable as long as he was alive even at the risk of his own life. 

After the clone spawned they both would take the stance of the Gentle Fist Style waiting for what would happen next.* - Sat Dec 12 18:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) and his clone seeing no chakra usage would peer forward, but also move forward as well toward the hidden assailant. Moving forward Koji would throw an explosive kunai toward the area where hidden figure is. Koji's clone following a step behind would do the same motion. This would probably cause the person to be alerted that they're seen, but only time will tell at this point. 

After the action Koji would wait and see his opponets motion as he prepares his own plan to engage the target head on.* - Sat Dec 12 18:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seemed to have been absent minded of the floor beneath him, and so his clone as it triggered a trap, but the clone having the abilities of Koji would also possess his visual prowess. Thus, in an attempt to secure itself by using Heavenly Palm Rotation. The explosion of chakra would deflect the trapped triggered kunais to the ground, but this would not be all that was done! The pressure would cause any traps beneath the clone to be triggered or destroyed if not already triggered from the clone's step. 

At this moment, Koji would move forward avoiding ground traps that appreared on his progression forward. His steps would be precise and accurate as he prances through the trap field. (Traps... Traps. Waatch for the traps.) Once safe Koji would rotate as well in an attempt to dispell the traps that palgued the cave floor as well.

The clone as well would make its way toward Koji taking the same way should traps be set as the clone made its way it would be prepared to protect or shield itself in the unknown but upcoming predicament. * - Sat Dec 12 19:34:33 2015

As the original Koji survived the barrage the clone would have it's luck as well. In the time that Token took to open the first gate Koji would be well prepared to face whatever dangers awaited him. In this case it would be a bold Token. To an untrained eye her speed would appear to be a blur however Koji was well equipped and trained to deal with this attack speed. 

Would avoid the attack by stepping back (It should be noted Koji's rotation had previously triggered traps.), a good margin to avoid the woman's severe leaf whirlwind attack. 
(Reflex 20.82, Speed 14.7,)

Token's attack would be fierce in nature, but perceived by Koji in time to step out of her range. Koji didn't want to miss this chance as it was clear the woman preferred to be out sight. This could also be inferred by the traps set on the ground. After Token landed in a missed attempt Koji would press forward to attack once more. Koji wanted to end this quick so he unleashed a viscious strike. Each landing on the torso region of the of the opposition. (Vital organs struck in this time would be the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and intestines repeadetly until the 64 count was completed. If Token has the proper reflexes to dodge. There should be a consideration of this occurring as she lands on the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have long perceived the entrance of the swordsmen, so he was well prepared for a backwards assualt. At the speed at which Koji finished his attack it would seem as though he didn't stop attacking, but his motion would be different as he was putting up a chakra net. Thanks to the use of the Byakugan this allowed protection for the incoming strike without turning around. Depending on the durability of the sword it might be broken on contact, but that would not be all as Shanzo would be blown back. 
(12.6 Control + Nin 8.92 = 21.52) 

Koji's clone having made it's way to Koji (previous RP unaadressed by player "Shanzo"). Would deliver an Air Palm to Shanzo as he's flung. This attack would be directed toward his lung area.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would appear to be taking an attack from behind, but the drunken man would have missed the clone due to his intoxication. This allowed for a direct attack on the drunken swordmen, but not by Koji himself... No, this would be from Koji's defending clone as it moved to divide the two. In this process Koji's clone would unleash an Air Palm toward the swordsman's torso targeting his lungs. The damage is of course halved from the original, but no less efective. This would surely impede the process of the swordsmen. As the clone posseses the same abilities as Koji it would have been able to react properly being that it was by the original.
(Stats halved - (10.76 mini damage)

Of course this means the attack would follow through thoroughly leaving Token on the ground unable to move. Thus, allowing Koji the original to regroup himself (It should be noted that this isn't a fusion but the moment after the completion of the move. Koji wouldn't at this ttime be able to defend himself during the trance of his attack. However, his clone would aas it was left unattended during the conflict.) Allowing him to deliver an Air Palm toward the swordsmen as well. This attack would be delivered toward the man's torso hitting the lungs as well. 
(12.6 Control + Nin 8.92 = 21.52) 

If both attacks are accepted this would give a total of 32.28 damage to the lungs. Causing the total destruction of the swordsman's lungs. (This would cause a period of choking before death. * - Sat Dec 12 22:07:18 2015

REPOST - Token pursed her lips as she heard traps going off and whirling winds of rotation. She waited listening while a trap was triggered by Koji but he would be fast enough to activate the second rotation and block the attack. As he was busy dealing with that she was trying to time out an attack at the right time. A burst of chakra from her mind and through her entire body as her muscles tensed and stretched in severe amounts of pain but she was used to it by now. 

Waiting for his rotation to end she then darted towards Koji. Her speed was a blur, even he would have trouble keeping an eye on her as she aimed to quickly twist her body and aim to send a sudden attack in a backwards twist of her leg in an upward attack that attacked so quickly that there was a literally whirlwind around their leg and body in the spin. After doing so they had dashed away from the male again through the traps she had already learned the locations of from testing in her own way long before Koji arrived. She had done this so quickly it would be impossible for him to track which steps she took. 

(Attack speed 11.5, tile movement 12, need to calculate the damage after buff activation)*)

(*Shanzo was laying wait, watching as the two fight. Drinking his sake and having his katana pre-drawn in his free hand as he waited for his chance to enter the fray and gain the upper hand. So when he saw his chance, he made sure to finish up his sake as he moved from the coner and ran at Koji's position as he moved backwards from Token's attack. 

With his unbalanced and wabboly steps, Shanzo held back his katana and gave Koji a sloppy but percice diagnol slash onto his shoulder. Followed by  twist of his hips as he sends his left foot to try and clip Koji off his feet. If he had succesfully tripped up Koji, he'd simply back off of him for a bit.*) -REPOST

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would ahve completed his attack briefly after the dispersement, and obtained the knowledge the approaching swordman. If not from his now available eye sight, then from the dispersed clone. The tripping of the swordsman would be odd, but he approached with a drawn blade. Which was enough to prompt Koji to rotate as the man approached. As the man's attempts would be unpredictable. They would not be unseen for the blade although illusionary in nature to Koji. He had a wide range defense allowing him secuirty! This would be rotation as the intentional drunken swordsman wasa in his strike toward the knee Koji was in the midst of exploding his chakra. 

There would a clash between the chakra expelled from Koji with the sword and its wielder. This would cause a throwback and possible mini damage if nin def isn't overbearing of the rotation. (21.52 damage reflex 20.82) 

Upon the success of the rotation Koji would turn to face the swordsmen. As the swordsman is surely recovering at that point from the throwback this would probably work in his favor as his movements are dunk by nature. And Koji is unable to tell what exactly hs moves are.* - Sat Dec 12 23:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) with the effect of rotation more or less the same. Koji would take advantage as the placed himself back on the wall. Koji woud move quicky faster than Shanzo could react or move out of the way. As he let his guard down to take a drink of his sake. Once face to face as this is assured for Shanzo could move from his postion at this time. Koji would unleash another set of 64 palms. These strikes would be directed toward the vital organs struck in this time would be the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and intestines repeadetly until the 64 count was completed.

(It should be noted that thought Shnazo's movements are unpredictable. He isn't fast enough to act on them against Koji. He would sway unpredictable but his motions would be slow enough to be perceived by Koji at the very least.)

Upon the sucess of this there shoud be to incapacitated bodies in the area. * - Sun Dec 13 00:08:28 2015
