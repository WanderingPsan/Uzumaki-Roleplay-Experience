Hokuma Koji would attempt to set the stage in his favor if he  could to cotend with such fighters. 

Koji would release a water style technique, but it wouldn't be directed toward Hiro perse rather the area right in front of his own two feet. Cause a a range of mud pitto form in front of him. * - Wed Nov 25 21:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would attempt to follow behind Izanami's incredible speed, but she would be moving rather quickly. Thus, the Koji would activate his Byakugan and channel the chakra to his feet. allowing him to walk upon the muddied surface without slippage. Upon the completion of the genjutsu being a succes Koji would not attack, but if there was a hint of an abnormality Koji would stop it and follow up after Izanmi attack being succesful or a fail. 

The attack he would use would be a new one gained, Air Palm if landed this would hit internal organs causing severe damaage. In the abdomen region.* - Wed Nov 25 21:28:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) original would be keeping the peace in Sunagakure having his wits about him he would be traversing the village with his agents,thus creating a great defense for him as they continue scouting out and destroying the intruders. It would be the Desert owl versus The Grain. The police force would have been placing civilians toward the east succesfully as Koji's clone and Izanami had the fire starter occupied. 

During this time Ai had entered the frame and would have been notified by Koji respectively on the dier situation.

The clones plan to incapacitate the individual had failed. Koji would have taken his stance and prepared himself for anothre chance to follow through on the nimble, yet powerful foe.

"Ai this man is the reason for the fires." * - Wed Nov 25 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) clone with the aide of his Byakugan would attempt to move as Hiro's attack would performed in the body. Seeing nothing but fire being expelled from the user. Koji could only assume a direct fire attack was coming, however, the peed at which it would come would be devastatingly fast! Understanding the range of the fire Koji give himself up to the mud beneath him. As he did this he would perform a water release, but knowing the damage of the attac this was all an attempt to lessen the damage. To a lesser severity. 

If failed the clone would be disperesed, but it would appear as if Koji was consumed in the flame. If successful in this attempt Koji (rather his clone) would be sheltered by a cover of mud and a release of water. 

(This however is only an attempt nothing more. If failed the clone would disperse. Returning the knowledge to the original Koji.)* - Wed Nov 25 22:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 's clone was defeated in battle by Hiro and the knowledge had been transferred back to the original in the village. Upon retaining this information Koji would seek to inform the Kage on the aftermath, however, this would be little on the personal side. As Koji's clone was consumed in the same fire as Izanami and Ai leaving his knowledge on their condition little. Knowing their ability in combat he expected them to be fine. However, he would  have valuable insight on the fire style user and his capabilities. 

Koji after receving this knowledge would make his way toward the other shinobi with a few of his agents from Desert Owl. Upon arriving to a group of individuals. Koji would ask, "How is the condition here? Have you seen any of the otehr leaders around? Also are their any water manips or fire users? We'll need your assistance soon." 

It was time to recooperate and strike back quick. As the powerful fire bender can't be left unattended for long.* - Wed Nov 25 22:39:47 2015

Koji begins to inform them//

"Hiro is the biggest threat he seems to be the core of destroying us, so lets make him priority. Plus I can't abandon Izanami. He posseses the Sharingan from my eyes I could tell that he had one more "tomoe" than Iza. (Koji wouldn't know the effects but noted it for anyone who may have come across it before.) He displayed only fire techniques one that encompassed 30 tiles rage. It's best to stop him before unleashing that again. His hand speed was on fleek as well."* - Wed Nov 25 22:56:00 2015
