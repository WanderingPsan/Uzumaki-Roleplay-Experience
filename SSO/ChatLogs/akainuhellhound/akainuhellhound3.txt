<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) High knees his way to the very top of the mansion's steps, and went to grab the broom that was left outside. Going for the broom Koji noticed that there was a letter attached to the broom it read, "Beware of dust bunnies." But never encountering such creatures Koji was confused, and just thought Mizukage was getting confused in his old age. Koji now beginning to sweep the first set of steps. Would get the idea that activating his Byakugan would increase his proficiency in the technique. "I can see it all." He would say as he swept down to the second set up steps.
From the deep crevices of the step would appear Dust Bunnies, and they were angry for Koji had swept up their dust nest. Koji's response is cold, "Didn't you hear me earlier? I can see it all!" The dust bunnies 100 of them would attack! Koji taking his Gentle Fist stance would attack. Not yet, acquiring the rotation jutsu he knew this would be a tough task indeed. Dropping the broom he would strike eight as they charged! Dodge the other 92 by sliding under them as they rose into the air. At this exact moment he would strike from below taking out 8 with a fury of fist! While sliding he would be picking up dust with his pants, but this wasn't enough to rid the second set of stairs he needed his broom. So, Koji did the unthinkable. Dove into the mass of dust bunnies, and begin to trade blow after blow until none were left. Clothes tattered, eyes blackened, and body bruised he picked up his broom and completed to sweep. 
Now down to the third set he would sweep in rotations as he wanted to practice surging his chakra in such a way to mimic his future technique. For he knew it was only a matter of time before he broke his threshold in limitations. Completing the flight of stairs. Koji would return in triumph to his Kage hours later…

I suggest we do a memorial for the late Kage. I may not have known him long, but I know he's deserving of that."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Honestly? - Fri Sep 18 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Because, if we can catch them off guard with an attack that can push them back. We can start restocking and getting supplies to the village again. - Fri Sep 18 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I reccomend surrendering, and living to fight another day. - Fri Sep 18 15:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Why not? Why start the war in the first place. They're looking for power, and they aren't going to give up a chance to gain it. - Fri Sep 18 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At least not of this land. - Fri Sep 18 15:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: Past-tense implies that he's deceased, right? - Fri Sep 18 17:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Fri Sep 18 17:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So you said we out number them. By how much? - Fri Sep 18 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'm unsure. I didn't get a chance to gather a good estimation. - Fri Sep 18 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just a thought. I'm not really a good war planner...but it makes sense to me. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: And with a reinfornced barrier by Niza, the village will remain protected. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: What is this about attacking? - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We're risking a longer and extended battle, where if you go all in. We can quickly wipe one force away. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The army will be able to retreat before Zetsumo shows up, that much is certain if we place the attack at the furthest point from him. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Then retreat back if its a must. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What do you think, Hassan? Raikage? - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hassan is the one with the idea of a full force attack - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Oi Fujitora. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
