(Preggers, huh? Yup ignorance has put me in quite the pickle.) 

"Well, I hope you aren't holding a grudge and no I won't understand your pain but I know you feel it like everyone else. But, you're not alone we're in a post war period Sanoke and even the clan member s of Desert Owl have been helping to clear the area of the dead. No one individual is the center of life, but that doesn't make you any less of a blessing to us. Sanoke is taking on a roll he didn't want and you're having kids. One could debate all day whose woes are worst." 

Koji pauses// (Koji woulld ignore certain question DUE TO THEIR IRRELEVANCE like being alone because his family was hunted dow nand slaughtered. He was later adopted by a jaanese family and they raised him and his three brothers. Hell Kuro was alone now the Hokumas were the only thing keeping him happy. Koji understood coming from the life of slumville wasn't easy.) 

"Way I see it if you're contemplating hurting yourself... You're being just as inconsiderate as Sanoke. I say that because you're pregnant. Your body is their body at the moment. You think I like empathy? I have compassion for you all it's why I put myself in danger knowing well the entire outcome is death. I may not understand coupling of others, but I understand love and that's what I have for the Hokumas and this village." 

Koji had been paying attention in is biology class. Shoot he was trying to become the top student of his class. However, it wouldnt be easy competing with Trilliam and Izanami. * - Mon Nov 30 07:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) a bit flustered about recent events with Mirai would continue his training. Pressing forward it would be a while before he's ready to forgave her for her actions and words. This process clouded his mind, but he would focus as best he could. Koji begins to channel his chakra as he thinks about the girls frustration and he strikes into the air once more using an Air Palm. 

His motion would be as a traditional Kamehameha a brief motion as he releases it into the moutain's side. The wind would disperse as it impacted the rock causing a wind to fill the area. Blowing his hair back into the air.* - Mon Nov 30 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) didn't like to bottle his emotions as he felt it would only tarnish him and his mind. So, as the shinobi channeled his chakra he would feel the pressure of the events, but he would release in motion with his exhalation of breathe. Creating a fluid motion and displaying proper chakra control throughout the process. Upon the finish of the release Koji would say to himself, 

"I can't believe how upset I am. It's like I can't let it go. Everytime I replay the events... Gragh!" 

Koji would release another Air Palm toward the wall in fury, but he wouldn't feel any better being told to basically fuck off really angered the boy. As he felt that Mirai direspected not only him but the clan. Even beyond that! The pride of Sunagakure. Koji wouldn't stand for such a thing as he fought to prevent such a thing. Training the body must incorporate the training of the spirit and mind. 

Time passing briefly Koji would be seeking to improve every ounce of his being. As he had slacked due to official proceedings. Koji would take his stance and close his eyes, and in his mind wouldn't be a calm sea at rest. No it would be a raging sea! Turmoil was running rampant within the ocean, thus Koji was beyond upset. This could be seen his expression of Jutsus and moves! In the release of another Air Palm. Koji's eyes would be seen with raw anger, but with each release of the move Koji's strain would relieve itself.* - Tue Dec  1 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be exerting more of himself a bit more than usual in his training as Koji would be fighting off the anger that dwelled inside him. This would be a tedious process as Koji did his best not to fall pray to hate. Koji would take a brief moment and meditate on his knees. His eyes would be shut and he would be speaking softly, 

"Lord, I need your help rigt now to stop this anger from consuming me. I'm so fulll of it right now, because of the events that have passed. I don't want to be like that. However, i can't simply leave my people to such a faith of lunacy and irrational behavior. Help me keep my collectiveness but bring prosperity to my people." Koji would be praying to the Christianity God established by Bryson in Sunagakure. After he was finished Koji would gather himslef breathe out and say, "Let us do this. I can't let the family down." 

Koji would release an air palm without hesitation and continue mastering the form of his jutsu. Without second thought Koj iendures the spiritual and physical strain.* - Tue Dec  1 00:24:19 2015

Koji would have a lower demeaner than usual his swagger was disrupted by the rudeness and harsh things told to him by his fam. He was still trying to cope in the inside, but the outside he wore a smile. This was him being strong for the village. They can't know a leader is crying on the inside.

"It really is good to see you. I know... A morale booster as well.. It's not easy havng your comraddes turn on you in battle. Some are a bit weary now, but I think the festival will cure that." 

Koji's chill manner would seem to magically appear it would seem as if a motherly touch or older sibling's touch caused a warm rejuvenating feeling in Koji's spirit. The solidified water known as ice had become luke warm, thus Koji found peace with his friend Kiyoko. 

"How are things with you?"

Koji would have a bit of a shocked look on his face as he heard the two shinobi discuss the jutsu.. (Paralysis and Shreding! That's a bit much!.)

"Yep festival, Sanoke asked for an event and Chikyu brought up a festival. It was too brilliant on her part haha. I think the village will love it." In light of recent event the young chief would probably be speaking more for himself than the village. As Sunagakure was strong in spirit it seems as though the village as a whole can rise through the deepest and darkets of pits. But, it's not to say some villagers don't share Koji's sentiments of the war. So many bodies had laid wasted in the battle. Unable to help the cries of the dying as threats were to rampant and danerous to be left unattended. Many things laid heavy on the people, but as a collective they would be gathering themselves. These climatic moments showed Koji what it truly meant to be strong, and what it meant to be weak. 

"The fact that you're carrying on doing what you do. Shows a lot about your character and strength. Glad someone like you is my friend haha. I know where to go when I'm not right in the noggin!"

 This remark was meant to show Koji may be ignorant of all the Kiyoko had lost, but not ignorant that she has indeed lost a lot. Even if he didn't know exactly.  In regard to how he was doing he reply, 

"For the most part okay, but there's pain in the hest every once in the while. Nothing I can't handle haha. 

Koji was indeed heart broken at the losses and he could tell the pain in others existed. Thirteen and life was going against the grain for this young boy. * - Tue Dec  1 08:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) be pissed from high heaven down to Hueco Mundo. He gives Mirai the silent treatment. He be offended and butt hurt. He's thirteen years old and human its normal for him to have his feelings hurt for all the good he attempts to do. Sketched in the nerves of his brain cells are many words they are as follows, 

"God forgives I don't... I want you to go rogue. So, I don't have to see your disgusting face... Pig." 

Koji be butt hurt by these words the look on his face is abnormal for the young shinobi. He always repsonds nobly and with a smile to mask his expressionless eyes. While presenting an aura of tranquility equal to a smooth flowing ocean, but not today that would be gone. This teenager has the face of a stoic toward her Hi. Would it be a simple task to regain his kindness? Siblings raging at each other is normal though, so would anyone pay it mind? Is Koji too far in his feels? The child did just witness the biggest war of his life aside from Zetsumo attacking Kiri. The young boy was coping with shit.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) despite all odds is easy to forgive. Koji was taught never to shed tears in public because that was rude. But, it hurt him more to try and act mad at Mirai. Trying to keep a stone face was hard, thus it broke and tears flowed down his cheeks. In this moment he'd embrace Mirai's hug and give one back as well.

"I thought you were going to leave. It made me all kinds of things I felt like crap even while meditating. I'm sorry you're going through so much I wish I could help.." 

Koji be a compasionate soul he knew how to weep for a nigga. The slums taught him to spare no tear for a homie. In this time you could really see the tender heart of the thirteen year old. Most could see it when he spent time with Kiyoko she was a good motherly figure aside from his adoptive parents. 

It should be noted Koji is looking offf so that he doesn't show shame on his face. He must keep the pride of the Hokumas.* - Tue Dec  1 17:54:46 2015
