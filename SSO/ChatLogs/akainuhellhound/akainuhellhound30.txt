<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had begun studying his scroll rigorisously, and after such practice he would stand tall and ready as he begun to channel the chakra throughout his body. While creating an hand sign in the shape of a cross. The shinobi was seeking to advance his shinobi skills, and master of this would make him jump forward by a mile. * - Sat Nov 21 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) However, mastering this technique would take the same exponential grrowth to perform such a move. Koji as he stood would be in dee focus as sought to perform the technique. Wasteing no time the shinobi was training vigorosly to master such a feat. 

The scroll would lay prompted above of al level that met with his eyes. Koji would be looking up attempting to conjure up another version of himself. This process was tedious as he mimiced the necessary chakra flow from the scroll. However, it wouldn't be easy as this was the tricky part. It required a balance and that's where the time consumption began.

As a proper clone wouldn't appear unless the chakra was just on point as the handsign. In utter concentration Koji attempts to manifests another version of himself, but he didn't want to fail on the first go, so he held himself until the chakra flow was just right. His mind was geared to completing this techniques as he had witnessed its usefulness many times during battle and he would often think how it would be if he used such a technique. 

As he held the chakra through his body in attempt to let it flow steady Koji would grunt// 

"Lets do this. Nrggghaa." These would be light screeches but anything loud and sporadic. Something to show he was really grinding out the flow of his chakra. Koji needed the feel for move if he was going to perform it in multitudes. And use it wisely in combat. Koji began to think to himself, 

<This will benefit me greatly.> I will be able to perform quite a number of moves from indiviuduals.> He was imagining an over powering force of nature within his strikes and mathod. Corner and down the enemy as quickly as possible, but precisely as possible as well. As these thoughts rummagd through his mind not a single stride in progress would be wasted.

If one were al to they'd see the shinobi being quite strong in nature as he channeled consistenty the chakra throughout his body. Koji would be gauging the proper chakra levels as he attempted to perform this technique. Saying to himself, "Not enough, too much, not quite there yet." He was being taught this alone so the effort was tenfold and much more rigorous. But, this was teachyaselfgakure, and it was rough out there in the land of Sunagakure. But, not impossible life to live as Koji was trying to help make it a little better that's why Desert Owl is around.

Time would pass and Koji in te distance coud still be seen surfacing his chakra from the inner body point of where chakra is resonated. The boy was tedious in his dealing showing no remorse for the fatigue. He was always able to go beyond the normal length of exhaustion and today was a testiment to such a fact as the young boy stood strong. His body would face the scroll and in position as it stated, and body conjuring the chakra necessary to perform the move correctly. * - Sat Nov 21 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would begin to break into sweat as he grunted out the performance, but these grunts were not the grunts of quitting. No these were the grunts of a boy pushing forward in his training. Staring at the paper the ninja begins to work out the moves associated with this next technque. I
<If Iflourish properly and effetively I can create a ginormous effect of a barrage if you will.> 

So, he began trying to fathom the moves as he attempted in bringing the move in to fruition. Time would pass yet again but he would show no sign of giving in to fatigue. Koji was destroying the barrier that would try to impede him from conquering this move and that is impatience and exhaution. If he could feel out the right point Koji knew he could develop the jutsu without fail, so he sat and channeling. 

His focus on one agenda and that is performing the scroll's technique that was raised before him. As he knew this would flourish his combatant skills as a shinobi. And, with times getting rough he needed such a move if he'd hope to keep the peace of Sungakure from recklessness and evil. He needed to be strong and this jutsu would allow that. Evil was growing rapidly and he had to do his part in keeping it at bay. In this time of reflection Koji was enduring the process of channeling his chakra to a proper poroportion throughout the body. 

* - Sat Nov 21 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would bestressing and would feel as though he reached a point in which he needed to try and now put out the chakra. As he felt he had gotten as close as he was going toget at this point in his training. Koji having his eyes reared on the scroll would have his stance solidified at this point. Thus, the hand signs were already in place and within moment Koji would say, "Shadow Clone Jutsu." Their would be a tiny puff forming around Koji and this was from the release of chakra not magic, so it's not as if the clone appeared out of the smoke. Rather the smoke was a respone to the process involved in the creation. 

The smoke would clear and what wsa beheld was not a perfect clone. This was flimsy in nature and just drained in appearance. Koji was quite disappointed, but he understood he did hold back his chakra levels in this attempt on the last second as he wasn't confident enough. Koji would think to himself, 
<Come on man, get this there isn't a reason why you can get this... I have to stop being soft.> 

These aren't cray thoughts but something we've all done in our regular lives when motivating ourselves to  do something. Koji would be saying this as he stared at the briefly materialized clone. Being that the chakra wasn't adequately placed the clone itself couldn't sustain itself for a brief moment. Koji would say, "Alright I know I wanted to do this in one go, but that wasn't going to happen. Failure accompanies succes.. Thankfully that failure gave me insight that the amount of chakra used that time wasn't enough. Now, let us try again to get this right." 

Koji taking his stance once more would put up the hand sign and focus his chakra. With that last clone in his mind he knew one thing he'd have to put out more chakra than last time, or the insubtantial amount will leave the clone weak and unstable. That won't due in combat and Koji knew that so he continued his practice in the justsu. Time would pass as he channeled his chakra once more throughout the bosy. Taking his time in getting the right feel for the move. Spending so long the first attempt Koji had an inate feel for what was insufficient, so he was able to manage pas this point. However, just because he put more in doesn't mean it was the peak of insufficency. His failure only told him he needed to put more in and nothing more. * - Sat Nov 21 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would appear to be more fatigue as the time progressively passes and hs grunts would come off more violent than before. But, these would be at a volime that would cause some kind of alarm, rather a perception of his practice regime. Holding fast to his stance Koji would be performing the hand sign with ease, and in a trance as he distributed his chakra throughout his entire body. Once the point of insufficiency was met in the last attempt Koji would say, 
"Now, flood the flow some more. This isn't enough. Ngrrh." 

Koji distributes more chakra from his pool as he attempts to lets out more chakra. Without hesitation Koji pressed forward at this point without fail. This process would take awhile as Koji didn't want to spike the chakra so swiftly. As he wouldn't be able to feel out the right point exactly, thus causing a impediment in the training. Koji's eyes would be focused on studying the scroll along with his mind. Koji would be in one place, but at the same time at two. 

Koji was like this is how it must be to have a clone two minds acting as one in sense. Retaining the knowledge from the scroll Koji was thinking that he's close to completing this move and he would put forth more in his time to complete the move. The chakra would flow through him like a well regulated water dam. Being funneled here and there without fault, but in accordance to a manual. This was a keen trait to Koji's personality. As he was like water and law in spirit!! Well regulated and steady flowing this was what it meant to be Koji. 

As time continued to flow Koji would still be in his spot trying to reach an acceptablep point wasting no chakra Koji was going to release at an approiate time. <Come one, keep it going Koji lets get this, this time!> Again, this is nothing strange this is just self motivation in thought or self critiquing. * - Sat Nov 21 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) still channeling the chakra to throughout his body Koji would finally realease the chakra in what would appear to be surge! What would be expressed from this action is another clone, but not in the sense of the traditional, nor in the sense of the last! This clone would be bloated in nature and sluggish! Koji would look upon the clone and say, 

"Mehhh, so we have the high and low now. That's at least progress none the less."

 The bloated clone of Koji would attempt to walk but would combust into nothing on the first step. Koji at this pont would be determined to complete and master this jutsu and he was c onfident he was close at this point as he had proved to be able to release two clone... Even though they were a bit deformed and imperfected it showed Koji there was a point in the middle he needed to reach. 

With that knowledge given to him Koji would take a break and dine on lunch before continuing focusing his chakra cause much fatigue and he needed the rest and energy at this point. The young shinobi had always been sure to manage himself well in nourishment and hygiene, so this is no surprise that's he stop to do this action. Sitting in the sand Koji would take a drink of water as this is the revitalizing liquid of the body, then he'd pull out some garlic ramen tfrom the shop that imported fresh veggies and noodles from konoha! After which he would burp wipe his mouth, and go home to perform some bodily functions. 

Koji on his way back to his training ground would say, 
"Attached to every great training is grat rest!"* - Sat Nov 21 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would then set himself up to begin training once more in mastering the scroll he had set before himself. Performing the stance once more Koji would say, "We're close lets get this done!" 

Koji would feel for the point in between the two points he hit recently in practicing. The low flimsy clone and the high bloated clone. Koji would have not only the image of these two engraved in his mind, but the feels for their chakra points as well and he know that it coudln't be too overly distributed or too under-distributed. Keeping these two concepts n mind Koji begins his channeling!

"Garghh." Under his breathe he griunts becasue even though he performed the necessary break the moves would have taken their toll ofr the day. Koji would wouldl perservering through the the hardship of exhaustion at this point more heavily than the beginning. * - Sat Nov 21 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would allowing the chakra to course through the body would be transferring the chakra high and low as he felt the feel for the exact point, and after awhile he would then come to the point in which he felt serenity bewtween the two ponts and in a matter of seconds Koji would disperse a clone of proper porportion of himself. Koji would say, 

"This is amazing never did I expect such a great techniques to be in my possesion it is truly tremendous." 

With that Koji dispersed the clone and headed home to rest properly and then head to the square afterward for the survaillance of the village. * - Sat Nov 21 17:59:02 2015

Koji thinks, (Hope they have the bedny straw.) As the food prepared there would  be the scent of lemon spice and garlic eradiating from the kitchen. As the aroma tickled the customers' noses the singe of Soy sauce hitting the hot plate would begin to imminate the dining area. As this took place Koji would embrace the smell and let out a delighted sigh// 

"So, what's up? I actually have news for ya but you go first."* - Sat Nov 21 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would act his genuine manner as well, but he'd eat hastely once his food arrived. 

"Hahah, catching up is good no one does that anymore. Training is very serious but I understand why... And... My eyes?? Hmm well I'm all for surpises lets see, then..

Koji would channel the chakra too his eyes and activate his Byakugan, thus revealing what was wanting to be shown to Koji by Lera.* - Sat Nov 21 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have been sipping on orange juice at this time, so as soon as he got a glimpse he'd turn and spit. Cough* Cough*//

"Wooah there, I've only seen a partial transformation of Tetsu, and that's some overwhelming chakra ya have there. And that sword... It's a strange one haha. Should I be jealous or scared ha." 

Koji would be in marvel at Lera's growth because he was thirteen and tis was beyond anything he'd ever seen. His curiosity truly over-ruled him at this moment.* - Sat Nov 21 20:35:12 2015

"Wow, you're something special... Three. I only have one and here you are mixing them... Please don't I can only imagine the effect." 

Koji scratches his head... "Can your sword do that as well?"

It was clear their chakra had a connection, so he was wondering how the relationship worked between Lera and her sword.* - Sat Nov 21 20:47:08 2015

"Samehahda seems awesome and the fact that you're handlng the sword is a testament. But moving on, you seem to have a good amount of control of your new technique. Judging by the focus it's a heavy hitter. I can't wait to see it in action."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had been in the biology course, but to know that a jutsu was capable of this...
"Wow. I can see how Samehada might not like that.. That would have to be in a drastic situation. If something has to be broken apart for this to work, then it would be ideal to have something capable of regenerating as a comparable rate."

Koji was throwing some ideas he learned from Biology class. As the body acts to repair itself instantly when damage occurs. Of course, the process of that is slow, so you would need something able to channel without being broken down. Koji had never come across such a thing, but Lera might be able to.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Was he fast? - Sat Nov 21 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But, his nin was rather weak however. - Sat Nov 21 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: His attacks were fast but his reflexes were among the slowest. - Sat Nov 21 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Due to his age I assume he was able to channel outside chakra to add to his own. Allowing great physical feats. - Sat Nov 21 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But, he wouldn't utuilize his own chakra. It would be too much of a drain for him. - Sat Nov 21 21:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its hard to hide your identity and remain inconspicous when you wield a sword like this. - Sat Nov 21 21:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...? - Sat Nov 21 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) waking from a mid day nap would have a refreshed expression on his face. 

"Yeah, its been awhile they overworked me, so I've been in a slumber haha.... A deep slumber haha. As Koji spoke his one hand would be combing through his head while the other just stationed itslef next to his hip." * - Sun Nov 22 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose that's expected. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess it would be a bit too much to ask for your assitance. Well, more or less your guidance. - Sun Nov 22 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm? My guidance? - Sun Nov 22 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes.  To be more exact, I wish for you to teach me a technique. I've spoken to you about it prior. I'm not sure if you recall. - Sun Nov 22 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I remember lets go talk. - Sun Nov 22 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would bring Kuro to a giant rock that would conceal them from peering company and that sort,so they could talk in private about stuff about stuff.

Koji leans against the standng earth and speaks, 

"I don't mind helping you, but my family has voted we only teach our family members. So, I can't teach you anything without proper cause or tradeoff. I don't want to insult our policies. We Hokumas do our best to live by the law of each otehr and Sunagakure." 
* - Sun Nov 22 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) began to tap his foot on the dirt as he leaned on the standing earth//

"These things are complicated and I don't want to force anyone to do anything they don't want to in these kind of cicrumstances. It hurts a little because I know you're a good person, but Mirai would kick my butt if she found out hahaha. Personally I learned on m own and I don't see why you can't. ou're a phenomenal martial artist." 

Koji didn;t want to say fighter as that would be a bit out tof the man's character, so he said Martial artist. As art for the most part was meant to be a peaceful way of expressing one's self and their belief. 

"Another way I guess is you can join the family. Wouldn't hurt ya know, we take care of each other and the police force is really shapng into better character. Mirai is starting to show compassion. And the other officers watching over Trilliam get along great with others.. Although most see them as scary.... Walking around with epressionless eyes will do that hahahah."* - Sun Nov 22 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) laughs at the question// 

"Family comes and goes but what holds them close is love. This isn't your home so I wouldn't bind you here. Carrying our name will harbor unconditional love from us. We only want to protect each other. When one is in danger we're all in danger. But, once family you're always family, because family never break ties.Personally hesitation is normal for a life changing decision, so I don't blame you. However, keep in mind that I treat everyone's practice as the person themself, so you'll never be asked to abandon them.... Well unless you're killing folks to raise the dead hahhah."  * - Sun Nov 22 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) face would present a smile to Kuro... Well a bigger one as he was alrady laughing a bit lightly from the conversation.

"Well, Mirai calls me her cousin so I guess we would be cousins as well. Because I do have two other brothers... To be exact we're triplets haha. But, I see you all as close as them." 

Koji's words were as water as that was his natural element, so whne he spoke it would be this engulfing feeling of chillness. 

"Personally I think you'll be the greatest addition to the family. You're able to keep a calm mind and see the paths of right and wrong even in the midst of battle. That is necessary even when upholding the law. Also naturally you're apart of the force, but you don't have to act. If you're worried or it threatens your practice you're free to call one of us. I don't ever want you to feel pressured. As a family we're here to relieve any pressure we can."* - Sun Nov 22 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Wait, the family is the police force as well? - Sun Nov 22 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yep, Hassan's order actually it's his way of keeping track of things. - Sun Nov 22 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: He be lazy haha. - Sun Nov 22 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Heh. I suppose so. - Sun Nov 22 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What should I know about the clan? - Sun Nov 22 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well, naturally having respect to others is the main rule. Grandmother always stressed that and never go anywhere without telling someone. We want to know where you are at all time so we can find you if you're in trouble. - Sun Nov 22 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That makes sense. - Sun Nov 22 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Oh! Mirai is second head of the clan! - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Aah. - Sun Nov 22 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: She's getting married soon, so I might give her the head position as a gift if she shows mrore growth in the future. - Sun Nov 22 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Married? - Sun Nov 22 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To who? - Sun Nov 22 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Sanoke, of course haha. Have you never seen those love bugs waltzing around? - Sun Nov 22 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. I haven't. - Sun Nov 22 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've been busy meditating a lot lately. - Sun Nov 22 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I would like them to be the head of the family if it seems appropriate at the time. It will truly mark the rebirth of our people. - Sun Nov 22 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: 'Well, since we are family now I guess I have the power to allow you passage into the Lightning Temple if need be. I'm the heir to the head monk position there. - Sun Nov 22 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So if anything happens, you can always come to the temple. - Sun Nov 22 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I understand, they happen to be around often in my presence. Thank you Kuro but I wouldn't want to foil your traditions. There's blood on my hands. I could never. - Sun Nov 22 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Tainted hands or not, we help those in need. It's our way of life. - Sun Nov 22 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But! Hokuma, Kuro it's time to have your initiation! It shall be learning the technique you asked for! - Sun Nov 22 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) drops a tear// 

"The Temple be swag."* - Sun Nov 22 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. I'm ready. - Sun Nov 22 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: The Temple be swag? Huh? - Sun Nov 22 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) taking a stance would begin to say,
 "Flow like water, feel the chakra move through your body let it reach your eyes and tips of your palm. Envision the EIght tri-gram circle within it is your range of attack. All chakra points are visible to your eyes in this circle." 

As Koji spoke this his eyes would activate and he would strike swiftly in a forward and backward motions. In this succession or series of attakcks it would be sixty-four strikes. Kuro would and should be able to follow with his eyes rather easily. * - Sun Nov 22 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: You're a natural! - Sun Nov 22 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you. - Sun Nov 22 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've trained a lot to focus my mind. - Sun Nov 22 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The mind is key in eveything we do. - Sun Nov 22 08:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It is..I have Yukio's training to thank for it. - Sun Nov 22 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yukio seems like a good person, then. Well I hate to cut our time short but I'm a bit tired  from the day's work. - Sun Nov 22 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's understandable.  - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll let you go to bed. In the mean time, I'll focus on more of my techniques. - Sun Nov 22 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Alright cuzo don't stress yourself. Proper rest accompanies a great traning regime! - Sun Nov 22 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Koooooji. - Sun Nov 22 09:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Heh. - Sun Nov 22 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) jumps a bit// 
"Oh no! Your face is getting a bit colored. I'll be sure to carry some medicine for you from now on. But, I'm happy for you two. Are you going to share the same wedding day with Mirai and Sanoke?" 

Koji had been given a great deal of news today that blew his mind, and his little thirteen year old heart was overwhelmed at all the exciting news. His face would be sullied with a ginormous smile. Koji's grandmother never spoke about love, but he had learned a few things attending school on his days off of work. And his knowledge would stem from biology mostly, and he understood wedding just to be a big celebration for mates getting together. 

Koji innocent in nature of these kind s of things would ask, "Are you guys going to have kids?"* - Sun Nov 22 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: How are they gonna have kids? - Sun Nov 22 09:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) bows//
"I'm sorry Kiyoko didn't mean to make you nervous."  Koji would rise and comb his hand through his dreads//

"If Sanoke is the best man, then we're all kind of family now haha. It seem I've been blessed ever since Kiyoko arrived haha. Kuro has also joined the family I can't wait to celebrate these moments."

Koji's smile would still be radiating as he spoke, but his expressionless eyes would vanish as they closed due to the upheval of Koji's cheeks. (Boy was he smiling.)* - Sun Nov 22 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: He's really happy about it. - Sun Nov 22 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: What does he me--oh... they are related by that? - Sun Nov 22 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) bows again// 
"You're welcome, sorry for my smile at this point of the day it's impossible not to. This day really shows what Sunagakure is all about. Koji would post up here to sllep as the vibes were just emitting a divine energy. Koji wanted to bathe in this. If ever the village is said to have a heart of its own the events to today would proved to be the life sustained by it. 

Koji thinks, (Mirai and Sanoke, Kiyoko and Lera, Ai and Mizora, and now Kuro.What more could I ask for the family seems complete.) Koji would rest as he pondered on these thoughtss. As it has beena long day for the young lad.* - Sun Nov 22 09:47:56 2015
