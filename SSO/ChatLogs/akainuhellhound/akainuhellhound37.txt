<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing Sanoke lead the charge he understood this Zhen character was a true threat. He had already cause suspicion with his question, so this would cause Koji to step up as a shinobi must be ready to defend his village from impending threats. 

As Sanoke strung his jutsus Koji would channel the chakra to his eyes, thus activating his Byakugan. Revealing the tenketsu of the body and much more of course. At the time when the man would presumably be restrained Koji would take his stance and prepare for a follow up move behind his Kazekage.* - Sat Dec  5 07:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing the words of Sanoke would follow up on them. At the time he wouldn't ask for anyone to visit. As this was a fellow clansmen and it was best to try and resolve any issues they may have if he saw fit of course to resolve. (He being Zen). 

"Thank you Lord Megatron. - omit megatron-" 

Koji walks with his Byakugan active to see the success of the sealing technique, After confirming he'd handle the man and take him to the prison. There he would receive treatment for his injuries and then questioned. Or the other way around... Who knows right. Now walking back to the village with the man Koji would say, 

"Mirai if you want to attend you can. If not that's fine as well." 

Koji would be walking at a steady pace, so he would hear any words spoken as he passed ayone who wished to speak to him. But if no further question would be ask Koji would proceed to the prison of small pace unhindered. * - Sat Dec  5 08:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) calls for nurses to do what they could for the time being for the man.He would direct them to keep him concious at all cost. As the nurses did their job Koji would call for two guards of Desert Owl and also of the Hokuma clan as they are the new police force of Sunagakure. 

Mitsunara would be sitting outside the cell as the guards occupied the area with the nurses.

Koji would return shortly after speaking with his comrade.* - Sat Dec  5 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) scratches his head as she spoke, but understood that if a killing did have to be done. She didn't say anything too crazy although this was his clansmen. So, Koji wants a chance to get to know the man before his time. Koji is a man of the law and it's clear he came to terrorize which is enough for death. Well  was during the Hassan Regime. It will depend on Sanoke's ruling now that he was the Kazekage and hasn't really been known to be the death sentencing type. Sealing away his chakra forever might be his way of a death sentence. 

"If I need you I'll call you, Most likely if he doesn't give me straight answers I'll leave him for you to interrogate, but I don't expect you to kill him during interrogation.No matter the pleasure or aggitation. But I'll leave him in your devices if he doesn't give me anything... To be honest I know nothing of the interrogation process, but having him healed just to be tortured sounds pretty cruel... Fair?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says, 
"Aplogies unlike my brothers she not one I leave to take care of herself. But she's becoming older so more and more privleges. If you'll excuse me--." 

Koji gently places his sis against the spectators rows of the arena and walks toward Mizora. Alright I can show you them Mizora lets get to it. Everyone here for the most part has seen these moves, so Koji wasn't hesitant to train Mizora in the spotlight. Normally he'd leave, but who knows maybe this would show how amazing the clan really was in Sunagakure. (Or they must just be too engulfed.)

"Alright channel your chakra into the palms like so--." 

Koji begins to take the Kamehameha form as this was how he learned. This allowed easy control over the pressure begin brought about through the channeling.Once at a prople gauge Koji would release into an empty area. One who could sense or read chakra could see such an invisible attack. (4rps)

After Mizora had shown knowledge and prowess of this technique Koji would pop up a clone and strike it. But, it wouldn't be a normal strike this would be the rapid 64 Palms technique. Once successfully completed the clone woud disperse rather quickly(4rps.)

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: So the first technqiue is practically a wider-ranged version of mine. - Sun Dec  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Well, farther. - Sun Dec  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes and it targets the internal organs. - Sun Dec  6 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Alright... - Sun Dec  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Time to give it a go. - Sun Dec  6 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: A true prodigy! You're skillfull haha. - Sun Dec  6 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Thanks, want me to show you my Eight Trigrams technique, now? - Sun Dec  6 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) nodded gratefully// 
"Of course, what is it? And should I stand back?" 
Not knowing what she'd posibly unleash Koji was simply being cautious. As the moves they utilize can sometimes be a bit lethal.* - Sun Dec  6 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mm... - Sun Dec  6 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be paying close attention so much so that he activated his Byakugan to sense out exactly what Mizora was doing. Koji would see an explosion of chakra leaving the body, but precise and controlled. He had seen this move twice now. From the terrorist that attacked yesterday and his little sister Tsuki. He marveled at the utility of the move. As he seem to direct the weak points of a jutsu, thus dispelling them without fail. 

"That truly is a unique technique. More direct than Hevenly Rotation and more precise. I like... Let me try it out." 

Koji creates a clone to attempt the jutsu on.* - Sun Dec  6 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) using his Byakugan channels the chakra throughout his body as he faces the clone. He'd be building up an immense amount of chakra similar to the Heavenly Rotation, and as he focused on this task. Koji also focused on the clones weak point. If dont correctly the clone would disperse without resistance as the weak point would succumb to the accuracy. In moments Koji was ready, so he released, but at last... The surge that was release from him was not enough the clone though hit still stood. (What happened? Why couldn't Koji get it right?) 

The boy wasn't accurate enough in the release. For him it was easier with Air Palm he was used to containing and release, but this move would be all release and no containment. So, Koji now tries again in the endeavor to learn this technique from Mizora. Koji murmurs to himself, 

"Come on just like Air Palm." 

Koji more focused on his clone builds the chakra in his body. Focusing it on the points of the clone that still stood. And that moment of focus Koji thinks, (Got it.). FWOOSH! A swift release of powerful chakra is thrusted toward the clone singling out the weak points and thus dispersing it effectivel and without fail.* - Sun Dec  6 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But, I'm going to take my little sister home. If ya need stop by anytime. There's another one of our clansmen in prison. You have authority to visit him if you want. - Sun Dec  6 04:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes, we don't know much about him but he has connections with Edge. So, he isn't quite fond of us. - Sun Dec  6 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Would you like help with taking Tsuki home? - Sun Dec  6 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) as the tri enter the home of Koji the usual scent would be gone. As Yan hadn't been there anymore to light the doobie. Now it was scented with flavors picked out by Tsuki. As she usually knew best on these type of things. The aroma was close to caramel and chocolate. Mixing with Mizora's minty fragrance.

"Thank you Mizora I appreciate the help. How have things been?"

Koji heads out into the kitchen and gets out ingredients to bake for his sister he had been studying a cake book and he wasa going to put her face into the cake and give it to her. Sense she was asleep this was the perfeect time to surprise. * - Sun Dec  6 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) as he's in the frame of the kitchen pre heats that oven to the proper temperature,so Tsuki wouldn't get sick. After Mizora asked about Tsuki he'd respond, 
"She's gentle in nature and doesn't like to fight. She'd rather heal so she's becoming a a doctor. Can't wait to see her accomplish her dream." 

Koji now begins mixing the good stuff into a bowl.* - Sun Dec  6 05:05:29 2015
