<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be arriving with the squad he gathered. This made him admire those that ran to battle with him. Koji would have his Byakugan active and would sense not only the fierce chakra surging, but the approach of his Lord.  As he ran up to the group en route to the heated battle Koji would give him a more detailed briefing. 

"A blue haired man is the result of the fire and he possesses the Sharingan. Also Ai,  Iza, and my clone were downed during combat. It would appear that some huge chakra is coming from her vicinity as well. Matching or surpassing Tetsu's transformation." 

(This would be the time for anyone who wanted to dip to grab their Doritos and go. As the briefing was en route.)

Once arrived at the battlefield Hiro would be seen running away as he was still in Koji's sight. This information was whispered to Hassan as he whispered to himself. The Bijuu would be seen in rather unique form and charging a blast in the direction of Hiro. From this point Koji was in his stance keeping his mind ready for anything. KOji had a sense of fear about him, but this is common fear is what keeps a man alive and avoiding recklessness. (n example of this was the death of Izzutora a fearless man.)* - Wed Nov 25 23:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would follow up the wind released by his Lord with his own giant shuriken, however this would be tagged with explosives. If allowed these woud travel at the same speed as Hassan's, but follow up there after being that his shurikens had released first. After the phase of Hassan's attack Koji's tagged shuriken will be activated in hopes of making a dodge unavoidable for the transformed Ai. 

After this act Koji would make a clone of himself and prepare a way to impede the movement of the viscous being that laid in front of them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing the Kage's words would pause his initial movement , so he could avoid the pistol whip breathe from Hassan. Upon the success of Hassan's attack Koji would follow up with his clone next to him releasing a double Air Palm technique. Though the shadow clone works at fifty percent effeiciency of the original. This would be enough to increase the overall effect ot the internal organs of the beast.

As Koji and his clone peered down on the beast Koji would release it toward the cranium on downward toward the lower functioning organs. This would be cause due to the stance of the Bijuu. (Attmept to pierce brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc.) 

(Original Koji nin + control = 18/ clone nin + control = 9 ) - Internal damage * - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would sit where stood and what would be around him are bodies. Piled ontop of one another horitonally and vertically flesh would stand in the sand. Imprints of left in the dirt. Koji would throw himself in the feels and take in the aftermath of war. A thirteen year old would seek wsdom again once more. As war loosens his tug on the thing called life. It wouldn't help that his Kage left as well, but he nderstood his term would be short. Koji would sit amongst his brothers' and sisters' souls. 

Staring into the sky Koji would sniff and there would be the potent smell of flesh in the desert. Hearing Trilliams question he'd say softly and distracted, "Of course Trilliam you're free." 

As those words pierced his lipsalog with his tongue he would feel a bit of lightness overwhelm his heart. But pain would be heavy still as he sat in the scene of war.

( How could anyone take this seen lightly? For some this war was spontaneous and without reason. We fought for our lives today and preserved it. Where does one go from here? How do we prevent such a tragedy from occuring once more? When will my life meet its end. My family I love them. )

These thoughts Koji pondered at the moment. He disperses his clone and recovers.

(Hmm, I need to pick up my training. It's time to excel to the next level.) 

After this thought, Koji would make way toward the exit. In this time he would come into the presence of the two visitor from Konohagakure.  As they observed him he would be lke wate rin their eyes. Chill and and malluable to the enviroment. But, at the same time he would be of a noble mannerism when he spoke. 

Once in the immediate vicinty of Trilliam, Rias and Ziare He'd bow, and say, 

"Excuse my rudeness homies, I've been rather busy with getting the village back under control and peaceful. I just needed a little nap before interacting with people. How are you two?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) waves as he crosses Mirai and says, "Well picking up some of the bodies that are outside the vilagee's gates. Don't want the smell of war to be here forever. Want the people to start moving on withtheir lives. Sorry I've been away for so long."

After this Koji turns his attention back to Ai and Momura. Koji doesn't destroy people out of ignorance, but this was training and he had needed some for the day, so this was perfect for the ninja. He had been cleaing the fields and directing Chuunin Exams. Life was busy for the shinobi as of late and it had caused a bit of slack in his training regime, but that was all about to change. 

"So help training a technique? Well Momoura lets get started you were in the fronlines alot during the war. You do need to be prepared if yo intend to be that close to battle. I'm sure you have latent power within you haha. I'm sure you can totally beat me. Now don't hold back." 

As Koji finished these words his body would flow like a brewing storm over an ocean sea. In this moment he would begin channeling his chakra throughout his body. If one could see it would look they would see Koj ihad complete control over his tenketsu, and this was due to biology. That would not be all however as the chakra flowed it would charge in his eyes and fingers quite powerfully. Behold the Byakugan is activated! 

Koji piercing the bodily shield and witnessing the chakra flow of the individual Momura. What would be revealed in its totality? All three hundred and sixty one tenketsu points, surges of chakra flow, and anythiing that could be seen with x-ray vision. 

Before taking his stance Koji would put his hand in "+" form, thus activating a jutsu. Allowing another Koji to appear,however this clone would be fifty percent weaker of the original. However, their strikes to the points would be no less effective or painful. Momura would see these individual take their stance and stare her down.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would see her movements quite clearly and he peered through the qround tracking her movements as she moved underground behind him. Koji would appear to be blindsided in the view of Momura, but due to her ignorance of Koji's dou-jutsu she would be the one blind-sided.  As Koji moves forward in the now disipating smoke he would throw his own laced explosive tag into the dirt toward Momura as he, himself moves backwards. The Kunai would detonate on impact with the sand. 

It is Koji's intention to blow her from the dirt, or blow her covering at the least as he does this his clone pursues. In order to unleash an Air palm on the presumably exposed Momura. The clone's attack would be directed toward the abdomen area of the girl. If connected she would fell quite the internal pain and tenketsu closure. * - Sun Nov 29 07:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) noticing she dug deeper into the sand would track her movements on the way down. It was like playing wac-o-mole, but this wac-o mole was a bit viscious! Koji perceiving the girl diggin toward him he would simple air palm in her vicinity as she rose from the ground. Being that Momura would be coming up head first  this would cause disorientation, and a cancelation of her jutsu as Koji would strike at the very exposure of her head. 

If completed Koji's clone would come by his side and strike the girl before she has an attempt to recover with another air palm toward the abdomen. This attack would be an attempt to knock the breathe out the girl and leave her heavy in stamina as the battle prolonged. Koji was focused as it took evvery once of logic to combat a person who can essential become one with the eart around, or rather a fish in sand. * - Sun Nov 29 07:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would see this punch coming and literally side step it as he didn't want any of that raw power coming into his body. However, this wouldn't be the end of gesture as he didn't want to insult the efforts of Momura. As everyone usually ran from him in a fight never wanting to press forward in literal hand to hand combat. So, this would allow Koji to see Momura in an entirely different light. 

Completing his action of side stepping Koji would envision the eight tri gram circle and unleash a sixty-four palm strike on the girl. It would be nothing held back, but it wouldn't kill her (As Neji did the strike on Naruto.) However, it would be unwise to continue after the strike as a large sum of points would be closed, thus reducing effeciency of many jutsus. If successful Koji would wait to see Momura's next move.* - Sun Nov 29 08:00:00 2015

Caught off guard at the mere fact the grl was able to stand, but he also admired such tenacity as this was key to preserving the village. However, proper control of chakra would seem impossible at this point, so Koji was quite impressed. He wouldn't unleash another deadly palm strike. As that would be unecessary in a training match. 

As he followed up the moutain with his clone he'd say, "It's dangerous to keep going. With your chakra points closed and it's be very hard to continue fighting without putting your life at risk."* - Sun Nov 29 08:23:53 2015

With two teams pitted against each other in capturing the flag Koji would observe and make a report. However, he wouldn't interfere unless something got out of hand. 

Hearing Sanoke's word Koji would think to himself, 
(Alright so no tampering with the scrolls. Noted as cheating if done.) 

As the teams endured each other Koji would be examining with his Byakugan. Witnessing all that could be revealed to him were. As Koji was greeted by his friend Kiyoko he'd give a nice head nod gesture to the homie. * - Mon Nov 30 01:58:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) clone would see the monstrosity underground as it would be using its Byakugan to find the individuals in the midst of combat. The wild untamed beast had sought the the image of the proctor. It literally hurt the feelings of the clone. As Sandworm made its debut from underground Koji would throw down two explosive tag kunais in its vicinity. This would explode upon impact on the ground doing the damage of regular base damage of explosive tags. 

If nothing more but to slow it down with explosives.

In this frame Koji's clone would be backing up as the house sized Sandworm thrashed toward him. Koji would hit the beast with an Air Palm. This wouldn't be as powerful as the original, but would be nonetheless effective on tenketsu points of the beast. This would be occuring moments after Ai's attack given her speed of of ninjutsu. 

(9.76 damage for clone at 50 percent of original. If landed 9 tenketsu points closed in region of blast and internal damage.) * - Mon Nov 30 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) knowing the potential of Izanami wouldn't interfere just yet, but he noted the downed Hiroshi. As he didn't want to insult the skillful shinobi, but his eye would be keen on the scorpion as he traced it body. 

(At given points Koji would aide them by giving them locations when the beast disappeared. This was thanks to his dou-jutu.)* - Mon Nov 30 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) clone would note the spot that caused such an abnormality in his eyes for future reference. Assuming this is a large scale amount of puke being thrown up. Koji would seek to move back. At this time Momura's attempt at throwing kunai's would aide heavily in his retreat from the now bloat face Sandworm. 

The clone breaking into a full backwards sprint would be followed by an explosion as he darted from the area. The explosion land on the ground would disperse the forward motion of the acid. Sending it "every-which way" Momura would  have caused the acid to attempt to land on anything in the vicinity. Depending on how close the Sandworm was might have caused damage to that thing as well. (Possibly even turing its attention away from him and onto Momura.) 

In the frame of the acid flying puke Koji would rotate, thus protecting itself from raining behemoth acid barf. At the end of this Koji would be eyeing down all in range of his sight. Having his defenses up and senses alert for the savage clone. * - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) given his reflexes would lose balance but regain his composure fairly quick. Once up he would notice that the sandworm had dug itself a hole within the sand. Having no way of fighting such a beast below ground Koji would attempt destroy the Sandworm with a bit of brillance. As he noted that the worm had made a few holes throughout the battle and even shook the ground causing them to lose balance. (In the mind of Koji this was enough to assume that the layers were weak from such abuse, and even the acid that leaked from the worms body would cause damage to it. 

Hoping this explosion is powerful enough to give way to the ground with its own power, or if logical the ignition of acid base substance to help give way to the ground along with the explosion. Thus, causing the ground along the trail of the sandworm's escape to collaspe on the beast causing some kind of damage. If not at the very least cause its exposure.

Prancing forward he'd take his stance and attempt to unleash a powerful Air Palm from behind the seemingly diranged scorpion. To allow a recovery for the squad now in the embrace of both monnsters. 

As Koji released the move Koji would let out a tiny grunt, "Gryeah.) * - Mon Nov 30 04:41:36 2015

As he begin to walk toward the vilalge he'd call over some officers to aide Ai if need be, and leave a part of his rations for his homie as well.
