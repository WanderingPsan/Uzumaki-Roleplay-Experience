<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 's Ravenscrotum squad would arrive Via Trilliam's flying method. Koji as they flew would be utilizing his Byakugan periodically in the swift speed of their arrival. Dictating that it was safe Koji would direct Trilliam to land, and once on the ground team Ravenscrotum survived the area as they followed the instructions given by Lord Megatron "Sanoke". 

Koji would peer into the house and see a mourning mother. This is to be expected given the fact that one of her children was killed in the prior mission concercing the present case. Koji would ask Hiroshi to speak with the mother, but all memeber would be expected to introduce themselves this was to lower admosity toward the squad. prying through their space and time of mourning. 

Koji didn't ask Trilliam cause he's too unpredictable and didn't ask otorius because this was his first mission. Koji didn't elect himself due to the expressionless figure of his face due to his eyes. (This would carry over to Otorus as well.) Hiroshi has displayed enough manners in the past to have Koji's favor. 

Now Koji would have notified the team of the mourning mother and family members in the house. But, it seems there were just females present at the time. The males must be out doing something. 

"Ortorius, scan the house from the outside let me know if anything is suspicous to you. I'll scan from the inside itself. Hiroshi if you feel that the mother is witholding information. Report to Trilliam." (This was said as they made it to the door.) 

"KNOCK, KNOCK! The door is answered by a relative but not by the mother she could be seen crying in the back. Holding a baby booty to her cheeks. That were dirtied from lack of shower. Her eyes would be dry due to cnstant crying, but that wouldn't be all! Bags would be present as she was restless in nature. She would be catered to by the other women in the house.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Person who answered door - "Come in but if you upset the mistress I'll have you out of here." 

Upon a first couple of responses the mother would be silent toward Hiroshi. To the point he might have felt irratated or compassionate. Once he built a quick relation the mother would look at him. And call out her son's name very silently. Would Hiroshi play along? Would he use this to get valuable information? Find out on the next episode of Illusion of Granduer dun dun dunnnananna! (DBZ ending narration theme). 

As this happens Koji would be peering through the home where nothing would seem out of place, but he'd slowly make his way toward the master bedroom. This would be occuring during the time of Hiroshi and the mournnig mother's interaction. (Once Hiroshi made his choice the fun would begin.

Bloodthirsty Trilliam would be seen slacking through the three hundred and sixty vision provided by Koji's Byakugan. Koji would say, "Show some dignity homie." * - Mon Dec  7 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) unbeknowst to the group, or anyone in the room for that matter Trilliams actions and Hiroshi's appearance would have set the mother off! Within the moment her eys would widen with a smile, and she'd begin to shout! 

"KIRI KIRI KIRI! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME? YOU DIDN'T LOSE ME I'M RIGHT HERE!"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) thinks: Kiri...? - Mon Dec  7 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) //
The ladies smile was glued on her face, but she was creepy now , spooky as she stood up she was rather tall in stature. Hair dry and lips crunchy from dehydration. This woman wasn't normal however she possessed an abnormal power that rendered her immune to genjutsu, but her distraught created a path for Trilliam's jutsu to travel, but it wouldn't go the way he'd hoped. 

The woman stopped shouting her son's name and began to scream,
"NEMUS! NEMUS! NEMUS! THEY TOOK HIM FROM ME FROOOOOOM ME GGGRAHHHH!" The woman's voice softened.. As she began to calm herelf by reaching out to Hiroshi. 
"But it's okay now... He's come back to me." The woman attempts to fondle with his hair." Sadly, her immunity to genjutsu was fighting back Trilliam she grabs a senbon from the table and begins combing through Hiroshi's blueberry hair. 
"Kiri, your hair always was beautiful." 

What would happen if one approached? What is Nemus? 

Koji seeing all this goes down looks at Trilliam with a frown.... He calls for Ortorius to enter. Koji attempts to walk into the master bedroom, but he's stopped by the mother.Swiftly moving the senbon through Hiroshi's hair and out the back of it she'd say,
"STOP! NEMUS DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN STRANGERS GO THERE! HUSBAND DOESN'T LIKE WHEN STRANGERS GO THERE!"
Koji freezes...* - Mon Dec  7 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) //
The mother would answer Hiroshi's question without fail,
"Nemus took you away they're the organization your father's in. I told him to leave but he never listened he said it was someting he had to do... There's a hideout in the master bedroom. The key is ---" 

Her resistances to the genjutsu makes her lash out unhumanly stregnth this would make her charge Ortorius with the senbon. In this distraction Koji would run to grab Trilliam and shout, 

"Deal with her you two and come here immediately when you're done... Make her think he's your friend." Koji would move past the frightened people in the house to the masterbedroom where he's find a door that blended well with the interior of the house. And, thus is why it wasn't seen outside not only that the material made it impossible to see through even with the Byakugan.. WEIRD PLOT ARMOR* 

Koji says, "Blow the dorr down.. Just the door... Not the house homie." * - Mon Dec  7 06:10:46 2015

with the squad back together and the mini threat avoided the teams heads down the dark secret corridor of the house. Weird symbols could be seen scribbled on the wall. Resembled seals but of what. Usage of the byakugan would reveal the word, "Those who trespass will be crushed." 

Koji would say, "Watch out it's a riddle. I hear crumbling from the roof." 
Indeed anyone could hear crumbling Koji shouts//
"The roof is falling!" It wasn't the roof entirely but an earthly block with the pre warning everyone would be able to show their worth to stop what would presumably crush them if left unattended. 

After success the group would continue you down where they would find an entire excavation beneath the houses of the neighborhood. A network! Written on the walls read "Pigs of Nemus." 

In the shadows crept a man watching he could be seen channeling chakra from the distance. Grinning if one could see or hear his grin emminated and brethe heavy as he spoke, 

"More pigs." * - Mon Dec  7 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would aide in the destruction of the rock as well! Allowing Trilliam to go in hard on the guy. 
Assuming Otorius was using his own Byakugan he would see plans of their project and notes on a table in the network. Readings future plans whereabbouts, members, resources, and fundings... Earn that worth and pick it up homie for the one time. Misiion complete!

"Alright, you'll need your sight for this one myTsuki. I wish your bull could see but he'll probably just see me waving my arms like a maniac. This is the offensive side... I doubt you'll like this one much but it could come in handy." 

Koji having just created this move would throw up a hand to channel his chakra to the palms, and in his mind's eye he envisions the eight trigram circle. This would be completed instantly and without a moments hesitation. From both hands there would be thin shar blade released from his palms. They would also appear to be flexible. This was a variation of the already known 64 Palm technique. * - Mon Dec  7 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) "Don't be so shocked myTsuki.. You'l be able to do this as well soon enough haha. Now watch this..." 

Koji performs the same move but this time building a fence in front of him with the same speed as before. Sadly the collision of chakra wouldn't be as flashy as Hinata's because she had lighting chakra, but Koji did his best. If there is a collision they be rejected just the same. * - Mon Dec  7 20:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) enters the frame of the restaruant. The usual customer here they'd deliver on sight a fresh bowl of Garic Ramen and Unagi Don. Boy had to keep his figure and health on par with other shinobis in the village of Sunagakure. Who are we kidding he had to keep shape for the perp runing around they were track stars when thieving.

Koji would see Ziare his homie he met once next to the Kazekage's hussy Rias. Girl owes homage to these parts of the streets, but she cool people so Sunagakure lets it slide. 

"Hey there Z, nice to see you again I hope all is well. I see you're in a middle of a conversation don't mind me." * - Tue Dec  8 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) originally sat at the front table, but he wanted to change it up. Because, everyone and they mama sat him down on that front table to discuss business with him. Hell to discuss life with the thirteen year old boy. Koji was looking for a breather in the se seemingly peaceful times. Koji receives his food and he enjoys it passionately. A smile could be seen surfacing on his face, but not quite so easily as he was engulfing food. One would have to be looking awfully hard. 

During this time Koji would be pndering how he considers the people of Sunagakure family. Much like his clansmen and clanswomen of the Hokuma. They were secen deep now and strong in heart. He had taught them well recently and started to wonder about his future. As he was young and had accomplished his dreams. He had even let go of the hate that plagued him over Flexus (Afriend killin in combat). Was war all he was good for nwo? 
Koji would train in his time not for war, but for the unpredictable. 

Koji rests in the cafe pondering these thoughts... 

Noticing the conversation behind him Koji would intrude but respectfully..

"Zirare, I've been thinking of a lot things... What would be your plan after accomplishing your goal? The goal we spoke of last time.." Koji's question would be on of perlexion and cuirosty and one of great compassion. His eyes wouldn't show it as they were expressionless on his face, but maybe his brows being raised could possibly show it...* - Tue Dec  8 02:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: You're strong. I will try the donating you mentioned. I'm hapy you're not alone. It's dangerous to travel by yourself. - Tue Dec  8 02:34:27 2015
