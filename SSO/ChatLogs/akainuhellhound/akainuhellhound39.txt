<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) recognizes this look from Mirai and Sanoke interaction. He takes it to heart. 

"Hmph..."* - Tue Dec  8 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wouldn't stare as it's against his upbringing but he would've glanced at the young girls eyes if even for moment. Sadly he was more concerned with the inner being of a person, so his main intentions aren't her eyes. Koji speaks,

"I'm sorry if I may have offended you myLady. If you care my name is Koji I'll cover both your meals." 

Koji hearing the story of Z and Saika would pay their meal as they're traveling, so whatever they could keep whatever they had in their pockets for better things. This isn't out of Koji's nature he believes in giving alms and is quick to forgiveness, beause this is a practice given to him by Bryson the Priest. * - Tue Dec  8 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I didn't realize so many people had my eyes. - Tue Dec  8 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He's the only other one. - Tue Dec  8 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Plus your eyes are different. - Tue Dec  8 02:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hehehe. - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're gonna hurt my feelings. - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) accepts the homie's handshake gratefully. Nodding in a way that confirms his response. Although Koji was assuming when Ziare said her eyes were different that he meant for each individual. Which gave a bit more admiration points for the traveling homie. 

"If you ever have time myLady you should come by and meet my family. They're known as the Hokumas. You too Ziare.." 

Koji completing the handshake would attempt to part ways after payig his bill. There was much work to be done. (Icly they'd prolly been talking for months)* - Tue Dec  8 03:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Maybe I shouldve been a bit more sensitive to her...No wonder she acts kinda cold... - Tue Dec  8 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The name also serves as a protection. I took the name of my adoptive parents.My siblings bare this name and reatives. - Tue Dec  8 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 03:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I'm confused. . . - Tue Dec  8 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) shared knowledge but not th whole history. Just the important details. Clearly if they wanted to know more they'd come and ask, but she shared similar eyes so Koji shared that bit of detail with her. Not wanting to offend the girl he wouldn't tell her to becareful. But, it woudn't be needed either as Ziare was with her he seems the capable sort to protect. 

The non responsiveness of the girl would entice Koji to believe she had no interest but who knows. Koji was just trying to be helpful at the moment and recruit more members. (Become the 8th man)* - Tue Dec  8 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: He presumably left before the death. - Tue Dec  8 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) nods nothing seemed out of place here. Kiyoko was at the scene of the crime, so her being a suspect isn't unusual. Koji would hope his friend wouldn't commit such a devious act. 

"Got it, I'll have the morgue take a look at the body to see what we got, and will you need a search party to catch the runaway? I'm getting ahead First thing first where is this body?" 

Fuji was usualy ahead of the morgue research but with him absent Koji was positive his team could get the job done.* - Tue Dec  8 03:34:11 2015

Koji was really affectionate for his family anything he did was to see them progress. Hopefuly progress in the just and morally good ways, but only time would tell at this point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be seen as he normally is cruising through the sand like water, and seemingly with peace in mind. However, what would be off seetting is that he'd be walking with a couple of guards at his sides. 

"Hey Mirai, I hope everything is going well." 
Koji would speak this as he moved toward the hospital. Seeking out the homie Kiyoko. (Hope this isn't too serious. I like to consider everyone like family around here. It'd break my heart to confirm such travesties.)

Koji would be moving toward the hospital unless stopped.* - Tue Dec  8 23:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Entering the hospital with two guards would use his Byakugan to scan out the hospital. Normally this wouldn't be in Koji's nature, but he was on the search for a potential criminal. It hurt him greatly inside to search for someone he considered a friend. But, the evidence was there so it would be illogical to rule out the possibilty. Koji in maintaing what he considered family Koji had to be not only just but fair.  

Koji thinks, (This sucks.. Will she hate me because of this?) 

Koji would Ai come through and say, "I'm sorry for involving you in this mess."* - Tue Dec  8 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) peering through the room would move toward the area where people were present. Keeping a watchful eye for traps or triggers that could endanger people within the area.* - Tue Dec  8 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would check the door and noticed it would be locked. He would knock on the door in a respectful manner.

"Ms. Kiyoko. I need to speak with you." 

It should be noted Koji had activated his dou-jutsu upon entering the building in search of his friend Kiyoko. As there were certain matters that bothered him. So, if the door isn't able to be seen through this would alert Kiyoko and anyone that Koji acknowledge their presence within the room. 

The ordeal to come ached Koji's heart but he was fair and just when dealing with those he considered his family and didn't want to offend their honor by giving special treatment. * - Wed Dec  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) gives slight smile but it was clear the boy had troubles on his mind. 

"No--no--, I like to respect what you guys do here. Even with my lawful authority I think there should be boundaries to my power. But..."

Koji does a dramatic law and order pause. 

"I have to ask that you postpone your plans with Mitsunara.. We need you to come down to the station." 

Koji would never dream of embarassing someone he looked up to in public, because he couldn't bring himself to believe the accusations. Not before hearing Kiyoko the motherly figure speak. She had once queled the anger in his heart. * - Wed Dec  9 00:13:13 2015

"This is indeed over that. If you just come to answer a few questions. I 'm sure it'll be over soon." 

Koji ends with a smile.* - Wed Dec  9 00:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yep, lets get going. Oh Kiyoko this is Ai. I'm no good at asking the right question so Ai agreed to help me. - Wed Dec  9 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh, and yeah... I know Ai-chan. - Wed Dec  9 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would leave the guards at the hospital just incase that suspicous woman was up to something. But, the three would head down to the station to get this dirty business resolved for the one time. If not stopped they would head straight out. Deeming the place safe Koji would deactive his eyes before walking out.* - Wed Dec  9 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would ask that Mitsunara sit in the comfty visitor section and await for the process to be completed.  Upon this acceptance Ai, Kiyoko and Koji would head into the interrogation room. 

As they walk, Koji speaks, "I'm sorry for the proceedings but I don't want to be seen as biased. I want everyone to feel that if they're questioned it's been fair and without prejudice. Once completed I'll come out with a public announcement clearing your involviment." 

Time would have passed and Koji's vocabulary had cleary increased due to excessive studying in school he was shaping up attempting to be more than society's model civillians. 

Once in the room Koji would ask Ai to begin whatever she needed t do to receive information, because Koji needed to learn how interrogation worked. This being only his second time Koji ever seeing someone questioned in person. He only knew for sure that with a second person involved he could do aaway hopefully with his emotional opinon and keep it logical. Life is something precious we al ldeserve.* - Wed Dec  9 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) nods hearing Kiyoko's response//
" They have been missing for awhile but a search is in the process along with a few other missing people. The date of death was ( yesterday at 10:00pm) that was the date Koji was called to take on the case. The body oocly dissapeared after posting rpp flag soooo shrugs*) " 

Koji was clearly more interested in the mot recent case, but it couldn't be left out that two people died in her care. Knowing the late Marissa cleared her of charges is a good start though, at least for Koji.

"What she says lines up but I'll repeat for the sake of records. The body was seen with a slit wrist, but he was recorded to be in the hospital for a prior injury. But, the injury wasn't supposed to be lethal and having two deaths in a row has caused great concern. I was told that Kiyoko went away and when she returned. She reported that the boy had killed himself. The boy was reported also to be from Kiri and that his companion fled, so he will also be questioned."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing that the companion didn't flee conflicts the information previously stated , and causes alarm in Koji.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It was obvious he did them to himself, and considering his drugged state and pain it was conclusive with the type of messy injuries delivered. - Wed Dec  9 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not exactly. Don't assume right off the bat. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...That isn't an ASSUMPTION, it is a medical report. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You 'ASSUME' he killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...his injuries SHOW he killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Someone would have had to force him to do it with his own hands to make it look like suicide. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Simple. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Except not simple, not for me. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I've been in Suna long enough to know how evil people can be. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Kiyoko weak AF. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....and you think -I- am evil? - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I can kill someone right now and make it seems like they killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: However. - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ..Yeah, but Kiyoko isn't physically strong enough to kill anyone not completely helpless. - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I won't jump the guns. - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Except -I- can't. - Wed Dec  9 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Because I know people can rest the blame on you. - Wed Dec  9 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That girl Nina? She could have killed me, she was -going- to kill me. - Wed Dec  9 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I only managed to stop her because she tripped. - Wed Dec  9 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Kiyoko. - Wed Dec  9 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Explain his wounds. - Wed Dec  9 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He used them to sloppily slice his arm open by CARVING by the wounds left. - Wed Dec  9 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: There were several needles lodged in his wound sight from the needles breaking and using new ones. - Wed Dec  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm not talking about that wound sweetie. - Wed Dec  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He also had placed his arm into the sink and ran water over it, to increase the bleeding. - Wed Dec  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: W-what? - Wed Dec  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm talking about the one he was place'd in hospital for. - Wed Dec  9 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: In hindsight, I suppose you are right I could have overpowered hi. - Wed Dec  9 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *him. - Wed Dec  9 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You or someone else. - Wed Dec  9 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... - Wed Dec  9 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: However, the day that he died, where were you? - Wed Dec  9 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .....I have said this before, I was on the next floor in the surgical room prepping for his surgery to happen in a few hours. - Wed Dec  9 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Does this hospital carries camera? - Wed Dec  9 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: They can't afford them...  - Wed Dec  9 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I'm going to jail... - Wed Dec  9 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No guards? Nothing? - Wed Dec  9 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean there are two at the stairs of each level? - Wed Dec  9 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We aren't exactly in high alert. - Wed Dec  9 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing the prior injuries sound like this guy was pretty lethal, and like Kiyoko suggested in hindsight it would be easy for her to overpwer the man in this state. But his injuries made him sound incapable of locomotion on his own in Koji's mind. 

"This man was a forgeiner and severly injured why wasn't anyone watching? This for sure seems more like a homiicide than suicide. Given it might've been impossible for the kid to kill him self. Even if he was immune to pain."* - Wed Dec  9 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The staff at the hospital will support me but considering I'm the head of hospital I don't know how reliable you will take their word. - Wed Dec  9 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Kiyoko. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Tell me. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Did. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Kill. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Him? - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Honest answer. - Wed Dec  9 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll take your word. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Since there was no guard. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No camera. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: And he was also from another village. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: However keep in mind, this can spark a war. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: So I'll ask again, did you kill him. - Wed Dec  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ..? - Wed Dec  9 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No, Ai... - Wed Dec  9 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's still my fault, I was negligent... I should have left someone with him. - Wed Dec  9 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed. - Wed Dec  9 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Even if you didn't kill him, the blame will still fall on you. - Wed Dec  9 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) learned alot from how Ai handled things and he would use it in the future, s far Ai didn't say anything crazy at this point. Koji seeing the fatigue of both parties would conclude here and say, 
"Thank you Kiyoko for helping us. I'm sorry you had to go through this process. But, I'll have guards placed in the hospital and around. I don't want this to happen again... It's depressing."
