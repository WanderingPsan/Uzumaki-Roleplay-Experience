If contact is made the seal would spread on the individual causing the expected effect. 

If the genjutsu Ketsuki is obviosuly using takes effect on the idividual Koji will not follow up the assualt. However, if the jutsu seemed to be ineffective Koji would throw these Kunais with the below effect toward the man. Two would be thrown at this time followed by a ninjutsu in order to amplify the effects of lighting jutsu being used

***
Overheat Sealing(Fuuinjutsu)

***
After placing two seals upon the target.  This jutsu then causes that targets body to overheat from the inside and out over time per RP.  Causing them to slow down in speed depending on how strong the seal is made to be by the user if they have the proper traning ; eventually bringing them down to their knees if not handled by two serperate people who can take off the seal at the very same time.  If not then they will suffer immense internal heat as well as those who fail to remove it.  [If not removed this has potential to kill]

With direct contact of both Kunais his speed would be signifigantly decreased! As the seals effect would double , thus leaving him only (two turns to live). As one sealing would kill hm in (4turns).

The pain he endured would more than likely cut his actions at the very least by half. Koji would move back from the man's approach, and if succesful dodging both strike attempts made by the man. Koji would then unleash sixty-four palms on the individual. After the failed attempt.

Koji hears the words of Kuro and of Bryson "Everyone deserves forgiveness". But, it's hard to apply that philosophy to such a person whose come, and brought such evil to the land of Sunagakure. Bending down with confusion he would jab the man's points open, but only a few it would feel little to no difference. Koji needed to pray over such an incident. 

After doing what was asked of Kuro, Koji would remove the chakra from his eyes, and rest his stance as he takes his place next to the Kage's office.

Fuji spit as shouted, and face expressed much emotion! Koji would be shocked as he saw the clay starting ignite!

This would all be a brief before Fuji knew it Koji would be in his veil of protection. THis was the man he knew fromm the begining his life in Sunagakure. Koji would pray that this unecessary event didn't cause casualties. So many innocents were victim to oblivion at the moment.

However, in Trilliam's attempt to help he may have caused a bit more damage than he himself intended. The man that attacked more than likely caused fear as he was indeed a Necromancer, and one we've never encountered before... But, we should talk to Trilliam as you can see form the debris where all the damage ame from. His teamwork skills need enhancing, but this is something i brought to the Lord as well." 

Koji would seem order in his examnation, but this was only due to his exposure to war and many battles he's been in. He's been trained and seasoned in many ways due to the chaos that presented itself in their world.* - Fri Nov  6 09:12:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) getting one last yawn in from waking up would give Yan the ol nod and thumbs up deal.* - Fri Nov  6 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: We're not allowed to spar within the barracks however law of Sunagakure. - Fri Nov  6 18:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) follows.* - Fri Nov  6 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wouldn't have activated his eyes yet, but saw Yan's all but familair hand sign for the shadow clone jutsu. Koji wouldn't know how many clones to expect, but he prepare himself adequately. Taking his traditional Gente Fist stance the dreaded Hyuuga woud begin to channel the chakra heavily to his eyes. This would in effect activate Koji's Byakugan, thus allowing the chakra points to be revealed to his sight. 

Now ready for combat Koji would say before striding forward, "Hmm Index is a strange case, but if Hassan trusts him so can I, or at least... try to. It seems those who I assumed to be trustworthy are in fact not." As Koji finished his sentence he would meet face to face with Yan, and his clones. Assuming they're aligned along side him. Koji would split the distance between the two on  opposite sides. Attempting to hit one clone with an Air Palm, and strike Yan in the stomach a rapid succession of times in hopes of stopping chakra flow.* - Fri Nov  6 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trent(Fang7777) thinks: Man theres people here already. - Fri Nov  6 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 's perception would clearly see through the smoke, but of course Yan wouldn't know such a fact, and Koji would have him in his view without fail. It should also be noted exactly ninety- eight percent of Koji's abilities were tai-jutsu based.  Koji would sense the bellowing of chakra eminating, and knowing Yan from past spars. Koji understood one thing Yan would try to supress, and restrict movement.

 As soon as Koji wrecked the first clone he would've already thrown a laced "explosive tag" 2 Giant Shuriken. The force would clearly overwhelm the giant shurikens, but not the explosion itself. 

With immediate contact this would send the in sporatic place, but reduce the incoming force as well. This would allow Koji to rotate flinging off any mud that may have made it on him, and disperse that coming for him. At the end of this rotation Koji would throw a regular kunai toward the head of the rear clone. * - Fri Nov  6 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doesn't usually fight nin-jutsu users alone being a tai-spec, so he never expects to be a match alone. However, he ain't bitch-made so he accepts a challenge when presented with it. Koji would see the water come as came around, and it's not like he couldn't have manuevered, but Koji had a plan, so he took the waterfall for now. 

This would blow him back, but this is expected when Koji spars shinobis nobody wants the hands of Asura on'em. Koji would regain himself and places tags on the ground right before him how many ever feet he was dragged back into the distance. Once standing Koji again sets his stance in wait of the distance fighter,* - Fri Nov  6 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doesn't really care for taunts, but he would go through with his plan would channel chakra to his feet to sprint on the now muddied water. This is a techinique he picked up with his time spent in Kirigakure. Koji would use his speed with the toss of the kunai laced with explosive tag. This is an attempt to be lost form sight from Yan reducing his chance of reaction. 

If success is met the explosion would take out one or two clones, but this wouldn't be the only assualt. Koji would keep his momentum forward, and once near (what would expected to be two or three bodies) Koji would use Rotation. Literally flinging them off balance right after the explosion.* - Fri Nov  6 20:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) oocly not understanding the mass of water would assume it's flooding the whole areana. Thus, there was nothing he could do except be swept away by a force that big. Koji isn't hurt or distraught about the spar. As his specialty put him at a disadvantage when it came to those fighters able to create distance. He would have to keep training physically to surpass even the speed in which  they release jutsus, but Koji had already been training for such events so this isn't new to him. 

Koji would've love to hit Yan with the sixty-four palm though. Cause it was coming. It would be assumed that his tages were peeled up as well from the ground he placed earlier.* - Fri Nov  6 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would head off as Yan would seemingly be gone OOcly* - Fri Nov  6 21:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who was the intruder? The swordsman? - Fri Nov  6 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would finger Sanoke to come closer the news didn't need to to get out as it was an order from the Gezo, and no one wanted to stir up unecessary fear within Sunagakure. 

If Sanoke listened and came near Koji would show the report to Sanoke it would read Under the the village's insignia, 

" During the day of "yesterdays time" an intruder sneaked his way behind the village's defense. It was confirmed by Fujitora that the man had beene a Gezo private, and that he was after some specific information. The unknown assalaint killed two citizens, severely injured Jiki and Izutora, and Ketsuki. He would later be apprehended by the efforts of Trilliam, Tondou, Fuji, Kuro, a recovered Ketsuki, and Koji. Upon his capture he was sentenced death, but those actions were heavily delayed by Kuro the pacifist. Soon after, Trilliam's clay would ignite and explode resulting in the death of one. That one is Ketsuki, Koji would have been protected by Fujitora, and the intruder would have been protected by Kuro. After these events, Ketsuki would have crawled in agony as she bled to death from missing limbs. Fuji and Jiki would go through an altercation with Kuro until they effectively executed the intruder. Everyone was ordered to disperse after this to care for the wounded. Desert Owl took over the scene, and informed the villagers that ti was a mad-man loose." 

Anyone would notice the parade happening in Hassan's honor for the threat was dealt with rather hastely,thus building upon his administration approval rating.* - Fri Nov  6 21:30:14 2015
