<br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) It's the next day and Koji's body has recovered full. Taking his morning nourishments he would begin another rigorous training today. As he walks out the door he thanks the villager for looking after him and taking on a burden. Eyes of determination he sets out on his hundred mile run yet again. Blood pumping throughout the body Koji felt alive and well today. He would run the mileage straight today. As the day was hotter and thicker than ever this day. 
As he ran swinging uppercuts and superman punches Koji began to notice he was panting pretty heavily, and this was due to the heat of the day. Koji wanting to take control of this extreme situation would grab a giant from the quarry and lug it on his back while running. 
The townsfolk a bit confused by Koji's methods couldn't quite understand what the boy was trying to achieve, but they could see his rapid advancements! With extreme heat sucking the air right out of his lungs and gravity tugging him down through the weight of the boulder. Koji felt this was exactly the type of workout he needed. Completing the mission even in unfavorable conditions. 
As he ran it would be tough for the young shinobi. As he made it deeper into his regime the boy would feel the stone get heavier and his breathe get shorter. As the sun unleashed a diarrhea of heat upon Koji's body. He would feel the exhaustion more so than he ever had, but he would not quit. As the thoughts surfaced in his he would say, "Quitters never prosper!" 
Working ever so harder his pace would slow immensely to the point it was more of a lunging one hundred mile than a run. He would now be fifty miles in. You could see the strain upon Koji's body as he held the stone up. His biceps flexed powerfully to the world! It was as if he could be sculpted as an Olympian god at the moment! Legs chiseled to perfection! He would strut ever more forward as he completed the last fifty miles. 
An hour would pass and Koji would still be in the same spot (fifty miles). Unable to move due to the immense weight of the stone and shorten breathe. He would struggle with all his might to move forward, but the forward motion would just not permit itself through his legs, nor the air through his lungs. So, Koji would post-pone his run not by resting, but taking a different stance. 
Understanding that his legs had the strength to hold his body up. Koji would take a squat position. He would back squat this stone, regardless of the pressure! Regardless of the heat! As he began an idea immediately to mind. Rising from the squat he would use that motion to jump forward. Propelling himself forward he would repeat this process until he was able to run again. As he continued down the path the trees and ground shook as Koji came thundering down to the ground each jump. 
Making his way through the trail Koji's face was painted with fatigue. Biting his lip with the intent to push out more energy he would make about twenty miles, and let out a mighty roar as he completed his last squat. Confused how he would get this boulder down the rest of the way he shrugged his shoulders. Girded his loins and said, "Run." As he focused on his legs he would say again, "Run." As he looked even harder down upon his legs he would say, "Run." Before he realized he would be breaking stride, then breaking pace. 
Finding the strength to run Koji was back at again. Like the training maniac he was, but just because he started running again didn't make this easier. Matter of fact he was losing air even faster! And, he could feel his arms giving way to the stone! His limits were being reached and he had no idea how he could break them. He just knew he could quit, so that what he continued to do. 
Making his way to the finish line. Koji at the edge knew he couldn't fall forward or this boulder would crush him dead, but he had no idea how he was going to get this boulder off of him. Stuck in a serious predicament. An idea would spark, but it would have to be a flawless transition due to his fatigue. Changing his hold on the stone ever so slightly, and focusing his chakra… Koji would rotate and shot put the boulder off of him and into the distance next to the tree. 
In that single motion, Koji returned to his original position at three hundred and sixty degrees he would collapse from exhaustion. This was all at the same time the boulder came crashing down next to the tree. Koji would sleep for days, but not unwatched as his training behavior had caught the attention of another villager. And, like many villagers before they felt compelled to help the boy. 
Being nourished in his sleep Koji would wake up three days later. The perils of his workout truly took a toll on him, and when he got out of bed he felt ever so lighter! Almost as a leaf he would through rapid punches, and grin at the progress. The villager watching him grins with admiration of the boy, and says keep at it. You'll make this village proud one day. Heading out he would thank the villager for his support, and begin the day. 
Now feeling prepared for the reason he's been training Koji would warm up with a fifty miles run. This was to be soothing and relaxing for the body for what came next would be harsh and cruel. Along his run he would do the usual punches as he felt there was always room for improvement, but was greatly satisfied with where he was at. Anything after would be dessert to him. 
Making it to the finish Koji would then find himself in front of the tree he had been pounding for a while now. He would actually begin to talk to the tree and say, "Well buddy today I'll truly blow you away, but no hard feelings. Your sacrifice will bring a new era from the dust you're about to become." Beginning to focus his mind and body he would channel energy for the first gate. 
When he feels he is done he would shout, "FIRST GATE OPEN!!" and strike hard and fast! He did just that, but it didn't open… It was just a quick palm to the tree. This was good but not what Koji was looking for. He would set himself up to focus once more and attempt another try. 
Gathering the energy he would calm himself. Though the state of the gate is a blur. The process to getting there isn't. Koji would need to slow himself in order to speed up, so that's exactly what he did. 
Thinking back on his training he would see the images of his struggles up until this point. The death up until this point! The failures that caused death up until this point! It was truly hard for Koji to focus on such matters during training he would get angry, or saddened but he couldn't stay there he had an objective.
Calming his soul from the grudging emotions he finds tranquility. Heart pace would slow, He would breathe out a long sigh. It was soothing, it was focused, and it was time... Lining up once more to strike the tree Koji would speak, "This is it buddy. I can feel it. Again, I thank you for the new era." Placing his palm on the tree ever so gently before removing it just as gently. 
Taking his stance he focuses on the tree with fierceness in his eyes. As if he were some sort of vicious predator, and the tree prey. Gathering the energy, feeling the influx of power his body would begin to pulsate with strength. It was as if the chains on Koji's body were released! His limits were gone he felt free!
As he continued he would rush the tree in blinding speed 5 times his normal speed. Mind focused on the blowing the tree away. Koji would shout, "Gate of opening! OPEN!" In the midst of rushing the tree it would all be over for the non-locomotive plant. In a blink of an eye the tree was destroyed palmed into dust. It was… Thus, giving birth to a new age a new being.

Outside this buildng through the walls I can read the people's low levels of chakra due to starvation, any living thing is naked. And those inanimated but fused with chakra are no exception. From a distance of 105 blocks I can detect any of those with natural ease. No one will penetrate without my seeing, and no one will act without me knowing it. Be it underground or in the sky.

If I run in there and kill this kid it will be quick and no lesson learned for these two. They need to hone their battle wisdom skills being their first mission. Izanami is hesitant to take a life, and Flexus seems a bit to gun trigger happy. With Izanami taking the charge and interceptiing the targets shuriken will teach her to act, and Trilliam to be patient with his explosives by protecting Izanami. Of course I'll be there securing the area. Matter of fact Trilliam will be the key to cornering the weasel. Any physical attack toward the two will be thwarted by me. This of course is hypothetical if the target has set traps or seems to act more wisely than Lord Hassan told us, then I'll take the fore front and they'll act accordingly to my moves.* - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Acquiring the first gate Koji wouldn't stop there as he needed the second gate to counteract the first, so that he may continue his assaults. For this he would train with goal of building up his stamina. Strapping on his weights he would head out, thus marking the start of his workout to the path of the Second Gate. 
As Koji began to run he could feel the new weighted garb really bear down on him. Much more so than the boulder he carried a few training session ago! Running at a consistent pace he would brush through trees and bushes within the forest. As each breathe escapes his mouth the trail becomes ever more tiring. 
Perilous though the track may be Koji would continue running. Talking himself up he would say, "I haven't quit in the past when it was hard, so I have no excuse to quit now." This was going to be the hardest run he's ever done, but he knew when he finished he'd be ready for the perils that awaited him. 
Still running, Koji would ponder why he has made so many enemies in his life being so young, but understood that his alignment was good and theirs evil at least in his eyes. He had seen people die out of carelessness of their murderers rather than an actual purpose. Though death comes for us all he wondered if could be a purpose for it. Being so young he knew he wouldn't find the answer just yet. As he pondered he would come across a large boulder blocking his path. He thought to climb, but found it more proper to hurdle it. 
Picking up his speed he would he would begin to pivot forward one foot after another. Until he was in position to jump off his power leg. Leaping into the air Koji would make it twenty feet in the air! But, he needed more forward motion! Unable to physically bounce in the air he would reach out with both arms to grab a branch protruding from a large tree. 
Now gripping the branch firmly he uses the already in action inertia acting upon his body from the jump to start a flipping motion. He would then release in a way to allow him to start passing over the giant boulder. As soon as he was over he would flip forward in a rapid rate until landing elegantly on his feet. Koji would immediately get back into his pace once more and continue the trail.
Koji activating his Byakugan would look into the distance and see it was safe as far as the eye could see, but he would note that the breeze would increase drastically as he moved forward. Speaking within his mind Koji would say, "There could be a storm coming. I'll prepare." Placing a rain hoodie one swiftly, and eating a meal not knowing if the storm would ruin his rations.
As he ran on it would begin to pour lightly the wind would be fast, but not anything harmful to his health. Keeping pace the shinobi would activate Suimen to run above water, because he noticed that although the rain fell lightly it was continuous, thus causing a flood. 
The Ninja was having a bit of fun not ever running above rising water before it was like a joy ride to him. As he trekked on he would pant ever so harder, but would not give in to the struggle that was beckoning him to stop and rest. 
This training was meant to be increasing stamina and strength, so it was mandatory that he kept going even beyond his limits. And, then when he finally made it there! It would be mandatory to push even farther! Being pulled down due to the weight his Suimen would at times add more pressure upon the water. Not sinking the shinobi, but making his heart a bit anxious as the water rose and he sunk. He would have to pay attention to his chakra levels as he progressed.
The flood rising even more in height would half way engulf the forest itself in height. As he progressed he would comment the moon has never been closer. Looking up as he ran was even a struggle for the weight was pressing down ever harder on his body. Eyes cringing from the strain he was given no choice, but to keep running as the flood raged on this night and showed no sign of letting up. 
 Water perpetually rising and Koji's strength perpetually falling it would soon be up to sheer will power to keep him moving. For if he quit he would drown under the high tide that now surfaced over the land. With the moon now rising he could only hope for the water level to deplete quickly, but using his Byakugan he saw no drainage system in the distance as of yet! 
Running on fumes Koji is embraced by the stress of his weighted garments. Would lose control of his chakra every once in a while running. This was due to the fact that his Suimen had been in use all day, and that the weight of his vest was really straining him. Physically and spiritually the young teen was succumbing to fatigue as he trekked on.
The boy's muscles would cry out in agony through the skin as they pulsated, and his heart would whimper as every blood cell was steadily pumped through his body. This would of course mimic the effects of the Gate of Healing, because during that state blood will be forced throughout the body. This will of course be against the will of the body much like the Gate of Opening. 
Steady carrying the extra weight the shinobi finally noticed that the water level began to lower slowly, but steadily he began to see more of the trees' stem. This scene was enough to fill him joy, but on top of that adrenaline from the expressed emotion started an extra flow of blood. Thus, reenergizing him further!
Now able to giant rocks and twigs again he is yet again energized. He is now reassured that life will not escape him this day, but in its stead death would. This was not the same for his exhaustion, because he still needed to press on as the water was not at a safe level to release his Suimen. 
The boy would make great head way in his journey to overcome the limits of his stamina. But, that doesn't mean he would be able to quit! Koji's eyes would widen as he sees the flood finally release the land to the air. Without thought he would remove his Suimen, and feel land once more with great happiness. 
As Koji had been running for a very long time he would stop to eat, and replenish his strength not wanting to succumb to disease of any sort he would bathe in a nearby waterfall. After, he would eat dinner by chasing down wild animals and gathering berries and other vegetables. He didn't bring but emergency rations which he would save for the most severe circumstance. 
After having his nourishments Koji does the next best thing after a long workout. That is, sleep! He had been running not only through the day but the night as well! This will surely be necessary if his muscles are to recover healthily and fully! Making a comfortable padding with his camping material he lay down and sleep. 
Awakening later in the evening Koji starts the day by having his nourishment, and doing his stretches before continuing the training once more. Applying his weighted gear and strapping on his camping attire Koji sets off sprinting once more! Breezing like the wind he would increase in speed and strength like no other before him. 
The training would increase his overall strength, so his limits would grow through each challenge. Thus, making it difficult to jump right into the limit breaker Koji would have peril to the limits each and every time, but this was good! For he was becoming stronger and more proficient in his skills making him more of a threat to those that saw him as an enemy.
Thumping the ground as he ran he the grass fell beneath his progress, and the twigs cracked beneath his driving force. With the strong willed shinobi running through the forest he would press forward even under the weight of his garments. Though he moved as though an Olympic bodybuilder lugging a truck he would not quit! Though his legs cried out in pain like babies he would not quit!
This Koji doing better, this was Koji making his own way, this was Koji becoming stronger as seconds passed, and as minutes passed he would become greater and greater. He has tuned his mind and body together so that he may accomplish a goal he set in front of himself. He would become a champion of champions!
Crushing all opposition in nature Koji spoke the words, "No weapon forged against the Lord shall prosper." Building confidence within himself he would press on. Wishing to be the reason that no weapon should prosper. He would see himself as the shield that broke those weapons. Carrying with him the spirit of Suna. 
As he spoke to the sun glimmered brightly today bringing Koji the realization that it was beyond hotter than normal. Sweat would pierce out of his skin, and slip down his nostril and into his mouth. His lip would burn from the salt and legs would sting from not only the heat, but the running causing strain and friction between his muscles. He was again suffering at the hands of nature. 
Pressing on he would quote again, "No weapon forged against the Lord shall prosper." This would bring him strength carrying the heart and pride of Suna with him. If he died he wouldn't be able to complete any of his goals, so it was as if it wasn't an option for him. Muscles flexing each stride of the way, and sweat evaporating from the heat he would continue. 
Taking a drink of water he would hydrate up as he ran within the sun, but this would only do so much for the ninja. Being that there was no shade around it was only logical to run until sun down. He didn't want to sit in one place exhausting in no gain whatsoever. 
Going on there was never a night time for the Shinobi. Activating his Byakugan he would not see a tree within range, but he would force himself to keep pace and keep breaking the limits. Overcoming the conquering of fatigue and heat Koji would leave a trail of his print across the ground. Unknowingly he would leave his mark on the world as the weight of his garment forced his print onto the earth. 
Drinking water in heavier amounts he would extinguish the last bit of water he had. Tunneling through the heat. Activating his Byakugan to see if there was anywhere near to rest Koji would find no such place. Though there was light outside it was would do him no different if he were in a pitch black cave. For there was nothing in sight for miles as he ran on he began to feel the tightening of his muscles. 
Not having water would for sure dry him out, but he was able to force himself on. Raspy in breathe, and boiling from the heat of the unusual long day. Koji's vision would become hazy not seeing what's in front he would pass out due to the extreme heat. As he fades in and out of consciousness Koji would say, "I will not stop." Thud*
Falling upon his knees, and twirling over on his back Koji would fall under a leaf of a tree. Mouth opened and leaf soaked with water from a leak above it. Would fall into Koji's mouth as he laid passed out, thus allowing him proper recover. 
Upon waking up Koji would cough from a droplet entering his mouth. He would then cover his mouth and raise up to witness what's around the area. Scoping out the area with his Byakugan he would sense no danger in the immediate area. Noticing the leak from above on a canyon Koji would hoist himself up and begin to climb. 
Gripping the rock he knew this would be great workout for his forearms and calves. Firmly gripping a protruding rock one after another. Gaining ground with each clutch positioning himself with his foot it would began to strain his calves. Keeping from falling Koji would find this canyon would not be easy getting up. Infested with rodents on the side the young teen began to palm them off. 
This agitated them as a whole so they would begin to swarm the boy! Activating Suimen he stand tall and ready to crush the pests. Before beginning his assault he would say, "You guys really messed up my training this was supposed to be a simple climbing exercise. ROTATION!" Activating his jutsu he would obliterate these creatures in a single swoop.
Following the events of his attacks Koji would follow up by keeping his Suimen activated and run up this canyon! Sprinting up this canyon he would make it to the top in the blink of an eye! Upon making it to the exact edge he would flip above it and witness the scene above. There before him was a gardened spring!
A true chance to relax the young teen would embrace himself in the water drinking it and later bathing in it. This would revitalize his body completely especially after his well-earned nap. Setting up camp here Koji would pass out on the spot without hesitation!
Waking up refreshed and healthy Koji would start his training yet again. His pace would be faster than he started days ago. Galloping through the gardened spring he would end up in woods. Traversing rapidly he would make a grand distance within the woods before coming into contact with trouble.
Through his Byakugan he would see a pack of wolves blood thirsty in nature seek him out. They had been following him for a while now, and he had just hoped they'd leave him alone by instinct. That wasn't the case savage in nature it was clear they wanted blood. (NEW MOVE ENTERED)
Piercing through the forest trees Koji would take his stance and begin practicing a new technique. While training for the Gate of Opening. Taking his gentle fist stance he would begin to surge his chakra within his palm he would call it Gentle Fist Death Surge. 
As he channels an immense amount of chakra into his palms he would strike a wolf with a single strike surging a lethal dose of chakra in a lethal organ causing an instant death, and destruction of the organ touched. Charging one of the beast quicker than it could react Koji would begin his assault. Striking the wolf, then sending a surge through the contact skull its brain would be wrecked. 
Moving on to the next he would say, "Learning to channel my chakra through the first gate, and having such control over my kekkai genkai has made this move quite easy to learn, but it still needs work!" As he charges the next he wishes for the attack to be in unison, as he makes contact there should be a surge large enough to erupt the victim's organ. 
Attacking the second wolf he would make contact its Kidney! Incapacitating the beast he would then send a surge through the exact same spot. Causing the explosion of the organ, of course. As he completed this act he would rotate and set his eyes on the third wolf.
Focusing once more with his Byakugan Koji would strike for the beast's Lungs this would deal the same effect, but this wolf would die the harshest it will choke to death. Koji wouldn't quite yet master the timing of the attack. Thus, making it incomplete but he would continue to work on it. 
Surviving the threat he would continue to run, run, and run until he reached his destination. Not yet tired he would pass tree after tree after tree. Then rock after rock beginning to pant harder and harder as he exerted himself through the rigorous training exercise. Never had he ran for such a distance in a time. As sleep escaped him he would continue to run. 
"They should call me the running man at this point." Koji would say jokingly to himself. As the moon rose, so did his fatigue but he wouldn't quit. The boy didn't want to sleep unless he flat out blacked out. Truly bold he was running without care. Running so much brought thoughts of Kenshin to his mind. 
(I wonder if I can keep up with that guy, yet?) He thought to himself with a grin on his face. Picking up speed he goes to say, "I get that fast, hmph." Now running even faster! Lugging that weight for so long it was as if it had become a part of his very being, but that didn't make it any less easy for the ninja. For the weight kept him from being light on his feet. Though he was used to it he needed to master the weight itself.
Three days the ninja would run, three days the ninja would go without rest, and pushing ever harder to surpass what limits he had. This was in hopes to gain more power, power to defend what he cherished. Be it moral, physical, or imaginary he did not care one bit. As long as he could protect what he cared deeply for. 
It would be on the fourth day the ninja would seek rest to recuperate. He needed rest, his body craved nourishment and rest so that's exactly what he gave it. The boy would sleep for as long as he ran without any disturbances, and would wake to eat without any as well. 
Starting the run that seemed never ending he would find trouble as he strapped on his gear from some pack of lions. Feeling up to the task he would again find practice for his new technique. Taking his stance he would shout, "Gentle Fist Death Surge!" And charge the behemoths! 
 Sending the chakra within the tip of his hand it would begin to glow much like a light bug, and the shinobi Koji would target a single male Lion with this move. Prancing quickly he would strike towards its lung this attack had seemed effective at first, but another glance with his Byakugan would show it only severely damaged it. 
This is good however because now he has found a point in which the chakra is capable of almost getting to the expectation. He no longer needed to surge more chakra in after impact was made on the tenketsu. This lion would be incapacitated for a while before it found death. Koji moving on would seek out another lion in the viscous pack. 
Sizing the lion up it would charge this one was prideful. Koji could sense that much and wanted to give it a quick death for it. As this beast was a warrior by nature accepting the challenge Koji once more channeled his chakra. It would light again just as a light bug, and Koji understanding this would be enough would have made preparations for a follow up. 
Now coming at the lion Koji would choose to strike at the skull. Piercing through the tall yellow grass Koji would increase his speed rapidly. Edging closer to the beast he begins to move his arm forward in motion. About to make contact he would prepare himself to send a surge of chakra through the beast after contact.
Tch* Koji's lit hand would make contact this would be enough to cause a severe brain damage, but not enough to kill. As Koji makes his observation he would send another surge of chakra through his hand. This of course would end the animal's life as we know it. Rotating on the defensive he would see one more anxious lion rearing itself for an attack. 
Leaping towards Koji the lion has made its way high into the air. Exposing itself for an attack sliding under he would once again attempt to harness enough chakra in a single point to execute the beast quickly shouting, "Gentle Fist Death Surge!" Tch* 
Touching the beast's heart this was a fast motion for as the lion leaped towards Koji he would slide beneath it. If he had no struck the beast instantly in a swift move it would mean his head surely! So, as he struck he noticed his chakra was tiny but sharp much like a dagger!
It was this dagger like chakra that at the end of his tip that sent the surge powerful enough to kill the beast. As the beast flew lifeless over Koji and he slid beneath it he would speak, "Still needs work, but I like it..." Staring at his new technique Gentle Fist Death Surge in its final form. 
Wiping the dirt off of himself he began to run, and this time he would pray that it would stay uninterrupted. As he began to sprint he began to think about the weakness of his new technique. Noting that it is strictly close range, and will be noticeably easy to dodge. As the chakra will glow from the tip of his finger. He notes it will be up to him the user as well to be able to surprise the victim and be quick to utilize it. Otherwise, he'd be throwing away chakra during battle. 
Carrying on the running it would make one last observation of the move, and that is it's still close range, and that puts he would seek a move that improves upon this new one. One that can increase his range if only slightly. The thought would be to extend it into a sword, but that will take more training. He would wait and see the progress of Gentle Fist Death Surge first. 
With his mind set the ninja pushes through the exhaustion. Removing the sweat from his head he would march on through the pasture he would begin to see a mountain rise in the distance. Though it would still be far and a ways to travel on foot, but this was all part of the training. 
Heart pacing as he came to his destination he would not give up, or stop as he saw no reason to now that he could see the mountain. He so desperately sought through the world, keeping pace he would make a great distance. Bringing his knees to his chest to exert a more powerful thrust upon the ground.
Now at this point dashing through the field it would seem like he was but a black flash to the animals grazing around him, and yet… Though he moved at this incredible speed it was like the mountain didn't come any closer. This agitated Koji for he noticed his lack of speed now, and he wanted to move faster. This would improve on his skill exponentially, but he was glad he was at least trying to improve upon himself. As it would be worse if he just sat around and did nothing. 
Night would fall and the mountain wouldn't be any clearer Koji exerted himself a lot with the practice of his new technique, but would not stop regardless. As he wanted to make it to the mountain in a haste. He had made it a personal trial as well, and promised himself to take a nice rest when he actually arrived at the mountain. 
Knees becoming lower and Koji's form becoming a bit sluggish he thought it would be a nice idea to stop and rest, but the pride in his heart wouldn't let him even if he ended up crawling the his pride would force him to keep moving forward. At this point rest was for the weak willed in his heart. 
So he pressed on rigorously without stop, and the mountain that was once a glimmer of hope became an eyesore to our hero! He really became irritated and now questions whether or not he would attempt to destroy the mountain when he finally reach the Ginormous Mountain! In his head he began to imagine slicing the mountain with a giant chakra blade. That brought him quite the smile on his face as he struggled forward. 
The mountain ever so far in the distance would escape Koji as he ran and as the moon became the sun, and the sun the moon. He would venture on and on running and running. At this point he didn't know why he was running, but he knew he needed to run so that's what he did. It was religion for him at this point, and he practiced it well. 
Out of consciousness, but still running with extraordinary speed would continue forward without fail. He would eventually slow down to the point to where he would walk and drag himself by sheer will. As his feet flung within the dirt, arms limp like ropes, and head locked on the mountain. His eyes would fade to the stars and eventually shut… Thump*
Passed out, he couldn't go anymore the shinobi teen had done all he could for as long as he could! Now waking up with the sun batting his eye with light would wake in shock. Seeking for his water canteen he would down the water, and nourishments and rest for the day. As the journey had tired him beyond reason. He would scout the area see there was no harm in the distance and pass the freak out. 
Recovered to the best he could be in the wilderness he start the usual preps before the training, and then begin the training itself once more. Now better focused and filled with energy he was ready to close the distance between him and the mountain. He knew it would take a while but he was determined and that was the real factor for how this would playout. 
With his target in sight he takes a runner's start and dashes off in the same motion. Nothing but flat land scattered across the area he would be able to see fresh green grass come up. As the closer he got to the mountain he could tell it had its own atmosphere. It wasn't eerie but had a sense of healing to it, of refreshment to it! 
Something Koji had never encountered before but it brought a bit of serenity to him as he ran through the pasture. He even let go of the rage he harbored for the distant mountain! Matter of fact he had lost any ill will he may had coming into this area. It truly a good place to just sit and meditate. 
Koji making headway but still seeing the mountain off in the distance would run harder and faster. Trying to overcome the trials of the heavy footed-ness caused by the weight of the garments. Putting all he had into this training program Koji wouldn't be discouraged by the distance of the mountain. 
He would say, "I started this run without the vision of the mountain in my eye's presence, so I can damn well finish this training with it in my eye's presence." With that stated to himself he pressed forward even more. Increasing his stamina even more! He was feeling stronger as the times passed, and this was more than enough to encourage his progress. 
With the distance closing ever so slightly he would let the breathe escape him heavier and heavier as he pressed on. He would break the chains that held him back as he pressed on and on. It would be as if he was running away from something, but also at the same time running towards something! 
Weakness to strength it seemed Koji was headed, but another look at it was from slavery to freedom! With each stride he took it would be another step toward freedom. As he grew in strength he would be able to make a move without question. It would be a new kind of feeling that's for sure. He would find that speed would be freedom.
As he sought that freedom though the chains would grow tight on him, and he would have to break these with each stride he took across this open pasture. Any mental blocks Koji would seek to destroy them as he ran. He would allow nothing to impede his efforts.
On the journey of becoming a speed monster Koji was still running. Even though his legs screamed out their pain, though his heart pounded on his chest to stop, and though his lungs attempted to suck away his breathe. It would all be for naught. 
"Finally." Koji would say as he ventured further into the pasture. He could see the edge of the mountain suppressed under luxurious plants and wildlife. The ninja would let out a sigh of relief for making it this far, and say, "Let us rest a good while." Speaking to his mind, body, and soul*
Now able to rest peacefully it was as if the pasture around him nurtured him within his sleep. The torn muscles, and scars he had receives during his perilous journey would be healed. As the grass brushed over them gentle at the tip of their being. Truly this was an area not ever experienced by the shinobi before.
Upon waking up, the ninja would make his way toward the edge and begin to meditate in front of the mountain before climbing the behemoth, because it was if he was drawn to do such a thing within the pasture. It was as if this was necessary. So, he stood and he channeled within himself the gates unconsciously seeking the Gate of Healing within the pasture.

With that knowledge he would bestow on Yan and his members ahead of time. * - Thu Oct  1 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yup. Let us go report. - Fri Oct  2 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Eyes closed the ninja would reflect on his trials he survived to get here. Imaging of the start of his run from Suna. Koji would feel as though he was running even though he stood in a single spot. It was as if the meditative state had transferred him back into the exact moment. As he ran in memory, he panted in present he had truly found a place in his mind to reside. 
This would mimic the training Krillin and Gohan endured with Bulma as they flew to planet Namek. Koji running he would begin to notice that though he was in this meditative state. The conditions in which he ran were drastically changed. Leaping ahead full speed he wouldn't find himself in a desert on the outskirts of Suna, but a high grassy hill! 
The hill being as high as the famous literature work of jack and the bean stalk. Koji would drop a jaw at such the immaculate structure. Wasting no time he would begin to hike this mountainous hill. Running up would be a small hassle, but once he arrived to a point where the hill began to elevate he would find struggle.
Not wanting to activate Suimen until he reached the point at which the hill was straight vertical. Koji would press forward almost as if he lunging this was due to the angle. He had to also keep a certain pace, or gravity itself would pull him down to the ground. If that happened it would mean sure death for the ninja. 
Leaving Koji's mind for a brief moment we see that the ninja is actually sweating a load! The sweat piercing every pore on his skin, and escaping to the ground below. This is not all we can see the legs fidgeting along with the arms! He was truly in motion, and face was riddled with determination. 
Going back within his mind the terrain of the hill had changed no longer green and lushes, but cold and rigid! It had become a freezer wasteland knowing he couldn't jump down, or make shelter on the side of an escalating hill. The young ninja kept moving, and would not slow in pace for if he did it would be over. As the heat from motion would keep his body warm, and thus surviving a frozen death. 
His prints would be made into the high-inch snow, and yet his pace would not slow. Blizzard would bump his face, and yet he would not slow! Snow would fall into balls, and yet he would not slow! This ninja determined to live would defy all forms of death and press on ever more. 
Moving higher up Koji has found the break in the storm as the sun began to pierce the cold. It would evaporate it all in a flash! As if the light was fire itself and in those moments… The ninja knew this would not be in his favor later. 
Though he would rejoice and even pick up pace to try, and hope he would make it to the top before he would become scrambled eggs under the scorching heat. The sweat did more burning that cooling on Koji's skin as he trekked up the mountain. He would begin to stare at his while he ran, because the sun was just too bright at this point. Scoping out the distance was a no go now.
Outside the perils of Koji's meditation we see that he's entered into the first gate of his chakra flow. The Gate of Opening as his limits are reached in this meditative state he would seek to go even further than full strength. 
Surging with power the ninja still stood still with his eyes shut, but face as riddled as ever with determination. The boy's body was enduring just as well but you could tell it's frantic by the tightening of flesh. Even though he must've felt this pain it wouldn't remove him from the state he's in. 
Within his mind the heat was wretched in nature the once green, and then snowy plane. Was now the land of ashes! There was no color except for black how Koji survived such brutality of the heat he'll never know. He simply said, "It must be because I'm already burnt." Referring to his natural skin tone. 
Moving forward at the same pace the heat felt as though it started to singe through Koji's garment. As he ran his backpack would go up into flames! Next his garments, then his shoes! After that his undergarments! Koji was straight naked now as he periled through the heat. 
His feet would smoke upon touching the ground forcing him to become even faster on his feet! He would not be stopped by mere heat alone, or cold weather for that matter. Persevering thorough the pain the shinobi continued forward with great haste. 
It was as if the man became light as a feather pressing on the land ever so gently, but keeping the speed remarkably fast altogether. He was perfecting his body's technique becoming one with his practice. This would make a great tai-jutsu specialist indeed. 
Witnessing the strain on the body within the real world was devastating you could see the fatigue truly. His body gasping for life and rest you could say at the same time it simply begged for death. As even that would bring it freedom from the strain it was enduring, but Koji's spirit and soul told a different story! 
Pursuing the dream ever more Koji would break the heat of the sun, and night would come with a cool breeze. This breeze would soothe the ninja, but it would be short lived. As the wind began to pick up it was as if the wind now tried to brush him off his balance. 
With the force of wind increasing with every shot of gust made at him the shinobi of Suna would have no choice but to give in to such demands by nature! He knocked off the hill and sent pummeling to his death! Or, so we thought… 
As he was knocked down a flood would be rising one Koji would notice through his Byakugan. He would swiftly prepare his Suimen! Allowing himself to balance on the rising flood waters, and this would eventually bring the ninja not back from where fell, but to the top of the hill!
Landing now on the top of the hill naked to all! He would step of the water, and as he did this action the water would disperse into nothing. When his foot embraced the grass it was just as calmly embraced by the grass. Koji would be revived with extra-ordinary vigor. Getting rejuvenated he would again reach a new level of strength and speed as well. 
Opening his eyes the boy would feel no pain, but a boost in energy and in strength he had achieved it… The Gate of Healing was unlocked finally, but this was not all as he opened his eyes and examined the area he saw that he had made it to the top of the mountain. Rather, he had already been there!
