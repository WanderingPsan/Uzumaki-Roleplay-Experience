<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 

	Scoping the area out would notice that the water, trees, and rocks on top of the mountain had been arranged in his clan's famous art Eight Tri Gram symbol. Standing in the center the young shinobi would train to master the art, and the Gate of Healing all at once. It was as if Koji had no control at this point it was all instinct.


	Gathering his chakra this ninja would expel an amount that would allow him sense the area. Not from a wide amount, but fifteen feet allowing him to feel the disturbance of an oncoming attack that may be invisible to his eye.


	Using the falling leaves and nuts would attempting to palm them as the fell over him. In an attempt to perfect his striking, speed, and endurance. This would go on for days! For the top of this mountain would produce a self-restoration factor by nature when it was appropriate, so Koji would train until that set time. 


	No longer able to tell time the hours would seem like eternity to the ninja. As he punched each leaf that fell they would begin to fall more rapidly. So, unable to keep up with this reaction the ninja would begin dodging. This was not only thanks to his eyes, but the chakra he emitted to sense the falling leaves. 


	Getting over run by the leaves Koji would rotate creating release an immense amount chakra! Stopping the leaves in their track, and at that very same moment the leaves would be rotated out of his vicinity. 


	As leaves landed the trees would retract to the edge of the Eight Tri Gram symbol. This was also the edge of the mountain itself! With the edges secured Koji would take his rest against the bark of the tree. He would be replenished of all necessary nourishment by the miracle of the mountain.


	While still sleeping the ninja Koji would be rushed to the center of the Eight Tri Gram symbol by the trees retaking their original positions. It would be as if he was slapped awake and on his feet by the branches of the trees. Focus himself Koji activates his Byakugan, and as he takes his stance he begins to emit chakra from out his body. This was to sense of any incoming attacks he couldn't see. 


	The leaves would begin to fall upon the boy, and he wouldn't let a single leaf touch, or even brush the cloth of his shirt. This was him honing his reflexes as he needed much improvement in that area. As this happened the leaves would begin to pick up speed forcing the hands of Koji to strike. 


	Striking quickly the ninja would destroy each leaf due to the force of chakra being emitted. As the leaves shattered to dust the trees would begin to drop the leaves ever more quickly. The scene would imitate rainfall around Koji as he trained. 


	Sweating grilling off his arms Koji would engage himself in the stress of surpassing the limits of the human body. Teeth grit as he dodges and thrust a palm at the leaves with much effort. The ninja was trying to master the art of the Gentle Fist. 


	Feeling the pressure of being the last competent Hokuma clan member Koji must master himself, and the techniques so he can rejuvenate his clan. It was an ugly world and he wanted to add a mark of beauty to it. Even if it's small it will be something giving worth to this dark world. 


	With these thoughts rummaging through his head Koji was becoming more confident and determined. His mission became more and more clear! It was no longer about revenge, but something bigger than that! Than, himself… Thrust* Thrust*


	With each thrust Koji made the sweat broke off his head and onto the ground. Feeling each leaf penetrate his area of chakra field Koji would strike each with great precision. It was like he could see not only three-hundred and sixty degree, but in the dark as if the sun was out clear as day. 



	There was no hindrance in this man's sight. Much like his devotion to Flexus! Koji had found a new way to represent his late friend. This was by restoring his Clan it would bring respect and honor back to the desolate land. He wanted his people to be the shield of Suna and protect the village forever. 



	Having these thoughts as he trained Koji would begin to hit even faster within the Eight Tri Gram symbol. It was an epic fury at this point! As his heart rate increased from the thoughts of the future so did his punches and effort. Sensing the leaves falls ever more efficiently he would strike so rapidly! 



	It was as if he was seeing them in slow motion thrust after thrust there was time to maneuver. He was moving beyond comprehension at this point no one was stopping this motion! The trees could drop at a faster rate, nor drop anymore at this point. They were forced to retreat to the outer corners for the time being. 



	After the trees retreated the rocks within the Eight Tri Gram would begin to rise. And rocks the size of leaves would begin to trickle down upon Koji. As his chakra was still being emitted and Byakugan still active the ninja would begin thrusting out his palms once more! Koji was amazed at how quickly the scenes shifted. It was as if another mountain was just grown from the dirt!



	This amazement wouldn't make the young ninja lose focus however. With the process continuing Koji would be forced to use all his strength! As the mountain had created a boulder to fall upon him, but as the boulder came crashing down it would trigger his chakra sensors. Prompting Koji to expel all his chakra using his clan's famous offense and defense rotation! Throwing away the giant rock to the distance. 



	This exertion would force him to his butt and blacking out. The healing property of the mountain would heal him once again with all he needed. Koji receiving all his nourishment would rest peacefully until the mountain deemed it was time to continue training. 



	Rocks would begin to rumble and shake as Koji slept they would batter his face. Startling him upon his awakening. It would force him to say, "What the Hell!" Taking up his stance and activating his Byakugan Koji would begin his assault on the rocks as they fell mercilessly! Thrust* Thrust*



	This time with each destruction of the rock instead of increasing in speed would increase in size! Forcing Koji to increase his chakra output in order to destroy this rock. Thus, depleting his chakra more quickly, because with each thrust it would require more and more. It was truly ironic that the mountain healed, but drained at the same time. 



	As hours passed Koji would push the limitations of his body even more. He wouldn't quit that was the motto of the day. Surging his chakra through these rocks now the size of cantaloupes it was becoming very hard for the ninja. He was exerting more than he ever imagined he would need to!



	Arms would now tighten as he thrusted and retracted! Legs now stiff from keeping the stance his muscle were tired from the training, but he would carry on! The mountain training Koji would not kill the boy. Sensing his limits it would keep the rocks at a constant size this was to keep the rocks from crushing the ninja to death.  Because, if they got any bigger his chakra hits wouldn't be enough. 



	Keep in mind Koji has been keeping a constant speed of attacking these rocks as they grew in size. Not letting up for a moment! Being able to see and divert his movements in time to strike. Koji was gasping at this point, but not knowing the mountain wouldn't kill him would carry on. Thrusting and thrusting it would be the destruction of the rocks or Koji's body in Koji's mind. 



	Not being able to effectively keep up with the rainfall like rocks falling Koji's body would be blistered and swollen from the pounding! Not to mention scraped and bleeding from the sharp edges! It was a brutal sight to behold imagine nightsticks being pounded on an unarmed, untrained, and an ignorant civilian! And that is the image of Koji at the moment. Koji would get desperate now that his chakra reserves were getting low. 



	 Out of desperation Koji would rotate the rocks out to the distance, but this wouldn't end the assault. Now on his knees from exhaustion the rocks would continue to pound him. It was brutal his back would began to tear and scar in various places. His rotation couldn't safe him this time. 



	It would be in this time that Koji would began to get lost in thought. Remembering the fights he's lost in the past one that hurts him the most would be the one against Hassasn. Being defeated so easily by him really hurt his pride. The wind bullets he release back in Kiri that pounded him to a straight knock out in an instant was insulting. And this instance was exactly the same it began to infuriate him. 



	With that anger and devotion to not be as weak as he was in that past time Koji would stand. Slowly he would gather himself up with his knees shaking, and head being struck bare Koji would again stand on his feet. With the energy surging through him once more, but he was stronger this time. He could feel it… The mountain could feel it… 



	This reflected the Gate of Healing in many aspects, so Koji knew he was getting close to opening that gate once more. As he focus on the task at hand he would take no time to reflect on such trivial matters at this time. For the rocks began to fall rapidly, but not to the point of which he could not see. That being said he would strike with devastating power pounding the rocks into sand itself!



	At this point Koji's eyes were glimmering with perseverance! Though his eyes appear blank. Anyone in the area would see as the veins pulsated chakra to his eyes the ninja was peering far through the present time. In fact you could tell he was staring a future enemy dead in the face, and he was staring back it was life or death.



	The fury of heavy punches would continue without fail, and the stare would become even harder. Punches just as devastating as they started Koji would not be defeated by inanimate objects. Koji possessing already great stamina was now pushing himself to new heights of endurance. 



	He would at this point seem inhuman to the naked eye. No one should take such a pounding and live! Blood dripping down his forehead into his mouth Koji would spit and continue the barrage. Blood circulating even more rapidly Koji was feeling more than energetic! He was feeling elevated!



	Koji would destroy so many rocks at a time it created a smoke around the area, but that wouldn't slow him down one bit! He would now run up the mountain and go on the offensive striking the rocks as the fell. He was full of power and energy and he was showing it, but it was time for him to slow down. 



	As he would fall without expectation to the ground unconscious as he did this the land below would change into a pond catching Koji peacefully. It would begin to heal him as floated within the water. Wounds and all! As if they never existed, but this was unique because it also sped up the muscle repair process. Allowing him to recuperate faster and grow in strength faster!



	Waking up Koji would be on top of land feeling refreshed and energized, but would be on the bottom of the mountain once more. He was confused, but understood whatever that needed to be done was done. So, with that wisdom he began to run, run, and run… 



	Passing through trees on the way he would be clothed with new threads as he passed through each one. Upon exiting the pasture he would slapped on the ass by a branch. It was a good luck tap, because the journey won't be easy as it wasn't near easy but impossible. 



	Sprinting through the valley Koji would note his movements were faster than is arrival. Now, going through the valley the ninja would press forward as he knew the weather would be harsh heading back, and wanted to make it as far as possible before night. There was a wind coming in and Koji knew not what it was bringing. 



	With each leg flexing forward, and foot stomping upon the ground it would be as if the world was standing still in Koji's eyes. With the wind increasing in speed it began to mask his face. Making it impossible to open his eyes and move his legs forward. 



	Koji trying to keep pace would find trouble with this task, because the force of the wind was creating a wall. One that was almost as stable as a building! He would be forced to leave the traditional running stance, and change them to a pushing-position. 



	Now marching forward it would be as though he was rolling boulder, and he moved forward! Activating the Gate of Opening he would roll out the strength need to bull doze through this heavy wind. Now finding a pace he is able to run efficiently at would let out a sigh of relief. 



	Keeping pace the wind would not let up, but increase in pressure! So much so it would feel as though he was swimming through wind itself. Legs though moving unchained to anything feels as if they're lugging trains. It was madness never before had Koji experienced such a force of nature. 



	Essentially blind due to the force of wind shutting his eyes. Koji was now running in the dark for the first time! It would be the first time in his life where he had to press forward without knowledge of what's around him. This would create an insecurity within him, but not enough to give.



	Cautious now in his proceedings his pace would slow a bit, but images of Hassan's wind attack bulleting Koji unconscious. Would force Koji to push through without fail! He wasn't for losing again to his Lord so easily. With that cause Koji began to shout at the storm enraged, "Do you think you can stop me?" 



	Koji blindly would began moving forward still within Gate of Opening, and start thrusting his palms at the wind. Instead of pushing Koji would now palm his way through the wind. This was effective more so than the pushing he was doing earlier, so he did it continuously! Busting holes allowing him to move forward easily at a constant speed. Although not as fast as he was originally before the wind came. 



	With the wind still raging Koji would be at this limits in punching and running now! Using his Gate ability didn't help either as this drained his stamina, but having inhuman stamina he would push the threshold once on this journey. Quitting just wouldn't be in this guy's diary. 



.	Pressing forward even more Koji's muscles would feel as though they were about to tear themselves open! Literally he could feel his rapid thrust over-working his arms, and the force required to move forward through the wind would also claim its toll! Unable to continue the wind would pick Koji up, and swing him about like a rag doll. 



	Heart beating intensely and breathe panting as if he was choking briefly. Koji would regain consciousness, and find himself back on the top of the mountain. Rejuvenated and fully healed. This would immediately encourage him to say, "What the flying Fu--? Did I even leave?" 



	Not staying with the pondering Koji would look down and see the Eight- Tri Gram symbol was gone from the top of the mountain, and would begin his hike down the mountain. Making it to the bottom now, and this time with the experience he would begin his run. 



	As Koji was running he couldn't help but reflect on the experience he had. He felt the exhaustion and pain, but couldn't make out how he ended back on the top of the mountain. But, then again how he came to the top in the first place was a mystery as well! Striding forward he wouldn't fret, because this is officially the finish stride of the finish.

Before approaching too close Koji with his Byakugan would seek out all that was underneath them. He would spot 20 deadly scorpions.


Relaying this to his squad members he would say, "The scorpions are bellowed below. Now Hassan wants us to kill them simultaneously. We can keep this simple. Lera and Flexus you are both able to do Earth based moves correct?"* - Thu Oct  8 18:33:10 2015

Would say, "Nows not the time Tril-guy just an old friend. Now ready yourself with a move. I will rotate the bears from the dirt exposing them within the air be careful to not be bitten." 

Sensing their presence Koji would rotate in such a way that pick up the beasts as a tornadoe would a random object not stapled to the ground. Lera and Trilliam would have enough time to strike in combination as they rotated from the emitted chakra, or as they were flung far forward. Koji would keep them posted on how the scorpions moved afterwards. * - Thu Oct  8 18:46:49 2015

Now pointing over to Trill* Koji says, "He'll be planning a big surprise for the Mama of course, so be careful of his moves. They're explosive in nature. I expect you all to listen to me well. When I say retreat... retreat.." 

Using his Byakugan would scope out the area, and see two life forces, but due to Trilliam's chakra changing the atmosphere. One would pop out Giant in nature. Where there's a mother there's a father. By the anxious nature it was assumed to be the father the ninjas would now react. 

Koji would let the others know that the giant one approaching was charging Trilliam directly, and that it was also bringing its babies. Koji directs the two SuSu and Isshin to take care of them.

He could tell this wasn't his strong suit. It was clear the father scorpion was down for the count being beaten to death by pelting rocks. 

Koji would focus his eye sight as the mother had moved through the commotion it had traveled underneath the ground of her now dismembered babies! Unaffected by the blast of Koji's kunai due to the boulders that scaled down its back it would charge the shinobi. Prompting Koji to react quickly, but beign a giant beast he would need a boost to even begin to turn the damn thing. 

Opening the first gate, and using rotation he would swing the beast in Trilliams direction. As he felt he was preparing a powerful attack. This would be the end of the ignorant thing is he was successful. * - Fri Oct  9 04:52:41 2015
