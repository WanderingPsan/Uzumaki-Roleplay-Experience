<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) peers deep within the cave, and would see traps swet in various place of the cave, and though these traps could be seen they could not be avoided! There would be a sfot spot on the netrance foor unlock the rest of the surfaced door, and with a closer look there would lay a switch. This could be seen with his x-ray vision, and he would let the miners know that if they struck this something would happen, so it;s besti f they stap back. As this was only one of many, and Koji knew not the effects of these traps. 

Without looking back he would ask, "Are you two ready? This place seems to be a death trap, and I imagine there's someone at the end of these triggers." This was told to keep the members of Ravenscrotum alert for anything. With that Ravenscrotum would set out to rid the cave of its dangerous nature. * - Sat Oct 17 05:44:44 2015

It seemed the seals were a riddle and a clue to what would happen. Koji would ponder what would happen, but had no clue.* - Sat Oct 17 06:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) after organizing himself, and dispersing his clutter would now attempt the mastering of his clan's jutsu. Dropping into his stance Koji would channel the chakra into his eye, thus activating his Byakugan. Peering down the solid rock he would strike point in where he saw weakly solidified rock upon the wall. This woud be the first real time Koji applied what is known as the sixty-four palm! He would grunts as he impacted the wall! Counting in his head the number of hits!* - Sat Oct 17 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wiping the seat from his  face would say, "Thank you Marissa. Actually seeing chakra points is more beneficial!" He would say this with a smile as he turned toward the clone the rock behinf him would crumble, but deep just a shed of it's out layer. Now facing the clone with serious intent he once again takes his stance, and channels the chakra. Seeing the points he wish to make contact with Koji lines the clone up. Catching it in his range of the Eight Trigram circle, and at this moment the clone's faith would be sealed. Unleashing a fury of thrusted palms the tenketsus would be hit without fail. This would cripple the clone, sealing its point, and thus, causing it to disperse. Koji would leave his stance as it was key that he kept the flow going. He was all about rythm and flow. * - Sat Oct 17 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) still focues would scan the clone's body, and all three hundred and sixty-one tenketsu points within its body. Within the grasps of his Eight-Tri gram circle Koji would operate on the clone. By seeking its spine as he lined up the clone he would thrust down the veterbrae hitting sixty-four tenketsu point along the way. Being the spine this would cause heavier dose of paralysis, than if he had striked in front. Koji would note this from the clone's behavior after he struck it, and before it dispered back into wherever clones go when they disperse. Koji once again keeping his stance, and focus.* - Sat Oct 17 18:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing that the clone were aligned would rush between two of them, and unleash a brutal thirty-32 palm to each of the couple that was in his range of attack. As he is inbetween them each clone is about threeand a half feet away, and this caused them to be trapped wthin his Eight- Trigram circle. This sequence would be interchanging as he went to one he would go for another. As he contact a set he would move to contact with. This would be a rapid sequence, and cause the inflicted to be stunned. Koji would have aimed for both torso areas of the clone. On the last strike delivered on each of the two clones they would be blown back, and thus disperse into energy... Or whereever clones may go after being dispered. 

Seeing the last clone about fourteen feet away now. Koji would channel the chakra within his hand to the point that it lit blue, and struck the third clone in the gentle fist art, and following in unison the sixty-four palm jutsu. Koji was practicing his savagery as he prepared for the unknown threat that may have been preparing itself just as well, or better. * - Sat Oct 17 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Takes out his scroll and begins to study his scroll extensively. He would glance down with great focus as he sought to perceive the knowledge that was engraved on the scroll. His eye would swivel left to right in a rapid motion, and he would begin to think of ways to incorporate such a move with his tai-jutsu. He didn't want to learn a move that wouldn't advance him as a ninja, but upon studying he would find use indeed. 

	In order to engrave the knowledge of the scroll into his mind Koji would scribble and draw what he saw. As he swiped in the dirt it the dirt the images he saw he would continue to think of ways to use this new move. Many ideas would come to his mind, but none enough to wow him just yet. It needed to act in accordance with everything he knew, but until that time came when he got that right idea Koji would soak in the knowledge of the scroll. * - Sat Oct 17 19:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Continuing to scribble Koji would take his time drawing out the symbol, and was to absorb all he could in the motion. That would include why the hand seal was this way, and not that way, why the foot was spread this way, and not that way. Koji was doing the most, but he wanted to perfect the jutsu. So, he endeavored on in his tedious task of studying the scroll. You could see the intent to learn on the boy's face, and the effort from his shaking hand. This was from the extensive training only hours before.* - Sat Oct 17 19:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would take a brief moment now to mimic the hand signs he had just traced in the ground from the scroll. It would be a delicate process as he had just started, so the images would be uite in his head yet. He would look back and forth between hi hands and the scroll. Switchting through symbols and stances Koji was learning by repitition. So, with each mistake and correction he was improving! However little it may be it was enough to get him a step further in his dealtings with advanced jutsu that now laid before him.* - Sat Oct 17 19:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Getting to the head of Sunagakure's gate would meet with the Escort, and Koji would inform the man that he is the Leader of Ravenscortum. And, that they would be getting him to his destination in one piece. As they headed out of the village Koji would, say "Arata and Ai what are your specialties?" This was to get a feel for the team, so that we didn't mess up upon the ambush." 

As Koji talked and informed the members of Ravenscrotum they would move with Koji at the side of Dain Tain. With Arata and Ai in their respective positions that made sense. * - Wed Oct 21 02:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound)  and Ravenscrotum now leaving Sunagakure, and with great haste! Koji and Arata would take turns to see the surrounding area for sixteen bodies, and any traps in the area. Having two Hyugas in the squad would eliminate any type of surprse unbeknowst to the individual. With the Dai Tain "Whatever" close by the squad would notice abnormalties along the way to the destination. 

Koji would inform his team that he has trekked this road a few times, and never seen logs stacked in a way of that demonstrated construction soon. So, he directed the squad to stop and scout the area. The chakra would  began to pulsate to the Hyuga eys, and the veins that were connected to his eyes would become more prevelant. As his eys cringed during the search Koji would take his stance, and begin to count. 

"One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine... Lucky us there is enough for each of us. Three Are behind the stacked logs, Three behind trees that provide shadow to the left, and another set in the bushes. Bandits.... spit*" 

The bandits wouldn't know Koji would spot them early as he could sense 105 blocks. So, the team mainly Ai would have a chance to destroy the opponets behind the logs before they enacted whatever plan they were intending. Thus, the escotee would stay near her. While Arata and Koji bolt to the sides to eliminate the other six remaining n the respective positions. * - Wed Oct 21 03:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing the prowess of the ninja from behind his head made him admire the ninja's skill. Heading forward he didn't want to try too hard to defeat the enemies , so as he ran he would initiate the Firtst Gate of Opening. When he arrived face to face with the ninja they could feel the inensity of his chakra as he excreted it through the Gentle Fist Art. Staring the men in thei eyes as if he was peering through them, and speaking to their very soul Koji would say, "Sadly, you have sought the life of an innocent, and for that I seek your life." 

At the end of his phrase the ninja Koji would palm each man a respective amount of times with the gentes fist technique in the heart. He would then unleash the Hokuma clan's hidden jutsu upon their their souls. This was death as they were trapped in his Eight trigram circle. Each strike would be aimed toward the heart, this would undoublty cause a stroke or atleast something of that nature.... "These are weak low level bandits afterall..." 

Koji would head back to the group after this, and say, "Good work Ai, you don't ever have to kill if that's not your wish." Of course, he noticed she didn't need that reassurance, but Koji doesn't want anyone to feel forced to go against their beliefs or moral reasons. Koji eyes would remain vigilant as he cried out to Arata. 

At the end of his cry to Arata Koji would state, "There are seven men left... Six bandits and One assasin. Stay alert."  * - Wed Oct 21 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) With the death of the enemies, and having six left Koji would palm three of the neck. Due to the sheer force of the attack they would choke on whatever it is people choke on when cocked hard in the throat. Within hsi vision he would see Arata taking on the enemy, and Ai guarding the Dai just fine. After the fighting events Ravenscrotum would make it to their destination, and see the Dai to wherver he needed to go within the village. 

There was a celebration on the sucess of the mission with the head of the village. He gave us plenty of food, and other stuff the members of Ravenscrotum liked. They would head home soon after these events, and Koji woulld note the events within his Desert Owl Task Force Notebook for the report to Hassan. The ease of the mission was great for the new ninja Arata, and Koji hoped that Arata felt the same way. 

As they headed back Koji would say to Ai, because he forgot to answer her, "Mmm, Something meaty and ricey probably soaked in some zesty like sauce." Now, at the gate Koji would say, "I had fun with you guys today hope we can go on more mission in the future together." As he finished these words he would walk into the village all peaceful like.* - Wed Oct 21 05:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) rises off the ground from his nap taking his ratherly tall stance for his age. Beneath him would be a crater sadly this was prevolent when Koji was around. Now standing Koji would wipe the dirt from his clothes, and hair he would then turn to Nyoko to properly speak. It was unlike him to not face anyone while talking, but he was trying to wrap an idea around why Arata seemed so cautious about joining his family. Staring at the woman he shakes his dreads briefly to get sand from his head, but it was for naught. 

As he began to speak his eye would seem expressionless, but his heart was compassionate of the people he fought for, "Well that's an answer you get while you live, but sitting around isn't too much fun. If you ever need a tour, or want to accompany on a mission just let me know."

He said this with a well seasoned laugh inbetween his words as seeing the sights were one of Koji's favorite things about mission... Well except for the people he palm in the cranium on occassions That's usually not a  sight people liked to see. With that said Koji would go about keeping guard duty around the square. Turining from the girl, Koji's veins connected to his eyes would grow in size due to a chakra begining to surge through them.

Given no response from the Yoko character Koji would figure she was too busy, or didn;t hear him. He would go about his day, because she didn't look like she was looking to cause trouble. After this, Koji would sit in the sand, and begin meditating on a scroll he had recently been studying. As he sat his hands would form the necessary seals in order to perform the jutsu. This would be a repetitive action as he sat in the dirt with his eyes open of course, and this would look a bit bit, because he was on guard duty and his eyes' veins were pulsating quite largely. So largely they would be visible to anyone looking at him! * - Thu Oct 22 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) surveying the area deems it safe, and is still proceeding to make the necessary hand signs to perform the jutsu. Koji was imagining moves to work in unison with this technique, and names as this would sky-rocket his performance. Koji was all about advancing moves and making them unique to him, so this why in his thoughts he says beyblade, and rotation at times. But, he'll never shout it that goes against his upbringing, but with time passing the shinobi is still practicing his hand signs as he sits on the ground. * - Thu Oct 22 00:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) continued to focus around the village as as he could, and practiced each sign necessary for the scroll he had been studying for weeks now. His hands were forming back to back swiftly with no hesitation in the configuration. Koji began to feel confident in his movement from the dedication he gave the jutsu, but dedication and admiration of such success wouldn't get the jutsu perfected, so he pressed on with the seal forming. Koji began to thinkof more moves to flow out of this one jutsu, and this would grant a smie on his face as he sat in the dirt. * - Thu Oct 22 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would now stand and while forming the hand seal he would begin to channel is chakra. This would come easy due to his Gentle Fist Art, but he would cut no corners. Taking the proper stance Koji began to destribute the chakra throughout various points of the body, and once there he wouldl retract from the point was made. This was to cause a recognition of the required chakra through tedious repitition. Though, this would cause fatigue much quicker than normal. Thus, making this a process that'll take days as recovery will be needed for the body. * - Thu Oct 22 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be expelling chakra from his core and into the required place. Once there he would hold and charge from that point, but wouldn't perform the jutsu at this time. Instead, he would retract his chakra, and let out a sigh of relief as this was a tiring process to keep up. He would complete this process ten times in succession, and 40 times in failures. The improvement was heavily noted by Koji as he pervered through the challenge. * - Thu Oct 22 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would take a break, and walk around the vilage to see if anything escaped is vision in the time he was training. * - Thu Oct 22 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) heearing I'm ready sets his stance, and charges the chakra into his eys. Thus, causing them to pulsate larger than normal. they would appear even to the naked eye. Though his stare was blank and expressionless Koji could see all, and most difinitely expressed emotions. If if the special ed kid Trilliam calls him the White Eyed Devil... 

After that soap opera of Koji, the ninja now charges Izanami he would perform a Leaf Whirlwind, and follow up with attacks in the gentle fist art. They would aim for the right arm of the girl, and if able to make contaact he would strike down it.  As he stared through the girl Koji would prepare himself for any build up of chakra that may be performed in this turn unbeknowst to him. * - Thu Oct 22 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) upon making contact would be pushed back, and this surprised him causing his palm to be burned However, he would srill be able to seal one tenketsu. Koji would say, "That was impressive... Too hot to be touched haha." As he spoke this Koji would test the ability of the shroud not ever having dealt with something of this nature before. Charging her once more Koji would charge again for decreasing her chakra, thus decreasing hte effectiveness of the flame. 

If he was able to make it face to face Koji would unleash rotation thus throwing Izanami back without touching her physically. He would then charge her while she recuperated with palms of the Gentle Fist.* - Thu Oct 22 03:18:24 2015
