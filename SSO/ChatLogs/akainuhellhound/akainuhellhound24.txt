<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) was striking the tree repitively within the Gentle Fist stance sweat would be glistening off the young boy as he trained himself to increase the proficiency in the usage of his jutsu. The proces was grueling to the shinobi as he had been at this for months now, but he could feel the progression happening. As he noticed his strikes becoming more and more precise with each contact. At the end of this set Koji would have struck the tree sixty-four times again and though the tree looked unscaved to the naked eye. Koji wcould see the damage he was dealing with the prowess of his Byakugan.* - Sun Nov  1 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would notice Mirai enter the frame of his vision from the distance, but he wouldn't yield the progression. He wouldl simply strike the tree continuosly without fail. Koji would normally be unaffected by the desert heat, but today it was rather high in temperature today. Even for the unyielding Koji, however, though burning like a boiled egg he would quit! Koji continued the onslaught on the tree, and at the end of this set he would complete another sixty-four strikes upon the plant. On the last hit Koji would follow up again in the same fahion tieing together his moves. He didn't want to break the rhythm in which he found himself in. He had started a pace so he continued.* - Sun Nov  1 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have completed another set of sixty-four palms. Koji had also been channeling his chakra to his palms in an effort to form a third techniques as well.  This was to create a buff to increase the force, and effectiveness of not only the Gentle Fist, but the Eight-Trigram Sixty-Four Palm technique. He was looking to increase overall speed, and chakra output. On his last strike he would hear the voice of Mirai, and would turn toward her as he withdrew his palm from the bark of the tree. He would release the chakra from his eyes, and body. This would take him out of the fighting stance, and remove his three-hundred and sixty vision. 

Koji would do this to show trust and understanding of the situation that seemed to present itself to him. Now looking at Mirai and reflecting on the tone of her voice he'd say, "Whaat's wrong? I hope you're not hanging on the spar yesterday? You've improved beyond expectation and clearly possess better display of control than me. You have no reason to be sad. There will always be someone stronger, so you should never feel sadness from losing. PLus, that's how you get stronger to lose. Gives ya a reason to train hahah. At least that's how it was for me..... Sigh* You're stronger and faster than me at the moment I see no reason for you to be dissapointed in yourself." Koij doesn't really do good in talking situations cause he's thirteen, but he talks from his own experience of living. He's been through alot, but his age would never show such a thing. It would only be that small wisdom he shares every once in a while. He's battleborne, and something no one ever choose. :p* - Sun Nov  1 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) channels the chakra back into his eyes after speaking about versatility, but he would attack the tree just yet. As he turned toward the tree to peer through it he'd say, "Well I can see the benefit, and we have some pretty experienced medics here already. Plus if you and Sanoke are traveling it's be a great asset!." Koji would do an attack instantly after he spoke this. Another sixty-four strikes would be implanted on the plant once again. Thus, completing another set for Koji's training for today.* - Sun Nov  1 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Indeed. - Sun Nov  1 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) strikes the tree again Koji was focusing the chakra to his hand in an attempt to get better. As the heat kissed his dak skin darker Koji would force his chakra to kiss the frail tree frailler.  Eventaully due to the beating the tree would collaspe on itself, but not at the moment. Koji would complere another sixty-four palm strike upon the plant without mercy. * - Sun Nov  1 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) running and punching through is also surveying the village. As he certain objects pass through his vision he either dodges or throws rapid strikes this is an attempt to increase attack speed and reflexes. He would waste no movement as he trained keeping up the daily guard duty. By the time he copleted fifty miles he'd make back to the square, and would would have completed two-hundred strikes. The boy would let a sigh but not one of fatigue just following the physics of the human body as he catches his breathe. Koji would steady be jogging in place as he made sure the barracks were at peace, and once he deemed it so he would continue his jog, and survey of the rest of the village. * - Sun Nov  1 02:51:56 2015

Koji was horsed with rage as the maniac ravaged through the people he swore to protect. Koji would say, "STOP!" He would waste no time as he was already in  the midst of his survey. Koji would take his stance as he faced the 10ft figure before him. This stance would be the Gentle Fist. It would only be tiny moment after Koji charged the man after taking his stance. 

The Hokuma saught to end him rather quickly, or at least deal severe damage. Koji's first atack would be sixty-four palms. He would target the users vitals with this satack, and if succesful he would suffer a giant drop effectiveness.* - Sun Nov  1 03:14:08 2015

These bags would be laced with the young man's chakra as they were built by him for such occasions. Koji being flung back by the unimanigable force of the man would note. He was fast, but his reflexes were clearly shit, and thus  those sixty-four strikes weren't aimed to do physical damage, but chakra network damage.

Really took a toll on the young ninja had to understand, or try to get a better understanding of life. Events before Tribus had lead him to an answer, but the events during and after put many questions in the young philosophers head. Thus, he continued on seeking, but at this moment all that whispered in the back caves of his mind was his father's words, "JAAAAAILBAIT". However, Koji would make his way to the arena for the advancement of his training, but upon entering he noticed many things! 

Yan his old friend was there watching what seemed to be a spar between Marissa and a Demon man from the pit of Tekken. Koji had thought this was a myth, but here today with the presence of Aklys he knew onw that this was no longer a myth. He now knew the power of Asura could be his. However, this digresses from the story. Koji would regain his stregnth from training earlier in the day, and hopefully gain it back quick enough to lend a hand if things were dicey. Koji's training consisted of throwing out explosive thrusts forward. The range would be from 200 at the least. * - Tue Nov  3 22:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) witnessing the man's bulging finger extend to his direction would walk forward. While moving the shinobi would scan the man with his Byakugan. This was to check, and see the interactions between hiim and his gauntets. Not seeming to be a mad man at this point and time Koji would offer his name to the man as a true warrior. As he spoke the name, or didn't speak the name Koji would still embrace his stance, and his Gate ability this was Koji taking no chances against the enemy.

If it was allowed after the cermonies of trained warriors the thirteen year old boy would take his six-foot stature , and oppose the man who stood over him. Upon receiving the necessary information about the chakra Koji would act accordingly. Not yet receiving information on the gauntlets, and their  chakra attributes. It's assumed they're channeling chakra from the user at the time being.However, it could be they channel opposers (We don't know as of yet.) Koji would seek to disrupt the (if possible). Koji would go in with gentle fist strikes to the left arm and torso. He would finish the flow of attacks with a hard knocking leaf whirlwind hopefully.  * - Tue Nov  3 23:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) noticing the man delibrately taking the hit of the first kick would attempt an air palm to the head. Being that damage was taken there had to be a delay in proceeding actions after, and with a direct strike to the opponets head with an air palm. Disorientaion is assured as this strike would attack the tenketsu points within the brain. During this time of disorientation Koji would seek to take advatage of the man by once again lashing out another set of gentle fist strikes toward the man's torso, and right arm. 

If having to accept the Shockwave Smash Koji would seek to regain his stature rather quickly than the average shinobi thanks to the ability of the Gate of Healing. Koji would then proceed to unleash a savage poinding of sixty-four palms to the male's torso area. Koji would attempt to riddle him like an assualt from the great warrior of his clan Asura. * - Wed Nov  4 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: Why're we here? - Wed Nov  4 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) being focused would would see the wave come toward him, and would use watergun on the part of the wave that was heading toward him. This wouldn't dismiss the entire wave, but the part that was heading straight for him. This would turn that part into mud hopefully! As Koji wasn't skilled enough to take out the whole wave itself!

After done this Koji would say, "You seem to have more surprises than me!" * - Wed Nov  4 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) using his Byakugan to scan Aklys woud see that the power in his shockwave wouldn't be a masive output as with Marissa, and being half-assed in nature Koji wanted to make sure to keep it that way. Koji would move back from the inital punch, but take the weak shockwave. If plausible Koji would power forward, and give the man what he saught a good fight. This would be the sixty-four palms technique. If accomplished this would cut the output of the man's ninjutsus and gauntlests output by a good chunk! 

During the disorientation acquired after this impact Koji would try to bum rush the guy, and unleash another set of sixty-four. Given the speed of the attack it would be unlikely he would be able to dodge such a barrage at this point.* - Wed Nov  4 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would suffer a 4 normal hit this would reduce the effectiveness of his attack massively, and one masive hit to the jaw would disorientate his fow of punches. Making him miss, but landing three crucial hits to the man. This would slow him down signifigantly being criticals areas (Lungs, Kidney, and Heart). This would be a sequence of trading blow for blow between theindividuals, but as soon as the man countered Koji he would again follow up with another, but this would more than likely be his last assualt as his chakra reseve was running low. The long batte would be draining the shinobi, but only one with such said eyes could see such a thing! 

Upon the completion of this next move Koji would seem to be drained as if it were his last attack. However, the ninja was prepared to defend his life to the bitter end if it called for it.* - Wed Nov  4 01:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing the man cock back the arm would immediately rotate! This would more than likely re-direct his shockwave to the side wall due to the blunt force of the chakra. If this was completed correctly Koji expected that the man's Gauntlet would be once again drained, but he would also expect this dude to receive a fracture or be slammed into the ground due to the unexpected change of directiong of force. If not Koji be sad in the heart he aint face plant the arena sand.* - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) rotation clashes with the shockwave of the omega gray dude, and it would look to pit a challenge versus the high-powered chakra, but would eventually fail rather quickly. However, the clash would save Koji from a direct hit from the wave. Aklys' wave would pierce through with force enough to send him fying ground level through the sand he'd land inbetween the two Skoku and Trilliam. He'd lay there there a bit fammished from the duel between the two.* - Wed Nov  4 02:18:14 2015

Plus he took some unknown pills Lord Knows what that will do. Koji would request being sent to Bryson after the battle, and say, "This isn't a spar if he wanted he could've killed me, but at the moment he seems to be looking for a thrill at the moment. He's no ally or friend. Hard to say that he's even human."
