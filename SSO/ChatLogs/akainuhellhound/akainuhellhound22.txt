<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doing Desert Owl surveillance would be brought toward the location of shinobi of Sunagakure. * - Wed Oct 28 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would note from the distance that the ninja were quite capable of handling things on their own, so he vanished just as quickly as he came. Fairy dust poof** - Wed Oct 28 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Activating his byakugan would notice a strange being off in the distance of Sunagakure emitting an immense amount of chakra. He would leave his position to go check it out, and he would find that it was a human shaped plant. However, this wasn't an ordinary plant this plant had every tenketsu point of a human located in the exact location as a human. Koji taking advantage of this would strike the plant with his clan's ultimate jutsu the sixty-four palm. This would close sixty four tenketsu points coming into contact with his strike, but just as Koji had shut off the points of the plant. The points would instantly turn themselves back on without a moments delay. 

	This was a delight to Koji's surprise he had found something capable of withstanding his technique, and he would take advantage of this situation. Preparing himself once more Koji would strike at the human shaped plant sixty-four times without hesitation, and prepare to wreak havoc upon the plant. In a single instant the sixty four points out of the three-hundred and sixty one points would be cut off, but just as quickly they would be turned back on! It was a miraculous sight to behold to the eyes of Koji as he focus his sight on the plant with his Byakugan. 

	As the chakra flowed through the plant Koji would see it as it ignited the points of its body he would seek to strike every point. This was to try and stop the plan from revitalizing itself, because as Koji focused his eyes it seemed that the plant was literally pumping itself back to life with its own chakra! Understanding this Koji struck with Sixty Four Palms once more, but he wouldn't leave his spot as he delivered the final blow to the plant. Instead he would ready himself to strike again. This was an attempt to beat out the revitalization of the plant. 

	Only seconds would pass after the final blow was struck, and Koji would begin to unleash another savage palm strike on the plant without fail. As his body moved with each strike there would be no motion wasted. Sixty four strikes would fly by in an instant, but as soon as Koji laid his eyes on the plant it was already replenished and healed. It took no time for it to rejuvenate itself. Koji remarks with a grin, "This will be tough I see, but I will not falter. I will not be defeated by a mere plant." Koji punched his two fist together as he sets himself to begin once more. 

	Koji's hair would be tied behind his back this was to keep them from hindering his sight, and stance would be low in order to keep his balance, and eyes focused and at this point laced with chakra this was to make sure he sees the flow of chakra. Koji would waste no strike as he exploded forward in an attempt to strike the plant. He would shout in seconds, "Four palm, five palm, ten palm, 20 palm, and 64 palm." At this rate sweat would drip from his face, and he would greatly winded, but this isn't to be confused with his resolve! Koji's heart burned with a passion to destroy this obstruction in front of him at the moment.

	Stance set and ready Koji would strike again as he moved he would pinpoint his strike precise and quick. This would be effortless due to the many times he's struck this being, and it would be near reflex at this point Koji would waste no time. He was becoming more and more proficient with each hit he landed. He was going like he had something to prove, but there was nothing to prove at this point. So, it was rather odd watching him perform so enduringly! He had a drive but those outside of his mind couldn't begin to understand it. Koji shouts as he strikes, "Gaaaaaaargh"! 

	His day would need to come to an end as he needed rest, so Koji went to nourish himself with vegetable ramen, and dessert with a side of milk! After gulfing these down in high quantities Koji would send himself to bed, so that his muscles may begin to rest and recover. After a nap Koji would feel revitalized and would take himself back to the position in which he was training. Wasting no time Koji would throw on his green glove, and head out to the plant in which he sought to defeat. As he stared it down Koji channeled his chakra and unleashed the bellowing power of Asura upon the plant. It would sixty- four strikes on sixty-four tenketsu points. This would be in a matter of seconds, but this would not be the final assault.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would notice Ai from behind, but his focus would be on mastering his new move. As it was imperative that he be at his best should trouble arise. This was also to ensure he is an example to the shinobi of the village, but the reasons wouldn't end there either Koji was head of Desert Owl! If he was going to maintain peace of Sunagakure he needed to strong! As the in the recent days all kinds of madness had revealed itself within the city he swore to protect. With all this in mind Koji channeled the chakra within his eyes once more, and in those moments the chakra points of the unknown plant had been revealed! Koji would strike this plant another sixty-four tenketsu points in a matter of seconds. The plant would in its own mysterious fashion pump open its flow of chakra! Irratating the ninja Koji at this point!* - Wed Oct 28 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wouldn't stop his assualt for any reason as the plant held its ground Koji held his fury and passion. Though he was interested in the plant's biology he knew other things were priorities at this point in his life, so he struck the plan continously. In an effort to move faster and faster, but not just that! Koji was aiming to be precise as well! Koji would be grunting at the strain he endure while saying out loud, "One palm, two palm, three palm, four palm, five palm, six palm, seven palm, eight palm.... Thirty- two palm.... Sixty-Four palm!." Upon moving to the next assualt he would the chakra flow shut down, but open up instantly. As he began another assualt he says, "What's up with this thing?"* - Wed Oct 28 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Tch*, tch*, tch*! This is the sound being made as the gentle fist technique made contact with the unique plant. Koji was striking viscously as he perfected his moves. As the sweat gleamed from his face, and dirt being kicked into the air by his rapid movement. Anyone could see the residue of his efforts at the moment. The intensity was not only in his eyes, but his aura as well. Koji had released another sixty-four strikes in order to close the chakra points of the uniques plant. After this sequence Koji would wipe the sweat from his face, and say to the approaching ninja, "Hello there, I'm doing well and yourslef?"* - Wed Oct 28 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would continue to strike the unique plant that resembled a human, but he would keep conversation going with the ninja Kuro. As he palmed the plant into submission or at least attempt to Koji would say, "....., Besides my precautions for my eyes what other interests do you have, my friend?" Koji would have said this after completing another sixty-four strikes upon the near indestructible plant. Koji was always on guard and training this is why he was hand-picked by Hassan to be his left-hand.* - Wed Oct 28 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing, I just found it interesting to see another person with those eyes. - Wed Oct 28 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) lets out a sigh*, "Please don't take my serious tone and stance as a guard. I'm n the middle of training, and this plant has irratated me. As you can tell with your eyes it mimics a human in every way! Even down to the three-hundred and sixty one tenketsu points!" Koji wouldn't act shocked or anything, but he was happy to find another user as he had clansmen who shared the same attribute within the village. As he was there Clan Leader. As Kuro showed his eyes he would say with a joyous smile, "Ahh, nice to see another you can see the world and all its beauty truly then!" This wouldn't deter Koji from hs training however he was determined on mastering his new moves out of anger of the plant he would strike it with an Air Palm, and proceed to strike another sixty-four palm technique on the plant.* - Wed Oct 28 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) "Mental images are good, but this plant is unique in nature if you haven't noticed. It iterally mimics the human body exact! Even the tenketsu points. If you focus on it you can see the it... But, the two moves derives from our dou-jutsu. The infamous sixty-four palm, and Air Palm." Koji would strike the plant again in the same manner as he spoke to showcase, and to perfect as well. No movement would be wasted by ninja. As he completed this he'd say, "Also my name is Koji Hokuma, clan leader of the Hokumas, Leader of Desert Owl, and Left Hand man of Hassan. A monk that's a nice way to live are you seeking enlightenment?"* - Wed Oct 28 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing Juro's question would again strike the plant in sucession this would total again to be another sixty-four times. After this Koji would sit on the ground, and unravel a mid-training snack for a moment. When he was finished and replinished in stregnth he would say, "The Sixty-four palm works just as the gentle fist technique. Assuming you're familar with that it's developed to be a quick turn off switch to an opposer. No body can prepare for such a technique as it doesn't target to maim, but destroy the chakra point. It does this by attacking rapidly non-stop before the opposer can do anything about it, and the Air Palm is a long-distance manevuer where our chakra is channeled and thrown toward an opposer. This chakra isa powerful force that also destroys the points. Well destroy is a powerful word.. Let us say cut off circulation." After this Koji would stand, and say, "You said you're seeking unity.. Well I am too so if you ever need a home the Hokuma clan will keep its arms open for you. It's to ensure our safety."* - Wed Oct 28 04:39:28 2015

As his feet spread and torso lowered mid-way from his average stance Koji would begin to channe his chakra. The channeling of chakra would not only flow to his palms, but his eyes as well activating his Dou-jutsu the Byakugan. Koji would see all the points of Kilm, thus approaching to attack these point. Koji would seek to hit both shoulders. This would be within the gentle fist stance Koji would seek to be quick in his actions. If he succeded he would follow up with a Leaf Whirlwind!* - Wed Oct 28 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I really need to learn more jutsu . . . I have so many scrolls but I need more. - Wed Oct 28 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have followed, but seeing the man take flight he would look up and think of a way to get him down. Koji would throw a kunai, but his aim ain't good so it would more than likely miss. So, he kept his guard on it was clear Kilm had something up his sleeve, but Koji wanted to see if he could hit the ninja's clone. He unleashes an Air Palm, but it was more of causing a thought of caution that Koji is able to do distant attacks.* - Wed Oct 28 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Had he not been focusing on Kilm might have been toast, but noticing the build up chakra, and Kilm having yelled out his attack... The ninja was more than capable of dodgeing the massive fire ball by jumping to the right. Koji would attempt to close the distance ground level, and submit to another round by Kilm. Koji being strictly close-range would have to find a way to get close, but being fifty feet in the air made that seem impossible. But Koji was optimistic so he pressed forward some more. Kepping his defense of three-hundred and sixty degree vision handy. Koji throws another kunai in an attempt to hit the clone once more, but he knew this was futile :p, but Koji hated wasting opportunities.* - Wed Oct 28 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have noticed the chakra of such genjutsu with his Byakugan, and would have naturally prepared himself for the jutsu. As soon as Koji would feel the effects of the said genjutsu he would Open the First Gate. This is the tenketsu point that is in the braiin upon opening that point the spell of the genjutsu that captured Koji would be broken. What would follow would be his ultimate move at the moment sixty-four palm. He would execute this in such a way that doesn't kill the dude as this is a spar. And, Koji was only looking to master the technique if it's too lethal the user would like to just do a leaf whirlwind.* - Wed Oct 28 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) woud see the spikes as they erupted from the four different directions Koji would jump backwards avoiding each of the skewer attempt. Koji would line himself up ready to defend himself and strut forward to pursue if need be.* - Wed Oct 28 19:15:50 2015
