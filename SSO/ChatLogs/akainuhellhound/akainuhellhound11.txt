<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Then. - Sun Oct  4 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Let us begin. - Sun Oct  4 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Let's see what my opponent is capable of. - Sun Oct  4 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing his opponet takes his stance he would do the same at this same moment he would scope Masayoshhi with his Byakugan. Also Koji wasn't about wasting time activating his Gate of Opening he would go in for an attack. Applying his Gentle Fist art. 

Now charging in Koji would go focus on the tenketsu of the shinobi of his limbs. Mainly his right arm. This would consist of two strikes upper bicep, and lower forearm. This would begin a series of chakra circulaton cut-off. * - Sun Oct  4 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) not being able to react to such lightning speed even with his dou-jutsu would be rendered helpless to his aattack, but he is a noble worry and would not give in so easily. Now threatened of the shinobi's speed of attack  the ninja Koji would activate his clan's special jutsu Heavenly Rotation!

This move would unleash a surge of chakra repeling and sending back any follow up attacks, or those in the vicinity while taking damage from the rapid circulating chakra and force of being thrown back. This would give space for Koji to change hhis game plan. Now, understanding he is outclassed in skill he would need to be smart. * - Sun Oct  4 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) veins pulsating with immense chalkra would perseive all of Chiharu's movements, so Koji prepare as to defend him self within his gentle fist stance. Now, also within his field of vision were the three shurikens. Koji could immediately tell that the ninja was skillfull in this technique, so he wouldn't take it  lightly (Well to be quite honest Koji would take it at all!). 

With his dou-jutsu Koji would throw his giant shuriken to strike what seemed like wire links atached to the shuriken(s). Not being expert marksmen in skill the giant shuriken would make up for any problem in aiming with its size as it sliced through what appeared as wires to the eyes of Koji. 

Taking advantage of his vision and time Koji would prepare again his Heavenly Rotation should the ninja Masayoshi make a move towards him. With that dangerous swordsmanshp. 

This battle would have to end quickly as Koji's blood seeped out his arm profusely. Consciousness would soon became to sway after these events. The lower his chakra the more effective the strike to his arm becomes. The Hyuga now waits in defense. While slipping out a kunai flag with an explosive tag.* - Sun Oct  4 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: He should give up while he's still conscious.. - Sun Oct  4 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: I'm glad  to have joined this exam. I know see how much further I need to go. - Sun Oct  4 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Rotation technique could expand, and this was due to the gate's effect the sheer wind, and chakra force would blow away the desired smokescreen in an instant. But, Koji would have reached half his chakra pool, and with the blood leacking profusely he would have no choice but to consent. 

As he wasn't ready lose his life just yet. As he finished the rotation he would take a knee, and say, "I give. I know when I've been bested." 

Of  course, if the ninja didn't intend to keep his word the Noble Ninja Koji would counter as he saw the intent to kill in his actions and counter with another Rotaion. This pissed Koji to no end as he was left to defend this entire match. This built much passion in his heart to do better, but pain as well as he is now left to the mercy of his opponet. 

Koji's pearl lavendar eyes would peer down the eyes of Masayoshi as he gave his reponse...* - Sun Oct  4 03:32:54 2015

Today he would observe the vllage's status, and if all seemed welll he would continue his training. 

This was preparation for the dangerous mission up ahead, so Koji began esapnded on his Gentle Fist technique. He had only been using the tenketsu within his hands to expel chakra. But, as he trained and advanced his moves he noted that this is only the larvae stage. 

With this concept he would expel chakra from every point in his body, and bgin rotating in the exact motion! Whooz! would be the made as the chakra began to zip around him like a dome. Studying this process he would understand what he needede to do. 

With new understanding and keeping his stance the boy would begin to expel surges of chakra out his body. Allowing him to master his rotation at a more rapid rate, and at the same time increase the effectiveness of his Gentle Fist. 

As the procedure continued Koji woud say, "It's like my vision has literally increased! As the chakra expels I am able sense more and more. Truly the gentle fist formidable."He would now make the task of keeping a constant rate chakra unsheaved from his body at all times. This would help him react much better and have his wits about him at all times. It was his personal house alarm!* - Sun Oct  4 18:02:27 2015

Over hearing Lord Hassan's words of the gliders he would think to himself (That's badass!). At that same moment apart of the stones being carried up for placement on the near finished colleseum would come tummling down! 

As the stones fell they fell through Koji's poured out chakra network of the Gentle Fist art he would sense them. Thus warning citizens to move as he could n't hit all of them physcially. This would prompt him to unleash his move The Heavenly Rotation. 

After securing the areas the shinobi would take the stones that fell, and the ones he brought up on the colleseum's top to help finish production.* - Sun Oct  4 18:28:54 2015

After this he would address Mirai. 

Koji would say, "I'm always ready to train you, but there will be a slight chang. We will add your attitude to the list of things to work on. We are a clan of nobility we should be seen as respectful. But, if you are ready we can be on our way."  * - Mon Oct  5 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would walk off due to the woman's unwillingness to show proper respect. He couldn't quite understand the woman's deal, but wouldn't drag out childish behavior. He would go about his training as usual hoping the young shinobi will reflect on her ways. 

Koji has aspirations to spread a sense righteousness to the world not vanity. And this would be through the efforts of restoring his clan. With the events of today he must meditate on his actions. As Mirai was the only one of his people he had encountered in his life. 

Before he walks off into the distance he would show his distaste of the stuborness by rotating harshly. * - Mon Oct  5 03:55:31 2015

 "I will train her but her attitude towards the people of Suna needs to change. We are not outsiders to each other here. We are all Sunagakure. It may be hard to understand to her, but we are one in this village. When she comes to terms with that fact.. Sigh* Let her know I'll be waiting."
