<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: If they were stronger than us they would of attacked us outright and crushed us from the start. They'd have no reason to wait.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Do you not think that maybe they have a plan for once we go after them? Do you not think that they just wouldn't think we might come after them. For all we know, their whole side is littered with traps to spring. Or prepared jutsus that will wipe out most of our men.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: In war there are no ranking differences. It's a matter of what you can do and how well you can do it. I had a Genin on the front lines with me that took out half the amount of troops I took out. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lets not even go beyond the fact, they might have a second force in hiding. Waiting to hit the village while we go after them, or flank us in any direction they wish. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Stop thinking of yourself as a mere Genin and think of yourself as a shinobi of the Allied Force. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) beginning to meditate attempts to focus his chakra into the single point of his feet. Already able to channel chakra through his veins to his eyes. Koji now applies the same concept. Now as Koji studies his master upon the water with his Byakugan he begans to mimic his chakra flow. 
Koji would shout, "Almost got it, and notes though i may be able to mimic it doesn't make it easier. It's just a blueprint." He takes his first step out onto the water.* - Mon Sep 14 22:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Focusing on his master he begans to mimic his master's chakra to a "T". Looking up and down reaizing the previous try he did not channel enough stregnth. Koji started to imagine his chakra as stilts on the bottom of his boots, but he had to make sure that the stilts were stable, and so he intensifies his glare upon his master's chakra points. Koji will achieve this through chakra control, and through the blue print his master has given him which is his body. Koji would speak, "Too high, Too low, Too narrow, and Too wide! Remember as stilts they need to be firm!" Koji beginning to focus starts to twirl his kis kunai uncontrolably, becasue this is a habt he gets into when he's focusing to the nth degree. Koji now shouts, I've got, I've got... I've got it for sure! Koji would now step out in success. He woud be surely confused if he didn't, and would need further instructions.* - Mon Sep 14 22:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) not taking chances with dodging. As he knew his speed was not that great compared to the speed of the shuriken. His move would need to be precise, and clever. Koji in his clan's stance the gentle fist equips his giant shuriken to not only  shield his body, but deflect the shurikens into the force of the wind pasing through Violet. Embedding them into the tree behind afterward. He would then attempt to move closer to prepare a strike. Koji speaks, "It's a pain in the butt. Dealing with wind users when trying to get close!"* - Tue Sep 15 02:42:46 2015

He would then toss it at the shurikens above. causing an explosion that would disperse them.* - Tue Sep 15 03:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would set himself on top of the water to begin his rigorous eight tri-gram palm rotation training. Surging the chakra into his eyes he would moments later equip an explosive tagged kunai. To detonate within the water below. Koji would say, "It begins." while taking his gentle fist stance. Boom, swoosh, and ploof were the sounds made as the rushed into the air! Out came the fish at most 10, and Koji will now strike! He throws the first fist back goes the first fish, Koji throws a second, and back goes another fish. Now, Koji thinks (I must pivot to keep the rotation going.) at this moment he is reminded of the spar he had with Hassan. As he was only able to knock away one shuriken, and be sliced by two others. Losing concentration the balance is lost and he falls into the water. "Damn it!" Koji would shout as he realizes his loss of focus. The other 8 fish dead just lay afloat around him. With the training continuing Koji climbs back on top of the water regaining his balance, but now this time his focus! 
Dropping his second tagged kunai he would be again attempt the perfection of this technique! Up goes the fish "Byakugan!" Koji shouts! Up comes another 10 fish! Surging his chakra he now attacks two fish in front of him, and pivots right. The fish are now falling he will continue the pivot to the right allow the chakra to begin circulating, but he pauses at 60 degrees not able to keep it going. Now feeling strain upon his hamstring, thigh, and calves it would be hard for him to continue. Not to mention the speed at which he was punching was starting to strain his biceps, and pectorals. This was not enough to stop him, not enough to end him. He will gain this.

He stretches out his limbs to become limber once more. Takes a deep breathe, and exhales as he performs this action Koji feels the aches through his chest and abdomen. Taking his stance once more he drops another tagged kunai Up goes the water, but there are more fish that come up this time! Koji speaks, "There are 20 this time, quite strange being above the waterfall." He would then punch 5 fish out as they rose up into the air! And channel his chakra as they hit their max altitude and catch them with his chakra. Now twirling he makes 120 degrees! Thrashing out 7 on to dry land. Koji would comment, "Only 120 degrees not a full rotation! Garrrh!" * - Wed Sep 16 00:18:59 2015

This jog will help him understand how to feel for the circulating chakra that flows through him. As he jogs around the wooded area in a circular fashion Koji imagines his 8 tri gram rotation technique would work in the same fashion. Upon completion he would make his way back to the lake side. Where he would replenish his thirst, and energy with a bottle of water and honey-bun. All while twirling his kunai. He takes a look at the honey-bun, and realizes it's circular.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Grateful to be given a mission by his Kage he would head out immediately! Wanting to make sure the flowers made it to their destination in pristine condition. On the way out from the square he would run as fast as He could as he would consider this a time trial. On the way to the home of a villager he would face a villainous cat attempting to destroy the flowers! Having his sight already activated he would dodge the cat, and punt it over a fence. Koji would say "What a strange cat. It's lucky I had no intention to kill." Koji now continuing towards his destination. * - Thu Sep 17 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) After running 10 miles in 3 minutes he would knock on the door abruptly, but not in a fashion that would startle the villager to where they would ignore the door. A woman came to the door as the letter described, and took the flowers from Koji. Koji said, "Wait! Madame there is a song addressed to you as well!" The woman would question, "Oh really?" * - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Would begin to sing, "Most of me didn't father, most of me didn't mother, most of me didn't love my sister, most of me didn't love my brother! You are the only thing, my everything, and to you this song I siiiing---." Koji being cut by the villainous cat attempting to swipe the flowers from the woman! He rotates to gentle fist the beast in the back paralyzing it for hours on end. The lady overjoyed thanks Koji, and allows him to be on his way.* - Thu Sep 17 01:42:11 2015
