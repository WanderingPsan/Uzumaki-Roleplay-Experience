<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) harbored a kind of hate for Konoha as their late Kage ordered the death of his best friend, but he wouldn't be misguided in his judgement toward Nozumi. As he was raised better than that, and seeing the hurt in the shinobi eyes he would ask, "What is your name?" 

Looking into the Shinobi's situation as he knew their sitaution he would say, "We ourselves are rebuilding and though we look to be prospering at the moment. We are still a bit unstable in our system. And, we have had trouble with assasins. I myself have dealt with plenty of them. They are after our Kage's head I hope you can understand our system a little better. If you could tell me what you need I can help. And if you seek refuge I may also be able to help."

Koji wouldn't risk the life of his Lord, and this could be seen in his eyes. His solid pale lavender eyes would tell the tale. He is devoted to his land and village. First and Foremost.* - Sun Oct 11 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would take the check with much gratitude, and seeig the look of his Kage he was ashamed of that truth.  Prompting him to say, "Do you have any missions for me at this moment?" With that question he would raise from his knees, and await Reguel's response. * - Mon Oct 12 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Do you accept? - Mon Oct 12 05:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: But it's your choice. - Mon Oct 12 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) takes Reguel's pointing as being ready to battle, but as many know Koji don't give shits about ranks only resolve. Taking his stance and activating his Byakugan Koji would see what the ninja Reguel held with his xray vision. He would prepare himself. Focusing his chakra he would open the first gate, and charge the ninja. He expected Tetsu to control the battle rather well, so he saw no harm in starting right away. 

Upon making it close Koji would strike with great speed aiming for the kidney should it land the ninja would piss them selves on the spot,and if able to be interupted Koji would make a strike toward the his arm. Disrupting the chakra flow by stopping the flow in the left arm.* - Mon Oct 12 06:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) sensing the incomng tanto would just attack the swinging arm closing another set of chakra points, and this wouldn't be gentle due to the opening of the Gate  of Opening. After this Koji would unleash rotation throwing Reguel into the clone to the left. He would follow up accordingly preparing another assault. 

With a successful strike on the tenketsu on the kidney, and arm chakra control would be disrupted. Any chakra based attacks wouldn't be as powerful, and with the gates bruises would be left in these spots. "Swollen bumps if you will" Koji dubbed it the Harden Gentle Fist Art.* - Mon Oct 12 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Maybe they'll let me spar.. - Mon Oct 12 06:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: It's barely been two minutes and I've already resorted to using my last healing pill. - Mon Oct 12 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) charges as the sand is consuming Reguel with one last attack, but he pauses inches from his neck, and speaks, "Death comes that quick outside these gates, and even within at times. It's not because of our rank that we were able to beat you quickly, but our trust in each other. As ninjas of Suna we have to have each others back no matter our creed, blood, color, and "all that jazz". Here we are one and we fight as one not as genin, chuunin, jounin... But, as Suna." 

Koji would release his deathly glare that he held the entire spar. Those eyes having large surges of Chakra pumped into them. With zero expression of even seeing Reguel alone, but in fact the entire area. It was as if he peered right through he body cause in fact he could. Koji would show his rank at the end.* - Mon Oct 12 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: He's modest.. I just thought Reguel would've attempted to spit them in my face. - Mon Oct 12 07:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Major or not, i'd like a mission.. Somethin' to do. Not like I do anything around this time but train.. - Mon Oct 12 07:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would accept Fuji's favor, and say, "Don't worry master I'l bring you your gems." with a slight smile. He appreciated the fuuin suport as well. Not being too muc hof a specialist of such arts.* - Mon Oct 12 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Up north , within the mountain you'll see a blocked entrance... - Mon Oct 12 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) heads out.* - Mon Oct 12 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had made it to the underground cave that Fuji directed him to with the two fuuin specialists. Before entering Koji would activate his Byakugan to scout the area for traps. Using x-ray vision he woud see pass the boulder blocking the passageway, and he would see numerous of traps set in places within the cave. After this he would say, "There are a lot of traps within this cave, so be careful. Even this boulder has been rigged it'll be best to detonate it from a distance, so you two stand behind me."  As the two fuuin specialist moved behind Koji. He would begin to focus the chakra within his eyes, and see what trap was stringed to the boulder with x-ray vision. He would notice strings latched in the midst of the cave, but also to the boulder. Throwing an explosive laced kunai toward the boulder. Koji would have his guard up as the kunai flew through the air. 

Kink* Boom!* The sound as the kunai stuck into the boulder, and instantly exploding on contact. Through the smoke spikes would come flinging out at rapid speeds, but Koji was ready for something of this nature which is why he instructed the Fuuin specialist to stand behind him. As chakra built at an instaneous rate the the chakra would explode at the same instaneous rate, and the body would be carried with it. Causing a three-hundred sixty degree spin tagged with a cutting and throwback shielding force of chakra. The spikes making contact with this jutsu would be flung into the sand in front of the three bodies in various places. The threat had been averted this time, but Koji knew there might be suprises he wouldn't be prepared for within the cave. So, he kept his wit about him. 

Koji and the other two individuals would begin making their way within this cave, and Koji made a few objectives in his mind aside from Fuji's. They were not only to collect diamonds, but get everyone in and out alive. So far, it was a success, and Koji intended to keep it that way. Passing through the cave even deeper Koji eyes were viewing every inch of the cave. Sensing out the chakra coated traps such as seal or other variances. It would take much more cleverness than that to get the upper hand on Koji. With the paths essentially lit by the eyes of Koji the dark was no longer dark to the three man squad of Ravenscrotum. 

Now trekking even farther within the cave Ravenscrotum would come to a wall with a seal on it. The Fuuin specialist would translate it as Koji described it within the dark, and he would read, "Relesase me and I sink. Plug me and I rise ." Koji would ask, "What should we do?" One of the specialist says, "Look for a switch, or mishapen rock surely there's something to move the wall." Koji activating his Byakugan once more would seek out a way to solve the seal. With the veins pulsating to his eyes and pupils revealing a lavendish color. You could see the focus within his eyes as if he was peering through all things around him. * - Tue Oct 13 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeking for a tool would also search in his mind replaying the verse he read in his head. If it weren't pitch black the other Fuuin specialists would say, "My what focus and strain he's in trying to solve this conudrum. His eyes as they twirled around the room as if he were an investigator of a crime would finally pause. Pause as if time itself has stopped, and nt saying a word for a period that would make the darkness eerie, but this would soon be broken by a tiny sound. Causing Koji to say, "Do you hear that? There it is again." He staring in the spot  as well at this moment. It would be the sound of water dripping from above. With this found Koji would now formulate a plan to progress forward.
