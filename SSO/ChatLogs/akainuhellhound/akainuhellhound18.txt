<br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wouldn't be able to make contact due to Izanami propelling away like a jet, but he wouldn't halt his progression. Seeing the ball come for him he would rotate the massive heap of fire. Thus, dispersing it into the air! After this Koji would make his way to Iza once more. He would prepare once more to palm her in the Gentle Fist art. * - Thu Oct 22 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing the chakra gather in Izanami would expect a burst of flame to explode just like before, but this was not the case as his hand was stopped as if it were caught by wind, and his body would be thrown back. Not knowing the force of the wind the author assumes it was enough to movoe him back a few squares. Koji would regain his footing, and say, "Im getting tired of this getting blown back sequence." 

Koji would begin to channel his for an awesome attack as he began to make his way back toward Izanami. He would come in with a leaf whirlwind. * - Thu Oct 22 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) understanding he we would take burn damage from Iza's attack would be clever. Her skill of technique actually mastered over his own he would suffer a big hit after their first kicks collided, but Koji would keep it going. Using the motion he would perform a mid-air rotaiton. This would throw her in the dirt if she  couldn't control herself in mid-air being in the midst of an attack, however, this seemed unlikely. 

Koji would admire Iza's admiration, but he would say, "Do what you're good at. Although your tai-jutsu is great!" He would say this whereever talking was permitted between the two. * - Thu Oct 22 03:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) was picking his nose, and was just checking out the plaza like he normally does . He would see an awesome dynamic entry coming from the distance, so awesome it was more fluent than his own! But, not anything he was threaten by he simple moved out the way and flicked the booger he picking onto Reguels shirt. He wouldn't notice this unless he had some amazing eyes, but who knows  Reguel might be one to notice the flick of the figure from Koji. 

During the flicking process Koji would activate his Byakugan and take his Gentle Fist stance, and say, "Well, follow up the attack now. You perfected that even quicker than myself haha. A true genius!" Koji was focuses at this point. He hasn't had a recent Tai-jutsu battle since the Land Before Time!* - Fri Oct 23 00:26:27 2015

Koji would just fall to the ground, thus the needles would just fly over to somewhere off in the distance. However, if they are stringed, wired, or chakra attached Koji's eye would detect such a thing and just rotate react appriately. As Koji moved to the ground he would bear crawl toward Reguel. This is to keep all momentum from when dropped to move forward without hesitation, and as he moved he would make his way to Reguel. Once there he would rotate, because Koji loved to rotate. 

Should the hit land Koji will pursue with the wrath of Asura... (Guy with a lot of hands.) As Koji wasn't one to go light on anyone in a challenge.* - Fri Oct 23 00:50:20 2015

Koji in the midst of his charge would like to test the skills of the medical ninja Reguel at hand to hand combat, but it would come at a cost for Reguel. Now in the midst of his charge if Reguel wished to shoot senbons Koji would knock them away from their medium point with his Gentle Fist art. As his hands would would have chakra emitting from them to do. This was Koji also demonstrating his reflex. 

Now in the face Reguel Koji would unleash the Wrath of Asura. This would be sixty-four palms to the limbs. As Koji didn't want to kill the guy being a spar, and had no lethal intent. Matter of fact, the impact would cause his limbs to be momentarily limp upon succesion making him fall to the ground, but he would be ableto keep going if he chose to. Although his chakra would be cut signifigantly! * - Fri Oct 23 01:17:39 2015

Politely staring at the individuals Koji embraces the moment, and says, "I hope the days been good for you all. This is the first time we've all gotten together like this, so lets make the most of it. How would you like to start the training?" Koji asked cause he knew this would be difficult for all of them as he will be working on mastering his new technique, and he needed to know their resolve. Once this was done he would pass it down to them unless they happened to pick it in the time between today and tomorrow. 

Koji would take his in the trademark Hyuuga art, Gentle Fist and summon the chakra into his eyes. This was his signal to know that he was ready. Although if they had any concerns, or question he would be redy to answer them, as well. * - Fri Oct 23 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) was a bit sad to see Mizora just spectate, but he know its been a long day for everyone, so he would edge her to join in. Stil in his stance Koji would answer Mirai's question, "Well, we don't have to spar we can work on improving our strikes this is how I unlocked the Eight -Trigram: Sixty-four palm jutsu. We'll head to an area where I like to go train when I'm working on my endurance and physique along with the gentle fist." Koji would be cut off by the appearance of Sanoke, and he would say, "Yes, we are actually working on clan secrets and technique. I would like Mirai and Mizora to be focused." * - Fri Oct 23 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) woud instruct them to follow him as they walked he would inform them on what wsa uphead. As they left the gates of Sungakure they would be lead into the vast desert, and Koji would point to the distance, and speaks, "There we will find the Giant Spinning Cactus. Now like I said on the way here this ins't a normal Cactus! The needles are spiked and takes concentration. You'll have to channel your chakra to break these needles. And as we we strike them they wil move faster and faster. Do not get hit by these, because you will be flung in the distance and this is a giant desert, and we are near the Valley of Death." 

Koji would look at them to see if they would accept this training excercise. He would demonstrate first hand if they needed him to. The objective is to break the needles off the cactus completely. To where it appears nakes and less threatening to the eyes.* - Fri Oct 23 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Alright, well just follow me! It'll be fun. I fell from the top one time! - Fri Oct 23 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Ran toward the Spinning Giant Cactus, but one should note that the cactus hadn't yet began to spin! So, that would be the serious question now, but not for long as Koji was about to get it rolling. Focusing his eyes on the cactus Koji would channe the chakra to his eye, and begin to channel chakra throughout his hands as well. This ability was granted to him the art Gentle Fist. Measuring the output with his senses Koji didn't just match it, but outmatched it! This was necessary if he sought to break the needles of the cactus. Throughout the training Koji would maintain this output. Mirai if she was clever enough would just match Koji's output. 

Now face to face with the Cactus' needle Koji would reach and pull himself up on to the needle, and he would then balance himself. After this, he would strike an arms length away needles as this process was completed the Cactus began to spin. As Koji began to feel the momentum he would shout, "Jump on! Mirai!" After destroying one needle Koji would strike as he jumped this was would be a rapid process. (Picture a rotating tread mill with stuff coming your way, and you have to stirke a ht or be knocked off.)* - Fri Oct 23 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) noticing Mirai keep up made him smile as few people were able to do. This gave him competition, and he was no longer bored in his activities. Having two people really lived up the scene for him. Her control was excpetional for a ninja in general not just for a Hyuuga. This prompted Koji to say, "You really are marvelous. You're really are looking to take my place! I can't wait for that challenge." As Koji spoke this he would be as elegant, but fierce in his attack. This, was due to the rigourous training he'd done in obtaining the Gates. 

As he struck the needles like a bee he would hop forward like a bunny without hesitation. As his eyes were focused, his strikes were just as precise.! Seeing Mirai perform just as well a grin would overwhelm his face as she faunted her skilled moves. But, with both of the striking this caused the Cactus to up its speed tremendously! Koji had never seen it increase so rapidly, but it made sense having two people here to break it's needles. This twirl would casue the sand blow to sink in a hole. It would at the same time stirl up gale winds causing  less friction between the jump and landing of the shinobis. 

Perservering on Koji would show Mirai he doesn't quit easily. As soon as Koji struck another with his palm another would replace it! As if it were the one in the same, so this prompted them to be quick in there attacks! No waste of breathe could be afforded at this point. With 360 degree vision Koji kept his eyes on Mirai, however, he didn't her to fall without his knowledge. So, he was preparing for any kind of situation. * - Fri Oct 23 05:26:49 2015

This was to further incriminate the one known as Susumu. Koji wasn't happy about killing anyone, but reports were building on the ninja for abusing his powers. This incident seemed to have stemmed from that as well, but this was a larger scale, and as head of Desert Owl Koji had the authority to punish those against the Law by Hassan's word. Having his Byakugan activated he would spot the two individuals he caught in a tussle earlier he would approach with a presence that was more concerned than threatening. As some find his eyes a bit threatening. 

As he got close he would say, "Hey there, you two don't mind answering a few questions, do you? I know it's a bit soon, but I would like to solve this issue quick." Koji is looking for a public execution, and though this would bring peace to Hassan for awhile. It would for the people of Sunagakure.* - Fri Oct 23 19:21:23 2015
