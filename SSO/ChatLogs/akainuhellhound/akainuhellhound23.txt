He would rise to the occasion Koji Literally scanned the area with his Byakugan and struck like a  match being lit.

He counted not to keep track, but to measure the hit accuracy and speed. If it wasn't satisfactory the ninja would recount. As he needed to be precise,and effective. To do this he needed to feel for the best hit and replicate it sixty-four times.* - Fri Oct 30 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) is still palming through the air without pause, but not without reason each thrust was more potent and precise than the next.

However, it would be a dramatic increase but one that is noticeable he would still need work on this of course, so he continued to attack the sand in the air. Koji mumbles and grumbles as he strains forward it would be insane that he even asted this long, but he wouldn't falter in his training. As he was progressining his body in many ways by doing such feets.* - Fri Oct 30 20:32:38 2015

Koji woud be pracicing a technique. He is attempting to become more proficient in its usage that is why he is out here. Koji would see the individual approach from a distance without turning, thus prepared ahead of time. Koji would be seen and heard counting as he struck to sixty-four.* - Fri Oct 30 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) after a bit of a pause would notice that the individual didn't say anything during his approach, so he would continue his training, but he would keep a watchful eye. As he was standing rather close. Koji wouldo once again tke his stance and strike the lifted sand particles. Koji would strike sixty-four times strike sixty-four particles that would fal back to the ground. As soon as they all made contact the wind would again blow. Prompting Koji to start once more in his practice. * - Fri Oct 30 20:43:44 2015

Koji's strikes would be precise and devastating, at least to the personified sand particles being flung about. As the ninja made contact he would confirm by counting, "1 Palm, 3 Palm, 6 Palm, 9, Palm, 18, 32, 64". Upon completion he would rest himself to regain strength before begining once more. He didn't want to die in training that would be counter-productive.* - Fri Oct 30 20:55:40 2015

Oddly enough the wind would pick up itself as well! It would seems as though nature itself was challenging Koji this very day, and the young boy woulnd't turn away so easily! Returning to his stance and original strength Koji would strike the now lifted sand once more. Sixty-four times his arms would thrust forward with incredible speed, and his focus and would the vigor of his actions without fail. Koji would say, "This will take time, and that's the hardest part."  With that he sets himself up to begin again. * - Fri Oct 30 21:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) as he struck another sixty-four times would cause strain in his arms as they riochet back and forth. Imagine the function of a train working so hard one could literally see a small portion of steam relase from his body. But, not a portion that would cause alarm this was just the reaction as he sougt to break through his limits as a human. Each sand represented a struggle in his life that he wished to overcome, and Koji would imagine ways in his head to overcome such. Be it alone or with friends he was tryng to find a way. To him that's what it meant to train. The mental was just as improtant to the physical.* - Fri Oct 30 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) perseveres through the struggle without thought of pain at this point. The only thoughts that flowed through were perfect this, hit this, follow like this, and dont fail to do this. Koji was making a list of his wrongs and perfecting his moves each step of the way he wanted to become good at what he did, and this is what it took hard work and critiquing. He would strike another sixty-four times at the flung up sand with these thoughts in mind as he did it. * - Fri Oct 30 21:28:57 2015

He woud stare down his clansmen, and smile as he noticed the strength they had ganed overtime. Koji would stand back to back against the wall this gave him no where to run. He wanted to see what Mirai had he wouldn't move from any attack made in this direction. Koji would prompt her to forward , and begin her strike on him. * - Sat Oct 31 07:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I want to see this battle. - Sat Oct 31 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would notice her progression rather quickly as he wasn't able to dodge her moves quite as easily in the past. It would make him even cheerfl in spirit as he no longer had to harbor a feeling of protector over his clan members. Her speed  would match his owns, and attacks would break his own. She was a new person in his eyes. As he traded blows with her he would say, "You sure are good even better than me haha. Your reactions even seem better than mine now!" 

Apparently this was a chuunin hinata v Neji exam battle. With each blow traded chakra points would be shut off, and chakra would be surged out from the palms, and both being Hyuugas these contacts would causes explosions of chakra to be released into the atmosphere minitature levels nothing Bijuu level. The taijutsu battle would rage in this spot, because Koji said that he wouldn't move from this spot. Koji is a ninja that goes by his word. 

Clch, clhc clch, these were the sounds being brought about by their conflict. Koji was holding back his techniques for his clansmen he wasn't trying to hurt her. Plus she's shown great prowess, so he let her continue her c;ear offensive assualt. * - Sat Oct 31 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) and Mirai would be encased in the dome, but due to the intensity of the battle the dome would go ignored as it covered over the Hyuugas. The dark is nothing to the eyes of the Hyuugas, and if someone was polite enough to destroy the obstruction they would  see that the spar showed no sign of slowing down. Koji's eyes peering through Mirai, and not really looking at her as elegant at the moment as one mistake could end him. As her speed and reflexes at this point surpassed his own. He would point out in brief pauses as he moved to dodge and deliver a few hits of his own. One to the torso and another toward the shoulder. 

"Your pace.....Is..... getting slower....Mirai... Come on..."* - Sat Oct 31 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would see two heavy strikes comng toward him rather quickly, and he knew he couldn't dodge them so easily. Koji would take the hit to arm and the hit to the abdomen, but it wouldn't cause paralyzation, however, it would cause pain taking both hits. This would cause Koji to cough up blood being a direct hit without any interference. These hits plus the many he gathered would cause great pain and multiple chakra point being closed. She managed to close more on him, than he her. He knew she coud see this with her eye, so thought that she would take satisfaction in that thought of victory. As Mirai palm stayed in contact with Koji's abdomen he'd mutter very quietly.

 "You're good, better than me, but I'm not one to lose easy. I hope you feel the victory in today's match, but you're trapped in my Eight Tri gram." 

Now, this would be the level of attack put on Naruto non lethal, but effective. A keen move to cause immobilization briefly. Koji aint killin nobody, so no need to worry. During this it would appear as if Koji jumped up another level. There's no escape.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) drops his guard and says, "You forced my hand today Mirai, so you may feel like the loser today... But, in all honesty I am! I've created some awesome jutsus, and once these are in your hands not even I will be able to defeat you! I reckon Sanoke will fear you hahaha."
