The correct amount would be judged by a dice roll made by Koji. If the dice landed on one through four, then the amount would be insufficent five or higher, and we would see the effect in full. Hours would pass as the shinobi collected the water, and when they felt they had collected enough. The two fuuin specialist readied their seals, and released them on the seal upon the wall. As they did this the two would say in unison, " Release me and I sink. Plug me and I rise." During this the water would rush from the seals, and onto the wall.* - Tue Oct 13 02:48:57 2015

With these thoughts in mind Ravenscrotum would again try and unlock the secret of the seal that had them staring at a deadend. With time passiing once more the ninjas would again try unleashing their seals on the seal upon the wall. * - Tue Oct 13 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) and his squad found no luck they would again try again.* - Tue Oct 13 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) and Ravenscrotum would find luck the third time around! With the water crashing toward the seal it would activate the process. Allowing the roof of the cave where the water leak to open causing a water to fall as if it were a watefall. Flooding the area rather quickly, but Koji would advise his members well before time to hold their breathes. Because they would need to dive and swim within the water. As the water sunk from the roof the deadend wall rose opening the passageway. 

Koji seeing this with his byakugan Koji would pull his members through that pathway he would swim for awhile without, but this was okay because of his Gate training allowed him a bit of freakish prowess of endurance. They woud eventually reach a path where the curent would push them off a ledge within the cave. Koji would cough hard as the air rushed back into his lungs, and the individuals would be recesitated by him as well. Color that had faded from them due to lack of oxtgen would return after this process, and they would begin to gasp as they spit of water from their lungs. It would only be momuntary until they regained their stature.

And, the sight was something to behold as rhe cave was lit by the diamonds embedded within the walls. The sizes would vary from pebbles to fist size! The Fuuin specialist would release mining material from their seals, and start the excavation they would fill four chest the size of a smart car. As they exscavated they would make their way toward an opening of the cave. This would actually be a seal entrance ino Suna possibly used by bandits for quicl transporting, and escapes from severe situations.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) sensing out Fuji's chakra within the village would come to deliver his request in chests sealed by the two specialist he allowed to accompany him on his journey to the underground cave. Koji would direct them to hand him four scrolls containing chests the size of smart cars. As the specialist awaited the acceptance of Fuji. Koji would await his reward from his former master Fuji. 
He would then head to the academy to give a lesson on what it means to be a ninja of Suna. It was a busy day for the Left Hand of Hassan, but Koji loved to stay busy it kept him feeling a sense of importance to the village.* - Tue Oct 13 04:10:01 2015

He would think this as he pinched his eyes, and tapped his foot in the sand. He was hoping it was a giant Fox instead, but with his luck knew it would come to be that both would show. When Koji was finished with his thought process he would greet Fuji with an accepting smile, and say, "It'll be done Master Fuji." 

With that he'll head off, but first he would look to Nina and ask, "Do you mind first stopping at the academy with me to teach, or would you rather I come back for you? It won't be long. Your choice, you not being a sinobi of Suna leaves you with no obligation to them of course. " * - Tue Oct 13 04:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) heads to the academy, but would return shortly.* - Tue Oct 13 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) taking the mission of Hassan would advance it. Instead of teaching three students he would teach an entire class at the academy. He didn't want them influenced by all the criminals running amok around the village, He needed the shinobi of this land to be noble in their cause. Understanding he would touch all the students there in the academy. Koji only sought to touch one or maybe two students. He knew that could make a difference in the future for sure, so that's what he strived for. 

Making his way within the academy doors he felt a bit of nostalgia. He was reminded of what he flet when he was sitting in the classroom, and tried to touch base with that past self. That way he could relate to the students more, and be able to better help them find their ninja way. Suna needed to restablish itself, so that these students know we aren't garbage among the other village. With that thought in mind Koji would walk into the classroom as a special guest. 

Many would recognize him as it had only been months literally three since he left the doors of the academy as a full-fledge genin, but to Koji it felt longer because of all that had happened. Some students didn't recognize him as he had grown in many way from intellect and physicality. Koji resembled a man though he was just a boy. As the Left Hand took his position he says, "Hello students, I'm the Left Hand of Suna and today I've come to tell you what it means to be a ninja. Before that however I would like to hear what it means to be a ninja from you all." When he said that some of the students were eager to give their answer, and he was eager to hear although he didn't show it. 

Koji would pick each student one by one according to their seating arrangement right to left. Some would give an answer, and others would stay quiet just wanting to hear what the others had to say. Some of the answers he heard were along the same lines such as become stronger, be the best, or defeat the enemy. Hearing those answers Koji would smile, because he thought that way coming out as well. 

Now looking into the eyes of the innocent and ignorant students he would say, "All of your answers are great! And, I've had similar answers before the one I'm about to give you... Have any of you given thought to life after you become stronger? Or after you defeat the enemy? Or if that enemy is your best firend?" The students would look away shake their heads, or give a confused look. But, none thought the question to be absurd. Instead he could see they begun to think about such things this is when he capitalized the moment!

Koji says, "I see that some of you are now giving thought to the future that's good, but allow me to help you. When you graduate you'll be given a headband . A headband with the insignia of our village, and that is what you should protect with your life. The soul of Suna which is carried in the body of you and that headband. YOU! After you get stronger use that strength to lift this village to new heights of glory, and YOU! When you're the best let them know Suna made you th best along with your effort! Patriotism is what it means to be a ninja of Suna. Uplift each other and protect each other with your lives, because each and every one of you is what makes Suna special!" The class would clap and cheer saying, "Wow this is the Left Hand the Kazekage must be even wiser and cooler! I'm going to be the best Patriot of Suna I can be!" The kids would shout with excitement even the teachers were a bit astounded. 

With that Koji took his leave knowing the students were wel informed and learned on what it meant to be a ninja of Sunagakure.* - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015

I'm in the process of getting more men, but it's my dream to see more of our bloodline in this organization wholly. That way me make a name for ourselves.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) and Ravenscrotum would make their way to the outskirts of ther desert. Once there the team would venture out into the wasteland, and to the border of what was known as the "Desert of Death. Koji activating his byakugan would scout the area out. As he did this the veins that connected to the organs that is hs eyes would begin to grow, and pulsate due to the surge of chakra. This process would allow him to see through the ground as if it were glass itself, and with the knowledge gained from what he saw Koji would inform Izanami and Reguel.

With the desert a bit more hotter today Koji would say as they trekked further into The Desert of Death, "Stay close to me. Where I step is where there is solid land, but where I don't are Sinkholes or beast lurking. Be prepared for an ambush, and keep an eye on your footing as we move." If the members were obidient they would form a straight line behind Koji following ihis every step exactly as they traveled through the Desert of Death. * - Wed Oct 14 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be greeted by the presensce of both his members of Ravenscrotum, and would say, "You guys really know how to listen." Rubbing his hands back through his hair as he said this you could hear the jolly sarcasm in Koji's voice. At the end of his remark Koji would say, "Now time to do the real test!" In that same moment of speaking those words Koji began to rotate! Stirring up the entire area pot holes would begin to fall in various areas of the desert, and beast of all different sizes would pop out of the sand. Koji would shout, "Run!"* - Wed Oct 14 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) instructing his members to run he says, "Stay on this trek we started on, and you won't fall, but the animals.... Ehh.." Giant snakes would surface with their fangs bearing venom, and giant sand moles would pop their heads with their fangs bearing venom as well! It would be a horrendous scene almost as if the land itself was collasping on itself. As the ninjas ran out of the Desert of Death the creature would attempt to swarm Ravenscrotum. 

The odds were obviously out their favor this time, and Koji feared the worse for his team. He now understood why they called it the Desert of Death, and it kept  up to its title. Gaining the attention of the beast of the sand Koji would buy enough time for his other two members to escape by the har of their scalp. With their safety assured he would give them a hopeful smile, but all seemed lost as the beast came crashing down on the young ninja at once... 

Koji would activate his byakugan, and seek the perfect opportunity to unleah a savage rotation throwing back all the beast in a fail sweep. Due to the timing it was a perfect throwback! Allowing Koji to run back to the village with Ravenscrotum successfully!* - Wed Oct 14 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would see the giant fly heading toward them from mainly from the size, but he could see the large pool of chakra rushing toward the area. Koji would warn his members ahead of time, and thus they would have prepared a sufficient attack plan for the behemoth of bugs. Not seeing anything else in the area with the monster. Koji would prepare himself for the lightening using being. 

Koji would shout, "Be on alert of its mouth I shall warn you of it's charging chakra. Izanami we're depending on your aim! It's best to get that capsule in when its mouth is begining to open or close." Koji seeing  the skin of the creature knew it was thick in nature, so he prepared a shuriken laced with explosive tag. He would sling it as the 30 meter beast without hesitation. Testing the durability of the beast, Unable to reach the beast as of yet this would be the best bet for now. 
 
If he is actually somehow able to get close to the beast he would destroy it's chakra points. * - Wed Oct 14 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing the words of the more experiened ninja Tetsu... Koji assumed he had a plan, so he would direct his team to move back when the beast began to flap its wings rapidly. This allowed space and postioning between them, and the giant bug. Watching the wind rise Ravenscrotum would now be placed behind the two clones, and holding off the giant bug.
 As the bug pressed with the storm Koji would rotate as the beast struck with its mouth redirecting it from the group. It would not be able to do whatever it intended pricelly due to the shifting of its body. The team would keep moving back until Tetsu revealed his plan. Koji would keep instructing Ravenscrotum to do the same.* - Wed Oct 14 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) witnessing the bug bum rush through the iron sand he would take that moment to run toward Marissa. As the beast attempted to grab her he would slide under dodgeing the mouth should it try and snap, but being belly claw above marrisa this was not a problem as its head would be raised in the air. 

Koji would now use his gentle fist art, and in this moment he woud tell Marissa to use her wind with the rotation that he was predicted to use. Sending it towards tesu against its will. After this Koji would await for another counter opportunity. (This would be a perfect chance to catch the fly and force feed the bitch) Koji's thoughts.* - Wed Oct 14 06:01:23 2015

With his senses active , and byakugan activated he waited for any slight motion that may be perceived as a threat from the bug. * - Wed Oct 14 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) follows * - Wed Oct 14 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would catch the tossed blade, and begin to swinging up and down. Not knowing the basics of swordplay. Koji would swing hard up and down trying to rip apart the very air around him. He figured it took great strength to wield a sword, so he was preparing himself for the wielding of an actual blade. 

With sweat releasing itself from the pores of the skin Koji would change the motion from vertica to horizontal keeping the force the same as earlier. As he tenses you could see the chakra flow to his eyes as he began to focus even harder on the swing. He would activate his byakugan thinking he could find the source of the perfect technique through the swords structure. However, that would not be the case. 

Continuing to strike harshly Koji would let out grunts and straining sounds as he kept the pressure up. He was going to master this technique at any cost, because once he set his mind to something that would be it. He wouldn't stop until the goal met, or his body met with the dirt itself.

Time would pass and as Koji heard the words of Fuji he would continue striking ferociously within the air. * - Wed Oct 14 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Doujutsu are meant to be sacred, use them only when necesary, not as a 24 hour reflex. - Wed Oct 14 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would find that concept difficult basically having the use of the technique since childhood, but he would heed the words of his master. Closing his eye would soothe the tension he had in his grip and swing as well. His swings instantly became more fluent in nature. With each swing he would follow through with another. Up to down, then down to upward*

Koji would continue this with the words of Fuji echoing in his head. As his eyes were shut the ninja would begin to enter a meditative state. Much like the ones when he travels down his inner chakra pathways to open the Gates. Imaging various fruits tbeing sliced by a blade elegantly, but at the same time fiercly. A smile would escape into real life as he called himself a fruit ninja within his mind. * - Wed Oct 14 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) after some time would fashion other material things in his mind as he swung the stick in rea life. Such as rocks, shoes, leaves, wood, and hats.. These things would come at him at random, and he would in appropriate directions as they flung toward him. He was getting the hang of this skill just a tiny bit. 

Within his mind the items would come toward him at a more rapid rate than before, and this caused him to pick up the speed in reality. Sweat jumping from him arm, and onto the ground! Sweat faling from his forehead into his perked lips. Koji was working up a sweat cutting the air, and he wouldn't stop anytime soon having the ability to last an abnomal legnth of time. * - Wed Oct 14 08:17:04 2015

Koji awaiting his response would say, "Since posting the laws around the city, and the announcement of reinforcment of the Law taking immediate effect we've seen a small decline in devious sbehavior. Our academy is also taking their part ineducating the youth better on the laws as well."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) hearing those words would begin his patrol. At the moment he bowed his head in respect would be the same moment he dashed from the plaza to begin his patrol of Sunagakure.* - Thu Oct 15 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	After sparring and having a few mission Koji would realize he hadn't yet mastered the Gate of Healing. But, he would not be deterred from that fact and would reflect even more on the past events. The reflection he put himself in gave him the knowledge that his journey had gave him the building blocks to fully unlocking, and being half way there he wouldn't just stop in the face of adversity. With that wisdom in his mind Koji would strap on his gear, and walk out to begin his training once more. Eyes focused and body screaming for more training he would answer its prayers. Exiting the area, Koji made his way to an enormous rock within the desert the size of a tower! After sizing the solid earth up Koji would begin thrusting his legs toward it with whirlwind kick. Hitting high and low Koji would start the destruction of this giant rock 

	Koji would be unleashing savage kicks from the whirlwind kick jutsu of Konohagakure. This would be putting the minimal size of scratches on the behemoth of dirt. Koji would need to increase his strength, and this was the best way of doing. Able to move faster than he ever could before he would now aim to strike harder than ever before! Kicking the rock viscously with each turn of the body, and as he landed he would unleash his clan's rotation. Tearing the skin of the rock ever so slightly.  

	 At the end of the jutsu Koji would begin to chain his attacks together in unison with each other. To the untrained eye he would seems like a tornado in the sand! Everything in the sand would be picked up, and thrown toward the giant rock! Be it sand, pebbles, or Koji's legs it would bang against the obstruction with great force. The rock would start to shake, but it would not crumble down to sand just yet. If one were to come in close contact with the giant rock one could see the marks made by the impacts of Koji. As the time passed the swirling ninja would press on trying to reach his threshold, and then once there he would pass it. 

	Continuing the rotating process the ninja would strike the rock even harder! With each contact sweat would break his limbs and forehead. This was due more so of the glamourous sun in the sky, rather than the extent of his training. As the day progressed even further, however, he would begin to feel the fatigue.  The pain itself would begin to effect the boy's progress in his training, and he would need to start trying to overcome the pain mentally. 

	It would be more aching than extreme exhaustion as his body would begin to actually be bruising his body. He would feel his legs swell form the repetitive cycle of attacks upon the giant rocks. Not wanting to give in to his weakness Koji would persevere through the pain, and continue the furious swipes of whirlwind kicks. As he leaped Koji would cringe due to the pain, but his form would be sacrificed. He would make contact splendidly, and finish with a powerful rotation once more. 

	Now nightfall Koji would limp his way home for rest. As the training had took its toll on the young ninja, and he needed to recover. On his way home he would pay a visit to the village's medic, and that would allow him to be healed rather quickly. But he still needed the proper rest, so that his muscle would grow in strength. After having a bowl of garlic ramen filled with tother nourishment. He rested for the night, and was awoken abruptly to begin a mission. 
* - Thu Oct 15 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Koji would pass out from swinging, and as he rested you see the twitching of various muscles in his arm and back. The rapid swings, and combative mission before totaled up to be a harsh training regime on his body, but this was all accepted by Koji, because he was determined to train his body to unlock the Gate of Healing. Being carried to his home in his unconscious state Koji's muscles would rebuild for the next day. Awakening the next morning he would get his daily nourishment, so that he'll be able to keep up the extensive training. After the meal he would be instructed to patrol the village by Lord Hassan. * - Thu Oct 15 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 
Koji would activate his Byakugan to scout the surrounding area, and after this action he would notice suspicious behavior near the weapons market. Koji would high -tail it to the vicinity, and say, "Yo suspicious-guy. What are you doing? Why is that glass broken"? The guy had just been putting his leg into the door, but having been approach by Koji he would retract his action. He would then brush his clothes down, and swipe his hair back as he completed this action he would smirk, and pull a knife out toward Koji. This prompted Koji to say, "You don't want to do whatever you're thinking." As soon as Koji finished his sentence the guy would charge him. It would also be in that moment Koji would take his Gentle Fist stance. The guy now close in range Koji would rotate throwing the man back into the ground. 

Koji would shout, "This is the new force in Sunagakure, Desert Owl! We are here to keep the peace! And I the Left Hand of Sunagakure am in charge of this force" The man would run away in a cowardice state into the shadows, and Koji would say at a tone in which the guy could hear as he ran, "Remember stealing is against the law if I catch you committing such crimes again I won't be a generous in your punishment"! With all that done Koji would continue his rounds around the enormous city of Sunagakure.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would move on to the Suna Inn seeing a bit of a disturbance happening near the building. Using his x-ray with the prowess of his Byakugan Koji would see a large huddle of bodies, and a young lady cornered against a wall. He would activate the first Gate, and upon reaching the building he bust through the door! As the dust settled the men would look toward Koji with disgust, and warn him to leave now if he valued himself. Of course, Koji wouldn't be alarmed by them looking at their levels of chakra, so he would say, "I would be more worried about yourself than me. It's against the law to threaten the innocent, and I expect you to pay your bill here after our business is finished." 

The men would be confused as to what business Koji was referring, but they didn't hesitate on their actions. They would attempt to swarm him in the small room, but it would backfire on them quickly! Just as they settled their toes in position Koji would begin to rotate this would cut the threads of the large body of men, and throw them into the ground. Koji would then say, "I'd hate to arrst you all as are jails are small, and unless you like being balls deep in each others ass... It would be very unpleasant for you all." The men on their asses cowarding in fear would be speechless. Koji would drect the frail woman to run to whereeer she felt was safe, and that she didn't have to worry. 

Koji proclaiming himself as the Left Hand of Sunagakure, and head of Desert Owl the men would retreat as well with looks of repent of their faces. Koji knew these were the fodder of the gangs of Suna, and he was going to take out the leader of the gangs. So, that they fear him and not their boss. A new age was coming and Koji would be the hand to help pave the way for it. Exiting the Inn Koji would close the inner Gate, and keep his rounds going around SunagaKure.* - Thu Oct 15 04:08:19 2015

He couldn't even get close of course that was the experienced Hassan. He was going to see if he's good enough to prevent that now. Focusing himself he would unlock the first Gate, and activate his Byakugan. He would then take his Gentle Fist stance, thus creating his famous Harden Gentle Fist stance. After this Koji would propel himself forward to strike noticing the amount of chakra surge he noted a genjutsu was coming, so it would be best to strike fast. 

Dashin forward he would start a jab planning to cut the circulation of chakra flow. This would cause heave damage, but non severe and lower the strength of jutsus if made to hit. After this he would finish with a leaf whirlind. barrage to the opponet. * - Fri Oct 16 02:52:48 2015
