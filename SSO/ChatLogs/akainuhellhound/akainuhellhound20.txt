<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would say, "I can tell your paper structure is tough, but our offense isn't focus on stregnth. Instead the Gentle Fist is made to disrupt chakra itself, so the power of his strike wasn't entirely necessary." Koji using his Byakugan perceived the chakra level that enhanced the paper jutsu, and gauged the chakra flow to his hands accordingly. He would make strike equivalent to the papers thrown at him. Koji thrusting his hands forward would make his way closer to to Ai. 

This was because they were working on speed and Koji wanted to create a sense of urgency for him. So, he thrusted faster and faster until the papers were gone. Of course, they are reappearing so he expecting more to come as soon as he destroyed all ten. Thus, impeding his forward progress toward Ai.* - Sat Oct 24 07:20:44 2015

Koji woud take a fast step back, and try out a new technique as well. Koji took this step back cause he didn't want to attack Ai drectly just the paper. Measuring the required force Koji would unleash a force neccerasy to tear through 100 sheets flat and no more. 

Now backin position Koji channels the chakra into his arm, and thrusts forward this would be like a gale wind spear, but chakra leaving his hand. as Koji released his hair would fly back, and he would retake his original position. Striking incoming paper made after this in the process.* - Sat Oct 24 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks, (It's unproductive to blast waves of air palms, and not healthy either! So, I'll fist my through for now." Koji would dish out palms left and right on the stacking paper, but he would not lose count as he was accustomed to striking objects like this from his regulalr training regime. Koji would begin to utilize his body even more keeping momentum as he struck with his palm. He would channel chakra from his palm to his elbow, to his knee, to his foot. It would occur right to left. This motion would mimic the rotation, but without the explotion. It was a concentrated amounth and very effective technique as KOji bellowed his way through the monterous paper. 

Three-hundred stacks wouldn't be nothing with his palm, but Koji sought to increase his tai-jutsu,and attack speed so he pressed on. Thrust a knee to a mid kick, to a high elbow, to a precise palm. Koji was hacking away at the paper with attempts to get ever closer to Ai. * - Sat Oct 24 08:01:42 2015

Even to his user it was a mystery, because over 10kstamina was alot, however, over 10k paper was alot as well.. Koji cycled on through the heap of paper. With out a care in the world. Channleing his chakra to match every single piece he came into contact wtih. The boy was mastering his art along with other things at this point. As the paper may have seemed limitless * - Sat Oct 24 08:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) attacks werebecoming instinct at this point. Withot thought he would strike with grace. Just as the woman was barely scraping her paper supply Koji only scraped the of that which was a skin cell of a skin cell, so like a membrane or mitochondrian. Koji was imaging that he was a dragon striking through trees, andwould even let out tiny roars beneath his breathe as he struck. Koji perservering through it was not only a battle of foreverness, but how long he could stay attentive as well. He would say, "I wish I had a marker." Koji was admiring the wall, and how effortlessy it rebuilt. But he admired how quickly h tumble through it more.. * - Sat Oct 24 08:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would take it up another notch as the threshold was here, and that is the point where limits are broken, and new ones are gained. He would open both gates and give Ai what she asked for. After he has power up Koji unleashes another Air palm. He figured there was 500 or so now stacked, so this would be a full force blow. With no hesitation  as he knew this wouldn't pierce with deathly intent. She would just be greeted with a brush of wind through her hair. Koji would immediatley charge her. 

As he sees her panting increase he knows this will improve her skill grantly once she overcomes this legnth of jutsu usage.* - Sat Oct 24 09:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) matches his fist with her fist they would clash gently. This would be a symbol of acceptance between the two to spar. Koji was honoable in his dealings, so backed away to give her space to set up. He would take a moment to do the same as well. Focusing on the woman before him he surges the chakra to his eyes, and that moment he could see all around him and those in front through! Koji would soon after take his family's fighting stance.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: So, just to be sure, I'm Nalenth. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: If I was then everyone in this village would have owe me alot of favors. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: A pleasure. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Likewise. - Sat Oct 24 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Nice to meet you, Nalenth. - Sat Oct 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I'm Ryomen, by the way. - Sat Oct 24 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doesn't like to wait well at least in a match, so he decided to close the distance as well. He informed Makoto, "It will hurt more if you hesitate." However, Koji has been practicing restraint in his sparing, so he wouldn't strike her in the kidney causing her to involuntarily piss herself. Koji only does that to the most disrespetful folk he battles or come across. "Embrace the fight." 

Koji gathering his chakra to his palms, elbow and feet he would seek to strike her left leg out with his right. In order to make her lose balance this would also be a strike to a tenketsu point. At the same time he would be swinging his elbow around to knock her in the torso. (Picture a rotation motion very fast though) If sucessful this will knock her back causing a deep gasp. Due to a heavy point being hit. "knocking wind out basically"

Koji would then set his stance to begin again.* - Sat Oct 24 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Kilm, you're awfully close to that spar. - Sat Oct 24 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: At least...The world isn't as dark...A few dim lights are around... - Sat Oct 24 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would make contact with her leg, and see the chakra surge as she opened the first gate. He would literally use this motion to rotate, thus blowing back the harden woman from his range. Koji would would then set his stance once more, and with distance now between the two Koji open the first Gate as well just cause he could also. As he saw fighting was similar to dance in many aspects in matching another's move and so on and so on.* - Sat Oct 24 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would been thrown off guard by this completely as no one has ever pentrated his rotation before. Not like butter and cheese anyway, although the rotation would cause minimal scratch damage to the skin. The rotation would have already been in place, so the next this would be a nicely timed knee into Koji's abdomen. With the force of him rotating this would undoubtly cause him to choke on air and dirt cause that's where this boys going today. 

Koji being knocked down would fall to his kness gasping for air, but his guard would be up no less, but this would take a good chunk of stamina out of him. Regain his composure Koji would say, "Time to get serious." His eyes would be focused and he would prepare to unleash a barrage from Asura's Closet.* - Sat Oct 24 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Cute. - Sat Oct 24 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) doesn't like the second knee being given to him, and he's not going to Air Palm at point blank range that's just evil. Koji's arm would be held against his will kind of like a dog by the leech at the very moment, so he powered down an conceded. He would spit out some blood onto the ground. And, the veins would feint from his skull along with the surplus of chakra. * - Sat Oct 24 18:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll take any help, as long as it doesn't collide with my medical training as well. - Sat Oct 24 18:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That'll be good Ai. I can press her tenketsu to mimic the Gate of Healing. But, she needs to just rest and get water. - Sat Oct 24 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...I hope you're not planning on using that toxic fog on us again. - Sat Oct 24 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) activating his byakugan would press points on her to revitalize her. Though this minimal and not as powerful, but it wil allow her to be healthy until medical assitance is provided. Koji does this delicately this would ensure her safety for the time being. He says, "Get some rest."* - Sat Oct 24 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I can carry her to the hospital, if you'd like! - Sat Oct 24 19:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) moves to be healed by brother Bryson in the village church. It was time to pray and such as well for the shinobi. This day he missed Flexus a bit more than usual, so he goes to rest his heart on the loss of his friend. In his mind the ninja would say his ninja way (Do Better.. Or, these Bitch ass Niggas will Do Worse.) This was the motto he adobted from Flexus as he watched get impaled through the throat.. Hard for a thirteen year old to forget such a pivotal moment. * - Sat Oct 24 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be interupted in prayer, but he heard both responses. He would look at Izutora, and perceived the points he closed he would undo the sealing on the boy. And, we would possibly feel so jovial that he umps into a hand stand walking out the church. Koji would then set his eyes on Reguel, and hand him a passport, but told him to be prompt. He didn't want to see him hunted down or anything. He would also give him a smile, and say, "I hope you learn alot on your visit."  

He returns to prayer after his duties.* - Sat Oct 24 19:32:03 2015
