"The events would follow on "yesterdays date" a man snook by the defense of Sunagakure and made his way into the Kage's building. There he was apprehended by Izutora, Ketsuki, Jiki, and Fujitora. During that time Fujitora directed us with a plan, and apart of that plan was Trilliams spiders. They dispered rapidly in the room, but the battle would lead all parties to the hall way. Including the spiders. Where the efforts of Tondou,Trilliam, Fujitora, Kuro, Ketsuki, and Koji would stop the assailant. During the altercation Trilliam out of fear would sink into the floor even beyond my sight, but at the moment of the man's capture, and debate over his execution. The spiders would ignite and explode. Sadly there were two on Ketsuki's arms...(there is detailed information about her dying, but it's left un -said), Koji owuld be protected by Fujitora's effort, and the intruder would would be saved by the effort of Kuro. A bref skirmish between Fuji, Jiki versus Kuro would breakout, but in the end Fuji and Jiki would combo the intruder in a nice Sungakure execution style ceremony."

These are the events as recorded. * - Sat Nov  7 05:34:56 2015

Koji would hear Mizora's question and answer, "No problem, I'll ask Hassan if it's okay I want to make sure he hasn't put you on the shinobi suspension list." 

Koji would then turn and bow to the two ladies introduced to him by Yan. As Koji bowed he woud miss the extended hand shake, but would rise quickly enough to approach her as she left it out. As he came forward he would say, 

"Nice to meet you both! Hope we can get along at the party it's just to have everyone meet on peaceful terms, rather than harmful unpleseant ones,"* - Sun Nov  8 01:41:32 2015

 "I understand, it's the consideration that counts at leasts that's what grandma used to say." 

Koji releasing his shake would be wearing gloves to cover the softness of his hands. Usually people commented on how soft they were, but he didn't really want to hear that. As it reminded him of when his mother last walked him around  a few years ago. However, the size of his hand did match the teenagers abnormal size for his age. As he heard the question of Kiyoko he's say, 

"Nah, not common but every once in a whille some looney character will enter trying to do something to disrupt the peace. Imagine it like a weather occurance. "* - Sun Nov  8 01:54:20 2015

"I heard a strange philosophica phrase the other day while in school... Went like this, Some goods require necessary evils. My teacher is a doctor at the hospital, and used an example you might like to describe it. He said, "Normally cutting someone is bad, but I as a surgeon cannot heal someone unless I cut them." I was baffled by that statement, but made me think how cmplicated things are at times hahaha."

"Naah, I'm not blind I can see you probably just as clearly as you can see me." 
Koji wouldn't notice her staring, because Makoto was confused by his skin color, so he wouldn't take offense to the staring. However, no one had blatantly just stared into his expressionless eyes. As soon as he notice the intensity he'd turn a little. * - Sun Nov  8 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) "It's fine. It's not missing just blended in haha." Koji would sit as she bowed not on the bench, but in the sand indiant style. He had gotten tired of standing while having a long conversation. 

"Do you find the village nice outside the hospital?"* - Sun Nov  8 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) looks around and says, 

"I survey the village sometimes and see that some people actually sleep on the ground. I just want to see how they feel, or at least get close to that feeling. However, that's changing thankfully, Sunagakure is expanding and constructing more homes for the population." 

Koji has a key principal and that's have compassion for others. Most people look at him oddly as he chills around various places of Sunagakure. Acting as some of the homeless around Sunagakure. But, recently people have stopped asking him why he sleeps or sits outside. It's understandable to Koji why Kiyoko asked, because she's been in the hospital she's worried with many other things. Koji as an officer of Suna cares for the citizens on a deep level.* - Sun Nov  8 03:13:42 2015
