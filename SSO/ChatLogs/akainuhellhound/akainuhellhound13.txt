<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Strutting to distance the mountain would begin to fade in the distance, and Koji again would be making headway. This time even faster than the time that seemed faster than the first time! He was astounded at the increase of speed, but he would save his acknowledgement of the fact until the end of training. 

	Survival at this point was the game no longer having rations the ninja would have to fight through exhaustion, hunger, and dehydration all at once. This was necessary in pushing the limitations of his body even more, but to also simulate the feeling of going to Gate of Healing for prolonged time. Striding forward his through the perils of journey Koji's body would ache from the excessive stress being put upon them.

	The terrain was now rough and with each jolt off the land Koji would keep the pace up, but his breathe would be all but gone. It was if he was running in space at this point no air to be held! With his lungs collapsing in on themselves slowly but surely the strain of training was becoming great. Ignoring this fact Koji would press on without fail. 

	 After a few more hours Koji would be forced to rest against his will this was due to him slipping in mud. As he slipped he would bang his head onto a tree stomp, thus knocking him unconscious. Finally resting and allowing his body the proper rest his lungs to breathe easily, and heart rate to slow the young ninja would pass out soon after. 

	The light of the sun would beam right on to the face of Koji, and this would awaken him abruptly. Rubbing his forehead he would feel the knot from the fall, and say, "I really do miss the properties of the mountain." Wasting no time he would take to his journey once more. 

	Feeling a bit advantageous Koji begins upping the scale of training within the forest he was in. Activating his Byakugan Koji would check to see if the branches were homes of anything dangerous. He didn't see anything for miles, so leaping into the air he decided to give his arms a bit of a tense workout today. Accomplishing this by swinging from branch to branch. 

	This would strengthen his grip, reflexes, and arm strength as he thrusted his weight forward. Now looking like a monkey in the high trees Koji felt a bit of relief, because he didn't have to keep the boring routine of running. He would attempt to swing this whole entire forest as a game, but if he loses his grip and falls to the ground he has to run the whole way. Not wanting that ordeal he starts to will through the exercise.

	Whipping through trees like the wind itself Koji was anxious to get out of the forest. Missing his sand flooded village so much so it ached his heart to be away so long. Swoosh* Swoosh* was the sound made as he zipped through the trees he was becoming swift in his actions more so than ever before. 

	Now feeling the pressure in his arms Koji would use his Byakugan to look around, and ahead of himself to see if he could find any trouble brewing. Sure enough a blizzard seemed to be making its way over to our hero. Stopping on a branch of a thick tree Koji would take as many leaves as possible, and stuff them into his garments this would be to keep him as warm as possible. 

	With the leaves now in place the storm would come bellowing in with no warning, but thanks to his eyes he was given time to prepare. Taking the force of the blizzard with no regard to its power Koji would swing himself forward. As he moved through the air it would be as if the storm engulfed whole. Like a snake swallowing a deer. 

	Upon jumping into the snow Koji would notice it was the end of the forest, so he started running once more. It was rough as the snow began to build on top of itself. From one inch to two inches, then to three to four. It would eventually lead to the ninja stomping through the snow instead of running, but that was no simple task as the thickness of the snow required much strength to break through. 

	He would be imitating bleacher exercises as he traversed through the ever rising snow, and with the cold it made his muscles more prone to locking up. He couldn't find warmth within this weather, and he was feeling as though he was becoming refrigerated. Truly an awful experience for the young ninja!

	As time passed we would find Koji buried under snow like a standing coffin. It would be collapsing him under growing pressure, so he needed to act fast. Focusing himself and channeling his chakra Koji would release chakra from every point of his body. Breaking the snow that had subjugated him into the unfavorable predicament. 

	Now free he would run and run, but not effortlessly for the snow would now be building. So, with each step taken he would be elevated even higher than the last taken. He was reminded of when the flood happened earlier in his training, and filled with a bit of agitation. Due to the severity increasing this go around. Ignoring those feelings he needed to get back so he trekked forward and onward without fail. 

	Escaping death would be running high above the surface in deep thick snow. It would take a great force to not only remove his legs from the gaping holes, but to force them to jolt as the muscles within were freezing. It was as if he was breaking ice from his very bone structure with each trek forward. 

	 After some hundred miles Koji would find his way out of the blizzard, and into a spring like area where he found a lake to drink from. This was the first time on his way back that he found water, and he acted as such. Leaving his proper mannerism behind him Koji would dunk his full head into the water, and just engulf as much as he could. This was the miracle and rejuvenation he needed to return back home. 

	Beaten physically and spiritually Koji would rest this day wholly, and let his body recover from its shock. He was bearing more than he thought he ever would in his lifetime, but he truly felt he was on the road to be of the greats. With this thought in mind Koji would pass out from exhaustion. 

	As the ninja slept for days you could see the muscle twitch for days. They were working even in his sleep to repair. It was as if his body had a mind of its own separate from Koji! Like the bod itself knew what was ahead, and that Koji would need them to be top notch when he awoke. It was truly unnatural but then again this journey has been an unnatural one by far!

	Waking up Koji's body was still aching soar, but he noticed land had ended at this point. What laid ahead of him was an ocean, and he had thought to run over it, but found swimming would give his body the exercise it needed. Hoisting his garments to the side he would dive into the ocean, and begin with the frog style feeling this would better suit his muscles. 

	Frogging through the ocean Koji would encounter savage winds and storms along with them, but that was part of the journey. Using his Byakugan he would pinpoint a flock of migrating birds. Allowing him to keep his navigation correct, and not entrapping him in an ignorant voyage. Thrusting his legs and feet back and forth an idea for a new move would pop into his mind. He called it "Heavenly Spear", but before he started practicing it he would have to see his beloved land once again.

	Keeping the frog like motion going through the ocean Koji would be dealing with a lot! From muscle soreness to skin peeling due to the water drying and rubbing against his skin. Also dehydration hitting him much quicker due to the salt! It was worse than running he'd think to himself as he kept swimming onward. 

	Overcoming many obstacles of this journey he began to think this was the end. No longer able to move Koji was left a float with no energy. He had swam through the night and day, but made no progress closer to land. Though he saw birds within the air it was becoming hopeless for the ninja. Not knowing the distance he would have to go was starting to take its toll, and as he floated there he pondered on whether he had any strength left. 

	Koji would say, "I've given my all! One hundred percent! Wat else do I need to give?" Now Koji wasn't crazy he was shouting to the stars in the night sky as he heard one day they were past greats. He wanted their answer, he wanted to know what is greater than one hundred percent. Of course, he didn't get a reply mustering up his strength Koji would say, "One hundred and one percent is better…" 

	Stressing forward he would continue swimming keeping in mind that one hundred and one percent is better than on hundred percent any day. Scooping the water, then kicking the water Koji would propel himself forward without hesitation now. The longer he stayed submersed the quicker death would come to the door. So, he trained on and on. 

	It would be a cloudless day and hotter than normal, but Koji wouldn't give to the pressure. He had been under unfathomable pressure through this whole training exercise, so he wouldn't give to more of it. Instead, he would champion it like that champion he sought to be! He would spread the glory of Suna with his skills making sure they were not only respected, but revered!

	Lips dryer than sand and skin more pruned than a raisin Koji would finally find a coast. There he would lay and there he would sleep and rest, but not for long as the tide brushed his face. Making him get up and seek food and nourishment. He would find some off the trees farther into land. Even clothes were out hanging on some wires! After bathing he would put on the clothes, and rest in a tiny man-made hut already assembled. 

	Koji would sleeping for days, and this would give his body the rest needed to journey and train once more! This was comfort he hasn't felt in a long time, and really appreciated this moment. Awakening he felt physically and mentally restored and able to compete once more with the challenges of life! Throwing a hooded shirt over his head and tightening the stringed shorts upon his wait. Koji's body would resemble a well-crafted sculpture. 

	Taking out to the setting horizon Koji would run, and start to recognize the area just a bit! It warmed his heart greatly so much so he would fill an adrenaline rush as he brushed through the trees and grass. The sun would kiss instead of bite today, and it pleased him so as he ran home. He felt not only his power grow, but the love of his land as well. It was as if it missed him greatly.

	Leaving the forest he would now make it to a desert, and he would kneel down in it, and pray to God with a thankful heart! Koji would say, "Now that I've given my thanks let us get home with our new strength. Opening the first gate Koji would sprint forward as fast as he could humanly go! He was using 100 percent of the body's abilities. 

	Pulling up sand from the ground as he ran Koji wouldn't let up for nothing wanting to see his home he would sprint full speed ahead. It didn't and wouldn't torment him that he was miles away still from home. He wouldn't let his own inefficiency be the reason he couldn't make it home. 

	Opening the limits of the human felt nice to Koji as he ran with the power of the Gate of Opening. He actually began to reflect on how he came to know about limit-breakers on this journey. He would come to so many obstacles in so many forms. He knew that he wouldn't and couldn't forget these lessons learned, because they were the reason he was able to obtain another power.

	One that would make him even more respected and revered as shinobi of Sunagakure! Jolting even faster Koji would pursue his target at even greater speed. The anxiety was really getting to him. This was unlike his normal behavior, but he had missed his home and couldn't wait any longer. The sun would begin to ravage the Suna ninja at this point. 

	Of course not caring for such matter Koji kept pressing onward with what he deemed his mission now, because his training would be complete until he ran through the village's gate. Using is Byakugan he couldn't see the village quite yet, but he wouldn't stop until it surfaced itself above the sand dunes. 

	Koji as ran would see the wildlife all around him, and say, "Its been so long I'm happy to be back." Running Koji would begin to jump off one leg every few paces to give his legs more exercise. Muscles naturally flexed would glimmer within the sunlight as the sweat escaped through the pores of his skin. 

	With more time passing Koji couldn't see the village just yet, but his reserves of energy was running low. He had to make a decision to stop, or keep going. You can imagine the choice he made. Without hesitation he would keep moving forward with great devotion! 

	Now feeling it's time Koji would focus himself to open the Gate of Healing!  Allowing another burst of energy and power to his body! This would cause many mini stable craters beneath his feet as he ran toward Suna. The wind would fill the holes with sand as he dashed forward however covering his traces. 
.	Now able to go this mode at choice due to his extensive training. The fruits of his labor has prospered greatly. Smirking Koji would move more persistently toward the village. Within his haste he would feel even more jolts of energy surge through his body. As the Suna was now visible to his Byakugan!

	It would be intervene by some intruding giant scorpions however, and Koji wasn't in the mood to deal. So as he ran would slide keeping all his momentum as he activated his rotation in unison with his speed. Causing the speed to increase rapidly to the point it shredded the beast into pieces! While ending the rotation Koji would keep his speed, and reform his stride heading back to Suna. 

	Now within the naked eye view Koji would deactivate his Gates, and fall flat on his face within the gates of the village. Villagers and nurses would carry the Left Hand of Suna to the recovery building. There he would rest and recover for the required time instructed by the nurses. After this he would be greeted to a fine meal that would restore his strength and energy.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 	Exiting the medical center Koji would go and do his last bit of training. Something simple something he had started his training regime with. Running fifty miles, doing six-hundred squats, and six-hundred pull-ups. Putting on his training garments would head out soon after. 

	Taking the usual route Koji would be sprinting through the village using Byakugan to make sure all was well, and today it seemed that way. No longer raspy in breathe when he ran, and lungs feeling as though he was walking the ninja would smile looking up in the night sky. "Can I become one of the stars of the night?" Koji would ask. 

	Completing the run Koji would make his way to a tree with a thick branch. Once there he would take his position and begin squatting. Counting each one out loud he would note how his legs had lost that burning sensation he once started with. But, the tediousness of the workout still lingered, and he hated that mostly out of this self-designed workout.

	Making it halfway through the workout Koji decided to back flips to get the feels going through his legs. With each pop up he would simultaneously plop into an elegant backflip. This would continue for hours until he finished the said workout! The sun would soon be rising now as time passed. 

	Finishing his last flip squat Koji would land, but instead grab hold of the above branch and begin his pull-ups. With time flying by he was delighted to see that the workout was not killing him like in the past. A smile would again surface on his face from the acknowledgement of his growth. 

	With day break Koji would have completed his first set, and would have repeated this process three times over. After that he would have walked home for bathing, nourishments, and bed. This would be the first time Koji walked himself home for bed after training. 

	Three days would pass and Koji would stay sleep undisturbed his muscles and organs would be refining themselves in this time, and his spirit would be as well. He was becoming strongly altogether in mind, body, and spirit.  Should he make a long life Koji would be a great in no time. 

	Awakening Koji would set out after doing his required chores such as eating and hygenes. Going out to his trusty tree Koji would begin striking it, and rotating after each set. This was to help reflexes and attack speed. Koji didn't want to slip on his techniques just because his athleticism was improving. 

	Hours would pass but Koji would still work on his gentle fist art, and eight tri-gram jutsu. He was dedicated in his proceedings and this was due to the standards he's set for himself. Wanting to leave a mark on the world somehow he figured his dedication would be a good way to start. He needed his clan to see his ways, and know how they should be in the future should he not be there to guide them.

	On his last rotation the young ninja would pass out from exhaustion, but he wouldn't left there a villager watching would help him to his home. There he would rest, and be nourished back to good health. Koji would awaken in front of a welcoming meal, and he would thankfully devour it!

	Upon finishing his meal the shinobi would strap on his gear and set his mind to training once more. Walking out the door he would thank the villager of Suna, and say, "Keep up the good patriotism." That said he walk out the door to begin another journey one that would empower him even more…

"There was a kidnapping of Daiymo this person must be returned with little to no injury. This is to ensure that Suna keeps powerful allies. If Daiymo should be killed or severely injured our ties with these powerful allies will be severed. 

Now the kidnappers are in a squad of four. Each highly trained and have no qualms with killing you. Here are their names. Bg Buck  power house, Mean Morgan a medical puppet teer, Ezekiel unknown, and The Leader --- said to posses a time manipulation jutsu, but this is speculation. * - Fri Oct  9 18:10:33 2015

"Now Im assuming Tetsu is a Sand manipulator, so I want him to go for the Puppeter it will be swift, and I'll take Big Buck though he's powerful I dont expect him to be exteremely fast by the briefing. Now that leaves the other two terrorists. the leader Saddam and Ezekiel. They wil not surely just sit in wait. 

I hope you two are able to keep them at bay while we take out the weaklings first." With that said he would wait to see if Sanoke detected anything unbeknowst to his Byakugan. Whie they headed to the northern Outpost. * - Fri Oct  9 18:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) scouting the area, and the bruises looking fresh on the individual along the person Koji would step forward telling Sanoke to stay back. 

As he did this he would say, "This is a trap, but keep your guard up. watch the buildings within the village. Move slowly and with caution. Tetsumi can how are your defenses?"* - Fri Oct  9 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says, "My eyes are sure they have used these tactic before. Tetsu block off the individual running east, and be careful of innocents. Sanoke you follow up with Testumi." Noticing the large individual Koji noted him to be Big Buck. He would engage this man one on one, and catch up with his team.* - Fri Oct  9 19:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says, "I'm not looking to be in your league, but surpass it." Taking his with intense focus of his oppenet he would charge forward, and prepare to assault his enemy in the ways of Suna.* - Fri Oct  9 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: thank you sanoke. - Fri Oct  9 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seeing the figure rotate a succession of kicks with his own. Koji would follow up with rotation, while keeping the speed of of leaf worldwind. The release of this ninjutsu would throw back the indvidual with much force, and leave him scratched in various places if hit directly.* - Fri Oct  9 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would dodge this attack by jumping over the man, and landing behind him. Koji judging the attack to be powerful enough to have the man's arm be plugged into the dirt for a brief moment. Would open the first Gate.. Gate of Opening giving him 100% of his body's capabilities. Keeping his gentle fist stance Koji would unleash eight rapid thrust to the man's spine in his tenketsu. Causing a brief paralysis for his next finishing move. * - Fri Oct  9 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: The force of the Gentle Fist is mininal as it targets the tenketsu but fused with the gates causes severe damage  to both. Truly a threat. - Fri Oct  9 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) notcing the ground not slowing the man down would not back up, but instead rot rotate this process woud start as a surge repeling and tossing the arm from Koji. The man would lose his footing and form with this. As the force would be greater with the Gate of Opening active. With this force increase it would surely shred the skin even more!

As this happen Koji would charge the enemy as he was thrown back into the ground. * - Fri Oct  9 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would dodge these punches of fury making sure to not be grazed by the enemies hits. But as he did this he would attack a single arm in the process in the gentle fist art. Eight times he would strike the man's left arm, and would then rotate furiously. So furiously that he would knock the enemy back for sure. 

Upon his knock back the man would find his left shredded arm numb and dripping profusely.* - Fri Oct  9 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would take no mind to the words of the fighter. Kojiwould simply shred hs enemy at this point. As he was dissappointed in the way his opponet cared not for his body. With the man bleeding out it would be a matter of time before he passed out. But, he was worreid about the Daimyo, so he wanted to speed this up. 

Going in to attack the man's points with the man being proficient in boxing he wouldn't compete. He would dodge strikes, and go for the man's heart. If he interupted this motion Koji would swiftly switch limbs to attack with, and aim to the man's lungs. This would close those chakra points, and if attacked in the heart would cause a brief stroke due to the sheer force, and if the lungs sense of choking. 

Having the chakra surge from the body Koji was prepared for rotation if he failed to make any connection. (The surge was a techinque of the gentle fist allowing him to sense and react in a proper manner)* - Fri Oct  9 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be gripped, but with the tenketsu being hit would allow enough of a pause to allow Koji to activate his clan's jutsu which would be a surge of chakra expulging from his body. He would use the motion of the already started swing of th giant man to his advantage. This would unleash a more brutal rotation of his clan, and being this close in range would not only cause him to be blown back, but his abdominals cut severely. So much so, his body wouldn't be able to function. No matter the degeree of resistance of pain lest he wants his organs on the ground.* - Fri Oct  9 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) Taking the blunt force of the ninja would be beat unconcious. But, he knew with the man bleeding profusely it wouldn't take long for him to be done in.* - Fri Oct  9 21:24:16 2015

Looking over as he reached for the pill Koji would find one of his arm bandaged as well. Causing a flashback of the mad grappler (the mad grappler had an unbreakable grip, and wasn't expected to be that OP.), and with that memory Koji would down his medicine in an instance! 

Getting out bed and throwing on his gear that had been washed by the medical crew Koji would say, "I need to train, so that I don't get put in that predicament again." 

Now making his way out of the building Koji would find the square where he would begin some meditation. * - Sat Oct 10 15:52:44 2015
