As the binded man seemed to be unconscious, and Yan seemingly having him contained. Koji would witness something rather peculiar! The boy would be a mass of possible wierdness resembling Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This was bound to be a difficult time for the young Chief. Noticing that the woman from the battle seemed able to talk he would approach her for some answers. (It should be noted that Koji noticed the medic aide the man/boy, so he would let that business carry on before he messed with him.) 

Now position in the front lady, Koji would appear to have an atmosphere like water, so he wouldn't come as threatening or furious. Instead it would be a chill calm nature just picture water homie. However, his eyes would be absent of expression and he would have no smile due to the nature of the scene.

"Aza..Kiyoko..." He'd say as he let a freezing sigh of breathe. The anger could be felt as the word traveled through his throat. As this happened Koji activated Byakugan to scan the area for any possible threats or traps. He wouldn't have any officeers on him at the moment, but it could be noticed he wasn't chill Koji at the moment. 

<Even now she's pleading for his life. This makes things hard.>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) could hear the cries of his friend, and he would be getting more furious as they persisted. However, he ws thankful Yan was here before him to the area safe. Even Jiki, Marissa, and Mizora seemed to be doing there part, however the only question to beg for now is how this all got started. Koji would be staring through the wall making sure everything got handled safely, but he knew there was nothing really required as the Jounin seem to have everything handled, but the ninja was ready for anything to happen. Until the guy was subdued and confirmed unable to battle his guard would be up. 

Koji yell, "Don't kill him!." (It should be noted Koji saw Mizora continue her persuit and was baffled why she continued when Marrisa was handdling the situation rather well.) 
 However knowing the speed at which all this is happening the cry would come as, or at the moment of contact. This was still an order though. Some people may act like animals, but it was well known Sungakure handled things quite properly now under the Hassan Administration.

As a safety percaution Koji takes his stance in preparation for the unknowable. * - Tue Nov 10 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) sits in his desk and would say a few things, but would be over run with details. It would seem as though Mirai had her hands full today. Koji opens with an apology//

"I see we need to handle Mizora she has been a bit sporatic in nature as of late. I remember her being calm in nature, so I'm taken by suprise by her latest actions. I want to help her but her actions as of late has really frightened me. Already, Marissa is blaming us as a whole I'd hope to avoid such accusations. However, Marissa isn't innocent herself in her dealings as of late, and if she disrespected you, then she's disrespected the law and no one is above the law... As the law is the Kazekage in Sunagakure. Her rank means as much as the scorpion shit imprinted on my shinobi boot (Koji be aggitated by the irrationality expresseed by Marissa).

<Oh snap, be like water Koji.>.. Koji lets out a sigh//

"Excuse my tone and language, but in regard to all this I can't act unless I know the situation can you fill me in on the whole story on Mixora and Shira. And it seems the "Angyman" let loose again. He MUST be dealt with now he's causing more problems each day. In regard to the techniques you could call me an expert at it (Koji would've mastered that hoe yesterday but it got all official). Also when you get this move becareful with Marissa. She's no chump if that day comes, however, she seems to be the reasonable sort I hope we can discuss this like the proper humans we are." 

Koji twirls 360 degrees in his chair when he's done and waits for a response. I* - Thu Nov 12 04:41:36 2015

"Well we'll need to get Shira here judging by the story I think he may have left out his true intentions of being here. No one transforms into someone without cause and threaten people. He'll have to serve his time like everyone no one is above the law. Not even the Hokumas. Marissa can say what she wants but we don't discriminate that is why we hunted down Mizora. It was only by the grace of Sanoke she lives today, and for that I'm thankful." 

Koji nods the good man (Sanoke)//

"Now for Mizora why do you want to quit? It seems only your emotions are the cause of your actions that's something that can be controlled with reason. In school they taught us something from Plato, but you're free to believe what you want. He believed there was two parts of the soul reason and emotion. If you feed one you destroy the other try thinking before you act." 

Koji would spin three hundred and sixty degrees in his chair//

"I will speak to Hassan about the recent behavior of Marissa, but Hassan has forgiven Mizora. We can't have grudges we are all family here. If not that allies of Sunagakure."

Koji pauses//

"As for Katsune, Hassan is handling that personally. I feel he may have a bit of regret trusting her. But, if you do come across her don't handle her alone. Hassan told me her technique is similar to Trilliam's. For now lets handle Aza and Shira."
