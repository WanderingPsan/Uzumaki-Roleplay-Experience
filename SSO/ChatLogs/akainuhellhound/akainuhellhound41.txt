<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) Koji would create two shadow clones before him, and he would challenge them both. Ths was because their stats are halved his own and he's expecting that two will give him an equal fighting chance. Thus, a higher difficulty of training was evolved from this training. As Koji took his stance and activated his Dou-jutsu he would seek to combat both at the same time. As he needed to increase his speed of attack and nimblesness. Within seconds Koji would strike out at the clone placed at his right within the gentle fist. This attack would be position within the thorax. As Koji did this he would be struck in the back by the clone standing to the left. Koji wouldl feel the nudge of the gentle fist as it gently closed a tenketsu. * - Thu Dec 10 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) would continue this training for months unti perfected it would be grueling for his body, but he knew he must get faster in his strikes. It was necessary for him to also deliver more blows with that swiftness! Koji would be trading blows with both clones as he struck one in the bicept and lung. and another in the throat and pectorial. After which he'd slide a kick clockwise beneath him attempting to sweep the feet from under the clones, but would it succeed is the question. One clone would fall and the other would pereive the attack and gentle fist Koji on top of the shoulder. This forced Koji to shout out a bit as it was a surprising attack and well placed at that!* - Thu Dec 10 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) with the time passing would be pressing his training ever more, and being relentless in this endeavor as well. The clones woud be as they were as months before. Striking as Koji struck back Koji would show little improvement, but improvement nonetheless. There would be an opening during the bouts and Koji would find a huge striking opportunity. Allowing him to hit one clone three times! (Roll - 3) The hits would be located in the heart, lungs, and kidney. In a swift motion Koji would dodge the strike from the other clone and unite his strike with its body making contact with its liver (Roll1)! Four strikes had been made during the time, and Koji felt a little proud of himself. * - Thu Dec 10 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) shows no slack in his movement as he trains to be precise and wasteing no motion or time with whatever he executed. Koji was picking up pace at this point. Causing both his clone to be pushed back rather than him for the time being. Koji was for the first time in his long training starting to feel like the legendary piccolo. Koji dodges and slide through both the clone, but in this proces the ninja would give to powerful strikes toward the opposition to the abdomen area. This would be a swift process as he brings his arms back Koji would roll with his momentum and release a body blow toward one the clones dispersing it without fail. Leaving one clone to deal with at this time.* - Thu Dec 10 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) lining up the clone runs forth toward it. Koji would dodge both strikes and deliver multiple strikes toward the clone. And, then he would prepare himslef for the sttrikes back toward him. As Koji retracted himself he would be carried by his momentum and jump back dodging the blows of the clone. On the last strike by the clone Koji would implement his own attack toward the clone unleashing a fury of strikes causing the clone to disperse from the excessive damage taken during the battle. This was enough training for the time being Koji would rest up and begin again once recovered.* - Thu Dec 10 02:02:01 2015

***
After placing two seals upon the target.  This jutsu then causes that targets body to overheat from the inside and out over time per RP.  Causing them to slow down in speed depending on how strong the seal is made to be by the user if they have the proper traning ; eventually bringing them down to their knees if not handled by two serperate people who can take off the seal at the very same time.  If not then they will suffer immense internal heat as well as those who fail to remove it.  [If not removed this has potential to kill]

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: So, shall we get going then? - Thu Dec 10 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: After your visit to Konoha, Paine. Decide if it's possible if some of the shinobi there wish to participate as well. I'll keep record of their performance for their Kage. - Thu Dec 10 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Thu Dec 10 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) goes out to train once more, but even with the passage of time and growth that came with it... He still wsn't comfortable with his performance the shinobi needed to get faster and nimbler! With that in his mind Koji spawned two clones as he had done previously. He would activate his Byakugan channeling the chakra to his eyes, but it would be as he took his stance and this was to better articulate his strikes. Koji was serious about improving himself, so without hesitation Koji began. Charging forward in a quick and agile way Koji attempt to deliver multipe strikes on the clone. For the first clone he would deliver a blow to the pectorial, then to the abdomen region. These were quick strikes but they weren't quick enough to deliver more! Koji would take two shots the respective region as well. Coughing just a bit.* - Thu Dec 10 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be getting ambushed as he coughed as the second clone delivers a high kick to his face. This would throw the teen back into the distance, but he'd gather himself up quickly to begin again. Thinking to himself, 
("My clone would know my blindspot I. Not surprising I didn't see it coming.)
"Tch." Koji spits// 

Pressing forward in thr training regime Koji would appear to be getting the hang of this thing rather steadily, but he needed time that much was a given. As he moves to deliver a strike so do the clones challenging him. Matching him in his strikes together this would be a hassle for Koji. Not fighting against just himself, but two other ninja. It was a tale to be told. With fatigue pressed on his Koji would have dodged all their attacks adnd then some. As the training required that he not be touched so many times, because that would force the training to end. Koji would be standing as he watched the clones dissipate from the succession of hits he gathered on them.* - Thu Dec 10 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) takes a sip of water and replicates his clones he would now begin again after a period of rest. Prancing forward attempting to move faster beyond there sight Koji would strike, and this time he could feel the rush. It must be the muscle memory from the last bout, but even then Koji wasn't able to perceive such as he just lfowed into the motion like water. Striking major areas on the clone such as the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, stomach, and intestines! This would be a perfect succession of hits! The clone would have no choice but to cripple atter such contact, but it was over yet. As Koji was being rushed from the side by the other clone!* - Thu Dec 10 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be breaking all kinds of limits at this point as he perceiveed the incoming clone, and Koji would fluently attack the clone's attacking limbs being the left and right arms. This would at the same time knock the down allowing Koji to strike at the chest. Causing a blowback to the clone a total of three strikes on this particular clone! Koji would have received no damage at this point, and fatigue would not even have been scathed! As he was born with freakish almost monsterous stamina. The young shinobi gave hmself space as his clone gathered themselves for the next round. As they did this Koji thought to himself, 
"Come agile, fast and precise. That's what we have to be."* - Thu Dec 10 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) partaking in the rough tegime he set for hmself Koji would be close to resting poin, but not before eyeing down a new set of clones as he had dispelled the originals due to the longevity of their controntation. Koji wouldn't be a zombite in the mind but he was head strong in the task before him. As he thought of how this training will better suit his village. His thoughts were as followed,
(I need to be strong if I'm going to be a leader. Can't show weakness in front of a threat must be brave must be an example of Sunagakure's pride.) 
As he thought these thought Koji would be delivering rapid blows to his clones. There was more to the boy than geting stronger he had a family to protect a people he swore loyalty to, and if a possible a world to unite. Though, this wasn't his main objective it was thrusted upon him, nonetheless. And he didn't back from the challenge success or fail Koji was in it., and this point he had accepted it whole-heartedly.* - Thu Dec 10 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had done all he could at this pont but there was much needed progress still. However, the boy needed his rest as well so he went to recover and would begin again soon. For now rest and observance over the village was a must at the moment.* - Thu Dec 10 16:49:29 2015

"I have reports of rebellion in our walls. A small group of old men who are declaring I step down for their godess Ai. Try and be peaceful about it. They're just perverts. They reside in the slums.."* - Thu Dec 10 18:45:32 2015

However he only waves as he assumes she might want to go by a different name. Is this wrong to assume? It's not like they had any prior rreaction. But, Koji was well informed recently of her and wanted to meet her first hand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***KazeKage**(Akainu_Hellhound) shouldn't have been saying anything unknown, but who knows with a new body may come a new mind as well. However, if it wasn't known Zenaki did have a good way of getting information if needed. Koji was informed that in the past Zenaki had performed experiments on volunteer in the past. And, that sometimes these volunteer would vanish. 

However, the new woman before him seem to not really recall such. Koji was attempting to be private, but he would come out blatantly to stop alll th confusion. Because he just wanted to make a point to the woman before him. 

As the confusion was noted,
Koji would ask Abraxas where he was headed to, so he could be aware just in case Abraxas may need aide. 
"Abraxas where ya headed?" 
Best to tell him leaving without stating can result in exile.

Koji would follow up after this with the new Zenaki, 
"You were given permission to interrogate, yes? And to perform experiments on volunteers? This is what was told to me by Fujitora."* - Thu Dec 10 20:22:49 2015

"I apologize for the way people acted toward you the other day. I will make an announcement pardoning you of the slander. New regime. New face. But, in the future without a written report of these volunteers accepting treatment I will have to treat it as malpractice."
