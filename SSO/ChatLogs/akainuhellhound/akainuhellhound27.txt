<br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) kept his chill manner much like his element nature "water".as he spoke, "Well I don't know if I'm successful. It seems when I'm able to stop one thing another comes in it's place. Apart of me wants to stop it all, but I've seen death too many times. Death of the best as well (Koji's voice would lower on this sentence). My close friend was taken before my eyes, and that's really my drive to prevent others like that. Each one saved is worth a smile on my face." 

Koji didn't expect to save the world, but he seeked to save those he could. The ninja possessed wisdom beyond his age, but this was due to the upbringing and events he had to endure as a citizen of Sunagakure. As times were way worst than they would appear now a days. Koji may seem unscathed by the life of the shinobi, but he has simply learned to endure. He had the pleasure of having (Fujitora, Tethys, and Hassan as mentors.) - They made him strong.... * - Sun Nov  8 04:11:44 2015

Some will tell you not to fear it, but personaly... I think you should. Fear will keep you thinking and thinking will keep you alive. At least that;s what Hassan said." Just know even though you might not need it I'll be there for ya, If I can. Never do anything alone... never." 

When Koji spoke never he would be erasing the smiley face and draw a frowny face. His emotions correlated with his drawings rather well. Art and Philosophy really nudged on him it was like expression that didn't involve fighting, so he enjoyed it. Although this isn't to say he doesn't enjoy fighting, but fighting had become something different ever since going against criminals and bandits. * - Sun Nov  8 04:24:32 2015

He would look at Kiyoko "You're the heart of the village, and everyone like me he'd point to the limbs we'll do our part. As you do your part."

"You're allowed one object of your choosing, but you'll have to leave everything else behind Trilliam. Don't try anything sneaky remember with good behavior Hassan will decrease your sentence."

When Trilliam came out the building Koji would ask, "Are you going to lock up the shop?"  When Koji heard Ravenscrotum he would explain to Kiyoko, "Hassan named all the squads a while back and that was the name he picked for us. We wear it with pride it helps with relaxing Hassan."

Koji would then lead him to his cell. It would be nicer than most cells, because well Trilliam is the grandson of Lord Hassan, so he wouldn't sleep on a sand bed. 

"Trilliam we tried to make the place a bit more cofortable for you, because you're young. You'll still be able to go to school an officer will escort you there whenever it starts. You'll get 24hr visits as well from family members... Hey, don't blame anyone for this, and dont harbor any hate. This is a crappy situation and the one at fault is the one who broke in trying to steal and kill." 

Koji didn't want the young boy to be consumed by uneccesary hate. Trilliam does have a good heart for the country and Koiji knew it.

Koji would leave the his school books in the cell, but keep the scroll on his body for protection. He would also grit his teeth this wasn't something he had dealt with, so it was hard to form the words. He'd never arrested someone so close before... Koji would begin turning to leave the cell he'd grip the bars hard as he looked back, and said, 

"Are you ready Kiyoko?" These would be the moment Koji would seem ignorant in these kind of situations, and his emotions would show it too. It hurt him hard in the inside and that calm nature would seem to escape a little. * - Sun Nov  8 06:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...then why is he in jail...if he just needs help? - Sun Nov  8 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) lets out a sigh and leans a bit// 
"He had a teacher but she defected, so now another relative Jiki is helping him with his mind. I don't know exactly whats wrong, but it causes sporatic actions by him at times. Hassan also put him here for protection... Someone was reported looking for vegeance."

While Koji spoke he would be rubbing his forehead from side to side.

 "The overall situation was bad, and Trilliam shouldn't have been in the situation at all. But we were caught by surprise, and yeah things were just really..really bad. If you want to forma judgement of your own I can show you the official report. Although, it's pretty graphic in nature.." * - Sun Nov  8 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says, "No, for the most part he minds his own business. However, there was an intruder that you probably heard about recently. Of course, he was reported as a mad-man running loose. A few shinobi apprehended including myself, and Trilliam was there as well by chance. Trilliam detonated his jutsu without thinking, and failed to not only kill the intruder... But, killed a fellow shinobi in the process.." 

Koji was leaving out details but this was because he wasn't looking right at the report at the time. * - Sun Nov  8 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That was my argument.. But, the anger of another wanted more to be done. - Sun Nov  8 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) face would be blank expression because he couldn't smile at this time// 

"Personally, that's why I think Hassan allowed for him to continue his social activities. Also here, he won't be attacked. I'll more than likely be spending more time here than usual to watch over Trilliam. The worst thing to happen from this is he decides never to help people again, or worst decides to hurt people instead." * - Sun Nov  8 07:28:00 2015

"I'm sorry! I didn't mean to embarress you! I figured you two were well acquainted, so I didn't mind at all helping out."

Koji would notice her turn red and hug herself, and he would feel bad cause he didn't know what he did exactly. But he would notice her rush pass him, and would quickly say, 
"If I didn't offend you too much you don't mind if I follow? You're really the first friend I've had made that didn't come from battle."  
* - Sun Nov  8 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would in fact be too young to know exactly what she meant, so he would see the speed of the hand coming and stop the impact. He didn't want to see Kiyoko smack herself. After which he'd say, 

"Well see your friend, Lera is really nice she was in my squad for a short time."* - Sun Nov  8 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would again apologize//

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) remains sitting he doesn't want Kiyoko to feel out of place or scared// 

He wwould say, "She was a bit moved by Trilliam being placed with some of the gruesome figures in the prison. It's understandable if it's all just hitting her now I mean this place wrecks of ill-intent. You should let her breathe Sanoke she's a new shinobi as well. She just enlisted from the hospital. I more than likely showed her too much.. I'm sorry."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) is all kinds of confused now but he figured it'll  be something he'd understand with time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would awaken// 

Koji heads back home to do the humanly natural deed of the day, and clean his teeth and body. He would then head out to complete his duties.* - Sun Nov  8 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would pull out his report sheet and begin to write// "It should be noted all of this was written in his office."

The first was Titled "Intrusion of the Gezo"  and it read as followed, 

"Accounts of the events:
Once the battle had begun, Macbeth would've been pinned within the bathroom, but he would not have been there long. Possessing tremendous speed, and a weapon that altered physics he struck a blow to Jiki Tetsumi. This immediately caused him to transform, and evacuate the building. He would go to prevent an escape, and would require large sand to do so... Moments before Jiki's preparations Izutora would be slashed in the torso area viscously along with his ankle this would knock him out of the fight. 

Fujitora (clone) would enter the fray (setting a barrier as he spoke to us), and as he passed by he would hand Trilliam and Koji kunais tagged with Overheat Seals. Fuji would also ask Trilliam for a scroll, this scroll of Trilliam contained an abundance of spiders. This would be released as Fuji entered the bathroom with Kuro. 

After these events Kuro would explain to us that he's a Necromancer. Kuro's chakra would then use a technique that seem to do more than seal regular chakra. He became the immediate target for Macbeth. As Macbeth took him out with his speed, Macbeth would swiftly take out the clones of Fuji that inhabited the bathroom, and evade the spiders. This would leave the final clone in the hallway. 

Those who stood in the hallway were - Koji, Trilliam, Tondou, and Clone Fujitora at this point// 

Upon exiting the bathroom, Macbeth would spot the clone, and rush it but Fujitoara would rush him as well in an attempt to do a whole body seal. It would fail and the clone would poof, but it would be this time that Trilliam shot out a creation. He wouldn't ignite them just yet as Fujitora was in range, so they would only be sliced by the intruder Macbeth. Thus, releasing his lightning nature chakra. It would zip out (As Trilliam saw this happened he retreated into the ground), but Tondou would capitilize this moment and use his chakrams to surround Macbeth in a jungle gym electric fence. 

Durin this time Ketsuki would enter a bit disoriented from an early encounter with the Intruder. Macbeth would throw his blades through two points of the chakram, and this would disrupt the flow, but his movement would be stopped by Ketsuki. As she placed a genjutsu on the intruder. Koji would capitalize on this by throwing two overheat seals on Macbeth. This would break the genjutsu, but leave the man in a death-like state unable to move or react. 

There would be an altercation swiftly after as Kuro began defending the life of the intruder from execution. A small scirmmage would break out between Jiki and Fujitora versus Kuro. It would be disrupted by a spontaneous explosion, and afterward Macbeth would be executed by the Jiki and Fujitora. (It should be noted that Ketsuki was killed in this explosion.) "

Once done Koji would pull out another scroll and begin to write and again// 
This would be titled, "The Capture of Mizora Hokuma" and read as followed, 

"Background Story:
Once Yan and Koji made it to Konoha they would be greeted at a giant mansion. Yan would note there is a secret passage there, but Koji wouldd see no bodies inside. Yan would inform them that harboring a rogue is retaliation, and breaking the alliance made with the village of Sunagakure. (It should be noted they denied ever seeing a woman of Mizora's nature or stature. And their speech contradicted itself.) 

The two Sunagakure ninja would then find themselves in Kiri where they would instantly be given information about Mizora. This would entail their trip back to Sunagakure tto report the crimes of Konoha. However there report would be impeded as Marissa was engaging Mizora at the entrance of Sunagakure. (It should be noted it was rather convienet for Mizora to turn herself in after Yan and Koji visited Konoha. It's highly unlikely the woman wasn't at Konoha.) 

As Yan, Kana, and Koji stepped from the caravan Marissa showed disregard for their body. As she begun forming seals without hesitation and performed a deadly wind technique directed for all four bodies. Yan's quick thinking would allow for everyone to be safe as he erected a wall. The battle would rage on and Mizora would be heavily injured, but wouldn't be killed as Marissa was subdued by Sanoke. 

All present would be brought to the office of Hassan where they discussed many things in detail. About the sacrifices Sanoke would make for the life of Mizora. Sanoke would sware himself to become a Gezo Private and protect Sunagakure with his life." 

Koji would wrap these scroll make copies and seal them with the Sunagakure Insignia. * - Sun Nov  8 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would come from his office as he had just completed the two biggest assignments of report to date. It would entail great approval rating to the Hassan Administration as it held no bias in sentencing kin.// 

The same would be told for the Police Force "Desert Owl", as it upheld the law wholefully without fail in returning the rogue. The city would be in a brighter mood for awhile as they witnessed the Hassan regimestay true to its law.// 

Koji passes through the barracks as he makes his way to the Kazekage's office. It should be known Fighting is now prohibited throughout the barracks and is punishable by death or loss of limb by the Kazekage 0.0. * - Sun Nov  8 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Koji. I need to speak to you, if you would? - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: No problem. In private? - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) nods and would follow his friend//* - Sun Nov  8 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had just finished his report and arm was kind of aching from writing, so he would order something he could eat with his bare hands. He just didn't feel like using utensils anymore// 

"Hey could I get some fried Unagi Rolls, and tea?" This would be said as the waiter came up. 

"Hmm? A request? Well I'm always up for helping my friend. Is it about Kiyoko she brought you up and fell ill. I think she really misses you. I offered her a passport, but she refused haha."

When described her as ill he was unfamiliar with anyone turning red and huggin themselves at the response of a name, and having shortness of breathe. It was all new to him from social stand point. * - Sun Nov  8 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Er....actually. About Kiyoko, well. That seems to have progressed to...a bigger stage I guess. - Sun Nov  8 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But no, my request is work related. - Sun Nov  8 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) took a bite of the ol Fried Unagi Roll whole. It was small so it wasn't anything obnoxious or crazy. After swallowing he'd say, 

"Hmm, I have no qualms with that, however, I'll need to leave someone to watch over Trilliam as he's in jail at the moment. What are the details specifically?"* - Sun Nov  8 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats just it. I don't know the details. - Sun Nov  8 20:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You were my first pick...i've also asked Sanoke and Kuro. Though neither can do it. - Sun Nov  8 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Odd. Sanoke is usually up for adventure, but I know he has a serious ordeal coming. - Sun Nov  8 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Kuro would never be up for anything of that nature. - Sun Nov  8 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well, I'm honored to help you Lera. I wouldn't want a friend doing that kind of stuff alone anyway. - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh Sanoke was up for it, but father told him he was too busy to take it up. - Sun Nov  8 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And thank you. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll speak to my father once we have a third. - Sun Nov  8 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, Lord Hassan sure is considerate. Have any ideas for a third? - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you have any reccomendations. - Sun Nov  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would be cut off as he spoke, and laugh a little bit//

"Seems we have the same thought process haha, are you familiar with Yan? He is very talented in earth and water elements, and has small summoning practice." * - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm familiar with Yan yes. - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In fact...I was going to teach him something later... - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose we could go with Yan...though I was under the impression that he was busy with other duties. - Sun Nov  8 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Ohh! Well you might want to bring it up. Nahh Yan ain't doing nothing but smoking all day.. Let him know his immigration duties are piling up. He has papers ddue. - Sun Nov  8 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. You, me and Yan then. - Sun Nov  8 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have finished his meal and slipt a good ol' Chief of Police tip into the waiters pocket all casual like he covered for his homie too. 

"Hmm, Imagine he didn't say when he would likeus to leave either, yet. We were going to have a party next week." Koji sighs//  "Well, it seems like business is settled would you lke to sit and chat, or head back out?" 

Koji had a demeanor much like his element "water", so he'd usually come off as chiill and mellow in his nature and speech. He would also be practicing his smile, because he doesn't like the label White-Eyed Devil. (This was given because his eyes are just blank and expressionless due to his genes.)* - Sun Nov  8 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll head back out, I guess I need to talk to Yan as well. - Sun Nov  8 20:30:30 2015

"I specialize in tai-jutsu , sensory, and little nin-jutsu, so being close won't necessarily always be a necessity (Koji looks to Ai knowing her skill-set). As I know the abilities of Ai she'll more than likely be comfortable being in the distance, but I'm a bit confused on your abilities (Koji doesn't know Ryutaro's name so he looks toward him).

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Akainu_Hellhound) wuld test the speaker system and it would appear to work rather well. With that the agent would strap on the gear and head out Sunagakure quickly// 

The three members making their way to Kumogakure would strategize a plan in order to kill the revoluntionist and his bodyguards. Looking at the information given to them the agent would pass around the desciption of the man causing an ursup. The information would read as follows, 

"Steel Toe Joe is a master at Tai-Jutsu and Nin-jutsu, he apparently has an ability that allows him to control his tenketsu at will. So, High alert when opposing the target. Steel Toe Joe has paid merenaries to protect him and they're expected to be B rank bingo book shinobis from various villages." 

As everyone took a nice look and read the information it would be agreed that the target would be taken out from the distance. Koji would act as bait, but would first give the numbers before approaching directy. 

After traveling covertly and out of the eyes of people the squad of Anbu would arrive in Kumogakure by nightfall. This wouldn't effect Koji's ability of sight at all as he activated his byakugan Koji would say, 

"There's three body guards... One at the door and two outside the room of Steel Toe Joe. The house has one entrance and the one guard is guarding it. They're working in shifts it seems. No sign of radio communication use, or heavy chakra usage in any of their head to think of other uses to communicate. Also there are lanterns being used as a light source, and the house is for the most part wooden. How shall we approach?" 

The one anbu and the rest would sit at a distance out of sight of the enemy, and from public eye. It was a high point possibly trees or a neighboring cliff or something else logical. This agent watched like a true Owl. * - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Akainu_Hellhound) sees all three guards are taken out this, and this was his time to act. Knowing the information on the target he knew one thing the target would be a bit faster than himself to react, so he set a trap for Steel Toe Joe. Koji knock over a lantern and delibrately stood infront of the door. Steel Toe Joe would come out yelling, "Hey that stuff ai--!" 

A small fire would begint to spread rapidly, and as the man realized it wasn't his body guard it would be too late. Steel Toe Joe would have stepped into Koji's eight-trigram circle. This would stick his tanto in the mans mouth and unleash 64 strikes to the man's main organs (Heart, Kidney, and Lungs). Though his points would be closed momentarily his organs would be devastated. Once, this was completed Koji would speak through his mike to Ai//

"Are you able to finish off? The target is immobilized." If the reply was positive Koji would head to knock over the rest of the lanterns and leave the premises. No one would have heard a thing during the tussle as the genlt fist was a silent and elegant practice. If the reply was negative Koji would set another dose of palms to the man, but this would be lethal. (The house would be set to blaze afterward regardless, and this was to prevent anyone from asking question.) 

It would appear as a common fire with casualties. An accident....* - Mon Nov  9 04:47:08 2015
