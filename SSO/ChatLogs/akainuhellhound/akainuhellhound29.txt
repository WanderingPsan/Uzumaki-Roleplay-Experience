Over hearing Mirai's remark he'd think <Slacking? I guess handling the  quarrels and perils of the city by myself is slacking..>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Akainu_Hellhound) would channel the chakra to his eyes as Ai spoke, thus activating the Byakugan. This would give him the ability to see through solid objects and take a look into not allow the village, but chakra based objects as well! Explosives, Genjutsus, and hidden people would be detected without fail.

"Hmm, what are we looking for exactly? Hassan usually like unit numbers and abilities of that unit." 

Kjoji would speak throught the mic to where only individuals sharing the mic could hear such words spoken. He would also be in a tree near the gate as well, but Koji being outside the village would only have so much to gather and he would spot no souls near them at the moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Akainu_Hellhound) would perceive the appropriate one hundred and five block radius, and he would detect any chakra based substance. He would also peer through solid objects during this time and unveil that which hides within. There would be nothing to escape this sight as he peered forward. This was a gift granted to him by his dou-jutsu.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) scratches his head//

"I see, so she tried to arrest without a reason? That's hard to believe considering her nature. But, she tried to attack Ivel that is a bit rough when he's contrained. What's the whole story?" 

Koji was seeking to understand the entire situation. Being an offier has taught him many people will talk in favor of their position, so he had to hear out everything before giving an answer. However, he had a sense of trust with Izanami. * - Sat Nov 21 03:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) orders fried Unagi Don after devouring whatever Flan was, and relax in his seat. He wouldn't be stressed as he had the longest, most revitalizing nap ever! His eyes and body, heck his energy of calmness could be felt as he spoke. It would be like water was in the atmosphere, but not a in a drowning sense. Rather a submersive hot tub chill conversation. 

(This effect was created by the fire spitting from Iza and the watery chillness of Koij.) 

"Misunderstandings are a misfortune and it seems everyone was intending to do a good, but sometimes intentions aren't always expressed too well in circumstances such as these. 

Koji would pause as he noticed Mirai and Sanoke enter. He'd throw a wave his hand would move as smooth as water pressing against the beach side sediment. He would follow through the conversation after this act//

"Shira has been a handful lately I admit and I had already planned to put him in jail after I found out he was impersonating Jiki. Hopefully I can figure out his intentions before it's too late. Want to apologize to Jiki so he won't be upset well... more upset... Ivel trying to split them up was wise, but fire is more threatening so I can understand the concern, but what cause them to try and arrsest you?" 

Koji knew an arrest shouldn't be made until all evidence were evident, or a true threat was apparent. From the conversation it does seem Mirai may have misread the situation, but that's not her fault. It's her job to keep the peace of Sungakure. Ivel spitting fire can be seen as obstructing the peace. 

Koji could be seen with a calm expressionless look on his face, but his concern would be shown through his questions. 

"Also you weren't hurt through all this were you??? Hmm I'm slacking on my homework..." * - Sat Nov 21 03:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) listening to the conversation would take this all in, and it would soon turn in a circle of "this and that", and though Koji enjoyed 360 degree performances.... This wasn't the time for such performances. Koji would wave to the waiter to wait on delivering the Fried Unagi Don//
"Shira, attacked a person with a bottle he violated a law so his detainment is necessary and just. Ivel used a flame attack with disregard of his surrounding, and that is cause for probation at the least. Trilliam was imprisoned for having disregard of his surroundings, and that was a decision made by Lord Hassan. Hearing this Mirai acted justly even though she may have been upset." 

Koji breathes out//

 "Iza we've been through alot, and I don't look down on anyone. I respect all that desrve my respect. I don't see you as a child because we have a our past together, but no one is above the law. And Desert Owl enforces the law rightfully. Hassan proved tis by sentencing Trilliam n oone gets special treatment when lives are at stakes. As shinobis you are held as adults and soldiers of Sunagakure, and are expected to be a symbol. If shinobi don't respect or trust our enforement that will cause chaos." 

Koji was trying to find a point of trust between the Shinobi he had felt was a good friend. Though, they never really chill. They be like kindred spirits with their shared past. * - Sat Nov 21 04:07:02 2015

"I report to Hassan and reports are unbiased, and that's why I'm encharge and why Hassan passes his fair judgement over the accused. I was informed by Izanami, Sanoke, and Mirai. You used a technique with disregard of your surroundings. Putting in danger a lot of innocents and my family. We can't have that image of our shinobi let alone our shinobi. Once you're able to show respect for the hierarchy of the village's law we can talk about your position." 

Normally Koji would place someone misusing their ability in jail for a day, but he was informed Lord Hassan dealt with Ivel personally or at the very least the situation. 

Koji's words flowed like water, but not with the force of a tsunami more like the ocean in the absence of wind. There was a serene presence in his voice. Though water could erupt without notice if one couldn't read the tides. 
Koji would hear Mirai about training and ask,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) stares at the prodigy Mirai and in an encouraging tone he'd say, 

"Stand next to me and take your stance." - A dramatic anime pause// 

"It's time Mirai follow my movements." 

Koji would channel the chakra to his eyes with thus activating his Byakugan, then he would tak his stance. Within this stance Koji would begin to explain the set parameters of the Eight Tri-gram circle, and he'd inform her anything within this will be savagedly wrecked with great control, of course.

(The eight trigram wouldn't be anyhing foreign to Mirai, but Koji wanted to reitterate because he like to make water references.)

"Flow like water with your strikes and make the contact potent as you feel the chakra flow through you. This should be easy I've seen your prowess as a shinobi Mirai. Deliver it precisely..... But not on me homie..." 

Koji doesn't want to feel that mess.* - Sat Nov 21 06:56:51 2015
