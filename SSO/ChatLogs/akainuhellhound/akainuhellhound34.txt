<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would smile at Tsuki's respons about his muscles, because he didn't know his muscles were an admirable size. 
"You're too sweet my Tsuki but I have to get going we'll hangout when I get back."  

As Koji glanced down at the desciption given to him the scrol would read, 
"High ranking threat! Stinky Breathe Funk Joe is a master in Fuuton Ninjutsu. His speed is incredible and jutsu even more incredible! Be wary! Don't let his size distract you.

This man was clever after all and sneaky as he was Sabotaging Sanoke's stuff. His speed and size made him elusive by nature, but the area would stink in areas of his presence, thus making him a trail to find him not difficult to find. However, it's his breathe that is his greatest weapon as this is where he released his wind." 

Koji sharing the information with his partner would say, 
"If you've gotten a good read follow me."* - Wed Dec  2 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What's so special about his eyes? - Wed Dec  2 04:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That's nasty. - Wed Dec  2 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would activate his dou-jutsu and seek out the Stinky Breathe Funk Joe. It would be in an instant that the chakra would be channeed to Koji's eyes. Probably just as fast as a blink. Having many things in view Koji would following the potent smell that lingered in the area this point, but as Koji grabbed such a sense that everyone would surely smell. He'd use his Bbyakugan to search for the culprit. 

Of course, Mitsurana would be right by his side as they tracked as they move Koji would inform the girl of the entire area, so that she wouldn't be surprised by any unexpected attack. * - Wed Dec  2 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) had continously scanned the area as they followed the trail, and he would informed Mitsunara even she hd noticed on her own that the midget was near. His breathe was beyond potent if tic tacs were in drect contact with his mouth... it'd most likely dissolve! 

"He's quite the paranoid type he seemed to sense us coming. Not odd seeing as he's a master Fuuton user. I'm sure he's going to want to keep his raa--."

Before Koji could finish his sentence a giant boom would be heard behind the building in which Stanky Breathe Funk Joe was dwelling. The man would be like a tick as he hopped in the distance. 

"Alright, he's content on keeping his distance, and at the moment he seems to be gathering his chakra for an attack. Seeing as he's standing directly behind the house I assume he's attempting to bombard us with the wind and house debris. It'll be a hassle getting close to him, mmm." 

Koji prompted with enough time to act, but Koji has always struggled against wind users specifically with Marissa and Hassan.  * - Wed Dec  2 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) noticing the chakra beng similar to Hassan's wind bullet Koji would dodge as best he could taking grazes to the face and leg. However, there would be a twist the stank of the man's breathe caused a choking sensation. (Imagine mustard gas, but less lethal than such.) This was quite the defense for such as this caused Koji's eyes to tear a bit impeding his vision a bit. DUN DUN DUNNN* 

Now Koji had took the order of Mitsunara and ran the opposite direction, but they would be approaching at the same time unless her speed was greater. This would be a blitz Koji would aide Mitsunara by coming close to her and Unleashing an Air Palm to dispell the incoming bullets, thus blowing away the dazing breathe effect as well. (t should be noted that Koji is dodgeing in succession on a diagnol path while moving forward. Gaining scratches along the way and even a few blunt hits to his legs. This was due to his vision being impaired a bit. )

"Go, my eyes are a bit hazy at the moment this would get you close. Remember capture." Koji says this after clearing the way, but he would be moving with her as he runs a bit dazed his hands would form a cross. What is the ninja planning?

Meanwhile, Stanky Joe would see that the team would be approaching through his wind bullets and would put together hand seals quickly, thus in succession he'd send a blast from his mouth!* - Wed Dec  2 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have missed the hand seal of Stank Joe during the barrage of wind bullets, but the Stinky Joe would have been a wind clone, thus the success of Mitsunara strike caused a burst of wind to explode in her face. But, this would be regular wind, so she would only be blown back after her strike.

Koji gathering himself would make made his shadow clone, and as he Koji and his clone ran forward he would say, 

"Stanky Joe has done his homewrok. He was out range of my vision thus only revealing one body in the vicinity. Clever no wonder Sanoke was having an issue capturing the criminal. Regardless, he's in my sight now and he's making a be line." 
(He wouldn't be hiding his presence at this point for some odd reason. The prankster began to shout, "SMELL THIS!" Thus, releasing a powerful stinky breathe. It seems the prankster is gettting all the fun he can in.)

If one could see the Stanky man would be hopping away, but he would be gliding thorugh the air. It would seem as if he was flying but that's just due to the longivity of air time. Koji hated chasing so this was now becoming a hassle, but he was told not to harm the individual. * - Wed Dec  2 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) seconds the emotion of Mitsunara//

The prankster would have gotten bored jumping around, and went into the crownd barfing his breathe in the common area of the slums attempting to capittalize in the panic of the crowd. 

With the team in hot pursuit of the individual Koji would say watch your feet he's short and he's channeling chakra. The three foot infdividual would have shouted, 

"You guys are good but I dont't think you're good enough to catch me!" 

Koji would have taken an indirect route moving swifty he would also use the crowd to his advantage. leaving Mitsunara with the clone. Because clearly a frontal approach wasn't working. 

Koji clone attempts to distract the individual// 
"You're under arrest give up Stanky Joe and pay for your crimes against sanitation and Sunagakure!" * - Wed Dec  2 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) 's remark, "She's right this is a waste of your skills. I hope you can think about that in prison."

Stank Joe, "Tch. You don't know my story." The stubby and flea like human was just not in the mood for conversation, and had actually been kneading his jutsu within for some kind of move, but he wouldn't be able to notice the swift movements of the skilled ninjas concealing themselve within the area. Koji equips a facemask to limit the stinch and channels his chakra for his own attack. Koji's clone already having alerted the group of the channeling chakra would force an Air Palm to compete with whatever attack is thrown their way. However, this was to keep the man focused the clones. Not the originals. 

Original Koji making it in range shoots out a Syurp Trap thus immobilizing the individual. This would occur during the impact of the jutsus by the clone and Stanky Joe. So, Koji's clone would more than likely disperse due to a direct hit.* - Wed Dec  2 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) notices the noble act would make it known he appreciates her act. As that shows greatly on her character.

Stanke Joe, "WOAH, WOAH!!! I give I haven't taken anyone's life no need to take mine... That's the law around here. I'm sorry for my actions... How about you let me go free huh?" 

Koji's original clone would say, "Nah you hav time to pay for your actions. Koji calls Desert Owl Agents to commence the sealing process and deliver the man to the cells. After this Koji would say, 
"Hey, nce job out there.. Lets go turn this mission in."* - Wed Dec  2 06:59:50 2015

After which he would shower cleaning the wounds sustained in battle (he would sit for awhile before returning applying pressure to his wounds to allow them to stop profuse bleeding and such. He would then wrap proper areas. He learned this in First AIde class.) and washes his dreads. Thus cleansing himself of the Stinch of Stanky Breathe Funk Joe. Following this Koji puts on his regular clothes and returns to the side of Tsuki.
