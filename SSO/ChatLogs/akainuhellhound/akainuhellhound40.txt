<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) takes it all in although his rep sheet wasn't that impressive he looks back on the things he's been engaged in. Surviving two encounters with Edge, and one with Zetsumo during their refuge in Kiri. (t should be noted that it was the time in Kiri Koji felt more of a outsider. Not just because of his heritage, but of being of a different villae as well. The other shinobi forsaked his life and words, but this fueled him in his endeavor to become better.) Being the survivor of a purge and of war Koj's struggles woudn't end upon taking back Sunagakure with his teacher Fuji, Hassan, and Flexus, Izanami, and late roommate Yan. For Erebus would have the young Flexus killed who Koji held as his dear friend. Two years would have passed since that time. Gving Koji grief to overcome and that he did whole heartedly. This gave him the power to see the villagers of Sunagakure as more than fellow patriots, but family as well this would be concreted by the attack of Edge. The final attack I should say unless he be edo'ed....

Koji bows his head and ponders his thoughts as the vote goes on, (Am I ready Lord? I'll do my best I haven't faltered yet.)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) takes a seat at the kazekage seat, and thinks to himself this is something he never expected. Not at his age and not this soon in his lifetime, and he knew the struggle was going to be real. However, he wouldn't falter so easily to the unknown. As Koji continues to ponder the young KazeKage lets out a deep sigh and turns on the intercom system of Sunagakure. 

"Hello, my mothers and fathers of Sunagakure. I say to YOU thank YOU for I am a byproduct of your love and care. Without YOU I wouldn't be what I am today that much is true. And to my brothers and sisters I thank YOU for taking up arms with me to protect those who couldn't during times of perils. I hope to see that same compassion during my regime, and if I don't live that long. I hope to see it live on pass my death. Each and every one of YOU carry the priceless grain that makes up OUR village. As you keep that in mind know that I cherish YOU all just as much as my own blood. 

And to the vassals of Sunagakure, I hope we can reach peaceful terms of agreements because we are of the same nation and that makes us family as well.Lets keep the peace and lose the blood. Let us work as a productive unit. Rather than disfunctional units. Let us strive for something greater self interest. Let us strive for a humanity interest. 

Now to the world, I put my life forward not just for my people, but YOU people as well. Our veins run with with something sacred and that is blood. I wish not to shed it, nor to have mine, or my people's shed. But I will defend fight if I must. In times of struggle let us seek Diplomacy not War. We are not beast chained to carnal needs. We can do Better, so I leave you with the ninja way of my late friend Flexus. 
Do Better."

Koji understood that there is always two sides of the story during confrontations, so it's never cool to decide on just one end. Sadly a lot of things were a bit unsettling in the land of Suna at the moment, and Koji couldn't endanger his family at the moment. Nor, could he leave a tired traveling group to the forces f the unforgiving world.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) heard the voice of Kiyoko and Mitsunara quite clear, and Kiyoko has stressed the issue of Zenaki quite passionately. This is why Koji allowed the 3 days of rest, because it was fair for outsiders who appear to be beaten and ragged from a fight. (Or a the very least confessed to a fight. Is enough to cause wearyness.) 

"Kiyoko I'm working on that issue, but I can't watch outsiders as well. I'm going to tackle our issue first and foremost and I cannot do that whole-heartedly if I'm distracted by suspicous outsiders. Three days is fair time to rest... In the meantime." 

Koji turning his attention to Mitsunara, 
"This is more than religion I want my people safe and if a wandering group comes in that has a threatening story as such. I must take into consideration there was an alternate tale. But, I'll see you inside sister."

Koji then turns to Bryson. 
"Bryson I know you're rowdied up on your senses but that can't be the main factor of judgements. I understand your conviction but try and see how this looks to the people. We have to be fair and just."

Ever so slightly he felt a sense of vigor running through him although he wasn't quite sure what it was. Fear? Anxiety? Pride? Honor? All he really knew for sure is that he wanted to chill and keep the peace. The position wasn't really on the agenda, but it sure put itself there. 

The now 15 year old Shinobi had to earn the trust of the village if he hadn't already, but judging by the vote he had earned it, but Ai just as well had earned it. So, it wasn't as if he felt if he did a terrible job they didn't have a back up, however, these thoughts laid dorment in the boy. As he knew second guessing never solved anything. He had given his annoucement and was quite stiff and assure of the words he spoke. 

Koji hears the words of the homie Hiroshi, 
"Yo!" But as he said this Mitsunara came through all bandaged.
