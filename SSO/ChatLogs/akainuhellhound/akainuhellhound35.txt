Koji would imitate the chakra flow within his own body. His chakra would fluctuate until he felt the right amount of pressure fluctuate through his body. In a moment's time he'd feel it and say quietly in his mind I have it. However Koji wanted to create a memory for it so he ended the concentration. 

Preparing himself once more Koji drowns himself within the details of the scroll. Creating the flow of chakra throughout his body. Koji thinks, (This is rather simple, No wonder Sanoke prances around with it all cool like.) This technique makes me feel more like the wind than water haha. Koji in an instant would shunshin!

Koji would take it slow by using a Kamehameha stance to direct the chakra into his palm. (This be the Goku Roshi moment.) After which he would continue the flow all the way into the release targeting the vitals of the clone from within.

"As I take this form I envision that my chakra is a ball in my hand and I'm holding it. Normally this would be nothing but with the aide of the Byakugan it's deadly." 

As Koji started talking he took his stance once more, and as he finisheed he struck the second clone. Of course when you come to master it you'll be able to release without the aide your second hand.* - Wed Dec  2 09:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't think I'm actually popular. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And it has been a while. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Enough time to teach something new haha. If ya want. - Thu Dec  3 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Um, sure. - Thu Dec  3 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh. I purchased one from Marco. He's over there. - Thu Dec  3 04:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would have a pretty big smile as he sees his cousin before him. 

"Alright, we'll go to the spot where we trained together last time."* - Thu Dec  3 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) takes a kamehameha stance, and develops chakra between his palms. Being fluent in his motion he'd say as his arms begin to cock back fully, 

"I use to hands in the beginning to help capture not only the chakra, but the air as well. Now I can use one hand but I find it easier to learn when performing this technique in this way. As the magnitude of it is pretty poweful. Best to step aside Kuro-san." 

As Koji finished the pressure would be complete. If Kuro were to scan Koji he'd see the flow of chakra flow to his palms. Once Kuro moved from in front of Koji. Koji himself would unleash the Air Palm toward the high standing rock. Upon impact a burst of air would run burst through the air. Forcing hair to rise and dirt to fly. After which Koji would say, 

"This attack is made to attack the vitals of a person. Causing them to be incompacitated. Thus, removing the ability fight back and hopefully will as well. Also it's a safer way than always running close up to danger. I would like to teach you this, In time I hope to also have another version of the 64 palms techniwue. I'm thinking Protecting sixty-four palm. Might prove more formidable than rotation haha." * - Thu Dec  3 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mhm, the idea came to me when I was talking to my little sister. She's not a fighter so I wanted to invent something that would help her. But, not only her you as well. I understand fighting isn't your first option. - Thu Dec  3 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: But lets see you do the Air Palm. The best part is it's sneaky haha. - Thu Dec  3 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) smiles a bit// 
"Haha, don't think anything of it. This is what a family does for one another." 

Seeing the focused Kuro he'd say, 
"I wouldn't say shape per se but envision an arrow. This is a burst but an overwhelming precise burst... Matter of fact if that's difficult to understand release as is. If anything seek to control your chakra but not shape it." * - Thu Dec  3 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) feels the wind brush across him and states, 
"That's some force there haha.. I'm sure it'll be rare if ever I'll see ya use that. But, I have a sense I could make this defensive... Like a wall."* - Thu Dec  3 05:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Mm possibly. I'll need to put more thought into it. - Thu Dec  3 05:41:45 2015

Koji would wait to hear Tsujki's approval of the name. As he waits he thinks to himself as well.

"No the original teams haha. Thought it was clear haha. I want to give Hiroshi the full experience. Although you're skillfull so it might be less than the full experience." 

With that said Koji would get to it, as he allowed everyone to take their respective positions and comfortability. Koji would channel the chakra to his eyes and take his stance. He'd stare into the direction of the opposition of course. Perceiving much of the area within the arena like chakra levels and chakra distortions, traps, and anything hidden. One could see the excitement on Koji's face because this would clearly be a close distance battle which isn't normally blessed to Koji. He had once fought a sword user in the Private Exams... Could have ended horirbly. (Can you imagine a one arm Hyuuga? the reject..)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) would attempt to measure the reaction and speed of the skillfull Mitsunara. If successful during his charge Koji would appear to be attacking with his fist, but upon closing the distance between the two Koji would unleash a swift rotations.This would be an explosion of chakra from his body, and thus Koji's body would follow its circulation respectively. If successful this would have blown back Mitsunara into the ground. 

Afte the said impact Koji would form a cross his fingers immediately perceived as this (+). What would come next hmm? What is he thinking in that mind of his? Will it work? Is it quick enough?* - Fri Dec  4 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) wouldn't make a powerful connection to the woman as he hoped, but as he slowed he'd perceive the woman coming with the blunt of her blade. Being that the force allow some momentum to be be loss in her effort the blade would connect with Koji's sunagakure headband. This presumably thrust him out of the rotation, but also knock him to the ground given her strength. Koji seeing a punch coming for him would roll out of the way and deliver an Air palm toward her arms.

Seeing as this is an attack that targets internally this would be an attempt to make Mitsunara drop her sword. After this point Koji would gather himself and deliver a gentle fist toward the unarmed swordswoman. * - Fri Dec  4 01:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) shift his attack as he noticed the blade was beginning to thrust toward his palm. But, it would be like lighting as he moved fluently to pull back his one arm to strike the arm wielding the blade itself. Koji was enjoying the spar between the two but he was thinking on a way to combine the two spars happening that would surely be more exciting. At the same time Koji would move to seek a second strike with the gentle fist on the same arm.

Understanding this atack would be powerless to her due to her abnormal fortitude. Her one leg reaching out and other on the ground caused for an unfavorable balance on her part.
