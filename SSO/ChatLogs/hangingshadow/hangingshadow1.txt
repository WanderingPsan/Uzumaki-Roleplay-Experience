<br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) takes a glance around his surroundings. The area was littered with foliage, combined with a giant mountain towering over his back. Byakuren's senses reached outwards, confirming his isolation. Satisfied, Byakuren began some simple work in using a technique he learned recently. His hands formed the usual clone seal and chakra pooled inside his core.* - Tue Dec  8 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) || A puff of smoke followed soon after, enveloping the area around him. Suddenly, a thick horde of Byakuren's popped up in his immediate surroundings. They seemed to be able to make sounds and took up the majority of the space. Byakuren nodded his head and began moving alongside his clones, creating a chaotic mess of sound and visual trickery.* - Tue Dec  8 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) roamed the streets of the village, his ears alert and senses tingling. A blur of information unloaded upon his mind as he observed the innerworkings of the inhabitants there. He kept an avid 'eye' upon its citizens and the state they were in. All the while, he'd appraoch individuals every now and then under the guise of a wandering priest. He offered 'fortune telling' and 'charms' merely as a way to connect with the people. From there, he'd try to get as much information as he could. These actions of his continued for months.* - Wed Dec  9 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (Hmm... Well I'll try that.) - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) || A gentle, yet sad tune(profile) rang out from the South, expressed by the hum of a lone man. White, flowing hair spilled from the top of this rugged looking individual. His features were marked by the eyepatch strung over his left eye and an ominous scar across his exposed chest. A strange aura of benevolence and 'life experience" seemed to shimmer across the man. Oddly enough, he seemed at peace.

"Just as I thought. . .all is not as it seems in this village."

Byakuren cast a dull glance towards the few entities that entered his field of 'vision.'* - Wed Dec  9 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: Ahhh. .  - Wed Dec  9 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: It seems we've crossed paths yet again/ - Wed Dec  9 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Wed Dec  9 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) closed his eyes monetarily, his humming halting. They then opened, filling with murky vigor. His hand withdrew from his sleeve and expanded outwards. The man merely waved to all those present, his ears twitching at various words. A calm smile crossed his handsome, yet rugged face.

"Attacked? Why would anyone do that? Have you forgotten me already?"

Byakuren of course was already aware of Akechi's presence before he drew so close.

-A gathering perhaps?-* - Wed Dec  9 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'd give you a baby, heh. - Wed Dec  9 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm? Yes. Its her child. I'M ON AN IMPORTANT MISSION! I'm baby sitting her kid.. - Wed Dec  9 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, I see.. - Wed Dec  9 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: Mmmm. . . - Wed Dec  9 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though.. She's cute.. so its worth it, heh. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'm bored... - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: UGHHHHH!!!1 - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Fine... - Wed Dec  9 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You should speak up. - Wed Dec  9 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Clear your throat!!!! - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: PRONOUNCE!!! - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Y-Ye-...I um...Mm... - Wed Dec  9 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) narrowed an eye and twitched his ears. Byakuren was observing the interactions taking place before him, but seemed a little displeased. Despite that, his calm smile remained vigiliant. His right foot gently tapped against the dirt as his lips parted, speaking in a grandiose tone. 

"Mmmm. . .do you at least have the charm I gave you?"

Byakuren's brow raised as he directed the question at the armoured individual.* - Wed Dec  9 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) thinks: I sense a false guise. A persona. .  - Wed Dec  9 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: Nuh uh, I'm real as fuck! - Wed Dec  9 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'm going to kick him in his head next time. - Wed Dec  9 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Oh well.... - Wed Dec  9 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Plan at making friends, failed... NUMBER..... ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEENNNN!!! - Wed Dec  9 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: But anyway... - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Back to you guy at the gate.. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) nodded as he presented the charm.

"Good."

Byakuren quietly scanned the area round him as his lips parted.

"Do you still feel that this is Peace?"* - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) brought a hand to his chin, rubbing it gently. The man's answer proved him more competent than he thought. Most go day by day, not noticing the changes around them.

"Of course. There is, in fact, little peace in this village and the world right now. Why is that you ask? The answer isn't as simple as one might think. . ."

Byakuren dropped his hand and held it palm up.

"Malevolence plagues the world. It has since the beginning of time. And, frankly speaking, it always will. However, the origin of this malevolence stems from humanity itself. People, when left to suffer and wither away, create a veil of darkness to protect themselves and transfer their pain onto others. It is from this never ending cycle that war, depravity and Evil are born from."

Byakuren clenches his hand in a resolute fist.

"That is why we must destroy this cycle in order to bring about True Peace. Humanity requires Guardians capable of piercing through the shadows as a means to uplift them from their suffering. They must be shown a more just way, free from the Evil they have become too accustomed to."

He took a breath before retracting his hand.

"It is to that end that I wish to create a holy group dedicated to both protecting and enforcing the better part of humanity. A group banded together not by land or even power, but by ideology and the hope for a better future."* - Wed Dec  9 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Just a litle spar. I'm not much of a threat.. - Wed Dec  9 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Little* - Wed Dec  9 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: nah fam i'm gud. -walks away- - Wed Dec  9 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *Chops off head* - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: -omit- - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'm as defenseless as the hokage's child here. - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: A fight? Is that really what it comes down to? - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yes. - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: If i'm going to trust someone as a 'Guardian.' - Wed Dec  9 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You have to have power besides words. - Wed Dec  9 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) shakes his head.

"If you are as defenseless as you say, then I can not in good conscience harm you."

Byakuren was, in the truest sense, noble.* - Wed Dec  9 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Trust me. Ignore your 'good conscience for a second or two.' - Wed Dec  9 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: If you don't have power to back up your words, it'll be nothing.. Meaningless. - Wed Dec  9 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You need more than words to make a change. - Wed Dec  9 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You can't move or sway a mountain with only words. - Wed Dec  9 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You need the strength as well... to do this. - Wed Dec  9 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: BUT!!!! That's words, i've heard from a relic of the past. - Wed Dec  9 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) furrows a brow, taking a look over towards the three present. He seemed pained, pained that people were still only swayed by power. Power is a formless monster, filled with destruction. However, Byakuren understood that what really mattered was the person behind said power, one capable of befriending said monster as a means to protect others.

"No, you can not. Action is necessary in all aspects of life."

Byakuren placed a hand in each sleeve, sighing.

"At the very least, let the boy hold the child."* - Wed Dec  9 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Plus.. I really need to know... how bad I've became. - Wed Dec  9 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Hm... whats going on here? - Wed Dec  9 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Good.. that was fast enough. - Wed Dec  9 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: . - Wed Dec  9 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: Fortunes. - Wed Dec  9 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Don't worry about it, ma'am. - Wed Dec  9 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Just... make sure he's all right. - Wed Dec  9 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: No I will your my villager now and I wont have you all getting hurt - Wed Dec  9 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: ... - Wed Dec  9 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) took a glance over towards the one titled 'Hokage' then back towards the armoured individual. Another sigh escaped his person. Byakuren made his way over the dirt before halting.

"I'm no good at trouble. . ."

 Byakuren muttered to himself a bit.

"Do what you have to do."* - Wed Dec  9 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) shuffled around inside the confines of his kimono. His hands found their way out, each with an object in hand. Kunai and paper met as he fashioned a quick device. Without much delay, he'd take the kunai in hand and release it. It flew true, aimed straight towards the armoured individual.* - Wed Dec  9 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) seemed to be processing something the moment the kunai left his fingertips. An illusionary 'field' expanded out in Byakuren's mind. Information flowed in, his ears twitched and so did his body. He was already on the move as various, small tornadoes seemed to whirl about. They kicked up the surrounding dirt in the area, sucking up his kunai like nothing.

Byakuren, in turn, formed a single handseal while maneuvering away from the kunai. In hopes of using the resulting dirt kicked up from the armoured individual's move, Byakuren smashed his hand into the ground. A change happened in that singular moment and, just like that, Byakuren would dissapear into the ground.* - Wed Dec  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) motioned his body in a vertical manner, pushing his way through the earth as if he were apart of it. Magnetic pulses seemed to pelt his senses, sending him detailed information about the surface. His focus turned towards his opponent's movements, detailing weight, speed and other such things. He then began estimating a route of sorts before finally halting.

In that moment, he suddenly rose from the earth, attempting to stay out of view just long enough to form a single handseal. Chakra poured from his being and formed puffs of smoke, as if he were using the Clone Technique. Suddenly, a horde of Byakuren, all alike in appearance, were conjured forth. A mass of chaos followed suit as the group made noise and descended upon the armoured individual. Their hands cocked back, pulled out what appeared to be shuriken, and launched them.

Of course, only one was the real Byakuren.* - Wed Dec  9 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) sensed his opponent's movement away from the horde of clones. Using their mass to his advantage, Byakuren placed himself directly beneath the clones. Suddenly they moved forward, attempting to follow the armoured individual's steps. The real Byakuren followed closely behind.

Byakuren popped his torso above the earth for but a moment, hiding behind the guise of his clones. Each one made the same motions as Byakuren's next move. They followed him in tangem, reaching into their kimonos and withdrawing shuriken. They quickly spun the shuriken upon the tip of their fingers, inhaling air. Then, the spinning shuriken was brought to their porcelain lips. A living, translucent stream of wind escaped from Byakuren's mouth and seemed to envelop the kunai. Utilizing their new, wind infused shuriken they'd unleash it straight towards the armoured individual. A single shuriken escaped from the horde, spinning vigorously. It seemed different however, tearing through the air like butter. In reality, a transparent circle of death encased the shuriken, increasing its power and hit threat by 15 feet across (3x3 area).* - Wed Dec  9 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) || The horde of Byakuren split into two groups. They forced themselves to take a longer route in an attempt to circle near the armoured individual while he was busy dealing with the shuriken. However, a large gust of wind quickly enveloped the area, barely managing to halt the shuriken in its tracks, kick up a large spray of dust and finally blow through a few of the clones. The clones, though, simply blurred from the impact, their images reforming as they seemed to steamline through the wind towards their opponent.

The real Byakuren was already preparing for his next move.

-Check-

Him, alongside the other clones, brought their thumb to their teeth and quickly drew blood. An open hand dove into the confines of their kimonos and withdrew a single, odd scroll. Their hands quickly worked with the scroll, expanding it out and forcing it to flutter in the wind. Their thumbs smeared blood across the scroll before flicking it back in place. Finally, under the guise of dust, they'd form a single seal with the scroll in hand before finally smacking it against the earth. Then. . all went silent.* - Wed Dec  9 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) stood up alongside his clones, having placed the scroll down earlier before. The moment his opponent touched the earth, was the moment he entered Byakuren's terrain. The earth bursted all around the armoured individual, hiding the shadowery figures behind it. Suddenly, his opponent would find himself tied down by eight distinct Ninkens, of varying sizes mostly likely before he could do handseals. They, of course, didn't have enough power to pierce his armour, but their target points consisted of the inner workings of his legs, arms and weighing his back down via a massive bulldog.

"Mate. . ."

Byakuren muttered as he stood in the second clone group, not the one directly in front of his opponent.* - Wed Dec  9 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (It also materializes out of thin air, without me needing to actually have.. Iron sand.) - Wed Dec  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: ((16 speed of the sand.) - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) furrowed his brows as an unusual, nostalgic gush of chakra ushered from the armoured individual. Byakuren knew full well what it was, his senses undeniable. His hand swiftly reached into the confines of his kimono, pulling out a kunai. It was quickly sent into the scroll he had just used, piercing its contents.

The Ninken, who were moments from being skewered, suddenly dispersed in a puff of smoke. Byakuren on the otherhand, alongside his clones, backed away from the scene and took a more observing stance.

-Well, I expected as much. . .-* - Wed Dec  9 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Hey there. - Sat Dec 12 17:09:29 2015
