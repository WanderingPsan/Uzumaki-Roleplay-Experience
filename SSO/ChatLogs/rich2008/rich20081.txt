Description ; 
By accomplishing the rat handseal, and wavering the hand, an invisible barrier forms through the will and developpes through the implanted chakra of the user. Due to the invisible aspect of the barrier, only thus who are able to see chakra may be able to see the barrier.

It's durability depends on experience, uses, knowledge, and could be boosted through an implant of chakra. With much experience, on may not even need accomplish the rat handseal.

Elemental nature can be implanted in place, as once making physical contact could, conjure fire, slippery aspects, blow away, make itself ridgid to allow stractches, and or even electrocute upon contact.*

<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (With the elemental upgrade, I guess it becomes C-rank.)
<br><font color=green>*OOC Admin(Trinity606) says: (more like B ranked to me)
<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (It's a basic fuinjutsu, with elemental side it becomes C-rank.)

<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (Considering it as a C, then I would pick it as my one C.)
<br><font color=green>*OOC Admin(Trinity606) says: (it sounds way more advanced than a C rank tbh)
<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (What's advanced about it?)
<br><font color=green>*OOC Admin(Trinity606) says: (by the description, its a form of ultimate defense)

<br><font color=green>*Rich(Rich2008) says: (No.)
<br><font color=green>*OOC Admin(Trinity606) says: (it would take alot of chakra control to add an element to a barrier, and considering your a genin with little to no chakra control training, you wouldnt be able to add any elemetnal stuff)

<br><font color=yellow>*Takumo(Infinite Swag) || It was a cool day in Konoha. The weather was cool, the humidity was low. By the calm streets, there was a house expelling smoke. By the house, there was a group of fat people doing a pretty much cool barbecue. The smell was great. Big hamburgers were located in the grill, and by the side, a lot of bread pieces. An old fat guy was located taking care of the food, Takumo's father.

In the central table, Takumo was sat, reading a taijutsu performance book. He was the only active Akimichi, making him not that bad. He still had the power inhetered by his clan traits, just not that fat. Snacking some nachos, he was looking at the stances that the book was showing with good designed pictures.

The smell of the hamburguers was taking control of the yard. Takumo's father grabbed the hamburguers, and put them in the bread. Placing two pieces of cheese, and covering them with another the another part of the bread. The old guy put them inside a plate, and placed it ontop of the table, saying: "We'll get hard ninjutsu training if you eat all of those ten cheeseburgers." Takumo had a brainstorm, but a disgusting face. He was trying to be different, doing diets and such, but he usually never succeded.

Grabbing on the chesseburgers, he openned his mouth a little bit, and snacking it once. Feeling the fat of the meat, his head started to spin from the inside. He couldn't disguise his Akimichi hunger. He quickly tossed it all, and chewed it in a rush. Feeling the great pleasure, he tossed more five cheseburgers, with his mouth wide openned.

The food dropped to his stomach, and started to be disgested. He stared at the four left burguers, with a OGODWHY face. He thought he couldn't let the training fail, and put three cheseburgues one top of another, and tossed them all at his open mouth. Eating it quickly to hide the horrofying feeling, he started to have a really bad face. He started to sweat hardly on the side of his forehead, and thinking of the awesome training he'd have.

Staring deeply at the last cheeseburguers and it's contents, he grabbed it, and put it on his mouth, entirely. This wasn't a good idea. He felt the previously eaten food starting to come out, rubbing his belly with his right hand. He chewed it quickly like a machine, and put it in. He stood on the chair for a good time, silent and staring at the nothingness, trying to do not vomit. After some minutes, he managed to get up, walking to his dad, with the empty plate on hand. As soon as his father noticed the plate, he said: "Get ready." Takumo grinned with half of his mouth, looking sorta awkward inside...*
