<br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) made a motion - hands quickly bringing brought together in a quick fashion. A single rotation and Heiwa's hands remain interlocked in the seal of the tiger. <Nehan Shoja!> The technique's name ran through his mind, a surge of chakra flowing out of his body touching at the air to create the effect.

The strongest genjutsu that Heiwa himself knew - it was far more versatile than the ones he'd previously practiced or shown. As the rising chakra touched the air it began to take shape, turning whiter and slowly far heavier than before. A passive observer at this time would just begin to feel the faint effects of it all - a small bit of drowsiness that seemed inescapable to the person.

As more of the feathers fall the person would find themselves in a deeper, and deeper sleep until either they passed out or they broke the influence of the technique. Simply overpowering it with will power was not enough - even the strongest of berserkers or the toughest of angers could be rendered powerless to its effects.

However, like the mist technique that Yumiko had shown him earlier, the usage of this had left much to be desired. Covering only a couple feet around him - it required him to be in close range of his opponent or preempt them breaking any sort of distance with him. Simply, it was not a practical usage of a jutsu in its current state. 

But near every time he tried it he got just a little bit better. The width increased, the feather's numbers improved, and the drain for each dropped down significantly. <This is getting better..> he thought to himself, eyes remaining closed as he waited for every last feather to drop. At that moment the chakra was disrupted and the feathers faded from view.

On cue - he brought his hands apart for only the briefest of moments before bringing them right back together. The symbol of the tiger and another expansion of chakra - the area around him quickly became blanketed by another barrage of feathers covering about and over the area. 

It was kept up in such a manner for a while - his body growing more accustomed to the drain and the method of using this technique. He only disrupted it fully and finally for the day when it'd begun to leave him more physically drained - possibly enough to interrupt his activities in the following bits of the day.

<That'll do..I'll need to remember to work on it later,> the growing child thinks to himself, pulling up from the well worn couch and turning to face the door. "Lets see how the squads doing today."* - Fri Dec 11 11:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Hey. - Fri Dec 11 13:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey. You seen Nori around lately? - Fri Dec 11 13:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Not in a while. - Fri Dec 11 13:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Me neither. She's being more..elusive lately. - Fri Dec 11 13:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec 11 13:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: How have you been? - Fri Dec 11 13:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Fine for the day. Don't have to act like we don't still live together. - Fri Dec 11 13:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah yeah. - Fri Dec 11 13:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And you? - Fri Dec 11 14:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Still working on fighting in the mist. - Fri Dec 11 14:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ah. Still need help? - Fri Dec 11 14:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec 11 14:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright - I'll make the mist this time. - Fri Dec 11 14:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) offered his hand out to Yumiko. 

"I'll see if I can manage it without having to use a water source too."* - Fri Dec 11 14:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) lead her to their standard traning area - a staple pick for Heiwa and his squad over the years. It was out of the way and relatively unknown to a good bit of the people offering them a greater degree of focus and secrecy during their points of training. 

After letting go of her hand, he'd take a few steps back away from her spot.

"The same stuff we've been doing for a while?" he asks, turning to face her after a bit. Compared to how Heiwa was before - the growing child would seem far more like, well, a child. With Yumiko and Nori he's been able to better grow into an individual and break from his previously outwardly callous appearance. Smiles were far less of a rarity for him.

"Or do you want to make it into more of a contact sort of training?"* - Fri Dec 11 14:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey - there you are, Nori. - Fri Dec 11 19:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hiya. - Fri Dec 11 19:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Say, uh. . Are you and Yumiko free later? - Fri Dec 11 19:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Uh - yeah. Probably. Why? - Fri Dec 11 19:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I have a lot of err. . Missions that I have to take care of. . That I never even thought to check. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: A long list. . - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..That's why I've been looking for you. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The council has been at me over that fact.. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...I take it you're wanting our help? - Fri Dec 11 19:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . .. Yeah. .  - Fri Dec 11 19:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Fri Dec 11 19:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: We'll help you out - but we also need to work on your training. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . .. Alright. . . - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Most of them are D ranks. .  - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Two or three are C. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: and one is B. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hm - a B? What is it? - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Spar a higher ranked shinobi. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ....Well - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Looks like we can work on your training and complete a mission. - Fri Dec 11 19:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I'll spar you. - Fri Dec 11 19:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded, holding his hand out to Nori. 

"Lets go - the training spot just outside of the village gates can work,"* - Fri Dec 11 20:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) let go of her hand as they entered the place - the child himself getting a good glance at the area. Squad 1 had multiple training sessions at this area over their time together, and it was steadily growing to be Heiwa's preferred spot over the previous area of the water fall. Few people came around to this area lending it some privacy not often found in the village. 

"Alright, we can start here." the child says, taking a few steps back to create distance, before finally turning back to face his childhood friend. Compared to a few years ago, Heiwa has seemingly calmed much in his age. From a moody child obsessed with thoughts still well over his age - the time spent with the two friends helped to make him grow into more of an individual.

His values and who he was quickly grew more defined - with even a smile now being far less of a rarity with him. "I'll stick to just Taijutsu if that's fine with you?" he asks, intentionally lowering his own ability for her sake. It'd hardly be expected that if he went full power she could beat him. After all - Nori was a medic first and foremost.* - Fri Dec 11 20:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) assuredly responded with a nod, his own hand reaching up in unison to craft the other half of the seal of confrontation. "Alright - let's do it," he says, a smirk marking along the side of his face. Heiwa was ready.

Lowering his hand somewhat he'd bring it so his right fist was resting just a bit under his neck - hand clenched in a fist parallel to his clavical. Meanwhile, the left remained more diagonally aligned than the other despite remaining at roughly the same height. It'd be a very simple stance showing not too high of a focus on taijutsu, yet at the same time not a complete show of being foreign to it either.

There'd be a check before any action was made making sure that Nori had been able to adopt her own comfortable stance. Assuming that had happened - the child took off into a tight, carefully kept hustle towards Nori. It would hardly be his full speed - in fact being far less than that. Still well trackable and easy for Nori to keep a full visual on him. 

It'd also give her some time to bring out some sort of an attack on him if she was so inclined to do so.* - Fri Dec 11 20:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) kept his speed down to a minimum for a variety of reasons. It left the enemy guessing towards how far he could go, while at the same time offering him a broader window to deal with threats and potential tracking by, again, the enemy.

An example of this was shown just well by Nori's own actions. By not moving too fast he kept the distance between them large enough that by the time the flash of shurikens hit Heiwa's eyes the child was already getting into position. Standing securely on the tips of his toes, a sudden dash at full speed is made showing a considerable deal of blur from his movements.

The shurikens pass by hitting only dirt as the child dashes off out to the sides - quickly making that movement further continue to wrap around towards Nori. It'd be favoring her side - hoping to use the quick movement to blitz his way up close to her just enough to send a quick, somewhat painful, jab to her left shoulder.

If it had connected he wouldn't remain in that place, however. Staying quick on his feet - he'd take a jump back following the strike aiming to take himself away from counter attack range and give him time to react to any sort of follow up.* - Fri Dec 11 21:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) pulled back immediately following after her successful block - the attack likely jolting her system but not otherwise causing any further immediate damage. Aside from some obvious pain from the impact.

<Gotta keep moving around her..> he thinks to himself, remaining focused primarily on Nori. Of course, Yumiko's statement had been heard - but as of right now things were relatively tense enough to make conversation harder.

When Nori moves in for swing - Heiwa once more picks up in speed. Moving towards the incoming strike he uses his speed to quickly close the further bits of distance while at the same time leaning towards her right side - moving against the incoming attack as he got in closer to Nori herself.

The short bit of distance would be broke in fractions of seconds - a quick popping blow from Heiwa's left hand moving to connect against Nori's shoulder not carrying too much impact beyond the stinging sensation and a tiny element of growing weakness in said spot. However, the movement wouldn't be aimed to be ended there.

Keeping his momentum - he continues moving past her before once again jumping a minor distance back to put them in a safer 'neutral' zone for the child. While it was hardly a strong or devastating type of fighting style, it did keep him safe which was exactly why he practiced it.* - Fri Dec 11 21:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) did his best to create some distance from Nori - but not outright so. Focused on Taijutsu, he himself endeavored to remain as close to Nori as possible and treat it as if Taijutsu was his only option.

Which is why he waited after the distance had been made. Standing on the tips of his toes, he watches Nori for an action. His brow lowers, hardening as he sees another lunge come in - and a sudden out of nowhere kick aiming to line up with his stomach. He bares his teeth and makes an assumption of where it's going and coming from.

Just narrowly he dodges the attack - sliding by Nori's leg for a third time. This time, as he moves up to her shoulder he instead places his hand on it saying "That's enough," and hoping to have that stop her actions.* - Fri Dec 11 22:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah hello there.~ - Sat Dec 12 06:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey, Yumiko. How's today? - Sat Dec 12 06:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Pretty good and you? - Sat Dec 12 06:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Same. Was thinking about delivering a message to Izanami. - Sat Dec 12 06:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Especially considering the upcoming exams. - Sat Dec 12 06:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: You mean the chuunins? - Sat Dec 12 06:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: No. The Gezo's exams. - Sat Dec 12 06:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: You want to take part....in the one coming up? - Sat Dec 12 07:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Actually the opposite. I want to make sure Izanami isn't planning to. - Sat Dec 12 07:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You know how she can get at times.. - Sat Dec 12 07:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah... - Sat Dec 12 07:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ....Besides I also had something else I wanted to ask her. - Sat Dec 12 07:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Like? - Sat Dec 12 07:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Well..about something I've been reading up on. - Sat Dec 12 07:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I've heard there are a few practicioners in Suna. - Sat Dec 12 07:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Oh? - Sat Dec 12 07:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Hey therre. - Sat Dec 12 09:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey. - Sat Dec 12 09:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: What do you want me to put in the message? - Sat Dec 12 09:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Hm? - Sat Dec 12 09:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) raised his brow at the exchange, briefly passing his eyes over to Anguo before resting them back again on Yumiko. 

"Alright..Lets find a spot then?" he asks, his hand reaching back to his pouch to pull out a small bit of a scroll as well as a pencil. * - Sat Dec 12 09:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) followed by where Yumiko went, doing his best to keep his pen and paper from being ripped or wrinkled as he did so. When they each had made ti to the top of the mountain, he'd begin quickly scribbling out the contents of the note before finally handing it off to Yumiko for approval.

"Well, how's that?"* - Sat Dec 12 10:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded. "Alright," he says, bringing a small kunai from his back pouch to bare. Lightly pressing it against his skin, a small trickle of blood begins to pour. "I'll send it to her right now then," he says, mixing and dragging the liquid across his fingers coating each digit in as much of the spread redness.

A quick formation of hand seals, a surge of chakra, and his hands slam against the ground. Smoke erupts around him revealing a small, black dragon spinning across his body as it rises up to his face. "Why have you called me here, summoner?" the dragon asks as it passes by his face, looking the boy in the eyes as he made every rotation.

"I've got a letter to send. To a person in Suna - Lera. Wears a robe, long black hair, sword wrapped in bandages." Every statement made by Heiwa had the occasional abrupt pause as he waited for the dragon to pass by his face before continuing - a sign of respect and tradition for Heiwa and his summon. Rituals like this meant a lot for the dragon. 

Again, as it passes by his face it'd choose to speak - offering a simple "Very well," before scooping up the message and departing out into the sky.* - Sat Dec 12 10:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah thank you. - Sat Dec 12 10:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Yeah. No problem.. - Sat Dec 12 10:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Uh - you're sure she's not..like.. - Sat Dec 12 10:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I'm sure. - Sat Dec 12 10:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..Alright. Do you mind if I watch anyways? - Sat Dec 12 10:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: You can watch.~ - Sat Dec 12 10:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: She reminds me of you. - Sat Dec 12 11:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..Reminds you of me? - Sat Dec 12 11:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) stopped just infront of the kage manor, one hand carrying a broom while the other remained within his pockets. It wasn't often that he was given a mission as generally low ranked as this, but some solace could be taken from it at the least. It wasn't another execution mission. That made him feel better at the very basic.

<Might as well get this over with as soon as we can..> he thinks to himself, audibly sighing as he moved up to the steps. Swaying the broom side to side - he wipes off all of the dust and dirt that had accumulated in the area kicking it back to the ground. A tedious task, Heiwa did his best to complete it without overthinking about how he was being given such a mission. 

It would still help the village in some way to complete it - and after the steps were finished he began sweeping off the platform that the manor rested on giving a clean and thorough job for everything that was being done. And while it may have been relatively hard to see in the back drop of the moon-lit night, it finally seemed clean enough after near half an hour. <Alright. That's the daily chore done..>* - Sat Dec 12 11:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) turned his head, glancing over to the sound's cause. Eyeing Tengoku, his visage would soften showing a side that wouldn't have been seen in Heiwa when he was younger - a smile.

"Hey, Tengoku," he replies, raising his hand up in a short wave. "What're you up to?" His age was just at the point where it seemed to be growing just a bit deeper than normal as well - and of course his increased height was an obvious point of growing up.* - Sat Dec 12 12:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded lightly in agreement, his dark eyes remaining just as sharp as ever.

"It has. How has your squad been? With Anguo?"* - Sat Dec 12 12:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...Yeah. I haven't seen Geo around much either. I'm not sure the kage cared about the squads that much as of late. - Sat Dec 12 12:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I never really had much interaction with Geo either way. - Sat Dec 12 12:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: At this point, I've simply just been training myself, which tends to get boring. - Sat Dec 12 12:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You could always still train with the rest of my squad. - Sat Dec 12 12:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: We've got the space - and since you're..more scout based anyways it's not like having you join us on a mission would be a problem either. - Sat Dec 12 12:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That would be awesome, thanks Heiwa. - Sat Dec 12 13:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: How's everything going. Guys? - Sat Dec 12 13:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey Kyubishu. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Going great, thanks for asking. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You? - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright as much as they can be. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey Kyubishu. - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: 'Sup, Heiwa. - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: We got anything planned for today? - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I don't think so - uh would you two want to train with Nori and I? - Sat Dec 12 13:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Sure. - Sat Dec 12 13:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: She agreed. - Sat Dec 12 14:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright.~ Lets head out. - Sat Dec 12 14:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, let's go. - Sat Dec 12 14:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Lalalalala. .  - Sat Dec 12 14:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, hi. - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey, Nori. - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey - sorry we're late. - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It's all good. - Sat Dec 12 14:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Lets get this training underway then. - Sat Dec 12 14:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You wanna join, Nori? - Sat Dec 12 14:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Afternoon. - Sat Dec 12 14:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I'll watch for now. - Sat Dec 12 14:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Fair enough - Tengoku, what're you working on as of right now? - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Erm. - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Anything taijutsu, really. - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Improving strength, my reaction time, anything, really. - Sat Dec 12 15:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: How about your perceptions? - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That too. - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Nori? - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? I'm game with it. - Sat Dec 12 15:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Then this will be a spar. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: With a caveat. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You will be fighting in the hidden mist. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: No sight. Rely on your other senses. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oi. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then I'm immediately down for the count. - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Huh? - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Nori will be just as disadvanteged. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nothing, just saying I'm an easy target. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: As is Nori. Learning how to fight in the mist is important - at least to being able to survive in it. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is a common hiden of this village after all. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Really? - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Nori is a medic - If they fought normally it'd be strictly in Tengoku's favor. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Yumiko, you handle one side of the field, I'll handle the other? - Sat Dec 12 15:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) brought his own hand up in tandem, the delay just shortly after Yumiko's own. <Hidden Mist Jutsu..> His chakra surged, and suiton built up in his mouth being exhaled as a fine mist. Created near fully out of chakra it'd blind sensors or anyone focusing purely on chakra during that time while at the same creating a very potent and dense mist.

Of course, his own usage wasn't quite as refined as Yumiko's, however, it did fulfill its job of filling out any of the gaps that may be abused during the spar. Currently the entire field had been blanketted with the stuff.* - Sat Dec 12 15:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *TAKES HIS EYES* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *omit* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Are those groans? Or..moans?  - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Eww Nori. - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) flinched - hearing the sudden sounds of an explosion echoing out through the mist. <What're they doing?!> he thought to himself, taking that as another quick cue for him to end the spar. Explosion tags were taking things a bit too far after all. 

"Okay! That's enough!" he calls out, disrupting his own chakra flow to begin dissipating the mist. Since, apparently, Yumiko passed out there'd no longer be her as a requirement to stop it anymore either. When it passed he'd probably see Nori having landed on the ground, and would move over to see her status.* - Sat Dec 12 19:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) kneeled down beside Nori, a hand being offered to help pull her up. "Nori - what happened? Are you alright?" he asks, showing genuine concern for his friend.* - Sat Dec 12 19:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) turned his eyes to the new arrival, briefly eyeing him up and down. <The one Yumiko sparred..> Heiwa remembered him well enough. But after registering it wasn't a threat he returned his attention back onto Nori. "What was the explosion?" * - Sat Dec 12 20:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) stepped closer to the sleeping Nori. <What's she doing sleeping out here?> he'd think to himself, sighing at the sight. "Hey! Nori! Wake up."* - Sun Dec 13 11:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Come on, Nori. The grass can't even be that comfortable. - Sun Dec 13 11:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) kneeled down beside her and began nudging at her shoulder.* - Sun Dec 13 11:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The missions should be kept in mind - but I have a question first: What's your element, Nori? - Sun Dec 13 12:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Water. - Sun Dec 13 12:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Why? - Sun Dec 13 12:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Because Yumiko and I won't always be able to help you.  - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Or Sekitsui for that matter. - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Then gimme rasengan so i can fulfill the prophecy *omit* - Sun Dec 13 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: If you know how to use some of your element you may be able to save yourself. - Sun Dec 13 12:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: True.. Well, Yumiko was helping me with that the other night. - Sun Dec 13 12:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: She was? - Sun Dec 13 12:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: What'd she do? - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: She told me to generate water through my mouth. - Sun Dec 13 12:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And how'd that go - Sun Dec 13 12:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ? - Sun Dec 13 12:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I manage to spit out blobs. - Sun Dec 13 12:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Of..water, right? - Sun Dec 13 12:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Tell me they weren't making spit bubbles. - Sun Dec 13 12:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm! - Sun Dec 13 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Good. Can you show me it? - Sun Dec 13 12:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: See? - Sun Dec 13 13:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) tilted his head, brow raised at what she had made. Multiple blobs of water and spittle, it appeared in some way made out of chakra, but that was only due to the size being higher than a human would normally be able to spit. However, it was still rather poor of a usage.

Returning back at her, he'd shake his head and move closer. "Maybe..working on making water isn't what you need right now." he asks, placing a hand on her arm. "How about we work on using existing water sources first?"* - Sun Dec 13 13:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . Yeah. Alright then. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) began leading Nori over to a body of water. In Kirigakure - it wouldn't even be a far walk.* - Sun Dec 13 13:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. How about we work on a primarily defensive jutsu then for now? - Sun Dec 13 13:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure.  - Sun Dec 13 13:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded and stepped forward moving infront of Nori. A thin sheen of chakra surrounds his soles keeping him afloat as he maneuvered ontop of the water. 

"Good. This jutsu is one I'm sure you already have seen enough of," he says, remembering briefly the many points Nori had seen of the technique. "It is the namesake of the village with many practicioners that remain here." As he continues, he brings his right hand up into the seal of confrontation, a light surge of chakra exitting his body.

"Kirigakure no Jutsu: Hiding in Mist Technique." Suddenly the water directly under him begins to float up into the air - a very thin mist being created. Nori could still likely see Heiwa, especially considering how close they were, but it'd remain in the area nonetheless and may very well be damaging for those with chakra sight viewing anything.

As he kept the technique up, however, there'd be little to no semblance of drain or exhaustion on the child - an indicator of how far he'd gone with this technique since Yumiko had given him it. "The technique is done through manipulation of the water surrounding you. After building up your chakra and making the hand seals, you send the energy into the water beside you or under you."

As he says this, slowly a bit of the water he hadn't influenced begins to, as well, float up into an additional bit of his mist thickening it. "Small bits of water are then lifted up using your chakra turning into a veil of water vapor. The key is in how much you create with each drop of water. Too much and you waste chakra - too little and it won't make mist. While having a water source this can be negligable because of how much room for error you have, but the drain can be significant." 

As he finishes, he steps off of the water and halts his chakra flow. The mist finally begins to subside. "I want you to give it at least one or two tries, Nori. If you still have trouble..I'll be watching to see what happens." <It shouldn't be that hard for her. She's a skilled shinobi, and it is a D rank.>* - Sun Dec 13 14:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) shook his head, making a guessing assumption of it all. He'd never managed to put too much chakra in a jutsu, but often if that happened there'd still be some sort of result - as well as likely a violent sort of one. Hers wasn't quite that. 

"It might be too little," he says, taking a seat against the ground to watch further. "Or it might be your shaping."* - Sun Dec 13 14:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) 's brow raised seeing the rather incomplete usage of the technique. <Still too little chakra? Or is this shaping issues again?> it was steadily beginning to sound like it could be both. But before any critique could be made, Nori asked a question bringing his eyes back onto her.

"No, I don't think we have a medical head," he'd say, shaking his skull as he said that. "Are you..planning to try for it?" * - Sun Dec 13 15:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) pulled himself up, a smile marking his face.

"No - I think that can manage for today," he says, partly out of not knowing how much Nori's reserves could take. After all when Yumiko was first learning how to use this technique she could manage at most a few seconds of use. "You still capable for a mission?" he asks, stepping onto the water offering his hand out once more.

"One of our missions involves delivering some material to Sunagakure."* - Sun Dec 13 15:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. I wouldn't mind. .  I have  a mission to go there also. . Bringing a message to Sunagakure. .. Maybe that could go along with it as well? - Sun Dec 13 15:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I mean. .The incoming goods. . - Sun Dec 13 15:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm. That it can. - Sun Dec 13 15:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) brought a hand up to his ear. Softly he'd speak out a message.* - Sun Dec 13 15:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm. - Sun Dec 13 16:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm. Guess she's not up. - Sun Dec 13 16:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You ready, Nori? Got the message and all? - Sun Dec 13 16:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeaaah. - Sun Dec 13 16:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Good. - Sun Dec 13 16:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: We'll head out now. - Sun Dec 13 16:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Readyy? - Sun Dec 13 16:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) raised a brow at seeing this. Was this really what their mission was? 

"Nori..isn't the mission supposed to be delivering a message from the kage?" he asks, confused at seeing this. "Why are you writing it yourself?"* - Sun Dec 13 16:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Sun Dec 13 16:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) sighed. Unfortunately, Nori had a point. "Alright - yeah. I guess just write down the mission supplies. And..express 'gratitude over a continued peace'" he says, looking out of the caravan as they arrived. 

"Anyways, we're here."* - Sun Dec 13 16:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's been way too long. - Sun Dec 13 17:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) allowed them freely to do so, the kid remaining still as they patted him down. No weapons. 

"It has. How are you doing, Izanami?"* - Sun Dec 13 17:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You may come in.  - Sun Dec 13 17:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm doing well, how about you? - Sun Dec 13 17:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) stepped off the caravan alongside Nori. Considering the time that has passed it was obvious what features would be possessed. A taller body, more defined physique, and even a deeper voice, albeit not nearly at completion. 

"I imagine your guards will take care of the caravan and supplies?" he asks, stepping up closer to Izanami. The atmosphere around him seemed far more positive than previous. The years spent with allies has given him less of a macabre view of the world - which is only further added on with the ideals he had previously.

"We're doing well - Kiri has had some issues..but we're coming back. Can we get something to eat?"* - Sun Dec 13 17:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded, a smile marking his face. "Alright. Lets go, Nori."* - Sun Dec 13 17:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) also totes followed after saying that.* - Sun Dec 13 17:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: This is the best cafe in the village. - Sun Dec 13 17:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I see - I remember earlier everyone was talking about the 'Hungry Ant' - Sun Dec 13 18:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods* - Sun Dec 13 18:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: What're you guys going for? - Sun Dec 13 18:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm... - Sun Dec 13 18:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: What's a hungry ant? - Sun Dec 13 18:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: H- - Sun Dec 13 18:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Haha. - Sun Dec 13 18:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's the name of this cafe. - Sun Dec 13 18:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm. It was popular when I first came here. - Sun Dec 13 18:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Five years ago? Sounds about that long. - Sun Dec 13 18:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Good to see it's still running. - Sun Dec 13 18:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec 13 18:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Honestly, it's kind of like sunas pride and joy.. - Sun Dec 13 18:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: And i'll probably be getting Omusubi - Sun Dec 13 18:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . I seee. - Sun Dec 13 18:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm. I'll have some doughnuts. Nothing beats a doughnut. Jelly filled are my favorite.~ - Sun Dec 13 18:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Even has a name .  . Better than Konoha's cafe. . and ramen shop. .  - Sun Dec 13 18:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Seriously what kind of name is Konoha ramen shop. . .? - Sun Dec 13 18:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Should be called Konoha brothel and ramen shop. . .  - Sun Dec 13 18:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: I remember how much Nori hated Konoha's cafe when we were hiding out there. - Sun Dec 13 18:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Normally I'd ask why, but knowing Nori...I don't want to know;. - Sun Dec 13 18:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I still kept the. . . tissues. . - Sun Dec 13 18:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Edo Tensei purposes are real *omit* - Sun Dec 13 18:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) tilted his head, face shifting into one of those 'The fuck you talkin' about?' looks. 

"Flan is alright.." he scoffs, shaking his head securely. "But it's nowhere comparable to a good jelly doughnut." 

As he finishes he himself looks up at the ceiling in mock fashion of Izanami.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: 'Lera.' - Sun Dec 13 18:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: The village is practicaly under water... - Sun Dec 13 18:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...When was this? Why would she..do something like that? - Sun Dec 13 18:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm?? - Sun Dec 13 18:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Well, I ordered a few books on Sunagakure culture..and read up about a style of combat using puppetry. Like Marionettes. - Sun Dec 13 18:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: But in combat. - Sun Dec 13 18:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Puppetry. - Sun Dec 13 18:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Are you interested in that field? - Sun Dec 13 18:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm. I was looking to find out more about that. - Sun Dec 13 18:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: If you could that'd be appreciated. - Sun Dec 13 18:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: If you're really intent on finding out more about it of course.  - Sun Dec 13 18:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I tried to look in Kirigakure for any info but found nothing. - Sun Dec 13 18:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Doesn't help that our archives are destroyed in the invasions. - Sun Dec 13 18:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Would they be in the village's archives? Or is it more public knowledge? - Sun Dec 13 18:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: A little bit of both. - Sun Dec 13 18:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's a commmon profession here. - Sun Dec 13 18:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: But...there havent been many outstanding users of the style. - Sun Dec 13 18:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ah - so I'll be making history as I go.~ - Sun Dec 13 18:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Not just in our ideals, but as a puppeteer. - Sun Dec 13 18:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Speaking of which -- I was also hoping to show you something when we had time. - Sun Dec 13 18:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: A hiden of the black lotus. - Sun Dec 13 18:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Sun Dec 13 18:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: A hiden? - Sun Dec 13 18:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Id like to see, please. - Sun Dec 13 18:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) nodded, and pulled himself up. "Nori - when the waiter comes please put in our orders." he explained to her, before moving to walk out of the door.* - Sun Dec 13 18:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? Alright. - Sun Dec 13 18:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Steaaaal it. - Sun Dec 13 18:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This should work. - Sun Dec 13 18:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ready? - Sun Dec 13 18:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) brought both hands up to his chest, interlocked digits remaining in a simple formation of fingers. And then he began rotating them - a quick blur of movement crafting about the remaining seals in very fluid succession. 

A surge of chakra escapes him - and suddenly Heiwa leans down slamming his open palm against the ground. The chakra he had created seeped out of his hand into the ground travelling farther ahead. The destination the child had picked out was the tree standing directly opposite of the two, and with a movement of his body he'd try and direct Izanami's attention to it.

"Over there - at that tree!" he calls out, waiting for the effects. A second after he said that suddenly large chains ripped out of the ground - appearing to be made of a thick set of iron. Four of them in total all focused on diagonally opposing sides of the tree itself - the ground appearing as very weak obstacles for the chain's advance.

As they appear they suddenly begin wrapping around the tree - dragging and pulling it straight down to the ground even to the point of painfully uprooting it. The chains were strong - and remanied durable to the point. Enough so that they hardly appeared even scratched as they continued to hold the tree permanently.

Pulling himself back up, he takes a deep breath out - appearing only barely impacted from the usage of the jutsu. "That's a technique I've kept only in the hands of Nori, Yumiko, and myself.~" he says, taking a bit of pride in the fact of its exclusivity.* - Sun Dec 13 19:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) gently moved to connect his hand with Izanami's, trying his best to interlock the digits. "Use my hand as the other.~ Tiger, Dragon, Ram."* - Sun Dec 13 19:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) couldn't do anything neat like having them have a moment of connection in making the hand seals or anything. Darn. So he handed her a scroll with the information. 

"It's powerful - and if we combine the strengths it gets that much stronger."* - Sun Dec 13 19:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I came with yo man to pick you up gurl *black gurl voice* - Sun Dec 13 19:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: No - Sun Dec 13 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) noticed as they got there that there was, strangely enough, no food at the table - yet there were three plates. And the one at his seat had flan!* - Sun Dec 13 19:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..... - Sun Dec 13 19:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Why would she do something like this..? - Sun Dec 13 19:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You could always purchase one? - Sun Dec 13 20:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Heiwa(Wantpark) picked up the scroll, wrote a little bit, and put it back on the table.

He'd then look towars Nori to see what she did.* - Sun Dec 13 20:20:12 2015
