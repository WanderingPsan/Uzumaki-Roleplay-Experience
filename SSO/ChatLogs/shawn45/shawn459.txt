There will be some that guard the gates, but time slots will be done for those so that everyone gets their fill of training. Overtime, the training will benefit not only those that we can count, but the mercenaries and other children as well.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: What are we doing here? - Mon Dec  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks her eyes for a moment, "So we're executing a man for crimes against the village?" A bit of thought came to her head before she smiled a bit wildly. . Even more disturbed than before. . But then she quickly hid it behind the veil that was her hand, "Is he restrained or his chakra sealed?" She asked, wondering the specifics of how detained the man is for the most part. Can never be too careful these days, right?* - Mon Dec  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: He's detained, malnourished, and deemed generally not a threat. - Mon Dec  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Much of his abilities have rusted over the near year of incarceration. - Mon Dec  7 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Our mission is a public execution. - Mon Dec  7 01:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Just in case something happens. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Sekitsui and Yumiko - you'll both escort him. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had promptly followed behind, eyes narrowed as she followed. . She was a bit. . ecstatic about this.* - Mon Dec  7 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inches her head to the side, removing a good stack of tags, "I got a few." She said out loud. . Just how much did she have? No one would know.* - Mon Dec  7 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) rubs the back of he head for a moment, finally calming down. She could read the air within this, despite her having a different feel about this than the others. Shaking her head for a moment, she looked over to Heiwa, "If you guys are uncomfortable. .I can always. . you know? Do it." She said that with a bit of a soft expression on her face.

She was the oldest of the four, despite their rank and status. So it might have been best if the oldest had taken the most responsibility with the death. . Despite being the medic in this case.* - Mon Dec  7 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) shook her head, "It's alright. .I will." She said this, no conviction in her voice. . Was it. . her mannerisms that made her wanted to do it? Or was it something that she wanted to prove. She ran a hand through the back of her head.

"Let's just get this over with. . It seems like it's leaving a bad taste in all of our mouths." . . Most of their mouths. . Not all of them.. * - Mon Dec  7 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..Yumiko, go gather anyone you can ahead of us. - Mon Dec  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: This is the person I'm looking for. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I've got next. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Heiwa, do me a favor. - Mon Dec  7 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Pull out this spear from me? - Mon Dec  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Does he not see we are in the middle of something? - Mon Dec  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does Nori -want- to do it? - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But who? - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .......But why? - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, rubbing the back of her head as she entered with the rest of the squad. She stared at Sekitsui for a moment, then at the others. . Only person who wasn't really awkward about it, or was hiding it well was Yumiko. She kept her deadpan gaze for a moment on the weak and frail man. A year in confinement in brutal conditions can do that to a man.

She gestured for Sekitsui to make him kneel. It was only formal for it to happen this way before she even did anything about it.

"Heiwa. Tell them his crimes before I do it, please." She whispered to him, taking a few steps inbetween Heiwa and Sekitsui. . .* - Mon Dec  7 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Ask him for his last words..and then afterwards go ahead and do it. - Mon Dec  7 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inhaled deeply for a moment, taking in the atmosphere of the situation. She closed her eyes, probably just giving the man a bit of time to take in the seriousness. Opening her eyes, she would look at the man, deadpan eyes.

By now, shinobi and villagers that resided in the village that wanted to attend had come about, some speaking ill of the situation -possibly because they came late to the scene- and some just questioning why was it being done now. . . 

Of course there were also others that were just there to condemn the man or make it be a quick one, but hey, who is actually going to shout that shit infront of people with mixed opinions?

"Do you have any last words for the public to hear? Any at all." She said this, keeping a calm and -surprisingly- emotionless composure. . * - Mon Dec  7 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're just going to execute that man as he is? A poor death. - Mon Dec  7 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If he should die, he should do so on his feet, not grovelling on the floor. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: Lame. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ..... - Mon Dec  7 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Squad one doesn't look very happy to be doing this. - Mon Dec  7 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Mon Dec  7 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times. . . She might have been the noob in this entire village, but. .Who the hell was Jashin? That was a bit. . unexpected. She just looked around and nodded once. If the man was able to show a smile, then. . 

Surprisingly, she showed the same ecstatic -yet sadistic to all living hell- smile she showed when she heard about this mission. An explosion was too good for this man. . Fuck an explosion. Her right hand had grabbed onto the hilt of her tanto, unsheathing it from the scabbard.

A loud sickening sound of metal hitting against a case was heard until the entire eight inch blade was shown in it's splendor. Perfect for the job at hand. To have the honor to do this, especially to someone whom she could now show no remorse for? It was perfect. Her eyes pinpointed the area of choice where she was going to do it. The heart. 

Within a quick lunge of the blade, the tanto would attempt to run through the malnourished man, inching into the left side if his chest, inbetween the ribcage. She had no qualms in doing this and had only chosen to do this because the others were too. . .Weak in the legs to do the same. The moment the entire blade had reached into the chest. . .

The sickening sound was heard as the blade was twisted, to make sure that it was done, causing more pain inducing internal damage. Just so he could feel the pain, 'Unfortunately for you, I have no problems getting rid of scum.' She thought to herself as she said that. She only stared to see how the man would take the pain.* - Mon Dec  7 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Death. - Mon Dec  7 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Too common. People do stupid things to deserve it. - Mon Dec  7 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Then again, shinobi encounter death way too many times. - Mon Dec  7 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Guess that makes me stupid, heh. - Mon Dec  7 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks for moment as the man had slumped against her blade. Her face turned into that of disappointment for the most part. She lets go of the handle. .If it wasn't for the fact that the man was practically malnourished and what not, he probably would have been too heavy for the medic to even think about doing this next. She calmly pushed and grabbed, trying to place his body on the ground in a formal manner.

She then grabbed and pulled the blade from the male. It took her a while, but she exhaled the breath of air she had inhaled the moment she was put in the middle of it all. A sense of relief washed over he face as it was finally done.* - Mon Dec  7 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: We'll need to clean up the area and dispose of the body. He is not to be given a burial. - Mon Dec  7 04:17:16 2015
