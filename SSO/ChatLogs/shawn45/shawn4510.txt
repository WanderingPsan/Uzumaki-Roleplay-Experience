<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had fortunately had done the handseals from before. She was only stop from the final motion of letting go of her hands and slamming them to the ground due to Heiwa grabbing onto her wrist to stop her from further moving through with her plan.

(Handseal speed 1)

In reflex to Ren rushing over to Heiwa's direction. She would back up momentarilly, more or less assuring Heiwa to do the same, 'Shit.' She thought to herself. . . Yay, she cursed for the first time, how cute. Anyway, she slammed her hand to the ground upon moving to the ground.

Now the chakra pulse had been evident to sensors across the board. Chains sprung up and about. She couldtell that Ren was strong. . Probably strong enough to break through the chains, sure, but it was only a way to somehow hinder him from getting close to Heiwa intimt to perform the jutsu.

It probably wasn't much of a lapse in time, but it was something to consider atleast when it came to concentration, right?* - Mon Dec  7 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had fallen asleep. . .Why god. . Why do you do me like this? I was already on a roll after brutally gutting a prisoner. . Now I'm sleeping onthe floor.. Soon you're gonna tell me that I can't experiment on hobos that ask for shelter or to 'feed the homeless' with my special medication that I put in their foods. .

Oh. . wait. . .I'm dreaming this. . .

In reality, Nori was already drooling in her dreams.* - Mon Dec  7 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) slowly snaps out of her own trance, grasping onto her head. . She noticed that she was drooling, but paid no mind to it . . She didn't sleep that long anyway. She got up, staggering a bit and trying to follow behind Xian. . Unless no one helped up poor Ryo..

Then she might go 'saving private ryan' on him.* - Mon Dec  7 08:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arched her brow for a moment, "I will be honest here. All in all, although Midori was a bit extreme. . In her attack, it was deserved. Stupid people need to be taught a lesson and if it's through pain, then it teaches them not to do stupid stuff. Or in his case, threaten random strangers and acting like he has any status at all. He is a genin, not a chuunin or jounin, but a genin."

It was a satisfying feeling to her before she got right into concentration.

She remained silent for Yumiko, just closing her eyes as a means to find out where Yumiko was going to come from. For now, it was just going to be a light exercise for the both of them, right?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) decided to move on to the manor, searching for the man in question that was probably in shackles to keep him from escaping his fate.  At that point, she was just looking through the manor to make sure the guards were there watching him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to walk over to the man in the manor. She wanted to see just how 'lively' the man was. Folded her arms, she looked at the guards, for a moment, promptly staring the man down, "Hmm, well, someone seems energetic." She was obviously being sarcastic to the man in the manor, but waited to see if he would respond.

"It's your big day today. Make it or break it time. You're excited?" . . A lot of sarcasm, it seems.* - Fri Dec 11 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) //Had a couple of the guards pick the man up. . She folded her arms as she would just  allow the guards to keep the man in chains. They pushed  and shoved him as he struggled. She didn't know if they were going to be killing him also, but she decided to take the mantle the moment they left outside. A hand moved to the handle of the tanto, swinging it to hit at the soft spot on his head.

"It's your time to shine, not your time to run away." She said, holding the chains and pulling on them. Had to abuse them a little if they struggled, you know?* - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was mentally enjoying the rough housing until Anguo had spoken up, "Mind if I do it?" She asked to Anguo. as she was pushing the prisoner towards the execution area. Some of the guards like before noticed her struggle and decided to just help her by picking the prisoner up and helping her set the prisoner in place infront of everyone else.

As they were there, they took the other prisoner's lifeless corpse up and dragged it away.

"Finally. . " She mumbled, a bit embarrassed that she had just offered to bring the prisoner over there, but couldn't handle the struggle.* - Fri Dec 11 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Was still not told his crimes. . - Fri Dec 11 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Murder... - Fri Dec 11 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment. She begun to inhale deeply, looking around, "As for this on--" She begun to clear her throat, shouting back. Thirteen year old spirit and all, "We. . . are all here to see the execution of. . This man. . " Whose name was not above her head at all. She nodded once before just grasping onto the tanto blade.

"His crime was murder, an unjust crime for the public!" She exclaimed outwards. She ignored the shouting for a moment and looked down, "Do you have any last words?" More embarrassed because she didn't get the male's name?* - Fri Dec 11 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) frowns for a moment. . Really? No fighting the system, praying to the god? Nothing? Really? Not even a smidge of begging for forgiveness? Or his life? . . .

Her eye twitched for a moment, before she stopped, "For his crime of murder, he will be giving the same compensation that he gave his victim." With that being said, the girl came up with the unsheathed blade. She would've lobbed the head off, but there was something that she liked more than that.

And it was keeping the body in tact. She grabbeed at the male's neck and brought the blade up, lunging it into the male's chest and sinking the blade into it until it was entirely in. Promptly twisting the blade once it made it to the heart and shredding the blade outwards.

She didn't give the man the satisfaction of dying a painless death. . A stab into the heart. .It might have been instant but the start was ever so painful. .And so was the twist.* - Fri Dec 11 04:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Say, uh. . Are you and Yumiko free later? - Fri Dec 11 19:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Uh - yeah. Probably. Why? - Fri Dec 11 19:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I have a lot of err. . Missions that I have to take care of. . That I never even thought to check. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: A long list. . - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..That's why I've been looking for you. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eye twitched, "A  very. . very. . . long list. . ."* - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The council has been at me over that fact.. - Fri Dec 11 19:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...I take it you're wanting our help? - Fri Dec 11 19:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . .. Yeah. .  - Fri Dec 11 19:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Fri Dec 11 19:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: We'll help you out - but we also need to work on your training. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . .. Alright. . . - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Most of them are D ranks. .  - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Two or three are C. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: and one is B. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hm - a B? What is it? - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Spar a higher ranked shinobi. - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ....Well - Fri Dec 11 19:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Looks like we can work on your training and complete a mission. - Fri Dec 11 19:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I'll spar you. - Fri Dec 11 19:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, "That will be nice." She said, folding her arms under her cloak.* - Fri Dec 11 20:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inches her head to the side. She forgot where that was anyway. She shrugged it off and just grasped onto his hand.* - Fri Dec 11 20:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inched her head to the side. Of course, Heiwa knew how to dodge, an ancient art passed down from generation after generation of every human being known to mankind. .Anyway! Aside from that, Nori would grasp onto the edge of the hilt of his tanto, curling her fingers around it for the most part before unsheathing the blade itself.

"Hmm. . I can't really say much on your progress since you'll more than likely win. ." She wasn't that keen on taijutsu practice, so using weapons was probably the more beneficial term to keep this spar going along. After doing this, a brief flip of the blade was notice as she drew it to the side.

"I'm fine with however you fight. So long as it's eventful for the both of us. .You know?" She asked, as she lifted up her left hand, furling it into the seal of confrontation. . Well half of the seal, you know? At this point the young medic was ready for the spar.* - Fri Dec 11 20:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had smirked for a moment as Heiwa was begining to rush over towards her. He was relatively fast, so she was a bit confused as to why he was moving so slow for her sake. She brought the blade up with her right hand, clenching it tightly before she dug into her backpouch, pulling out three shurikens. For now, she swiped her left hand quickly flicking them towards the body area as she jumped on backwards.

What was she planning from moving away? Well, who on earth knows. She was just thinking while she was fighting at this point.* - Fri Dec 11 21:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes looked over to her right as Heiwa had moved from it. At this point, she looked at the bottom for the moment and realized something was a bit off. The moment he moved for a jab, her right forearm rushed upwards as a mean to block the hit. She winced a bit, though didn't mind the light bruising that would occur later if he had damaged her a bit more. She wasn't concentrating on Yumiko for the most part as she asked that and had her concentration on Heiwa, whilst lunging over towards him.

In a quick swing, she would aim to slam the side of her tanto right onto Heiwa's right leg!* - Fri Dec 11 21:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) cringed for a moment as she felt the brutal impact against her shoulder. .Well not that brutal of an impact but brutal enough to cause her to cringe. She took one step back to gain a tad bit of distance only to realize that Heiwa had moved from his position. She had to admit, he was fairly faster than the norm, which made this all the more harder.

In light of this, she lunged inwards, driving her right foot upwards with the intent to slam it into Heiwa's stomach. Her eyes widened for a moment as she assumed that she had found an opening through it all, 'Keep the focus, keep the focus.' she thought to herself.* - Fri Dec 11 22:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes had widened for a moment as her foot lunged outwards, only able to kick into nothing. She staggered a bit forwards, following her eyes for the most part. She turned the blade, almost as if she was going to swing it, but felt Heiwa's hand on her shoulder.

When he said those words, she sighed, but nodded. Without doing much, the young medic had begun to sheath the blade once more.* - Fri Dec 11 22:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: How are you holding up? - Fri Dec 11 22:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Good. . . Welp. Finished one mission finally. - Fri Dec 11 22:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I have. . Six more missions to do.  - Fri Dec 11 22:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ugghh. .  - Fri Dec 11 22:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: And Heiwa told me the council is hounding me to do them too. .  - Fri Dec 11 22:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Well then. Your next opponent is me. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? Uhh, alright I guess. Guess I can do one that ain't a mission. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Come then. Afterwords we're going on a trip. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inches her head to the side before sighing. She didn't bother doing the seal of confrontation and just rushed northwards over towards Yumiko. A hand ran upwards, curled into a fist as she aimed to slug the girl right across the chin.* - Fri Dec 11 22:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, as Yumiko had just moved away from Nori. She staggered a few times, turning on the balls of her feet and staring over towards Yumiko as she tilted he head, "Uhh.  . Right. ." She said, sighing and just bringing up the seal of confrontation with one hand.* - Fri Dec 11 23:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) frowns for a moment, "You said to begin the spar, but alright." She said, knowing she couldn't really say much about it being unfair since she did do it unfairly as well. For now she just took a few steps backwards, holding onto the tanto blade tightly.* - Fri Dec 11 23:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened as she noticed that a bit of the mist opened up. Though it came shrotly with her gettign hit and faultering backwards, tumbling on back, ". . . I meant to do that!" She exclaimed with a groan as she got up. . Good God this was so difficult to do.* - Sat Dec 12 00:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to move a bit about, though decided to sheath the blade. After doing that, her hands clasped together, moving through a single handseal. Whilst doing that, a cloud of smoke washed over her, just aiming on moving west. . Like, completely west. Possibly tackling into whatever was infront of her at the time. 

Yep, she was being a bit reckless with it, but she found it most effective.

(Control + Speed= 18 (by rounding). so 9 tiles)* - Sat Dec 12 01:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had continued the effects of shunshin due to not really tackling into anything but air. She staggered a few times forwards, blinking a bit before turning her head from right to left, 'Where is she. .?' she thought to herself, frowning as she wasn't very much used to her hearing at all nor thought that it was right to use it at all.

She drew the tanto blade once more, trying to keep quiet. .Atleast that is what she was learning she was supposed to do at this point. She only tried to hear the sounds of footsteps that plagued the ground.* - Sat Dec 12 01:43:37 2015
