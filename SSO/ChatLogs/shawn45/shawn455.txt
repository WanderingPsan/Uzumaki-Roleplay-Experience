<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..I figured we were already sort of a squad. I don't know if the chunnins would have one, but we're sticking together despite that. - Fri Nov 20 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Even if we don't have a squad together we're going to ..'do it' together. - Fri Nov 20 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 20 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm doing alright. - Fri Nov 20 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That's good. How's your training going? - Fri Nov 20 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's going pretty good. Would you like to see the results so far? - Fri Nov 20 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Be careful around that fan.. - Fri Nov 20 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was just monitoring the fight, trying to take note of what happened and the injuries they both bore during it.* - Fri Nov 20 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Zzzzz.~ - Fri Nov 20 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: say Huh. . Oh-- Oh right. - Fri Nov 20 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had kneeled for a moment, looking over at Yumiko as she assessed her for any wounds.* - Fri Nov 20 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You three. Want to go on a mission? - Fri Nov 20 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..A mission? - Fri Nov 20 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah. Killing a rogue shinobi from the Hidden Mist. - Fri Nov 20 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) clasped her hands together, moving through a bit of the handseals. A hand moved over to the wounds that were exposed as chakra had jutted onto the surface of the scrapes as a hue of emerald green was seen, slowly trying to heal the wounds that were on her person.

Considering they were just bruises and what not, it might not have taken a lot of time as it would if she was horribly damaged.* - Fri Nov 20 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A rogue? Who? - Fri Nov 20 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Goes by the name of Betty. - Fri Nov 20 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Pretty sure it's a male though. - Fri Nov 20 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good. She's back. - Fri Nov 20 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I can manage... - Fri Nov 20 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good. Good. - Fri Nov 20 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right..Nori? You good as well? - Fri Nov 20 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ....... - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah..Well at least as far as his ninjutsu goes. He's probably frail physically. - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Don't worry he'll be slow. - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Just don't get hit~ - Fri Nov 20 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's like 72. - Fri Nov 20 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Slow huh..... - Fri Nov 20 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Where is he located I have an idea. - Fri Nov 20 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..What're you planning? - Fri Nov 20 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I need to take a trip to the shop. I'll tell you on the way. You might like it. - Fri Nov 20 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He's north of Amegakure last I heard. - Fri Nov 20 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Alright. Do we bring him in? - Fri Nov 20 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do we need any information? - Fri Nov 20 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Or do you want him dead? - Fri Nov 20 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Nope. Just kill him. He's been killing civillians all over we can't have that...Oh and y'know.. - Fri Nov 20 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Check his pockets he might have weapons or scrolls or something... - Fri Nov 20 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Heard he was a medicc~ - Fri Nov 20 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Interesting. Looks like I'm becoming a medic. - Fri Nov 20 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. Any other clues you have about him? - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Mine. Mine. Mine. MINE! - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What type of ninjutsu does he use? - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If any at all. - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: B. Fire maybe. - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I don't know. - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Probably water. This is Kirigakure. - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: The last two people he killed were incinerated. - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: BUT, they were also full of water... - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Go on now. Get ready. - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was slightly drooling from the side of her mouth, just. . . . ecstatic after hearing the wod medic.* - Fri Nov 20 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Oh right. I have a lot of weapons. .  - Fri Nov 20 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes peered a bit to the side as she was trying to get a good look as to who Heiwa was speaking to. A bit of a slanted lip was seen as she was trying to convey if that was the person or not. . When all of a sudden, Betty had grabbed onto his stringless bow and rose it upwards.

Her eyes widened and her heart sank quickly as the arrow was headed for her direction. She -if given the chance to do so- would attempt to stick close to the tree, motioning backwards as the arrow shot forth and hopefully either missed or stabbed into the tree instead.* - Fri Nov 20 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hi there. - Fri Nov 20 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi! Uh, how's it going? - Fri Nov 20 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Pretty good. I have something for you. - Fri Nov 20 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks, reaching a hand out to grasp onto the two scrolls, "Uhh. . What kind of scrolls?" she asked, opening them up one by one and reading them.* - Fri Nov 20 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Medical stuff. - Fri Nov 20 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: They seem understandable. . Atleast to me, that is. . Doesn't seem that bad. - Fri Nov 20 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) continued to read them, looking up and down at them both, "So. . You and heiwa are serious on failing it, right?" she asked, just to keep some kind of conversation going. She looked up and over to Yumiko, almost like she was examining her for any wounds she probably got during the mission.* - Fri Nov 20 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods a few times, just continueing her reading for a brief moment, "The other one seems a bit. . harder to really understand. . Let me re-read it for a moment." she said, just trying to keep her focus back on the scroll. . Tired. . as all living hell eyes, to be more exact.* - Fri Nov 20 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) continued to read through the scroll. . Focusssssss! A lot of it.* - Fri Nov 20 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) looked over at Yumiko, before slowly beginning to finish up the reading. She wasn't done quite yet with it exactly, so this might have taken her a bit of a while to complete. At least that was what she was assuming for the most part!

"Uhh, do me a favor? Do you mind giving yourself just a light cut?" she asked Yumiko.* - Fri Nov 20 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) closed both of the scrolls, placing them into her pocket before rising a hand up. It didn't say anything about handseals for the most part, so she just tried to first examine the wound first with her eyes. It seemed minor for the most part, so it didn't need much of anything other than a brief healing. Chakra had accumulated around the surface of her palm before it stretched outwards, planting onto the wound as it slowly begun to work as a fast acting healing agent, slowly closing the wound up.* - Fri Nov 20 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) panted a few times, "Yeah.. Good. . Dang, that was a lot of chakra. ." she mumbled.* - Fri Nov 20 23:54:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? I can try to help. . What are we doing exactly? - Sat Nov 21 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: There's a guy coming to Kirigakure. We're to strike first before he strikes us. He'll be unaware we intend to kill him. - Sat Nov 21 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm. . Alrighty. - Sat Nov 21 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: How strong can he be anyway? - Sat Nov 21 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We're getting paid three times the normal C rank mission because legally he can't make it an S rank one. - Sat Nov 21 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's that bad. - Sat Nov 21 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehhh. .. Alright. . - Sat Nov 21 00:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Do tell. - Sat Nov 21 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Okay, so is the guy expecting anything or going to attack us? Or is he just coming to have a talk with the Mizukage? - Sat Nov 21 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Nori. Hi. - Sat Nov 21 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was smiling for once. . . Obvious reasons, of course.* - Sat Nov 21 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. I've used the scrolls that Yumiko gave me. Took me a while to understand them though.  - Sat Nov 21 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: She gave you scrolls? - Sat Nov 21 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: What kind? - Sat Nov 21 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had rose her hands upwards, furling into a single handseal and focussing chakra under the soles of her feet, "Uhm . .Just a favor though, before I use it. .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) groans for the most part, as she literally forced herself into Heiwa, stumbling a bit on the ground as her mind practically trailed a bit due to the tunnel vision. She could not read the situation she was in, but was more or less groaning. Pushing herself upwards, if given the moment. . . She probably knocked Heiwa over as well, but it was all in good spirits. . At least to her it was, "S. .Sorry. .You okay?"* - Sun Nov 22 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) She just moved to her side for a moment before she finally got up entirely. A hand was stretched out and offered to Heiwa to help pick him up, "Sorry. ."* - Sun Nov 22 01:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had decided to try her work with mastering the technique one more time. She clasped her hands together, furling a single handseal before taking a quick step forwards. In almost a quick blur of smoke, she would appear from one end to the other with a twitch of her eye appearing.* - Sun Nov 22 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) finally was notice a bit of a change when it came to doing this frequently. She was not growing as tired as she assumed she would've, which was good for her, so it meant that the chakra drain was becoming minimal, which was also a good thing for her. Her knees bent, and wiht a quick push, the chakra that she stored once more had allowed another veil of smoke to move around her.* - Sun Nov 22 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was in a bit of a daze, not knowing where she was at the time this was going on. She staggered a bit from side to sidem however it was still a bit of a problem. Flexing the muscles in her feet, Nori would turn and pressure her knees before pushing off in a quick blur!* - Sun Nov 22 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) //Although it was beginning to become more and more evident that she was getting tired of this, she would say nothing. She staggered a bit backwards, stretching momentarily. She wanted to go through it a bit more, but didn't know how it was going to react to her reserves. She leaned a bit forwards, as the plume of smoke took over her frame and she rushed nearly towards the table.

She stopped, quickly freezing up in fright.* - Sun Nov 22 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) smiled a bit, feeling like she had perfected a second technique she had. She folded her arms, nodding almost out of accomplishment. She kept her arms to the side as she looked to the exit with her eyes narrowed, just allowing her arm to reach out, allowing her chakra to exert out towards nothing.* - Sun Nov 22 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) continued with the chakra flow, trying to keep it constant, but with less chakra so it would strengthen with mere experience and not her chakra flowing into it.* - Sun Nov 22 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) continued to inch thechakra into small threads, if it was possibleat all. She was beginning to cough a bit soundly.* - Sun Nov 22 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still focusing the chakra to just keep thin down. She was going to stop in a bit as she was coughing more harshly, but kept the focus. She wanted just a small bit of time. That's all she really need for now.* - Sun Nov 22 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was beginning to pant raggidly, realizing that after all of this, she was going to get some goodnight sleep. She would stretch her hand outwrds as the chakra thinned into something else, hoping it was enough to keep the healing pulse going.* - Sun Nov 22 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was a bit caught off guard. He stopped the chakra conversion almost immediately, staggering a bit backwards as he panted excruciatingly fast. She grabbed at her own chest, just trying to convey what had happened. .Did she lose too much chakra?* - Sun Nov 22 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) sat up for a moment, just crawling a bit to the couch where she knew that Heiwa was sleeping. Her eyes were too heavy to convey anything for the most part.* - Sun Nov 22 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) slowly had to rest, quickly closing her eyes as she allowed her body to just relax itself. That's all she needed to do herself. . Just relax.* - Sun Nov 22 09:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, walking over to Kokoru. Atleast it gave her an excuse to try and use one of the techniques she had acquired. Her hand drew outwards, as chakra would slowly begin to imbue around the center of her hand, overlapping it in a emerald green-ish tint.

The chakra had slowly stretched outwards. Now if there was an actual arrow lodged in there, then of course, she would remove it first, but if there was none, she would continue with this process, allowing the healing chakra to do it's work and close the wound up.* - Sun Nov 22 21:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Ichirou and Kida..as in the people with Sado. The people I warned the Mizukage about trusting.. - Sun Nov 22 23:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm no medic but the blood loss alone from losing your tongue should be enough to kill him. - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Lord Mizukage! Those two ladies over there want to talk with you! - Sun Nov 22 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...Let me get the brackets together then we'll kick off this tournament. For the time being, there's nothing we can do about Kyubishu's attackers but be prepared to destroy them upon location. - Sun Nov 22 23:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: But this new kid might have a few tricks up his sleeve. - Mon Nov 23 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. Let round one begin! - Mon Nov 23 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Come on, Yumiko. You've got this.. - Mon Nov 23 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Does this put me against Kana? Or is there someone else I'd be fighting? - Mon Nov 23 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, just walking over towards Kokoru, who seemed the most fucked up.* - Mon Nov 23 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Good. ..The winner is Yumiko. Kokoru you did a good job. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Next fight. Heiwa, Nori. You're up next. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Against Nori.. - Mon Nov 23 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sir, are you sure about this? If Nori is healing him up just before the match she'll be at a disadvantage. - Mon Nov 23 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'm sure. She'll be fiiine.  - Mon Nov 23 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had spaced out fo a moment, "Yup. Deja vu. What is this, the second time?" she asked jokingly before clasping her hands together and moving through a few handseals, bringing a hand over to his arm as a means for the damage to slowly thin and the wounds to close up. Her control was becoming a lot better from the looks of it considering how fast the wounds were closing up.* - Mon Nov 23 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alright. Heiwa, Nori. Get in place.  - Mon Nov 23 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, okay. - Mon Nov 23 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Over here. - Mon Nov 23 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Quickly jacket. - Mon Nov 23 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nonchalantly moved to the opposite side of the area, nodding once towards Heiwa, "As ready as I'll ever be." he said to Heiwa, nodding once during this moment.* - Mon Nov 23 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsurugi, Shi(Kyotoshien) whispers: Am...am I interrupting anything? - Mon Nov 23 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had brought a hand upwards also, a bit perplexed, but had decided to say nothing more. Forming the seal of confrontation, the young girl would merely wait for a moment, to grasp the situation she was placed in. She inhaled deeply, just trying to keep a clear head as a hand moved to her tanto as soon as the seal of confrontation was done, dropping her opposing hand and unsheathing the blade, more than likely saying that she was ready at this point.

Because fuck getting the first attack in, she ain't crazy, damnit.* - Mon Nov 23 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: Ah the wooden tanto. Been a while since I've seen it. - Mon Nov 23 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) for the moment, was only trying to keep herself relaxed and composed, the tanto blade being held upwards with both hands as she angled the blade to the side, allowing the steel blade to hit against the wooden fabric. She grits her teeth, taking a quick step backwards.

She was still slowly trying to get a good read on Heiwa's reflexes. For now, she leaned inwards, rushing on forwards towards the little kid. The first thing that Nor had done was swing the blade downwards, trying to use her height to her advantage as the blade rushed down to the young kid's chest.* - Mon Nov 23 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to quicky adjust a bit once Heiwa had motioned to the side of her and even moved past her for the most part. She kept her eyes blatantly on the boy as he moved with the intent to flank her. Her knees bent, she would push off into a lunge, feeling the wooden blade's edges practically swipe against her back. The mere pressure was enough for her to feel the wind standing on her the strands of hair she had for just a brief moment.

If anything, if that was an actual blade, it would've cut through a bit of the hoodie and the long strands of hair that fell to her back. Might've left a thin cut also, but hey, moving on. She didn't bother to turn around entirely however because if she were to do that, then she might not have had enough time to move away from the strike itself.

Skidding on the side of her feet, she would spin on her heels, keeping the blade in position. This time, her right hand moved into he backpouch, removing up to three shuriken. She continued this motion backwards to get a clearer distance away from the young boy before flicking the three shurikens forwards, aiming for the chest area.* - Mon Nov 23 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa. Stop holding back. You hold back and fail to show your true ability and your men won't respect you. - Mon Nov 23 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Interesting. - Mon Nov 23 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened for the most part as she did not really notice Heiwa moving like she did. The shurikens dropped quickly for the most part as she looked back, feeling the quick strike on her shoulder. She was not that fast. Not yet, atleast so the bokken slammed into her shoulder.

A sudden wave of pain emitted through her body, but she would grab onto the tanto with her free hand. She turned on the balls of her feet quickly, trying to discern where Heiwa had gone to before, once more, the young medic rushed over to his position, blade caught upwards almost as if she was going to try to stab into the boy.

Only that wasn't the case as she had motioned her arm upwards, aiming to tackle im to the ground instead. Yup. Using the same elbow that got hit too. . .Why? . . .. Well, why not?* - Mon Nov 23 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was already in a bit of a fit. Yes, by now everyone should know she didn't rely on jutsus or anything, but just weaponry and even that was a what if for her. The chains merely wrapping themselves around her frame tightly and just her trying to struggle against it, but more than likely failing.

Chains were no joke, man, like seriously. She just felt something gnawing at her head for a moment, though she just fought it off for the most part. Whatever it was anyway. Yeah, she was going to fail at this point anyway.* - Mon Nov 23 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Mon Nov 23 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Hm. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It was a test, or at lest I believe so. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aaah. - Mon Nov 23 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: They're the ones mentioned. Ichiro and Kida.  - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Daki's the name. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I like long walks on the beach, and beautiful women. - Mon Nov 23 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hired out to you? - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I was not informed of this. - Mon Nov 23 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . ..  I wanted to stay there longer. . - Mon Nov 23 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had stayed on the ground for a moment, just. . blinking and looking down. She inched her head to the side and got up. . Or Heiwa helped her up. One of the two.* - Mon Nov 23 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: And that's how you say bye bye to someone. - Mon Nov 23 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: Well we're done for today. I'll be back around later. - Mon Nov 23 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, inching her head to the side, "Sure, I suppose. . Lemme see. ." Atleast she could go back into her field in peace. Since that was all she really knew. Hooray for pure support. .. White mage bitch.* - Mon Nov 23 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Does this mean I have to take the Chuunin Exams? - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: I hope so! What an adventure! - Mon Nov 23 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) brought a hand out as chakra would begin to pulse on outwards. An emerald green hue had begun to overtake the wounds and within a matter of seconds the wound would have closed up. It wasn't anything too serious, but she wanted to take whatever chances she got to train the technique to do so.* - Mon Nov 23 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. Lets have lots of ramen, dumplings, and tea.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well. . I am hungry. So sure. - Mon Nov 23 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Have fun, you guys! - Mon Nov 23 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Dumplings and tea.~ Mmmm.~ - Mon Nov 23 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had followed behind, though still in a bit of thought, "Same. Lots of the tea too." she said, placing her hands into her pockets nonchalantly.* - Mon Nov 23 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) taps her chin for a moment, "Uhhh, like a mission squad, or. . ?" she asked, grasping onto one of the sticks of dumplings and just biting into the first one she saw, wolfing it down, basically.* - Mon Nov 23 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sort of. But more of a permanent one.. - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Confused. - Mon Nov 23 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So like a faction then? - Mon Nov 23 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not really. We'd still be a part of the village..just a group together for the sake of missions. - Mon Nov 23 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No I mean like. . an inter-village faction.  - Mon Nov 23 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. What do you think, Yumiko? - Mon Nov 23 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I rather us three remain together... - Mon Nov 23 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. That's what I meant by a squad.. - Mon Nov 23 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But, uh, we're always..going to be together, right? In that house? - Mon Nov 23 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Our house, home,heaven. - Mon Nov 23 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: But then the fire nation attacked. - Mon Nov 23 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good.~  - Mon Nov 23 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Nori-chan. - Mon Nov 23 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm? - Mon Nov 23 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah, Yumi? - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Need help practicing jutsu? - Mon Nov 23 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Somewhat, yeah. Merely the low ranking one I have. Diagnosis. - Mon Nov 23 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to head out? - Mon Nov 23 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It can be done here or outside, if you want.  - Mon Nov 23 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm also going to be mastering my techniques so outside will be better. - Mon Nov 23 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. Maybe I can see what it does to you also. - Mon Nov 23 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If that makes sense. - Mon Nov 23 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well then, shall we go? - Mon Nov 23 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, getting up and stretching before gesturing to Yumiko to go first.* - Mon Nov 23 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had taken her time to narrow her eyes onto the arrow. She was not exactly a good person when it came to telling how far back something could go, so she just nodded her head once and clapped her hands.

"It went pretty far. . I can't tell how far. .meters? A couple of meters away." She said with a bit of a nod before she looked back at Yumiko, focusing her eyes onto her to see if her body had changed because of it. She pinpointed the organs, the bloodstream, the arm and bones to see if there were any problems or how they moved as she did her training.

"Hmm. . This new look with the human body is rather . .weird." she thought to herself.* - Mon Nov 23 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi. - Mon Nov 23 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . - Mon Nov 23 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Dot dot dot. - Mon Nov 23 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Just keep spacing out like always. Probably better than nothing. . Wait. . Same thing. - Mon Nov 23 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had a cardboard sword in her hand, just swinging it down on Heiwa's head, "Boom, I win." * - Mon Nov 23 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) smiles for a moment, nodding before she sat down on the couch with the rest of them, "Now, now, you should've been ready." she said, yawning for a moment before looking around.

"Anyway, what's up?"* - Mon Nov 23 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Talking about Kumo. Wondering if the kage is planning to do anything against it.. - Mon Nov 23 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's a mystery but after what he said he might be planning something in general. - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Who might be what, what? - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mizukage. - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What'd he say? - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm? Yeah, what did he say? - Tue Nov 24 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Say. . Uhh.. Heiwa? - Tue Nov 24 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah? - Tue Nov 24 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. . If you don't mind. . Where did those chains come from? - Tue Nov 24 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . . - Tue Nov 24 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's a jutsu. A hiden in Kirigakure. Curious about them? - Tue Nov 24 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . In a way. . Yeah. . - Tue Nov 24 02:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, "I'll. . See what I can do. " She said for a moment as she tried to follow along with the same sequence of handseals. Her hand had moved to the ground,  though she had no idea what she was going to do after she had done this. Of course no chains had stretched on outwards, which meant that it had done nothing.

She was a bit confused at that, but inched her head to the side, maybe she did it too quickly or maybe it was just something else for the most part. She took a few more steps backwards, and this time kept her hands clasped as she was on a crouching level.

Nori had to keep her focus onto the ground as a hand moved to the side. She rose it upwards and with a quick lunge downwards, she would slam her hand onto the surface of the ground once more, this time she felt a pulsing from the ground, but only that. Nothing had happened, nor was there wa target in mind for it to actually come to fruition.

She straightened herself out, stretching a few times before she would try to mimic Heiwa. Her hands clasped together, fingers interlocking with one another as she narrowed her eyes onto the bush in question. She slowly moved her digits from side to side, as the handseals were being formed.

At the formation of the final one, she would slam her hand onto the ground as a rush of chakra would quickly pulsate around her physique, lunging towards the bush as the sounds of rattling chains were heard lunging upwards, intertwining and enclosing around the bush. Her eyes widened but she said nothing. .

Other than take out a small honey bun and bite into it. . She had a sweet tooth after learning jutsus, now. . Don't judge.* - Tue Nov 24 05:19:08 2015
