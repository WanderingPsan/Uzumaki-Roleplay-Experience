Okay, almost slamming into the fence. She groans out loud, holding at her side as she forced herself up, "I'm beginning to get the feeling this isn't a spar. . !" She exclaimed, looking at part of the fence. She gripped at the tanto and tried to cut into it.

Was she planning something?* - Sat Dec 12 02:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, "But. . I just got a plan. ." She said that but then sighed, waving a hand dismissively.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: As is Nori. Learning how to fight in the mist is important - at least to being able to survive in it. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Nori is a medic - If they fought normally it'd be strictly in Tengoku's favor. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Yumiko, you handle one side of the field, I'll handle the other? - Sat Dec 12 15:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to rose a single hand upwards, forming half of the seal of confrontation. She inhaled deeply, getting ready for the amount of fuckery she was about to get herself into. . That last hidden mist battle didn't. . really run well with the young medic. . at all. . She just mentally shook her head and tried to focus onto where Tengoku was at the moment.* - Sat Dec 12 15:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *TAKES HIS EYES* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *omit* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes narrowed for a moment, hearing the steps. . Unlike Yumiko who chose to mask her steps, Tengoku was making it quite apparent with his movements. She clasped her hands together and moved them in a simple seal, allowing a wasp of chakra to emit around her as well as smoke before she moved southwest of the field. The fast pacing would've made it obvious, but she decided to take it a step further than that. She kept her eyes closed. .

Her right hand mvoed right under her buttpouch, fumbling for a few things. .* - Sat Dec 12 15:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) didn't hear the other Tengoku. . Not because of the mixture of sounds, but because well.  It was a regular clone. . Those clones are practically intangible, so for them to be used in such a way would've been off putting. Removing a small poison bomb, she flung it upwards, into the direction she had heard quickly.

A popping sound would've been heard within the mist and Tengoku might have saw the small ball dropping in his general location as a vast assortment of mist and smog had covered his view. It might have led on to where she was, but for now, she had to keep things discrete and what not. She removed another small thing that he dropped  to the ground.

(Gonna be discrete with the things due to you not being able to see in the mist if that is okay with you.)* - Sat Dec 12 16:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) smirks for a moment, "Nausea. . Good. ." She thought to herself as she kept the tag there. She heard the foot steps that came afterwards and quickly tried to pinpoint where they were. Furling a handseal, she would dissappear in a plume of smoke once more as the tag was set.

He appeared behind Tengoku this time, smiling from ear to ear. . If it was possible, she would quickly lunge her foot upwards. Not to kick him to the side. . But to spartan kick him back into the smog. . At this point, she was just trolling the guy.

Not like the poison was enough to kill anyway!* - Sat Dec 12 17:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) smirked a bit as he fell to the ground. She wasn't done as she moved through the handseals quickly-- though they were soon cut short with a punch to the stomach. Her eyes widened before she could manage, feeling another kick to the back and then a sweep kick.

She was forced face first into the ground, causing her to stumble for a moment. It broke her concentration, but she did let out a loud groan. Her hands were clasped in her hands once more, so she tried to remain calm. If he got too close, she could get the upper hand at this point as her hand was calmly placed on the surface of the ground afterwards. .

She groaned even further to administer how much pain she was in right now, but waited.* - Sat Dec 12 17:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) smirks for a moment. . The moment she saw the shadow above her due to him being close. . . 'Caught you. .' she thought as the chakra on the ground pulsed. .Before he could send the kick forth, chains would rush up, some brushing against Noris frame, but all aimed for Tengoku as he aimed to go forth with his chain of attacks once more..

They all aimed to bind around the boy, keeping him immobilized.* - Sat Dec 12 17:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Are those groans? Or..moans?  - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Eww Nori. - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's palms were still on the ground, gripping tightly onto the surface of the ground as she pushed on upwards. The chains had failed to catch it's target, which was a bd thing for her, yet at the same time a good thing since it meant the fight wasn't going to end quickly. She pushed off the ground, as he tried to encircle her and kick her, noticing the blurring kick in motion as she was airbourne.

Quickly, she would remove a kunai with an explosive tag, and throw it to the ground, 'This is gonna sting!' she thought as she furled her hand into a single sign, allowing the explosion to emit, blasting Tengoku if he continued to tread closer and her beng airbourne due to the shockwave, possibly getting out of the mist due to the amount of elevation there was to that thing.* - Sat Dec 12 19:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) grooooans on the ground, ". .  Not the right idea. .Oww. ." she mumbled.* - Sat Dec 12 19:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had accepted the help, pulling herself up and keeping the cloak around, "I'm fine. ." She said, taking a few curt steps back.* - Sat Dec 12 20:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nodded for a moment as she would begin to have a few things going through her head as she begun to move through the single handseal once more, "Let it flow like a river stream?" It was a bit weird to think of it like that, but she could try. A nod was seen as she furled the tiger handseal once more, inhaling deeply as she did so.

Her chest expanded a bit, though it was natural before she leaned her head in once more, thinking that water had formed in her lungs. . Exhaling quickly. . Just more blibbering spit! Seriously, now?!* - Sun Dec 13 03:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) sighs, "Been thinking for a bit. ." She mumbled for a moment, though aside from that small bit of talk, she kept the handseal going. Nodding to Sekitsui to affirm that Nori knew she was there, the young medic still kept the handseal going, inhaling deeply as she was beginning to. . . get the hand of at least the posture of all of this! Aside from that, she was still being annoyed by how grueling this process was.

Inhaling, chakra kneading within the throat and lungs, she kept her demeanor calm as she tried to coat her throat with suiton chakra before exhaling. . There was small blobs of water that chucked out of her mouth, falling to the ground. . At least there was some form of improvement in it.* - Sun Dec 13 03:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The missions should be kept in mind - but I have a question first: What's your element, Nori? - Sun Dec 13 12:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Water. - Sun Dec 13 12:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: What'd she do? - Sun Dec 13 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: She told me to generate water through my mouth. - Sun Dec 13 12:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ? - Sun Dec 13 12:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I manage to spit out blobs. - Sun Dec 13 12:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Of..water, right? - Sun Dec 13 12:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Tell me they weren't making spit bubbles. - Sun Dec 13 12:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm! - Sun Dec 13 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Good. Can you show me it? - Sun Dec 13 12:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had nodded for just a moment as she was still practicing this. Hands clasped together, the medic would begin to move through the single handseal -tiger- and inhale deeply, allowing her chest to expand a tad bit before she would  exhale. As she did this, a small wad of water blobs spat out on the ground. .. Poorly made and stuff, but it was better than nothing in Nori's head. .She wasn't that good in offensive jutsus.* - Sun Dec 13 13:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: See? - Sun Dec 13 13:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . Yeah. Alright then. - Sun Dec 13 13:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. How about we work on a primarily defensive jutsu then for now? - Sun Dec 13 13:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure.  - Sun Dec 13 13:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes had looked at the water for a moment before nodding once. She fiddled with her cloak just to keep herself warm before she clasped her hands together. She first did the first few handseals. . Rather one seal, the seal of confrontation. This seemed a lot more easier than just getting right down to business and making your own source. Plus it gave Nori a better chance at testing the jutsu then anything else.

Chakra was stretched out to the water as she would try to trickle and break down thewater components enough for it to turn to mist. So far? Nothing had came out of it, "Hmm. . Manipulation of water around me. . So maybe I put too little chakra?" She asked, looking at Heiwa with a bit of wonder.* - Sun Dec 13 14:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) frowned for a moment, "Uhhm. . Right." She said as she would keep the handseal up. She didn't know what had gotten into her all of a sudden, but she wanted to keep going with this kind of technique. Her hands furled into the final handseal as chakra was pumped into the water. As this was happening, swivels of small particles of mist. . Just rose up. . foot level. .Not a lot of mist to cover an area at all.

Her frown continued, but she was used to this kind of thing when it came to learning techniques. It didn't mean she liked it, just that she was only used to it enough that she could actually keep going with it, "Say, Heiwa. . I've been thinking. .Even with Kana as the mizukage. .We still don't have an actual medical head, right?" She asked as she was still trying to input more chakra into the technique to further it.* - Sun Dec 13 15:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) kept even more chakra pumped into the water to increase the amount of mist. It grew and expanded for the most part, "Yeah. . I wanted to try to go for it for the longest time. . " She mumbled out loud. More mist was going over head and covering both Heiwa's and Nori's vision. She sighed faintly, "Ugh. . Heiwa. . More water training after this?" She asked, arching her brow. He did say something about wanting to do some missions.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uhm. I wouldn't mind. .  I have  a mission to go there also. . Bringing a message to Sunagakure. .. Maybe that could go along with it as well? - Sun Dec 13 15:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I mean. .The incoming goods. . - Sun Dec 13 15:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to write out the small letter, removing a pen and paper. She made sure the cargo was set up and had begun to take into account what she was going to write. Her eyes turned to Heiwa, poking him, "Hey, Heiwa? What should I put for this letter? What's being delivered or?"* - Sun Dec 13 16:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Sun Dec 13 16:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arches a brow for a moment, "Do you honestly think Kana would do a letter without any snarky remarks or crude insults?" She asked as they were still in the caravan coming here. She frowned. . I mean, they might have known Kana for a short while.  . Well, Nori only knew her for a short while, but she tended to be a bitch about the slight things. . . . Yup. Good reason to do this.

She then whispered lowly, "Plus remember, it was you that made the alliance with Suna back then. . I believe..  Not Kana. . I don't think she even knows about it, you know?" A lot of good reasons to not fuck up a mission or a young alliance. . * - Sun Dec 13 16:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: It's been way too long. - Sun Dec 13 17:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had basic weaponry and medical tools on her. She didn't bother to come out of the doorway yet until it had finished. . She had been finished for the most part. That was done finally.* - Sun Dec 13 17:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You may come in.  - Sun Dec 13 17:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm doing well, how about you? - Sun Dec 13 17:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) finally got out of the caravan, "Hmm, heya." He said as he would begin to sign the letter and place it into the envelope before reading. She walked over to Izanami, smiling and handing her the note, "Inside this is a letter from the Mizukage. It comes with a Cargo for goods from the village and the list of goods is in the letter along with some gratifying words with the letter." She said this with a curt nod.

Following that was a smile, but she said nothing more as she had to wait for Izanami to take all of this in.
