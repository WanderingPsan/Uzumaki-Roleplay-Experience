<br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah, it's fone then. - Fri Nov 27 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm gonna train my techniques for a bit. . Wanna come along, Heiwa? - Fri Nov 27 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sure. - Fri Nov 27 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to read herself for the most part, stretching her right and left arm before looking back over towards Heiwa as she arched a brow, "This might help you also. . Uhm. . How good is your sight?" She asked, as she was slowly moving through a few handseals.* - Fri Nov 27 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, finishing the last bit of handseals, "I want you to try and find a fish. Just point in the general direction of it and I will try to summon the chains to trap it in the chains."* - Fri Nov 27 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment as she would inhale for a moment, rising a hand upwards before slamming it into the ground. She tried to follow where he was pointing as the sound of a light cracking sound through the earth under the water. The chains had risen upwards, but she couldn't tell if the chains had caught onto the fish or not.

She was using someone else's sight in order to help her out in her training, so in a way it was using two birds with one stone!

"Did I get it?" she asked Heiwa, turning her head.* - Fri Nov 27 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) frowns for a moment, "Let's go again." She said, hands already moving through the seals, "If all else fails, then I guess we can try and find something like a wolf or something outside to help. Plus, it could help you with your training too." She said, as she would turn her head just for a moment,

Hands had already formed the final handseal, "Alright, let's try again and hi, Yumiko."* - Fri Nov 27 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm thinking about going hunting. - Fri Nov 27 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arches a brow, before looking quickly to the direction he was pointing and slamming a hand onto the ground as chakra emitted from the ground and outwards. This time another chain had shot outwards, aiming on wrapping itself around the fish. She didn't know if it had worked like before, so she was relying on Heiwa to do that in her place.

"Hmm? Maybe after this we can. Or maybe we can go right now. What do you think, Heiwa?" She asked.* - Fri Nov 27 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: What are they staring off into the distance for? - Fri Nov 27 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets all go.~ - Fri Nov 27 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Water..water. Water you doing? The gentle waves push and pull. I cry.. - Fri Nov 27 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Such a sad life that I live, without even being able to feast upon the flesh of the unsuspected evils of this world! What is true sustenance? - Fri Nov 27 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Alas! Woe..is I! - Fri Nov 27 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) sighed, getting up and stretching for a moment, "Alright. To the forest then?" * - Fri Nov 27 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I must walk the path of justice.. - Fri Nov 27 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Slaying those who refuse to accept -my- ways! - Fri Nov 27 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: For to refuse justice..is to refuse order. - Fri Nov 27 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Without order..there is only..--...EVIL! - Fri Nov 27 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Gosh. I'm glad my reasoning isn't that flawed. - Fri Nov 27 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: So what if I kill people. Does that really make me a bad guy? - Fri Nov 27 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: So what if I happen to trip and rip off someone's skin. Accidents happen. - Fri Nov 27 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Hanging out with these children has warmed my heart. I'll become a better priest. - Fri Nov 27 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: T'was brillig, and the slithy toves... - Fri Nov 27 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I'm truly misunderstood. - Fri Nov 27 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: All I want is someone to l-l--loooo.... - Fri Nov 27 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: What... - Fri Nov 27 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) grasped onto Heiwa's hand, following behind the two and looking back at Nigen, "Later, mask guy." she said.* - Fri Nov 27 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I feel as if..they're leaving me behind because of my "Fiery" hair. - Fri Nov 27 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ready? - Fri Nov 27 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah - what're we going for? - Fri Nov 27 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Deer, boars, everything. - Fri Nov 27 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mmmm. I could try to capture a deer. - Fri Nov 27 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'll help.~ - Fri Nov 27 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Alright. Hmm. .I'll chain it up, you do the rest? - Fri Nov 27 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Fri Nov 27 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) looks around for the most part, "Heiwa, like last time?"* - Fri Nov 27 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright we both chain and I'll try to finish it off. - Fri Nov 27 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Am I the spotter? - Fri Nov 27 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Just for now. You can help Yumiko finish it off. - Fri Nov 27 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had already begun to move through a few handseals, inhaling deeply as she heard around the area, trying to hear what was odd amounts of rustling, or something that sounded like breathing. Of course she was not intune enough with her hearing to hear breathing, so rustling sounds were a lot easier to her.* - Fri Nov 27 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had quickly looked over to where they both were staing at, spotting a deer. She kept her hands furled into the final seal and walked only afew steps close, careful to not step on anything that might give away his postion faster than normal. She looked down and with a quick launch of her hand, she placed it delicately onto the surface of the ground.

Chakra jutted into the ground and before she knew it, the chains had appeared right under the deer, aiming on entangling it and restricting it's movments. Thanks goodness for land animals, am I right?* - Fri Nov 27 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) maintained the chains. It was all he could do for now.* - Fri Nov 27 08:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: That's....awful. - Fri Nov 27 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still focusing chakra into the ground, but then blinked a few times. She released the chakra for the most part and looked up, "Uhm. . What is it?" She asked before standing back up and turning her head curtly southwards to take note of the newcomer.

"Uhhh?" She mumbled for a moment, inching her head to the side.* - Fri Nov 27 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that's how you hunt? - Fri Nov 27 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Looks more like you are trying to scare it to death. - Fri Nov 27 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you...mind? - Fri Nov 27 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Mind? - Fri Nov 27 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 27 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Me ending it's suffering. - Fri Nov 27 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What do you mean scare it to death? - Fri Nov 27 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Look at how it's crying. - Fri Nov 27 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yawns* - Fri Nov 27 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hello.~ - Fri Nov 27 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: How are you? - Fri Nov 27 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey. - Fri Nov 27 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi. - Fri Nov 27 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ... - Sat Nov 28 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nothing to do 'round here. - Sat Nov 28 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeaah. . - Sat Nov 28 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'd rather roam the forests, but then the Mizukage might come for my neck. - Sat Nov 28 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And what will a weak little boy like me be doing in the forests? - Sat Nov 28 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Taking down bandits and rogues? - Sat Nov 28 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Probably not. - Sat Nov 28 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, you up for more training? - Sat Nov 28 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: If you're a smart weak boy, then you will know being patient is better. And sure.  - Sat Nov 28 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: True. - Sat Nov 28 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm weak also. So I guess I can relate. - Sat Nov 28 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Is it alright if I watch you guys train? - Sat Nov 28 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't mind. - Sat Nov 28 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is an interesting trainig spot. - Sat Nov 28 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nodded for the most part as she inched her head to the side, "Well, I mean. . Yeah." She said this with a bit of a dismissive look on her face. Her hands furled into a simple seal that was mimicing Heiwa's Seal of Confrontation. 

She snapped out of the daze as she was positioning herself to try and do the jutsu, hands clasped together, eyes focusing on Heiwa, "Well, if that is the case." Her hands were already on the verge of doing handseals.

She slams her hands onto the surface of the ground, watching as the chakra poured into the ground and shot upwards towards Heiwa, aiming on entangling him in chains.

Of couse she did it without much of a warning, aside from the confrontation seal.* - Sat Nov 28 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hello.~ - Sat Nov 28 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nori, that chain technique is kinda interesting. - Sat Nov 28 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It's practically the only offensive thing I know, to be frank. - Sat Nov 28 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Frank. . What does that even mean. - Sat Nov 28 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'd say you can use me as practice, but I'm far too easy for you to make any gains. - Sat Nov 28 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sometimes I wonder if you're only saying that or not. - Sat Nov 28 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: You may be very strong and just hiding your talent. - Sat Nov 28 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's true. - Sat Nov 28 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: To be "frank," I'm only really talented in the art of Shunshin. - Sat Nov 28 05:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times and just clasped her hands together, "Hmmm. . Lemme try to . " She said for a moment as she inhaled deeply. Chakra had jutted around her legs as she would quickly lean in forwards. With a quick blur thanks to Shunshin, she would quickly dissappear, and in a sudden splash. . .

It was evident how far she really went, "Ahhhh!" She exclaimed.* - Sat Nov 28 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinked a few times as she was picked up from the water, deadpan expression before she was placed down, "Ugghhhh. . None of you saw that, okay?" She asked, keeping on the ground in a fetal position just to show her embarrasment. . Hrnnng, why?* - Sat Nov 28 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's fine. - Sat Nov 28 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It bappens from time to time. - Sat Nov 28 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: So, we've seen your chains, Nori. - Sat Nov 28 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You gals have seen my expert Shunshin skills. - Sat Nov 28 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Is there something you specialize in, Yumiko? - Sat Nov 28 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm an elementalist, but I picked up shunshin as well. I can't attack while using it but it helps when a strong attack is heading your way.~ - Sat Nov 28 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's pretty cool. - Sat Nov 28 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Which element, or elements, do you specialize in? - Sat Nov 28 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Suiton.~ - Sat Nov 28 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Neat. - Sat Nov 28 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Suiton is actually one of my elements.~ - Sat Nov 28 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe you could teach me a jutsu sometime. - Sat Nov 28 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mmm..  - Sat Nov 28 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) claps her hands together and decided to troll for a moment. She moved through a few handseals and with a quick hand slam, chains would begin to morph from the ground upwards, aiming on entangling around Tengoku!

"Surprise!"* - Sat Nov 28 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes had widened as it appeared her luck was sadly shortlived. The chains from Yumiko had shot on outwards, wrapping around her and keepig her still, "A-Ah! Hey!" She exclaimed for a moment, trying to struggle around the chains that binded around her.

She then noticed that it was Yumiko as she was just combing he hair. She blinked a few times, then looked down, just struggling a bit silently.* - Sat Nov 28 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hard to break free? - Sat Nov 28 07:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: We went on a mission to Konoha. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tried to harass a woman. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ended up punching a defense mechanism type of thing. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And it broke into shard and pierced him all over his body. - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was the mission about? Why were there no guards brought with him? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Because to be frank, he was being stupid. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No offense. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Suicidal coot. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Who's this 'new mizukage'? - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Don't know. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Never seen 'em. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure the spot has been even filled? - Mon Nov 30 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Not too sure. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just a rumor I heard. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And the power vacuum starts again. There are only two candidates Liu would have in mind. - Mon Nov 30 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I cou - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I wouldn't have been able to react fast enough to pull him out before the shars got him. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then again, it was only a jutsu used to defend the woman, not harm the Godaime. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He decided to punch through it, and then the crystals shattered. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: *sigh* - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Crystal? Was the one who used said technique - did they have purple hair? - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I recall correctly, yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I was just thinking the samething. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I think he was originally from this village as well. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it's that person he wasn't originally from Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's from Konohagakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He did reside here at one point or another, correct? - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's odd. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu offered him a transfer to the village on temporary probation. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He lost a fight and was criticized for his fighting style. Reacting negatively he stormed off - he was thereafter exiled from the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From the sounds of that he made a new technique, however. Finally took the advice I gave him to heart..in order to kill the Mizukage. - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Though I must say. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It seems as if that man never meant to kill Lord Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu put himself in that situation. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That's much easier to say than Lord Liu, or Lord Mizukage, or the Godaime. But that's disrespectful. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Regardless I should have killed him. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Why do you say that? - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because if I did then it might not have happen and he might be alive today. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The thing is, Yumiko, it's not quite Abraxes's fault. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Besides - Liu was unfit for the job. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori can attest to that. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A few months prior he handed us his hat and mentioned he was going to 'walk off into the woods and die.' - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then there is the matter of how he became Mizukage to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I still can't believe it though. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tells me to scout Konohagakure, and get a "feel" for it. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A feel for it? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Was he..intending to attack Konoha? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then he transforms into me, and waltzes right into the villages, trying to feel a woman's knockers. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, like the type of people, the environment. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's presence, whatever you may call it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He was -very- unfit. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: To think he made -me- his "bodyguard." - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I'm too weak for that type of stuff. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Regardless of how unfit he was, he at least prepared for the future.  - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fighting over who the Mizukage is won't be necessary. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are two candidates. One of which is the captain of the general military of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How come? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The other? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The other is the captain of the binding and genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other is the captain of the binding and the genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The two highest ranks made by the Mizukage before his death. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How will either of them be chosen? - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More by whomever fully chooses the title than anything.  - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that - well it depends on various other factors.  - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I predict it will go to the military captain - Kana. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana, I've heard of her. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The name sounds familiar. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a chunnin of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong fighter too. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I imagine she is, at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: She might be able to teach me a trick or two. - Mon Nov 30 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: From Chuunin, to Captain of the General Military, to Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's quite the jump. - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not nearly as large of a jump as some kages in the past. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Including Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Where did he start? - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fresh from the academy basically. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What!? - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Tha-That's crazy. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirigakure has not been in strong straits for the last couple of months.. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt Liu made much of an announcement of my rank. Beyond Yumiko and Nori at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That, I know. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's about time that we fix it, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. The people in Kiri deserve better than what we've had. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Agreed. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You are correct. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Heiwa? - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait, I'm probably wrong. - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hewai? - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That sounds right. - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You had it right the first time. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi, that's embarrassing.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Excuse me, Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm .. I should try containment after medical works, to be honest. . - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
