<br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Closer, stand beside me. - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The three of you are on a mission. I've been seperated from the group. - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What does Heiwa have planned? - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You see the faint outline of a rogue shinobi infront of you.  - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You have one minute to get into position. - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Protect Nori, disable Tengoku, however you choose to play it. - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi.~ A mock mission encounter? - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is gonna be over rather quickly. I'll try to last as long as I could against them. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll just say this. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I tap you, let's say you've been assassinated. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just for the sake of the training. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have one better. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Wait, what? - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can still uh. . Defend myself though. . Right? - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...Interesting. - Tue Dec  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had nodded for now, looking around idly just to see if thee was something she could use as a means to get out of the situation without much thought to it. It was then, she realized that not just Sekitsui had moved infront of her and the mist had enshrouded the area. Her arms were brought upwards as the veil of mist obscurred her vision.

She took note on where she was currently and had begun to just lightly remove a small tag. There was a bit of thought on wondering if this was a good idea or not since it was just a training simulation, but why not spice things up. . Right? She placed it on the ground before trying to move further back.* - Tue Dec  1 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Why did I do that if I can't see? - Tue Dec  1 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to snap her fingers for the most part, just keeping up the pace of going back and away from the direction that Sekitsui might have spotted her at. She would have used Shunshin, but then again, that mgiht have been a problem for her when it came to jumping at the tree.

Quickly sprinting eastwards, she would kneel a bit, lunging upwards as she launched herself into the nearby tree. Upon moving into the bushes of the tree, her hands quickly motioned into the backpouch, fumbling and taking out a tag and two moderately sized spheres that fit into her palm entirely.

She placed the tag on the branch she was on currently and motioned her foot over it so that it would be out of sight when the moment had risen.* - Tue Dec  1 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) is just. . being cute and hiding. . .You know?* - Tue Dec  1 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still hiding in the tree. . Lalalala. . She wasn't taking any chances. She was already in position damnit!* - Tue Dec  1 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If this was on me would any of you be the wiser? - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique itself could hinder you in many ways. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Be careful with that jutsu, Yumiko. - Tue Dec  1 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I would have acted differently, I only use it to make it harder to shunshin an attack as quickly as he could since Nori could have been the first target of such a stratagy. - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Paper* - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Can I come out now?! - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes. You can come out. - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps. Not every hostage will be a shinobi, however. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every hostage will be capable of stating they're tagged.  - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Around near any person it's a good idea to be careful. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or develop some sensory ability. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The situation was saving -you-, our squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) pushed off of the branch, falling on the ground, feet first. She staggeed a bit forwards and walked over to pick up the explosive tag.* - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not a civilian. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah, I screwed over your little lesson. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Nice try though. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This time - don't worry. Feeling around me would have been a mistake. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wasn't a chastisement of you. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lesson itself was rigged against Yumiko's usage of that technique. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't see why her using the technique was a bad thing. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong. Invaluable even. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't understand. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But it can have detriments. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Collateral..unintentional actions or results - the use of the mist blinds us as shinobis from being able to react. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ....oh that jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I thought you meant the other one. - Tue Dec  1 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Tengoku, you aren't hurt, right? - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Yes - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I feel like I could have fotten murdered in that mist. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You're lucky you moved. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I was about to knock you out. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: OOC OFF - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Having her train against Yumiko or Nori could be hard. She'd likely even be capable of being me too. Especially in Taijutsu. - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Her using that jutsu helped me. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But I mean, she didn't know it would. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Just worked out. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Your sense of hearing synergized well. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Similar to mine. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No, smell. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I smelled him. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And you. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Again - interesting. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll work well in the team then. Only one who still has difficulty from what I've seen if Nori herself.~ - Tue Dec  1 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks. - Tue Dec  1 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll do some together, but much of that is reliant on you personally. - Tue Dec  1 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm okay. - Tue Dec  1 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah . . . Wait, difficulty in what? - Tue Dec  1 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Finding your way around the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. . That kinda. . wasn't something I expected. - Tue Dec  1 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If only Nori ran my way. - Tue Dec  1 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sparring someone that outmatches me doesn't make me stronger, it makes me weaker. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just need to train harder. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You need allies to grow. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It isn't. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: It is though...I fought you wearing weights the entire time....Had I fought you with them off. The fight would have been much shorter. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Exactly, that isn't training. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But I fought you -with- weights. So that I can increase my speed and stamina. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I still want to practice with my bow. Do you two think you can avoid my shots? - Wed Dec  2 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Make sure to tone down the power of your attacks.. - Wed Dec  2 04:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Because dodging arrows is as hard as dodging your first crazy ex. *omit* - Wed Dec  2 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm alright then.~ - Wed Dec  2 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You two should spread out. - Wed Dec  2 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods, taking a few curt steps backwards. . Well, three steps backwards, "Is this good?"* - Wed Dec  2 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) takes a few steps further back, but was still keeping a close eye on Sekitsui. More importantly, she was looking at her bow.* - Wed Dec  2 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to keep an eye on Yumiko still, though from afar, it was still difficult to tell when she was going to shoot. She wasn't as perceptive as the normal person, so this might have been difficult for her. She proceeded to move  a bit eastwards, trying to keepherself running so that she would be a possible harder target if Yumiko aimed at her.* - Wed Dec  2 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened for a moment, quickly as she was trying to keep her pacing up, only realizing she was already running at her max. Fortunately for her, the arrow had just moved past her, 'Oh thank goodness.' She thought to herself. . She then had a thought.

'Why am I running like this agai-- oh my god, almost bumped into the tree' she thought.* - Wed Dec  2 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I just got lucky that time. That's all. - Wed Dec  2 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) stopped in her tracks for a moment. All in all, she was mentally glad that she didn't get hit by an arrow. Inhaling deeply, Nori would walk over towards Sekitsui, kneeling and examining the wound on the girl's leg. Clasping her hands together, she would move through a few handseals and hovered her hands over her ankle, allowing an emerald green tint.

Within moments, the cells would regenerate faster, closing up the wound within minutes,"At least it was not a direct hit." She said.* - Wed Dec  2 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Training. - Wed Dec  2 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We were playing a game of dodge the arrows. - Wed Dec  2 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I mean. . She did dodge a lot better than I did. I only dodged because I kept on running. . - Wed Dec  2 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Eh.. you did good Nori-chan. - Wed Dec  2 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: No, no. You did a lot better than me. Haha. - Wed Dec  2 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, being a medic has it's good times. Can you stand on it now? It wasn't that serious, right? - Wed Dec  2 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah, I'm good. - Wed Dec  2 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry about that. - Wed Dec  2 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: He doesn't look happy. - Wed Dec  2 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) finally got up, taking a few staggering steps backwards and offering to try and pull her up, if that was the case. She looked over to Heiwa and gave him a bit of a thumbs up, "She's all good." She said with a sage nod.* - Wed Dec  2 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Uh...yeah... - Wed Dec  2 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Jeez, they are acting weird. - Wed Dec  2 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: What did I do? - Wed Dec  2 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every dodge happens..Besides, I'd rather not have both of you injured from a spar being lead like that. - Wed Dec  2 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Especially if Yumiko can't keep her power lower - her arrows are too powerful. - Wed Dec  2 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I mean...it wasn't that bad? Would she have actually hurt me badly if I took the full hit? - Wed Dec  2 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Probably. If you had managed to hit Tengoku in the mist, do you think he'd be hurt too? - Wed Dec  2 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: He'd be hurt but I was using a rotation that was slow enough only to cause his body to hurt. - Wed Dec  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And I wouldn't have made him pass out. - Wed Dec  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I would have paused to let him admit defeat. - Wed Dec  2 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You told her to hold back, she was holding back yeah? - Wed Dec  2 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...She says so. If the confrontation was serious, however, that might..mistakes can happen. - Wed Dec  2 07:20:19 2015

She would move through a few handseals, placing a hand over the wound and allowing a emerald green hue to wash over the wound, slowly closing it up. It didn't take too long for it to close up, however.

"Be more careful, alright?"* - Thu Dec  3 05:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arches a brow for a moment, just staring at the odd coloring pigmented liquid that spread across the ground. That seemed promising but at the same time kind of fruitless, "What if someone that was running super fast goes into it? Would they be able to get out?" She asked, folding her arms.

She clasped her hands together, seemingly moving through a direct amount of handseals.* - Thu Dec  3 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, staring at the liquid then at Yumiko whom was walking away from it, "I mean. . It's your jutsu. Can you really get stuck in your own technique?" At least she read that part rather well. It seemed a bit fruitless if she could also get stuck in her jutsu as well.

"So if someone can get out of it, it's by another jutsu or by some kind of other way?" She asked, continuing wth the handseal practices.* - Thu Dec  3 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think so. - Thu Dec  3 19:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) stumbles a bit forward, "Ah!?" She exclaimed, but quickly stood back up, "Atleast ask first." She said, but just stood up with her in tow.* - Thu Dec  3 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Maybe training or no? - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Training can work - I have an idea in mind anyways. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets head out to the fields. - Fri Dec  4 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Alrighty.~ - Fri Dec  4 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. This spot should do. We'll be working on some physical training later on in the day, but with all things there is a balance needed. - Fri Dec  4 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong body is nothing without a strong mind. - Fri Dec  4 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, Yumiko, Nori - Can either of you explain what a genjutsu is?  - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope that's not taken as condescending. - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Jutsu that affect the mind only? - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: It's a chakra attack on the brain. - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. It's a type of jutsu that affects the mind - not the physical realm - through application of chakra on the nervous system of the brain causing the recipient's senses to reflect what the user intends for them to see. - Fri Dec  4 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In other words - what you've both said. It's not used by many as they favor the use of frontal attacks. - Fri Dec  4 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As it cannot kill it is often seen better to use a more physical sense of combat. - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, you may very well find someone who does use genjutsu. In that case are any of you aware of how to counteract that? - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, inching her head to the side. . So pain counters it? She had a few ideas in her head, but she pushed them into the back of her head for the most part as Heiwa had explained the procedure. It was a bit of an interesting insight on how genjutsu could be countered.

Then a thought popped into her head for the most part, "I mean, I read up a bit on genjutsu for the genin exams at least. ." She said, bringing her head upwards, "I mean, yeah if you're in a genjutsu, then you can cancel it with those two ways. But what if you can't tell if you're in a genjutsu?" She at least knew it was difficult to tell whether you were in one or not.

"Like. . If you were to use a genjutsu on us, how would we know if it's one or not?" It would be weird if they were to make fools out of themselves at one point because they couldn't tell between an illusion and reality. . Then again, it would be funny too.* - Fri Dec  4 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . . . What if we are in a genjutsu right now? And this village isn't real? - Fri Dec  4 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good question..There are some ways to discern whether you're in a genjutsu or not. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A genjutsu only affects the senses - it does not affect the world around you. Low leveled genjutsus often will have tells because of this. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If, say, a giant ball of fire is made and is hurling towards you? - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you can visibly see a large body of water appearing still cool to the touch and not reacting in any way against it? - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Of course, a strong enough genjutsu user would make you perceive that body of water also being boiling. - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Staying aware of your senses can keep you from falling into the traps of a genjutsu. - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, "Uhm. . Alright. I guess that works." She said with a nod. . . Though. . She still didn't know if she was in one right now or not though.* - Fri Dec  4 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm going to use a low level genjutsu on you. Your objective is to dissipate it using only your chakra. - Fri Dec  4 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What are the handseals though? - Fri Dec  4 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The tiger hand seal. - Fri Dec  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had been staring at Heiwa as he motioned through the handseals sloow like. She was a bit in content as to what this might have followed up with. What made her a bit weirded out was the fact that the veil of leaves had begun to fumble and furl around her physique.

Within that moment, her green gaze had become obscurred due to the leaves dancing around her face. Was that it? Well, that was a stupid genjutsu. She then saw something tha occured infront of her. Surprisingly, it was seemingly a depiction of herself writhing into what would appear to be agony.

Not the good kind either. Nori basically in straight jacket, uncomfortable in the slightest and to top it off, she was staying in place. . No interaction, no pain, no speaking, no pain. . No pain. . No pain. . Yeah, she was being tortured in the one way that would be torturous to her. No fucking pain man!

She brought her hands upwards, in the attempt to furl into a single handseal. A deep inhale was done as she would try to flow the chakra that was within her up to the centermost part of the brain. Once then, she would attempt to reverse the flow of chakra in her head, with the intent to cancel the genjutsu. With a quick burst of chakra into the head.

That genjutsu was surprisingly. . Obvious. Was it supposed to be? Nori couldn't tell. . Good god that was so traumatic for her. .  . . Weirdo-- shut up, I eat people.* - Fri Dec  4 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) set her hands to the side, looking back up to Heiwa after her apparent long daze, "Wait. So you don't need to be in a genjutsu to master it?" She asked.* - Fri Dec  4 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Take a breather - we'll be working on some sparring in just a bit. - Fri Dec  4 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your opponent will be Nori. - Fri Dec  4 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Okay.~ - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: When you both are ready step up and take opposing positions. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After the seal of confrontation you can begin. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can I go? - Fri Dec  4 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh - sure. - Fri Dec  4 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori and Yumiko then. - Fri Dec  4 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Taijutsu, kenjutsu, shurikenjutsu - the limiting factors of this spar. - Fri Dec  4 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Stick to use of those. - Fri Dec  4 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm right. - Fri Dec  4 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - actually, Yumiko, while Nori rests up from her..experience.. - Fri Dec  4 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, rest up. We'll be back in a moment. - Fri Dec  4 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I feel ditched. - Fri Dec  4 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's okay..It wasn't real, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What did she see..? - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.. - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, you ready as well? - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec  4 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets head back. - Fri Dec  4 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sooo. . Spar, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Physical spar only. - Fri Dec  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Alright. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) removes the tanto she had on her back, placing it on the ground.* - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) brings her hand up, forming the seal of confrontation. There was a light pause in that motion before she would proceed to rush over towards Yumiko's position. Her eyes were widen this time almost as to emphasize that she was focusing on the girl as she closed the distance between the two.* - Fri Dec  4 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, wondering why Yumiko had just  moved backwards. She didn't pay it much of any mind and had continued her relentless pursuit towards Yumiko. Her nostrils flared a bit as she closed in, dropping her arms to the side. . . Was she trying to tire her out? If that was the case, then what was the point of the spar anyway?* - Fri Dec  4 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened for the moment. She might have been fast. . In her own way, but she was in nowhere prepared for that sudden milk throw to the face. Some moving onto her eyes caused her to grasp onto her face,"Agh!" It might have hurt, but regardless of how one might think it was good, it was pretty damn annoying while in a fight.

She grasped onto her eyes before feeling her body jerking backwards and a fist slamming right below the jaw to her chin, causing her to hit her back against the soil.* - Fri Dec  4 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) got kicked into the side, grunting for the most part. Her hands gripped into the soil as she felt her insides shifting or rattling just from the sudden attacks on him. His other arm grabbed onto his stomach, groaning for the most part.* - Fri Dec  4 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's hands had gripped the dirt for a reason. The way her body was positioned and face turned for the most part, eyes clenched tightly. Her right eye -the part of her face that was still on the ground for the most part. The dirt had hit the left side of her face, which caused her right eye to twitch for a second.

The moment that Yumiko tried to pin Nori down, her hand would slip from under the hold, noticing her going for that hand that was deep in the dirt, dragging the dirt up and trying to slam it right infront of her face, trying to shock her first with that, as well as mess up her vision. Her right eye -albeit red due to the liquid that was poured onto it- shot half lidded as she did that.

Hopefully that nullified her attempt at trying to headbutt Nori or pin her successfully.* - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was not going to give Yumiko any breathing room. Her other hand -assuming she was freed would grab onto her collar. Considering she was still ontop of him due to her trying to pin her to the ground, she would abuse that effort, trying to pull her inwards. Nori lunged her head, forehead leaning abit as a means to slam her forehead right onto the bridge of her nose.* - Fri Dec  4 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) jerked her head quickly backwards, grabbing onto her eye once more and this time a shrill of a scream was heard. Eye damage was always horrendous in itself. Her body was convulsing at this point.* - Fri Dec  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'M SO HIGH RIGHT NOOOOOW *omit* - Fri Dec  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still screaming like a wild crackhead. . Yes, a wild crackhead. Look it up, it ain't even a word. She was trying to roll on the ground. It could be worse. . Anyone remember that one episode where butters got a star in his eye? It could be that.* - Fri Dec  4 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still twisting and turning, groaning as she was panting harshly. . Shit, she knew about pleasurable pain, but eye shots weren't pleasurable, man! No! That shit was painful! The ice being placed on the top of her eye just caused her to shake up a bit, but not as much.* - Fri Dec  4 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oooh.. . - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Shh it'll be okay, it'll be okay. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I think. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..Was she enjoying it all along? - Fri Dec  4 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) wasn't enjoying it. . I just don't know what to type for a groan. . * - Fri Dec  4 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you feeling now? - Fri Dec  4 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . Nuummb. . *muffled groan* - Fri Dec  4 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry. - Fri Dec  4 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to head to the house? - Fri Dec  4 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I can get her head if you get her feet. - Fri Dec  4 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We could take her arms and walk. - Fri Dec  4 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..how about Nori? - Fri Dec  4 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) just slowly nodded. . She did hear them.* - Fri Dec  4 07:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you want some more ice? - Fri Dec  4 08:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) notes it seemed like it was swelling up. She placed  a small patch on it, "A bit of time before the swelling could go down."* - Fri Dec  4 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: What did I miss? - Fri Dec  4 22:54:43 2015
