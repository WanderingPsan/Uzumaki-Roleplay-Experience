<br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) //This was beginning to feel like a chore, which was probably a normal thing for it to feel at this point, arms slung the bag and walked it over a few miles away from the manor to the compaction heap, "I thought this was a mission. . Not some exercise. ." she mumbled to herself, lazilly throwing the black bag into the compaction heap, wincing only lightly.* - Thu Nov  5 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) slowly would stagger a bit backwards, as she had seemed to have broken a sweat even after a short while of sifting back and forth. She decided to carry two bags instead, having only a short amount of garbage to throw out this time, she was only mentally happy that she was getting paid for this, which all in all was better to keep her mind going than anything else.* - Thu Nov  5 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was almost done with her session, already beginning to realize how much time had passed while she was doing this, she would decide to quickly finish up, throwing bag after bag, panting rigorously as she would throw the small bags into the trash compactor, panting as she would writhe in agony. So much garbage, so much smell!* - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) saw only two more bags in the small area which caused her to wince a bit. She thought that she had gotten all of the bags already, but it appeared she was wrong. Quickly swinging her bags into the compactor. .  . Well, bag. There was only one more left, of course.* - Thu Nov  5 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had merely inched her head to the side, feeling the aching area on her right arm, "Okay. . Yeah. . Feel the burn. . Whoooo. . ." she mumbled to herself, though at this point, she was practically almost done. She tried to rise the garbage bag onto the top of her head instead of her shoulder, trying to balance it out as she moved closer to the garbage compactor. upon throwing it, she would note all of the garbage bags were in the compactor before she forcefully pulled the lever down to watch the bags get crushed. She sighed, but felt a bit good to see all of those bags crushed.

"Ahhh. . Blissfulness." she mumbled to herself.* - Thu Nov  5 03:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) moved along behind Takeda, whistling.* - Thu Nov  5 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) squints her eyes for a moment as it appeared that they were supposed to actually look for the guy they were to escort? She looked a bit around, though she pointed only to the man that seemed to be in his late thirties and was walking over towards the two, "I gue--" sure enough, she was right and she stoped her speech just to convey a light shrug of the shoulders.

"Ready when you are." she said with a curt nod of approval.* - Thu Nov  5 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods fo a moment, grasping onto the hilt of her tanto, "Right." the older man looked at the young girl with a bit of suspicion, though Nori did not let it get to her as much as it might have been assumed. She just calmly unsheathed her blade and looked over to Takeda, "Have you been to that country, Takeda?" she asked with a tilt of the head, trying to convey a bit of conversation.

"What about you?" she asked the architect.* - Thu Nov  5 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inched her head to the side, "I see. ." she mumbled to herself, shrugging her shoulders as she would continue with their travel. She kept the blade close to herself, but just incase there was something to have gone down during this travel, she would merely take out a small piece of paper with a string on it, tying it on the pommel of the hilt of the tanto as they continued on their journey. While Nori was not known to fight, she could atleast use explosives. ..  A lot of them. . Boom, boom!* - Thu Nov  5 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers:  [ are they just going to sit and watch us..? ] - Thu Nov  5 04:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's ears quickly perked up as Hideyoshi called out her name. Eyes widening only for a short moment, she would nod, "Yeah. . Just. . Not used to doing work that is outside the village before." she said, keeping a tight grip of the blade, "I'll be alright. Really." she explained with a brief nod.* - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to walk a bit out of the path that Hideyoshi was going as she had forgotten a bit about them. . For just a second of course before she moved back behind the architect with a quiet few steps to make sure that no one noticed that she was away, "It's not that far from here. . Right?" she asked. For the most part, it did not seem like she had to do anything else, other than guard the guy. Everything seemed rather calm and relaxing to her, so maybe she could just lower her guard. . For just a moment. . And by just a moment, I mean letting go of the blade with her left hand. . Yeah, she was still on edge.* - Thu Nov  5 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) sighed for a moment, yet nodded. The walk was not really something that she had mind, rather it was just patience which was her problem all in all. Arching a sharp brow for moment, she would look over towards Takeda as he spoke about something that was irrelevant to the mission, "Oh! Well, it's been better. I tested a bit of the herbs on some injuries I had due to an experiment. . It actually healed pretty well, surprisingly. Though I do need to try and gather more herbs to experiment before I could actually say if they are good or not." she explained, seemingly a bit entranced on the herbs she had.

"I also carried some for the trip incase there was any injuries or anything."* - Thu Nov  5 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had continued following behind the man with a brief yawn escaping her lips. She was slowly starting to get bored with the walking, but as soon as Hideyoshi said the were able to finally stop walking for the most part, an amount of relief washed over her face as she finally sat down. Her dead pan eyes looking around before she sat down with the architect, finally getting a bit of a break from walking.

"Eh. . Is it about that err. .test?" she asked, inching her head to the side, though of course she was still trying to tread carefully when speaking about something like that.* - Thu Nov  5 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ once we've each done 8 RPs lets just get a caravan back ] - Thu Nov  5 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: (8 rps each?) - Thu Nov  5 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ you know, eight paragraphs. we've each done  seven after your next RP. Then on the 8th RP we'll arrive at the destination and get a caravan back ] - Thu Nov  5 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: [ sound good? I just can't be bothered to do 8 more RPs about walking back lol ] - Thu Nov  5 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: (i was getting a bit annoyed doing them lol so yeah, i don't mind) - Thu Nov  5 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: (Also i have 7 already. so this will be my eighth one) - Thu Nov  5 05:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers:  [ Ah, ok. well anyway we'll jsut get a caravan next RP round ] - Thu Nov  5 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) shrugged her shoulders as she got up. That was a rather short break that had no real relaxation behind it. She sighed lightly, stretching for what it was worth before she followed, though this time it had appeared that she was to be leading them off the rest of the way, which to her seemed like a headache. Looking down for the most part with the same blank expression on her face, she would continue this, "Uhh. . I think I see something now." she said to Takeda.* - Thu Nov  5 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods a bit as they had finally reached their destination. She blinked a few times, inhaling deeply as she would just, "This is really tiresome. . But! We finished, which is all that mattered really." she said with a nod as she was a bit surprised at the fact that Takeda had called up a caravan before hand, which made her sigh with some form of relief, "That's. . actually good." she said, inching her head to the side as she would simply climb in the caravan, feeling more relaxed due to just hanging out with her feet resting.

"Hmm. . Well, since he might not be here yet. . I guess we can get something to eat or whatever, if you like." she said, "Though the village has been rather empty last time I went venturing around. . . But meh, kind of irrelevant." she said with a nod.* - Thu Nov  5 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had nodded, just getting off of the caravan as she walked on behind him, "Got it, got it." she said, shoving her hands in her pockets as she followed along.* - Thu Nov  5 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) just ordered a shrimp miso, inching her head to the side, "Yeah?" she asked, merely waiting for the order to be done, "What is it?"* - Thu Nov  5 06:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had suddenly found the area rather. .  desolate. . deprived of human life. . Well, not really deprived from it as people could probably be in their houses, resting, but for the most part it did seem rather quiet. She kept on following behind Heiwa with a curious look in her eyes.

"Uhh. Wanted to speak?"* - Sun Nov  8 00:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh. . How come you're not supposed to be here officially? - Sun Nov  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I left Konoha as a shinobi to follow my uncle to Kirigakure. - Sun Nov  8 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Now that he's dead I'm unsure how the hokage will take my departure. - Sun Nov  8 02:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's why it's unofficial. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's also not a place that we have paid for either. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're squatting. - Sun Nov  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We have running water still, however. And food.  - Sun Nov  8 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . . Do you get bills coming here in regards to the water then? - Sun Nov  8 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes and no. This house used to belong to a man named Nozumi.  - Sun Nov  8 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The water was paid well in advance..for another month I'd wager. - Sun Nov  8 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The water bill was paid months in advance. About another month should be left I'd wager. - Sun Nov  8 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Electricity not so fortunate. - Sun Nov  8 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm. .  How much money do you get? - Sun Nov  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *have - Sun Nov  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm Nori was it? I could give you an important job right now. One that will pay one thousand but it's a continous job. - Sun Nov  8 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, not saying a single word as she just pockets the money. Looking over to Yumiko, she would just arch a brow, waiting for her to say what the job was.* - Sun Nov  8 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We want you to speak to the Hokage everytime we need you to or desire you to. Not sure what he thinks about us being here but I rather not meet him unless I have to. - Sun Nov  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, the real question should be if he realized if he left in the first place. I don't really know who you are, however. - Sun Nov  8 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Aside from that. . I just need a few plants to be gathered. That's pretty much all I ask from you guys if you can help with that. - Sun Nov  8 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: A few plants huh? Alright then. - Sun Nov  8 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The same type you were talking of earlier? - Sun Nov  8 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehhh. . Yeah, and seven more. . I will give you pictures of them that were off of the uh book I was given. - Sun Nov  8 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fine. Do you need help with any of the research? - Sun Nov  8 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehh, more or less. I only got pictures. - Sun Nov  8 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: With names, of course. - Sun Nov  8 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Didn't you say you worked with one of them? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tried it in staunching blood loss? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And..smoking it? - Sun Nov  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. I had to put my own notes on my own experiments. - Sun Nov  8 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Smoking plants? Sounds nasty. - Sun Nov  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It makes you relaxed. - Sun Nov  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is that all it does? - Sun Nov  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . . It also makes you hungry a lot and your eyes become red, almost like you haven't slept in a while. That's if you smoke a lot of it, though. - Sun Nov  8 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Basically, I call it happy medicine. .. And hungry. . - Sun Nov  8 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So it's relatively worthless. - Sun Nov  8 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Maybe the other ones won't be.  - Sun Nov  8 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, you can keep the top. - Sun Nov  8 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It helps for pain due to it's relaxing nature. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Not a lot of hte pain, but it helps to bare with it. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Which is something to take into account for if you have injuries. - Sun Nov  8 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right. - Sun Nov  8 04:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are only two beds. - Sun Nov  8 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Then take one. I don't mind taking the pillows. - Sun Nov  8 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd rather you two have it. - Sun Nov  8 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll be fine.  - Sun Nov  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I don't mind sharing a bed with who ever. - Sun Nov  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh? Where'd he go? - Sun Nov  8 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Anyways you mind sharing bottom bunk? - Sun Nov  8 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Don't really care much. So sure. - Sun Nov  8 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right, that's settled. - Sun Nov  8 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yaawns* This is the first time I actually relaxed. - Sun Nov  8 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *yawns* - Sun Nov  8 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Morning. - Sun Nov  8 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Got those pictures ready?  - Sun Nov  8 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can go get those plants. - Sun Nov  8 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, yeah. I have them. - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) yawns as she pulled out the small book, tearing out seven herbs.

Each listed the following with pictures:

Marijuana
Sweet Marjoram
Red Clover
Navajo Tea
Sage
Saffron
Hops Flower* - Sun Nov  8 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) *herb pictures* - Sun Nov  8 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: The first five should be in the village. They are medicinal drugs. The other two would need some searches outside of the village. Not in dry climates, I believe. - Sun Nov  8 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fair enough. What'll you be doing? - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, for one I am going to try and get word from the Hokage about a few things along with turn in the missions. I still want to know more on what you want me to actually do when the Hokage is around. - Sun Nov  8 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't believe that you could work in that aspect. Missions are relatively easy, and you only can get around three per mission. She was hoping for you to help us acrue funds through work. - Sun Nov  8 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More I think your abilities as a medic could be more helpful than that. - Sun Nov  8 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Explain. - Sun Nov  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Explain what? - Sun Nov  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How your abilities could be helpful? - Sun Nov  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Stitching our wounds after something bad happens. Helping to prevent infection. I don't know really how much I have to explain. It's well valued. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your research into plants could also help as well. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *sighs* - Sun Nov  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Something wrong? - Sun Nov  8 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Thinking. I already ran low on the herbs I have already. - Sun Nov  8 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Once I got the others, I can study them a bit more. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Probably find some ways to plant them as well. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's a start. - Sun Nov  8 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which ones are you focusing on? - Sun Nov  8 21:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 12 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was beginning to set up a bit of experimenting. . First thing's first, she had to take out a small notebook and a pen, placing it on the side. She also removed a kunai knife and placed the bag filled with herbs on the counter as well, "I am going to stay here and do a bit of long needed studying. You two can go out." she said, cracking her fingers as she had to get to work.* - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had placed the weed that she was given from Heiwa and Yumiko to the side, deciding to sift through the area for small plastic bags. Once she had founded them, the medic would place them into the bags. Upon doing this, however, she would quickly, yawn, only just placing the weed to the side and just testing the Hops flower first and foremost. She wanted to see what it can do with her psyche the most since it was told to be a sense of euphoria, but before she could test it, she placed it to the side.

Another plant was in her mind to test out that she had almost neglected to do so in the first place. The sage herb which was close to the area itself. She grabbed at one of them that were in the bag and had begun to open up a small book to see how to ingest the flower in a regular fashion, slowly grinding it with the small pot and what not she had obtained before ingesting it from the mouth. For the most part she felt nothing.

Then suddenly, a light wincing was felt as she was only a tad bit woozy, grasping onto her stomach. It did not set right with her at all. . Then again, it was her first time testing the plant. So only time will tell, right?* - Thu Nov 12 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) groaned as she grabbed at her stomach, feeling the negative effects, "O-Okay. . . Not by the mouth, got it." she mumbled to herself in a meek tone, grasping onto the side of the table and looking up. Reluctantly, her hand slipped by and grabbed onto another sage flower. This time, instead of grinding it, she decided to pound it to the point the squishy liquids of it spread outwards into decent piles. She inched her head lightly to the side, peaked with literal curious intent on what she was to do next after all of this.

Quickly writing it back and forth, she would sniff the fragrance only to feel a bit. . better. . She wrote a brief note on that, and pushed it away. However, a tint of red was on her face as she still felt the pain from before.* - Thu Nov 12 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) took the hops flower for a moment, just staring at the herb before shaking her head. She had wrote a bit of notes in regards to this plant, inching her head to the side as she was only trying to discern what she was trying to do next. At this point in time, the young medic was just aggrivated over a few things that were deemed rather noteworthy. Quickly, she would tear at the hops flower, chewing it and swallowing it. So far, there was not much to be said about the herb, to which she had wrote down in her notes.* - Thu Nov 12 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had suddenly begun to feel light headed, swaying left to right, "The heck. . " she mumbled to herself with a bit of fear in her voice as she took a step backwards, only to fall on her backside with a brief groan echoing  from her. She fell back, as the hops flower's sleep effects were starting to begin. . Before she knew it, the young medic had passed out from the flower itself. Atleast. . That was one thing that she could get from the flower.* - Thu Nov 12 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. I'm back. You know where Yumiko is? - Fri Nov 13 05:16:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I've been doing work. . And then I got lost. . . I also tested one of the herbs. - Fri Nov 13 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Tested it how? - Fri Nov 13 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I ingested it. . It gave me a stomach ache. . I sniffed it, it actually cleared my sinuses for a bit. I tested another one, but this one I ingested it . Though it made me pass out. - Fri Nov 13 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It made you pass out? - Fri Nov 13 05:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see..would it only work on ingestation? That..sounds bad. - Fri Nov 13 05:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to follow from behind unfortunately due to obvious circumstances. She didn't know what they were getting themselves into, but the fact of the matter remained clear that they would have to be on their toes since there was no caravan guiding them to the village ruins. This was only a tad bit odd to her, but it only made sense since as they said, it was an abandoned village ruins.

"Uhh. . I'm decent, I guess. I don't really know. I'm guessing you two are fast?" she asked, as she was just catching up with them for the most part. She seemed more aware than anything at this point.* - Sat Nov 14 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was only walking behind the two, meekly looking around, though this only made her wonder what they were  going to encounter even more. The stress of it only made her wanted to know if they were going to get jumped or mugged.* - Sat Nov 14 07:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes merely stared at whatever was going on. She only saw someone being. . stabbed with senbon needles. . Atleast that is what she was assuming as her eyes boggled for the most part,  practically. .Just watching, "So much blood. . ." she mumbled to herself, simply smiling with a bit of delight. . .She was. . yes, drooling from seeing it.

. . .. Shut up, you don't know her attitude.* - Sat Nov 14 07:38:14 2015
