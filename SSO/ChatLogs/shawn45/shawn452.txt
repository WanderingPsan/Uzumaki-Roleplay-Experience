<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arches a brow for a moment before nodding. Hands on the table and what not, a brief moment of thinking would be apparent, "Ehh. I guess some shrimp miso ramen will be good for me." though after saying that, an obvious frown was seen.

"Not too well with this, but uh. . you don't have to do this, you know. I understood and everything."* - Sun Nov  1 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) just rubbed the surface of the table for a moment before sighing, "Ehh. . Alright, I guess. Just really not used to being treated, I guess." after saying that, the waiter had more than likely left to get the orders adjusted.

"Sorry, no. Uh. Go ahead." a thought occured at that moment. . In a way. . it was still free food. . Though it still did not seem right to Nori.* - Sun Nov  1 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . I've actually still been trying to do a mission. . Never did one yet. But aside from that and medical work? Not much, since when I get home, either it's a bit of training then sleep, or pass out. . - Sun Nov  1 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Or books. .  - Sun Nov  1 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) dropped to the ground as he would travel across the small fields of Konoha, particularly where most things like herbs, spices, fruits, and vegetables were being produced. There was not much people that were around the area, so it made things much easier to gather and place in his satchel for future notice. But what he was trying to gather was not the fruits and vegetables, but the gathering of herbs that were generally within the vicinity.

A hand lightly interlocked around the knife as Nori walked up and close towards one of the small plants, analyzing each one he could see and could get his grubby hands on before inching his head to the side, trying to make sure he didn't pull on them too hard that he pulled them out by the root. That would surely be an untimely damper on the young medic's plans as he was not a herbalist, but them being here was all the more better for him as he slowly cut them from under, making sure each incision done was clean and would take a few steps after gathering them.

He leaned in and sniffed them, slowly drawing a finger on the top of them to see if there was any residue on them.

Following herbs he gathered:
White flower lily
Weed herb
Cornflower
Coca* - Sun Nov  1 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to sit down calmly in a small house, taking note of how empty and desolate the place had been for the past few weeks he had been gone, his optics looking down at the bag of herbs he had, studying their color pigmentation. He looked around the small room, trying to sift through the books he had in regards to the herbs he had gathered, but more importantly, he was trying to find where he could gather more intel such as this and deduce what he needed in order to further differentiate the plants and herbs from one another. A sigh escaped his lips, yet that did not hinder his progression, flipping through the book and looking over the cornflower bud he had gathered first wth his brows furrowed.* - Sun Nov  1 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) gave himself a moment to analyze the bud, he would deliver a small puff of a sigh. It had no medicinal properties to it, which was furher disappointing, according to the book, so it was not meant to be of a bother to the young medic. Although, it did seem to have it's benefit as a good style, so for now, he grabbed the one that seemed promising, shifting it to the side and just looked over the to his right to the weed herb next with a boring facial expression as he analyzed the roots and grass, the color and texture to see what it was called.* - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) //Upon further investigation, his eyes narrowed as he would chuckle only a tad bit, turning the pages of the book and finding the name of it that best described what it was. A medicinal herb that was used to help with pain, but it did say it could get people dizzy and stuff which made Nori even more interested in the drug than the others for the most part. Quickly putting the amount of weed he had gathered in a neat patch, Nori's arm reached in to grab the next herb, a white lily herb.* - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was beginning to find a pattern of uses here. It was good for things such as bleeding, the female reproductive system, burns, coughing, etc. Although it had some side effects to it like the weed herb which caught his attention as well. His eyes were beginning to burn as he looked at the time, it was already getting a tad bit late, which was not good for him. Quickly closing up the book and shoving what was left of the herbs he gathered, he would heave a light hearted sigh, running a hand through his hair before packing up.* - Sun Nov  1 15:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinked a few times, however tried to keep away from the fight, as two of the three combatants had begun to fight it out. The first thing Nori had decded to do was to do a quick run to the side, now realizing how deep they were in the battle as the wind had practically rushed past.

For now, as promised fom before, Nori remained on stand by, dead pan eyes looking at the fight and bringing a thumbs up, "You're good. ." Nori said, though. . that was only if the red head managed to get out of the range unscathed. If not, then it is what it is.* - Mon Nov  2 06:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to quickly run over towards the girl, eyes were still deadpan as hands had begun to fumble around the bag upon approaching the both of them. Nori's eyes had begun to scan Ketsuki's frame, trying to dictate where the injuries were exactly and tell if they were mostly internal or external.* - Mon Nov  2 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes squinted for a moment, "Well. . It's a bit serious for the internal damage." explained as hands had to lightly press against the ribs just to make sure that the bones weren't too damaged, "Hmm. . Not too serious, I mean. Sorry, just a mistake. Still not very well with the analyzing yet."

"As for the bruises. . It's not much, but I can try and take care of them." Nori had explained whilst clasping their hands together and rummaging through a short string of seals. Cupped hands rested around the surface of Ketsuki's bruises, slowly beginning to try and mend the wounded areas. Obviously, Nori couldn't take care of the bones, so that would have to be dealt with through a bit of rest.

Taking out a small pill, Nori would try to hand it to Ketsuki, "Take this. It should take care of the internal injuries. The bone fractures however have to be dealt with on your own. They aren't too serious, but don't take any chances."* - Mon Nov  2 06:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I took one of the herbs. . - Wed Nov  4 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yes, I got stoned. *omit* - Wed Nov  4 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well I did drugs once. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So don't feel too bad - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Did it make you feel relaxed then very hungry for a good thirty to forty minutes? - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah... - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway Nori, I gotta go. - Wed Nov  4 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: See ya. - Wed Nov  4 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had entered into the hospital, getting ready to do a bit of work. She had been experimenting on the amount of herbs she had been given, sometimes on her wounds that she gave to herself and sometimes to just plain smoke. Gathering the herbs were one thing, but using them on herself for the most part was another.* - Wed Nov  4 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to remove a small knife, lightly pressing it against the surface of her leg, "Okay! Time for the annual blood take!" she exclaimed with a bit of a chime, lightly digging the blade into her leg and slowly cutting into the leg. She winced for a moment, but then a faint shade of red covered her face. She looked from right to left before just placing the kunai to the side.* - Wed Nov  4 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) first had removed the one of the small pasty remnants of the Coca plant and just slowly lattered it on the wound. She winced ever so lightly before only clasping her hands together, moving through the amount of handsigns and placing her hand hovering over above the wound as a light hue slowly shaded over and aimed to swallow up the wound and close it with the help of the plan speeding up it's effects.* - Wed Nov  4 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inched her head to the side before inhaling, "Okay. . Did that. . Now what else. ." she mumbled to herself, clasping her hands together and slowly sifting through the handseals, just practicing as she thought on what she could do other than roll up the weed she gathered. Looking into her bag, she would fumble into the bag.

She only had three weed herbs left and 2 coca. The other six were separate coca herbs and white lily and cornflower, two of each before sighing lightly.

"Okay. . I will save the rest for later." she thought as she exhaled a sigh, ruffling the back of her hair.* - Wed Nov  4 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) removed small book, just writing her small findings, "Okay, so it helps with the healing process on the outside, but what of the insides?" she asked herself, inching her head to the side as she spoke to herself, tying her bag and placing it to the side, leaning a back against a wall, yawning.* - Wed Nov  4 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes? - Thu Nov  5 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) simply walked in, though knocked, of course, "Not interupting anything, am I?" she asked before walking in.* - Thu Nov  5 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: No you are not. - Thu Nov  5 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: What do you need? - Thu Nov  5 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) inches her head to the side, "Well, I wanted to come simply to ask for a mission. I haven't really gotten one before, so I wanted to see if there were any really availible." she explained.* - Thu Nov  5 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Yeah, there are missions available. - Thu Nov  5 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: You think you can clean up some trash for me? - Thu Nov  5 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: It's a very simple D-Rank mission. - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Of course. - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: If you can perform such a D-Rank with success. - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: You'd be up to candidacy for a C-Rank. - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: And so forth. - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure. No problem. - Thu Nov  5 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: I'll be back later. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: I have some papers to handle. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Takeda, help her out with that mission. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Also, once you're done with that. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: You have a C-Rank mission to escort an architect to the Village of Rice. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: It's for Takeda and you to go on together. - Thu Nov  5 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: Fresh air isn't a bad thing. - Thu Nov  5 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: And it'll be good to breed your experience. - Thu Nov  5 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Thu Nov  5 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: For fucks sake. - Thu Nov  5 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehh. .  - Thu Nov  5 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Two missions in a row? - Thu Nov  5 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) shrugs her shoulders, "Ehh. . I will start with my mission. . So uh, you can take your time." she said, as she turned on the butt of her heel, aiming on taking her leave unless stopped.* - Thu Nov  5 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fine. - Thu Nov  5 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had first entered the tea shop, yawning rather faintly as she stuffed her hands into her pockets. Walking over towards the counter, she would explain to them that she was told to clean out the store. Upon doing that, she would merely nod her head once as she would begin to  do her work, slowly cleaning out the shop for the most part and placing the garbage she had found in  a black paper bag. She decided to only add this part before going back to the manor to do the real work as she got a bit confused as to what the Hokage really wanted.

"I think he meant to throw the garbage out at his manor. ." she mumbled, realizing it before she did more unneeded work.* - Thu Nov  5 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had ran back to the manor, quickly fumbling over and trying to pick up and drag the bags of garbage and what not that was near the side of the manor. She would hoist it over her back, slowly walking south and away from the area that she was around with a tired look plastered on her face. That was one of the many bags that were there.* - Thu Nov  5 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had continued to grab the garbage that she was being told to throw out, slowly pulling the black bags and dragging them over to the compaction heap to be destroyed and what not. She had to be careful to not use all of her weight while she threw the bag so she did not fall into it herself. Yes, she was that much of a light weight for her age, which said alot in some ways than one.* - Thu Nov  5 01:48:48 2015
