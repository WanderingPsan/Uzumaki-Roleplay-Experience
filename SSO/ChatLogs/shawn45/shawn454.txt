Was this ruins that were talked about? It was the only thing Nori can assume it to be as they ventured into it, only to find four or five other people, though a few of them seemed to be incapacitated, and the other two were supposedly already fighting amongst one another.

She was not that much of a fighter, so for now, she only had to wait. This dd not mean, she was going to wait right in the middle of the area, though.

Arms dropped to the side, the young medic would quickly move to the tree, trying to keep behind it.* - Sat Nov 14 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) kept herself behind the tree, slowly fumbling into her backpouch, though, for the most part, she didn't do anything yet. She already knew not to play the hero.* - Sat Nov 14 09:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had only exitted the caravan momentarilly, moving over towards Yumiko. For the most part, she ignored Hachirou and tried to examine Yumiko since to her they were already cleared from the danger.

"Let me see your arm." she said, bluntly.* - Sat Nov 14 22:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Doesn't matter, lemme see your arm, maybe I can fix it up. - Sat Nov 14 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had first removed a kunai knife, slowly cutting through the bandages for a moment like butter before she would clasp her hands together, moving through a few handseals. She did wince a tad bit as she would move through the handseals, hovering a hand over towards the top of the wounds that were there.

 A light hue of chakra would hover over the injuries, slowly as she inputted more chakra into the technique as a means to hopefully close up the wounds and possibly heal the burns, if there were any burns there to be healed.

She never did try to heal burns before, so in a way it was testing how far she could go with the jutsu itself, "Comeon. ." she mumbled to herself.* - Sun Nov 15 00:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) was still closing up the wounds, mumbling only a bit before she would inch her head to the side, just trying to keep calm as the burns and what not were slowly closing up.* - Sun Nov 15 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had begun to fold her arms momentarily grasping onto the scroll and just sifting through it. She arched a brow for a moment, not knowing whether this was fake or real, but she could tell that it was something that was special. Looking over to Heiwa, she would inch her head to the side.

"A scroll on summoning a. . cat thingy. .?" she asked, rolling it up and handing it over to Yumiko for her to see. . unless Heiwa wanted her to copy what was on the scroll, then that was a different story.* - Sun Nov 15 05:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A wooden sword. - Sun Nov 15 07:05:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.  - Sun Nov 15 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had gotten up and off of the couch, stretching for a moment before moving over the couch. She patted herself off before she followed behind Heiwa once he was ready, staring at the wooden sword, just wondering how badly it would hurt if it was to smash into her ribs. Just a sweet innocent thought.

"You know how to use that thing?" She asked with some for mof curiousity embedded into her voice.* - Sun Nov 15 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You want the first move? Or should I? - Sun Nov 15 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. Lemme go first. - Sun Nov 15 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had to refrain from using her tanto for the most part, just clenching her fists as she would bend her knees for a brief moment, rushing over towards Heiwa. She was indeed, slow as she would reel her fist backwards, lunging it forwards to try and punch him dead in the face!* - Sun Nov 15 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes simply narrowed as Heiwa had effortless avoided Nori's slow strike. She did not say that she was well off when it came with the tactics of hand to hand, she just knew how to do it. Punches, kicks, headbutts, tackles, cheap shots, you name it, she can do it! The only thing she could not particularly do was deal with dodging.

She had looked to the side, where the wooden blade had been coming in close. Within that split second, she was hit, just being knocked back to the ground, grasping onto the area tha was hit, she would bow her head, just to hide the literal excitement she was feeling just from the hit alone.

Nori had gotten up, her right knee bent as she planted on the ground first before lunging towards Nori once more, this time aiming to tackle Heiwa to the ground! Yeess!* - Sun Nov 15 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) could not really comprehend just how fast or nimble Heiwa was, as she was not remotely close of being that fast  at all. She seemed more and more distant from the fact that this probably will be a losing battle, and that she would end up back on the ground again, 'He is pretty fast. .' she thought to herself, however before she could react, she felt the sword swing against her posterior.

Nori's eyes had widened in a mixture of shock and literal confusion as she fell to the side, this time frowning for a moment. She would slowly push off to the ground once more, this time grabbing her rear and just rubbing the part she felt the damage the most befoe she would force herself up nad off of the ground, for just a little moment.

"Okay. . I will admit . . He is fast. ." she mumbled to herself, not really knowing how else she was going to top all of this, but knowing that she was way out of her league after the first few attacks didn't make their mark. She did not get up entirely this time however, pushing up from the ground, like stated before, she would kick her leg out while rising up, hopefully aiming to trip up Heiwa by hitting into one of his legs!* - Sun Nov 15 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says:   - Sun Nov 15 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had smirked as she felt the strike impact against Heiwa's leg. Mentally, it was rather promising for her to get the hit in for once in the fight, though for the most part, she was caught off guard, her eyes trailed to the side, noticing the Mizukage, "Oh. . Uh. ." she stayed awkwardly on the ground with her hands helping her stay up.

"Yeah. We made it to the academy grounds, but no one was there. We assumed you called the meeting off . Rather, I assumed that." she mumbled to hersefl, with a bit of a frown. .She was already starting to feel tired, though it was not because of the fight..  Just literally tired.* - Sun Nov 15 08:58:52 2015

Only rather unphased, "I have to hand it to you. . That was good. . " she mocked to Shio and Kida, before shaking her head, gaze now fully focused on Nigen.

"You sure know how to pick them."

Was the only comment she made before taking a few steps backwards and  resting Heiwa down. Hands rose up as she clasped them together, moving through a sequence of seals before she placed them over the bloodied up hand that Heiwa had. An emerald hue was seen hovering just above Heiwa's hand, slowly closing up the wounds that were on his hand momentarily.* - Mon Nov 16 06:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) finally after a bit, the wounds would've begun to close up. She would pick Heiwa up, looking over to Nigen, "That's my cue. Anyway, thanks for helping him." she said, though for the most part, she still couldn't get a clear read on Nigen for the life of her.

And with that, unless anything else was said to her, she would be off!* - Mon Nov 16 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) first thing's first. .

Yup. . Might as well abuse the chance that she has to do this.* - Mon Nov 16 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had already placed the marker into her pocket by the time he was slowly coming to.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) merely only nodded for  the most part, "Yeah. . I couldn't even heal it or anything." Just keep going with it was the only thing she could think before she cracked a light stifle laughter.* - Mon Nov 16 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) couldn't help but laught out loud for a moment, just relaxing on the couch, "Show no mercy for this treachery!"* - Mon Nov 16 08:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) squints a few times, staring at the hand. She grabbed and place a light squeeze on the knuckles, down to the wrist, just to see if there were any bone fractures. It seemed relatively healed up in terms of cuts, but what of bones?* - Mon Nov 16 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) finally lets go, "Hmm . . Everything seems in order. ."* - Mon Nov 16 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had merely squinted her eyes, only shrugging idly as she just looked over to the Mizukage, "Hm. . I have yet to see how strong Ortho is upfront." She said openly, eyes squinting as she listened to what the two were talking about. It seemed the Mizukage was more. . . conflicted on what was going on with Heiwa and how it might effect the village.

At least, that is how it seemed to the red head as she folded her arms, "Aside from that, is there anything you want us to do?" It seemed like a pretty stupid question to ask, but for the most part, this all seemed like it would happen endlessly unless something is either resolved or either Ortho or the Mizukage was dead. . . Or both were, you never know if that could happen.

"I mean, I don't really know what you want us to do. You said you're planning, right?" This all seemed. .Waaaay fucking depressing on both Heiwa and his side, like goddamn.* - Tue Nov 17 04:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This may take a bit. - Wed Nov 18 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeeaah. - Wed Nov 18 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: So... - Wed Nov 18 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Booored. - Wed Nov 18 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Want to go do something? - Wed Nov 18 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Mhm! Anything really. - Wed Nov 18 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Hmm - Wed Nov 18 04:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) whispers: Sure. - Wed Nov 18 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) arches a brow for a moment, grasping onto his, "Hmm. . Let's go. Maybe the pub? I heard they had good food in there." she said.* - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Alright. Lead the way? - Wed Nov 18 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I got bored searching so I went here instead. - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm buying though. So want anything? - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Small order of Miso soup? - Wed Nov 18 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for the most part, "That's good." she said, tapping her chin for a moment before ordering a vegetable soup, along with a Miso. Of course, it took a while, but not as long as expected before she handed out Heiwa his bowl.

"So. . . You've seemed. . A bit distant ever since that conversation with the Mizukage. . You okay?"* - Wed Nov 18 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: He didn't make much sense. . I'll agree with you on that. .  - Wed Nov 18 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . Did that question upset you or anything? - Wed Nov 18 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. It's..fine.  - Wed Nov 18 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm..worried about Ortho. About the village. - Wed Nov 18 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: About you two.. - Wed Nov 18 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Chunnin exams? - Wed Nov 18 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Eh. .? - Wed Nov 18 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) shrugs her shoulders, "I understand that. . Hmm. ." She mumbled herself, tapping her chin for the most part, "Hmm. . . It may be asking for much, but I wonder if there is more things out there to help healing. ." She really didn't see much of any techniques out there aside from the ones she had used during her time around the shinobi world.* - Wed Nov 18 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Don't know, maybe I feel like I'm not helping enough. . - Wed Nov 18 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) seemed to be in a bit of a conversation with Heiwa. .Well, trying to be at the very least before Liu had walked over to their table. In all honesty, it did give her a bit of a sense of wonder as to what he had to say if he came by.

But that was soon left with surprise and confusion as he placed the hat on the table. Without a bit of a moment's notice, the only thing she heard was the part of taking care of the village and the 'Thank you' which even left this as a mere sour taste in her mouth than anything.

"Whoa, what?" she asked, wondering if the guy seriously picked Heiwa. . Was. . Was he serious about? No, couldn't be. He isn't gonna leav--. . .

She got up, almost as quickly as Heiwa had gotten up, grabbed onto the hat. Nope, not to wear it. But to give it to the man, who might have been making a rather. . harsh mistake, "What are you planning to do?! Don't walk out like this." Yeaah, this obviously struck her wrong also.* - Wed Nov 18 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, almost as if hearing something that sounded like a different language, "What are you saying? I mean, despite that small thing that happened in the courtyard. . People do respect you." She said, almost as if she was speaking to most of them.

"If anything, think about the villagers than the shinobi themselves. They've been through a lot, think about what that might do to them." She said this in a calm voice, not really distressed despite her movements up to this point. She did look over to Heiwa for a moment, wondering what he was thinking and if he was going to say anything anytime soon.

Whether he did or not, she did bring the hat up, almost as if trying to put it on Liu's head, "I doubt you dying would serve any kind of. . purpose. Especially like this. ."* - Wed Nov 18 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) squints her eyes before just falling silent for the most part, staring at Liu before just sighing, "If it's help, I can try. .But I can't help someone who doesn't truly want it." She said, clearing her throat before stretching a hand over and placing the hat literally ontop of Liu's head.

"Don't be like the other shinobi that chose to leave a village. . Because they were bored, because they wanted to leave their own problems or because they could not face the problems head on. Be yourself. Be something the village will be able to stand for. Be something you can be and not follow the others."

She said this with a quick nod to herself, just making sure to straighten the hat ontop of Liu's head, "You leaving will hurt the people that believe you. . Ignore those that can't give you or this village a chance, because they don't deserve your kindness." Therapist at it's finest folks. .That or just well with talking, whatever. . Shut up, fourth wall.

Nori didn't smile, or anything of the sort. She just waited to see what that would do to Liu, "There will be times that people will lose respect to you, sometimes they will lose faith in you. But those that choose to leave the village because of one person. . Well. . They are nothing more than mere scum. . You're not scum, you're better than most of the other kages I've seen. Just. . one more chance. . Alright? You have a lot of people that believe in you. . Please believe that."

"Even me and Heiwa here are apart of those people." She said, nodding one more time, though at this point she stayed quiet, staring at Liu with a genuine look of concern. . . Hey, atleast the medic was trying. . White mage and all.* - Wed Nov 18 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Besides, Heiwa too emo to be mizu *omit* - Wed Nov 18 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, "That's all. Just know you're not the only one that has to do it on your own." she said, giving Heiwa a thumbs up, "You have supporters. More than you can even imagine. Despite how they look or what they say to you, it doesn't mean they give up on you. So keep pushing, and remembe, there are people that will be there to help you." she said, finally giving a smirk. A satisfied one, at that. She might not have been a good fighter, but she did know a lot about talking things out.* - Wed Nov 18 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Right. Good luck. - Wed Nov 18 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov 18 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 18 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Surprised? - Wed Nov 18 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: At how he acted.. - Wed Nov 18 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's true....however, it did keep me alive luckly. - Wed Nov 18 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. I shouldn't have left you like that..by the way.  - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I didn't think any jutsu..could move that fast. - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Wish we could have forced some information out of her. - Wed Nov 18 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..she was dead before I was given a chance. - Wed Nov 18 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm maybe next time under conditions we can find a way to get information without them knowing. - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Without them knowing? - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm.  - Wed Nov 18 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa-kun go stand a little bit away from the tree. Going to try and shunshin to you. - Wed Nov 18 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heya. - Wed Nov 18 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Missed anything? - Wed Nov 18 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Just a bit of training. - Wed Nov 18 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Curious however, how good is your control? - Wed Nov 18 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehhh. I'd saay. . . Good enough to not drain as abnormally faster than anyone else. Why? - Wed Nov 18 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe this technique will help you out incase we have another mission like the last one. It's called shunshin. - Wed Nov 18 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. What does it do? - Wed Nov 18 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well first things first it takes a decent amount chakra but it makes you move really fast from one place to another. - Wed Nov 18 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Seems pretty useful. Uh, what's the catch? - Wed Nov 18 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Just remember to vitalize your body with your chakra so you can increase your movement ability. - Wed Nov 18 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, "Easier said than done." she said, rising her hands up and clasping them together, furling the same handseal as a means to focus chakra into her body. For a moment, she would inhale, then exhale before finally a puff of smoke would swarm around her. Before she knew it. . . Well, nothing happened. She just stayed in the place she was in, "Uhhh.  . I could be sitting down while using this, or do I have to stand up?" she asked.* - Wed Nov 18 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You have to be standing up. - Wed Nov 18 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods as she got up for a moment, stretching her limbs for a moment just to make sure they weren't tensed or anything. After doing that, she clasped her hands one more time, moving through the pre-required handseal before allowing chakra to accumulate and exert from her body.

As always, the same amount of chakra pushed out before a cloud of smoke raged around her body for just a moment. She didn't move at all once more, making her blinka few times, "Ehhh. .  Not doing anything wrong, or. .?"* - Wed Nov 18 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Try focusing more to the soles of your feet and moving to the right. - Wed Nov 18 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods, "Soles of the feet and to the right. Got it." she said, keeping her hands together as she would begin to focus chakra this time into her feet, exerting it somewhat onto the ground, but still trying to keep the chakra she had maintained on her feet as a extra layer in the event she went too slow or too fast.

Another puff of smoke wrapped around Nori's frame, before dissolving, only to find that she didn't put much chakra into it, "Uhh. . Do I need to move while doing this, or ..?"* - Wed Nov 18 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes silly. - Wed Nov 18 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods once more, hands kept clasped, handseal still formed and focussing around the base of her feet once more as the chakra accumulated from under the soles once more as per everything else that had happened. After doing this, she proceeded to move to the right  a bit, quickly moving at almost high speeds as the smoke had encompassed where she was before.

Her eyes widened a bit, not knowing how fast she was going, but she knew she might be slamming into the wall or falling to the ground! And sure enough, she did in fact, fall and rolled onto the ground with a bit of a groan, ". . Oww. ."* - Wed Nov 18 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . Somewhat. - Wed Nov 18 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It's pretty useful. . - Wed Nov 18 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: A bit dizzy? - Wed Nov 18 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had continuously clasped her hands together, forming the ram handseal as she focused chakra onto her feet, keeping herself rather composed and calm as she moved a bit backwards. A flash began to appear before she saw the smoke that was right infront of her, making her a bit dazed as well.* - Wed Nov 18 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hiii. - Thu Nov 19 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey. I was about to get something to eat - either of you want to come with? - Thu Nov 19 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sure.~ - Thu Nov 19 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. To go fine? We can eat at the waterfall. - Thu Nov 19 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The waterfall sounds like a good place to eat. - Thu Nov 19 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hiya. - Thu Nov 19 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *sighs* - Thu Nov 19 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had clasped her hands together, furling them together before allowing the chakra around the soles of her feet to connect before moving southwards, allowing tfor the chakra to accumulate before in a quick burst of smoke, he moved to the wall, slamming into it, rather.* - Thu Nov 19 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) groaned only a tad bit as she grabbed onto her back, "I have to keep training like this. . Ugh. ." she mumbled to herself as she clasped her hands together one more time, furling her hand into the handseal like she normally did before chakra had begun to focus around the base of her feet. She moved north this time, crying a bit out loud as the speed caused her to slam into the wall this time! Fun times!* - Thu Nov 19 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) forced herself back up, dusting herself off slightly as she stared at the ground with a bit of determination in her eyes. She wanted to try to perfect this jutsu so she wouldn't be as a detriment as other people thought she was. . That or maybe she just said that because putting herself down was a bit of a kink to her.

Forming the ram handseal, Nori would quickly move this time eastwards, tripping up a few times as he motioned eastwards into the ground, groaning a bit in pain.* - Thu Nov 19 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) turns her head for a moment, "Oh. Hey Lord Mizukage." she said, nodding once, "Feeling better?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Did you come for the training session? - Thu Nov 19 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That and to make sure no one gets hurt during it. - Thu Nov 19 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Ah. Have you been keeping up on your training? - Thu Nov 19 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Somewhat. - Thu Nov 19 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Somewhat? Whatever do you mean? - Thu Nov 19 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I've been uhh studying herbs to help with treating wounds or patients that are in pain. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: In the event I don't have any chakra to help with it. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Ah. I understand. You ever think about branching into combat based Medical Techniques? Or is your chakra not up to snuff? - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Combat? You can do that? - Thu Nov 19 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) shook her head, "No, this is actually the first time. . I mean, I do know the technique I use if you use it too much when there are no wounds, it might knock out the person. Is that part of it?"* - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015

" She mumbled to herself, "So that is what you meant. . Hm. . I felt a breeze. . " She didn't really know if it was meant to hit her or if it was a minimized effort so it didn't hit her.* - Thu Nov 19 21:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) had only arrived from the courtyard not too long ago, only to spot more people training.This time they seemed a lot more familiar as she walked closer towards them. She stopped where she was, just trying to test out the technique she had learned a bit in the past.

Clasping her hands together, she would focus chakra under the soles of her feet before inhaling deeply as chakra had begun to culminate from her feet to the pores of her body as a thin cloud of smoke had shrouded around her frame before she rushed on northwards due to the speed of it.

She tripped, beginning to turn and flip, doing practically a barrel roll as she groaned a bit outwards, "Ugh. . Okay. . That's enough practicing it. ." she mumbled to herself, forcing herself off of the ground before waving again. . "Not mu-- ow. . Not much. ."* - Fri Nov 20 02:21:39 2015
