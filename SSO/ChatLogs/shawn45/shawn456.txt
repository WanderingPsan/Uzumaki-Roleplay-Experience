<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened upon hearing her name called. Her hands clasped together, almost as if it was right off the bat. She walked on a bit closer towards Abraxas, but not before she would slam her hand into the ground, whispering something to herself as chakra would begin to submerge from the ground.

In the end, it would rush on upwards as it was now obvious what it was. Chains. Chains that attempted to coil and wrap around the purple haired's body.* - Tue Nov 24 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (she was wondering if she could get uzumaki) - Tue Nov 24 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) Nori's eyes had widened as the man was still moving forwards. The chains had wrapped around certain parts of his body, which made her practically stay still. She did not know if that was going to work for the most part. In fact, it was one of the first times something like this had actually worked. . . She assumed he was going to dodge it entirely or something of the like was going to occur, but it didn't.

What was he going to do? A lot of thoughts had breeched through her head as if thinking on what to do, but for now, she just waited a few more minutes. She removed a kunai from the back of her holster and just flicked the kunai over towards Abraxas'.

She stood up and merely walked over over towards Abraxas, though she didn't seem to smile or anything. She just stared to see what Abraxas was going to do while entangled in the chains.

What was she waiting on?* - Tue Nov 24 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: This new kid isn't very good...Hope he improves quickly. - Tue Nov 24 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) tilts her head to the side fo a moment, smirking a bit. . She for some reason thought of a way to benefit herself during this moment. She swung the kunai blade, but to the legs, aiming on trying to cut into the flesh. Slowly. . . Very. . Very. . Slowly. . * - Tue Nov 24 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What's she doing..? Is she trying to force him into surrender? - Tue Nov 24 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Just put it to his neck - that'd be enough to call it. - Tue Nov 24 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hm? What's that Yumiko? - Tue Nov 24 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She likes pain. I've seen her drool at someone in pain. - Tue Nov 24 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..She likes pain? - Tue Nov 24 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Oh..Okay then.. - Tue Nov 24 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) 's eyes widened as she got kicked in the throat, skidding on to the ground as she fell to the ground, grabbing onto her throat. She coughed a few times, trying to regain her composure, "Ugh. .Ow. ."  throat kicks hurt, goddamnit!

At that point the chains had let go due to her concentration faultering.* - Tue Nov 24 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Very well. Go rest. - Tue Nov 24 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It should be obvious when someone can no longer fight. - Tue Nov 24 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was seeing what she would do. - Tue Nov 24 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Should we assume you don't have a technique to break past such a jutsu? - Tue Nov 24 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That you don't have a trump in your sleeve? - Tue Nov 24 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Doing that on the field is suicide. - Tue Nov 24 07:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm unsure if this village fits my views either. - Tue Nov 24 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Perhaps I was better off to be alone in Konoha. - Tue Nov 24 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) sighed for a moment, getting back up, and staggering on backwards. Her hand was still massaging her throat.* - Tue Nov 24 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you need me, I'll be grabbing something at the pub, if you have one here. - Tue Nov 24 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'll grab a few drinks, and then train. I won't be disrespected again. - Tue Nov 24 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Sorry to interupt, but I'm not an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I spent too much time in development of. . .well, what you saw. - Tue Nov 24 08:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...If you're not an in-fighter why do you fight like one? - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Heiwa. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good job. And he fights that way because he spent more time on his jutsu than his skill.. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He just told you that. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's simply the only technique I've made up to this point in time. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. That's my point. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He spent more time working on an in-fighter jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have no intention of being an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Instead of making a jutsu that is not in-fighter based. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It was simply the easiest to make. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then for now you're an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nah. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then you purposefully lost to Nori and Yumiko by fighting as an in-fighter and holding back. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: On the field you'd be dead. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you'd prefer I treated you as dead, then I'll do so. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: But that would be my issue. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not yours. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. It'd be the village's. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The village that has trained you and prepared you to properly complete missions. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: As far as I am concerned, I am not yet part of this village. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It'd be the issue of the people who hired you. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is why I detailed he'd be better off branching out of in-fighting and working on other techniques. - Tue Nov 24 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He is an in-fighter due to his inability to in-fight. He does not want to be an in-fighter, but he is one nonetheless. He can best improve by following his wants and working on ways to be an out-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He's..leaving the village..because he's an in-fighter? - Tue Nov 24 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: More of that personalitty I was mentioning, though. - Tue Nov 24 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: I hope he intends on using a genjutsu to confuse him..Not the chains of absolution.. - Tue Nov 24 08:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I believe. - Wed Nov 25 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: You should tell your shinobi to search the perimeters and within the village for any traps and such. - Wed Nov 25 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Three steps ahead of you Kana. I not only did that but we set our own traps around the perimeter. - Wed Nov 25 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: That run in with Edge changed the way I act slightly, I guess I'll go get some rest. - Wed Nov 25 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) blinks a few times, though was clearly not expecting another attack. . Seriously. . She got thrown to the side like a ragdoll by the albeit weak water blast, tumbling to the ground and grasping at her stomach and chest, groaning for the most part. That was clearly. . unexpected, like goddamn, man.* - Wed Nov 25 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehh. . It's fine, I suppose. Ow though. - Wed Nov 25 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: And eventually they'll allow you to summon stronger animals from their species. - Wed Nov 25 01:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Never really talked to another summoner before.. - Wed Nov 25 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They never mentioned anything like that. I take it that's how Ortho works with such a large one? - Wed Nov 25 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Surprising that something could even like Ortho. - Wed Nov 25 01:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: For the time being, while we train for the next conflict, would you like help with your summoning? - Wed Nov 25 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I suppose..how should I go about working with them? - Wed Nov 25 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I've summoned them multiple times - but mainly for recon. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Well...Summon a small one and give it a message. You also have to talk to it.  - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I, for a long time, gave them scrolls to take back with them. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They'd bring them back written on. - Wed Nov 25 01:28:19 2015

Good god-- well, she did see a three tailed turtle. . . Should this really surprise her.  She did take note that there were a few small glyphs on the ground, which caught her eye, but it wasn't there for long though.

She did rush on upwards, jumping on upwards and falling to the ground. She more or less was trying to take cover behind the bench, which all i nall might have been the most horrendous idea that she could have thoguht to have done, but regardless, the deed was done.

"A toad with a sword, a turlte with three tails. . What's next,  a giant fly swarms up in the air and snatches the manor up?" she thought to herself, as she was terrifyingly looking to see what was about to happen. .Good god.* - Wed Nov 25 01:43:40 2015

She carefully brought her hands up, though she was slowly rising them up for the most part.

She did nothing so far, but. . for the most part, despite the man being distraught or hurt, she didn't know whether to trust it or not. It could have been a ploy. She didn't clasp her hands or anything. She just rose them up, almost as if she was going to tap Heiwa's shoulders or something. Was that the case?* - Wed Nov 25 07:58:17 2015

Or even a position high enough for this. Likely not even the money for this effect. - Wed Nov 25 10:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Were being the keyword. - Wed Nov 25 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Well there's not much that can be done to stop all of them currently. - Wed Nov 25 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Aye. You've done well..Don't beat yourself up about it...What happened was my fault..I didn't have enough info. I didn't realize that he no longer utilized that annoying barrier. - Wed Nov 25 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He doesn't? - Wed Nov 25 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure it wasn't just inactive? - Wed Nov 25 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: *nods* It cannot become "inactive" in that sense...It's actually nothing he can control. It's sort of an..Automatic thing. - Wed Nov 25 10:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) jumped onto one of the small pillars near the entrance of the academy, moving ontop of the rooftop, "So! How have you been?"* - Wed Nov 25 16:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think us messing up was my fault. Because of how he acted I misjudge thinking the mission could end without fighting. - Wed Nov 25 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) nods for a moment, "What's important is that his main line of defense is gone." she said, "So now, if we do manage to go back on that mission, we can probably capture him a lot easier. I fell asleep though so I don't know what his barrier was.. Was it the wheelchair?"* - Wed Nov 25 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: No. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Two people were banished for such actions. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They weren't my men. - Thu Nov 26 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So? - Thu Nov 26 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Traveling with someone automatically means that I am responsible for their actions? - Thu Nov 26 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They're not under me. - Thu Nov 26 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's for you and the kage to discuss then. You can feel free to shirk the responsibility infront of him. - Thu Nov 26 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's not a stupid man, however. - Thu Nov 26 01:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The second one that is. - Thu Nov 26 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: When he attacked this place? - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Out of five. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What about it? - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He brought with him bandits. A lot of them. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Odd.. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Innocents. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: All because he was mad at Kirie who was already dead. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Now, the question is: Are those bandits not the fault of Ortho? - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They followed him. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As Kida and Ichirou followed you. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kida and the other one weren't following me. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They weren't under my name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ortho had an agreement with those bandits most likely. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I posed no such thing with Kida and that other one. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They were simply here to do what they wanted. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Entered the village together. Joked together. Spent most of your time with them. They were allowed passage no doubt under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You may seek for a scapegoat, but you'll find it hard for me to fit that role. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They weren't Shinobi or villagers of this place. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They were allowed here upon the passage of your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Isn't that simply Kirigakure's fault? - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Their lax security allowed two unidentified shinobi to linger.. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said my pet, Shiro was the only one I was looking after. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro has a bodyguard which was the other male. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That bodyguard is not under my protection. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then it is under the protection of Shiro. Meaning Shiro is to blame. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm not about to take the blame for his problems. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, if Shiro is to blame, and you're to blame for what Shiro does, then that means, transitively, that you're to blame for him. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So what do you plan on doing about it, Heiwa-kun?~ - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What do you expect me to do about it? - Thu Nov 26 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, I'm not that -man's- caretaker. - Thu Nov 26 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Try as you might to blame me for his troubles, but I do doubt that Shiro ordered that man to commit the acts he did. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. You're Shiro's. And Shiro is the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro is not the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He is a bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She is not responsible for what he does off the clock. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he is allowed passage within the village due to the requirement of being her bodyguard - then yes, she is. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let me put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's say if I went on a rampage right now.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Killing anyone I see.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you failed to stop me, is it right to blame you for my acts? - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is a false analogy. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I am not in any way the person that allowed you within the village through our laws. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you into the village ignoring the guards? - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: But you allowed me to murder. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were stronger..you could've stopped me. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you in to the village ignoring our guards - it would be my fault. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...... - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're even chatting with me right now. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So you've acknowledged that I'm here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yet..you allowed me to do what I have done. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And just what have you done? - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just as it is out of your power to stop my hypothetical scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh..murder people in that scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The difference is that Heiwa would stop you there. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There wouldn't be any pinning to blame for me. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is truly out of my power to know that those two would harm a random person. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unless you stop me before I take a life.. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is still a loss for you. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Luckily, I am a priest. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The big difference here that you're forgetting - I don't have ties with you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You do. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can be a psychopath just like Ichirou and Kida. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But that doesn't connect us like those two to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unlike them..I don't act without reason. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't cause those two to turn out the way they did. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Trust me..I had nothing to do with those two.~ - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They're just crazy. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And, at least one of them, was allowed in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We've already discussed this.  - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one - Ichirou, was it? Or Kida? - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The bodyguard of Shiro - the one you've already taken claim of for the actions of. You've said yourself you agree you'd be at fault if she took the life of others. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're taking agency for her actions. She is an object - you're an agent. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man as her bodyguard is the object of her - she is taking responsibility for whatever remaining agency he may have. This is because he went in under her name. And she went in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It isn't as if I am on the run.. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's not really the same as speaking to him. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We spoke as in he told me what happened to some extent. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I told him that they weren't under my care, and that I had no idea as to the antics that they have been up to. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I can't be responsible for every person that is injured in this world. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Those under you you are responsible for. - Thu Nov 26 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only one -under- me is "Shiro". - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anyone that decides to associate themselves with her aren't under my watch, or her 's. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You know who I'm going to pick. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The matter of agreement with her is the difference. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man had an agreement to be her bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's of similar clout to a shinobi swearing under a kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, and the agreement of the bodyguard is to protect the person. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This doesn't fall under that. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I doubt this man was even a threat to Shiro if she was on the scene. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: His entrance would be guaranteed by Shiro's own entrance. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meaning whatever he does that is not intended to protect her..isn't my, or her problem. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which, in itself, is guaranteed by your own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The deal was made here. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do wonder what I'd be sentenced.. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were the Mizukage, you'd most likely lock me up for several years. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Like I said I'd talk to the kage myself just in case he's..feeling dumb. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd banish Kida and Ichirou. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Prevent their entry even with your passage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They'd be unable to enter. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That doesn't bother me. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which is why I said I'd talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Psh..you're so nice to me. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I feel as if you really do care for me! - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The main reason they're even being punished is because they tortured him. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You still let Ortho go. - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I let Ortho go..because I was more concerned about him not killing you. - Thu Nov 26 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sometimes you have to make choices. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
