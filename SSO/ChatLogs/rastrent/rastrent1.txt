<br><br><font color=teal>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) says: . . . Not enough. We'll just settle it the normal way, then. - Mon Oct  5 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Mon Oct  5 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) assumed a callous stance, while withdrawing three scrolls in near simultaneuity, throwing one in the space above him, while holding two within his arms; small tinges of chakra were exonerated throughout theses vessels, encompassing his person with a plume of smoke within a moment's grasp.

Sin'ichi could then be seen withdrawing himself from the smog, accompanied by three bodies, towards which his hands were extended. Chakra perceptive individuals might see threads of chakra extended from his tips. Attention still affixed to the female, he began his strikes.

As the intentions of the female were apparent - to flank to his right side, one of the puppets suddenly moved forth in this direction. Should she proceed with her attacks, four of its arms would be raised in response; the rapid motion produced allowed for the short blades within its arms to function similarly to that of a buzzsaw - with obvious effects on the woman's leg, should she proceed witih her attack.

While doing this, even if the woman hadn't proceeded with her attack, the puppet simply shifted its faces, and the mouth facing the attempted attacker was opened, shooting forth with it a violent flamethrower - packed with enough intensity to turn rocks to moltenize materials. During the middle of this, Sin'ichi moved some distance away from the direct central fray.

Proceeding with this, the other two of his puppets attemptedly flanked either side of the woman - the macabre-esque puppet appearing to her left, while the one marked with a triablesque appearance was at her right. The puppet at her right launched forth a single one of its arms, armed with a sword in-hand, attempting to pierce her corresponding thigh - only if she moved out of the flamethrower's range.

The other simply shot forth a black smog from its right hand towards her position, regardless of if she moved or not, attemptedly hindering her and thereby locking her into place.* - Mon Oct  5 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) eyed the woman, as she predictably veered around the puppet - with intention to appear at its rear; however, as she aimed a strike for the puppet's face, which it hadn't an intention to dodge, it simply produced a jet-forced pumping of water, tweened to such a pressure that it could cut through rocks. This force was attemptedly applied to the woman's ribcage, with possibly serious internally damaging consequences if connected. Should she bare through the water's force, and manage to hit the puppet, would be pushed backwards by the damage, bearing a light chip on one of its faces as a result.

The other puppets quickly moved in unison to this action - the tiki-masked puppet readjusting its action, such that it released an adhesive substance towards the woman as well - its span being spread forth with the assistance of the water, attemptedly sprawling it across the woman's person. The other puppet simply retreated to its master, in case any further attempts at bolting directly towards him were made.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) 's brigade suddenly moved forward, as the woman proceeded with her retreat. With immediation, lead by the tiki-masked puppet, whose disjointed arm quickly followed the woman as she proceeded with her retreat; as she stopped, its swing curved - instead of a stabbing wound, its intention was to initiate a direct cut at her Achilles' tendon, with intention to sever it.

Shortly afterwards, the Reaper puppet began its encroach, again attempting to release a black smog around her position through its right arm. It was at this moment that the Asura puppet attemptedly flanked her at her rear, where its arms folded back, and wire-bound kunai were shot forth, aimed at various points along the woman's torso - though in nonlethal areas, they seemed intent on further slowing the female down.* - Mon Oct  5 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Anyone dead yet? - Mon Oct  5 04:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) 's assumption had been correct that the woman would minorly evade his attacks, much to his pleasure. As the arm passed her, and was assumedly disregarded, the the wire's tention suddenly stiffened, and the arm was swung backwards, this time aimed at the joint of her legs. Hopefully, in conjunction with the crippling pain she should have been feeling by -now-, he might do some damage - enough to slow her down such that the next attack took full-well effect. After doing so, it simply retracted its arm and lied in wait.


The attacks proceeded in accordance, except for one which was stockpiled through the Reaper pupppet. As the smog stopped being produced, another attack was added - with suddenness, the marionette's arms produced extensions, through which a multitude of arms were created. The sheer number of arms produced seemed quite daunting, especially as they headed towards the woman's position.

Their aimed was simple - crush in powerful numbers; his best efforts were made to ensure the safety of the head, and vital regions of the torso - but little more could be said for the rest of her body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) 's Parasite puppet immediately came through towards the mass of arms; indeterminate of her position and current status, it quickly leaned its head forward, and from atop its head came five thick metal cables, shot forth with sufficient speed, such that they attemptedly skewered what was untouched of the female. 

The Asura puppet proceeded with its six-kunai attack, as expected of it from before, while the Reaper puppet simply shot forth six of its own kunai - each aimed at positions along the woman's torso.* - Mon Oct  5 05:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) trekked to the border of the gates of Sunagakure, admiring the familiarity of the scenery. Regardless, he had a purpose to his commitment - one which involved payment, and thus brought forth his full attention moreso than anything else could have.

Quietly, he skulked around the border of the village, using his familiarity with the area in attempts to pass through completely unnoticed; his observant eyes tracking any nearby personnel while he did so.* - Tue Oct  6 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) utiliized his familiarity with the Sunagakurian mansion - being that he had, at one point in his life, visited the mansion nigh every day for the purpose of a mission - for the purpose of infiltrating the infrastructure without drawing any suspicion or alarm to himself.

Even so, he drew upon his keen eyesight to spot a particular area through which he could bring himself through with ease; that particular area being the roof. Likely, it was guarded, and thus posed difficulty to the male. Thus, he withdrew a scroll, sending his newly-enhanced marionette up to the roof, and scanned it from the rear.

Finding two said people on the roof, facing opposing directions on the rooftop, the marionette quickly sprung into action;  it floated towards the roof, revealing itself to one of the guards - only momentarily, as a horizontal slash accompanied itself to its introduction.

As the blood stained scythe crossed the neck of the first guard, who screamed  to alert the second before his larynx was cut through, the scythe quickly split into two - creating a second scythe which was launched towards the torso of the second guard, impaling him in the lung and shortly thereafter killing him.

The marionette rescinded its scythes with their retractable chain, and they were formed into one, once more. After the problem of the guards was swiftly dealt with, the male quickly scaled the building through the application of chakra on his feet. 

Shortly thereafter, he infiltrated the upper-level of Sunagakure's sanctum - accompanied by marionette. Noting two more guards in the viscinity, he allowed the puppet to lurch forward before he went within their full viewing; as it did so, it sprayed forth a number of senbon, at blitzing speeds, ripping through the guards, and the walls behind them.

Thus, he gained access to the room filled with information. Cursory searching allowed him to gain access to the necessary information, and he concealed said information with the rest of his paraphernalia, and began a swift depart through the entrance he made.* - Tue Oct  6 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) abruptly turned about, holding in his left hand two scrolls, and in his right a single scroll. Tinges of chakra were passed through each of these objects - the resultant being the appearance of wooden emissaries, under the bidding of Sin'ichi's fingertips.

As the smoke cleared, a large scythe could be seen leaving the plume, headed directly for the female's position - directly at her torso. As quickly as the previous action transpired, two figures could be seen darting out from the smoke, attempting to flank at either side of the female.

At this position, each of these marionettes went into action; at her right, one tilting its head forward and releasing five tendrills to her position, with intention to assault the corresponding side of her lower body, with two stray ones aimed at her thigh and knee.

The other's arms simply folded backwards at the joints - six arms in total, thus six kunai were produced from these orifices, each aimed in similar positions to the tendrils of the previous assault. 

During the assault, the smoke would clear to Sin'ichi standing behind another marionette.* - Wed Oct  7 01:53:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sin&#39;ichi(Ras Trent) 's attacks seem for naught, as a powerful shroud of chakra, easily palpable to anyone with basic sensory abilities, as he possessed, could feel. Thereby, he aimed to alter his position, and that of his marionettes, such that the situation could be altered in his favour.

Immediately, as the female's attack was set into initiation, his response was nigh as swift. Sin'ichi, and his puppet closest to him, retreated - scaling some distance as to escape her immediate attack range. A stream of black gas, streaming towards the woman, was released from its left arm - appearing some. Thereafter, the puppet at her left aimed to follow her from the rear, stopping at some medium distance. 

As she elevated herself to such insane heights, its main face released a potent stream of flames - intense enough to cause metal materials to melt with little resistance - at her position, attempting to utilize the currents encompassing her form to his avail.

Quickly after that, if the woman managed to land, his third marionette was positioned some distance from her rear.
