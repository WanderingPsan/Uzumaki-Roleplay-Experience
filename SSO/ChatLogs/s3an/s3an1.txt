<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) was sick of sitting down, all he ever did was wait for his brother to become availible so he could get to know him and get the chance to train with him so he could become as strong as he is. Gravel was still a young boy and very inexperienced in the art of fighting. He was decently strong because of his families bloodline. After eating his tea..by himself he decided he would begin his own training on his Jutsu Shoryuken. Gravel learnt this Jutsu and how to fight so far from his mother, who was very strong but not a very good teacher as she gave up fighting when their parents split up. He took few minutes on the table to plan his own training session by himself. He wrote down on paper his training scheduele for the next month on how to master Shoryuken. <br>

He decided to begin now, he left the house and started training on the slope just above the river. The boy started by retracing the move Shoryuken and the flowing energy through his body from his brain,legs..all into his right arm for a very effective upper cut. At the moment he could only use the Jutsu once before it became a strain on his body. Gravel rubbed his forehead in shock since he didn't realise he was this weak, that it would be such a strain on his body. After doing it one after the other he would sit on the grass to restore his stamina each time. Each time he would use the Jutsu he would shout, "Shoryuken!" <br>

After a week of training Gravel felt alot stronger, he gained alot of stamina and strength throughout the process of his Shoryuken training. He could repeat the Jutsu two times now before having to take awhile to sit down and rest. Gravel knew this was but the beggining as there were still three weeks left of training, he still would repeat "Shoryuken!" after each uppercut. <br>

After another week of training, Gravel felt different..He had gained the Stamina to use his Shoryuken three times in a row before it became a strain on his body. The boy also felt his meditation skills were increasing also as he would restore Stamina much more faster than usual. He felt alot of flexible with his Jutsu with how the energy would flow through his body at a faster pace. His speed while using Shoryuken didn't have much of a delay and felt more lighter to use as if it wasn't pushing him back anymore. <br>

Three weeks of training has passed. Gravel has felt he has lost alot of weight and has started eating more to make sure he didn't fall too skinny. His muscle's were beggining to grow out more, especially with his right arm which he has been using his Shoryuken on.. sometimes he would use it on his left for practice but he didn't feel as much power and rather'd his right. He could now use it four times without it becoming a strain on his body, the ground below him started to become muddy and the grass began to disappear with the constant amount of energy he used while using his Jutsu. His right arm seemed as if it were lightning fast, sometimes he wouldn't be able to see it move. <br> 


All has gone according to plan, he finished his month of training and is now able to use his Shoryuken five times before having to take a rest. The ground below him was below the other bit of ground around him since he used the same spot everyday to train on. He looked down on the bit of mountain slope and a few rocks seemed to have fallen out with the amount of pressure used around him.Gravel could no longer see his arm move while using Shoryuken, he could use it in lightning speed and the energy flowed through from his body to his arm was much faster and there wasn't much delay. He felt like he had mastered the technique. He was going to keep this hidden until he confronted someone in battle or atleast use it to impress his brother. Gravel knew that there was still a long way to go and lots more Jutsu to learn.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) approached by a stranger while he was strolling around the peaceful village, he was offered by the stranger to have a sparring match with him. He insisted that he wasn't very skilled, neither was Gravel so he thought that he might aswell accept the challenge if they were equally skilled. 

"Yeah man..I haven't sparred in a long time, let's give it a go."* - Mon Dec  7 22:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) watched as his oppoent move just south of him. Gravel didn't really know much about stances so he just put his fists up and focused on using his Jutsu to quickly end this battle. 

" Yeah man. I'm ready."* - Mon Dec  7 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) looked nervous as the battle was about to begin. Gravel smirked back at the other boy to try to make himself look a bit more confident. As Asin dashed forward to him with his Tanto, Gravel tried to counter it by completely focusing his Chakra into all of his arm and attacking the Tanto and his stomach in the Process. 

"Shoryuken!"* - Mon Dec  7 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) suprised by the fact that he couldn't hit Asin with his Shoryuken, Gravel hesitated for a half a second without knowing what to do if he can't hit his opponent. Gravel quickly retracted his arm as Asin went for the attack overhead. He quickly made a cross sign with his arm to block the attack, focusing most of his Chakra into his arms and pusing the blade off.* - Mon Dec  7 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) as he blocked the blade with both of his armed, quickly got subdued by the enemy. He didn't have enough time to counter this, he tried his best to struggle out of his arms but he wasn't budging. Gravel didn't want the battle to go on for much longer as he wanted to start properly training. He started to tap on his legs indacating that he would forfeit the spar.* - Mon Dec  7 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well, lets start with something extremely simple. - Tue Dec  8 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Geo already knows this one. - Tue Dec  8 21:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) looked at Hideo and amazed by how he simply destroyed the rock so easily by kicking it. While Hideo was talking Gravel would his arms behind his back and buffed his chest out to act like an army soldier.

"Yes Sir! So i'll use this rock over here..run up to it and kick it..Sounds pretty easy to me." Gravel takes a few steps back and starts to run at the rock at a very high speed. As he comes closer to the rock he starts to focus his chakra to his right leg which is the one he is going to kick it with.

Gravel hits the rock with his right leg while flying in the air but it didn't seem to break, there just seemed to be a large crack nearly breaking the rock. "Uhh..That's all I can do for now I guess."* - Tue Dec  8 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs*  Kick it again. - Tue Dec  8 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Your not done until you break it. - Tue Dec  8 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) kept repeating the process until he could break the rock. It took just two goes until the rock would properly break into little pieces.* - Tue Dec  8 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Yeah sure whatever. - Tue Dec  8 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) thinks: I'll just get him back later. - Tue Dec  8 21:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) felt no trouble being asked to do twenty push up since when he was training with his mother she would ask him to do one hundred between every session. He did a basic set up and easily did twenty push ups.* - Tue Dec  8 21:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You couldn't just do it on the air? - Tue Dec  8 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Nope, he had to see it occur on a target. - Tue Dec  8 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Fine, whatever, I will have these down before you know it and hit you with it my damn self. - Tue Dec  8 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) moved back as Hiroshi and and Geo were about to start a demostration for him. He watched carefully as Hiroshi went for the punch and and Geo countered it with his own Jutsu and then went for Hiroshi's throat. It clearly looked like it hurt Hiroshi even though he was going easy on him.* - Tue Dec  8 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Wow..that's pretty big. - Tue Dec  8 21:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) grabs the scroll that Hiroshi threw at him* - Tue Dec  8 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Learn that then we can see what else I might be able to show you. - Tue Dec  8 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) read the scroll carefully and quickly learnt the Jutsu that was in the scroll.* - Tue Dec  8 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm.. - Tue Dec  8 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You two have fun. - Tue Dec  8 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You leaving? - Tue Dec  8 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yea, I need to go check on my bro. - Tue Dec  8 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Ah kay. - Tue Dec  8 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *leaves* - Tue Dec  8 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) openned the scroll that Hiroshi handed him and looked at it carefully. Gravel had no problem reading as he was naturally good at it since he was little. He could read fast and memorize without going over it time after time. He had to admit though that there was alot of writing on it. Anyways he dug in and started to read the Scroll.

After reading through the scroll for awhile Gravel started to get the meaning of the first Jutsu in the scroll which was Throat Strike. It was a simple enough Jutsu to use but a very effective one since it could give him a free hit onto an opponent which fits in perfectly onto his Shoryuken.

After reading through it more he understood Throat Strike completely and started on the Leaf Whirldwind which sounded like a very powerful Jutsu. The Jutsu was to use a lot of high and low kicks, it stops the opponent from dodging from seeing the high kick which means the low kick may hit.

Finally understood both of the Jutsu, he read the scroll steadily and hastily enough and remembered most of the techniques. He knew he still had to test them in battle as reading can only get you so far.* - Tue Dec  8 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Ok Geo..I need to learn that other one. - Tue Dec  8 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: That one where I push your arm back. - Tue Dec  8 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Alright... - Tue Dec  8 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Okay..so keep punching me so I can counter it. - Tue Dec  8 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) lined up against Geo and entered a defensive position as Geo sent a flurry of punches at him. Gravel dodged most of them since them seemed like they were going easy on him. Gravel advanced anyways with his right arm going straight past Geo's and just stopping before he hit him straight in the cheek. He also left a free hit open so he use his left arm to do an uppercut to the stomach but of course stopped because he loved his brother <3

He kept doing this until he got the hang off it and seemed to be getting used to it. He seemed to be getting quicker at dodging some of Geo's punches and his arm moved alot faster when sliding past Geo's.

Gravel kept this going for another thirty minutes and still only a bit tired and had the motivation to keep going since he wanted to master this Jutsu as it felt like a suitable one for him to use in battle.

After an hour of using the Jutsu he seemed to be getting the hang of it. He was punching the right point of the face all the time now and almost always hit the free attack that his right hand would give him the opportunity to hit.
