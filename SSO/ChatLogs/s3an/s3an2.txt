<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) ready for another day of training, he began with a few stretches..he would start streching his leg, pushing down on each one easily. Gravel would then start doing jumping jacks about fifty times. Geo then told him to run at him. 

Gravel took an offensive stance and ran up to Geo and started with a high jump kick.* - Wed Dec  9 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) was confident in his ability to hit the kick, but while in mid-air was easily stopped by Geo as he was generally stronger as he has probably been training most of his life. Gravel suprised that his kick was stopped so easily..he tried to put some power into the leg for a second but the next thing all he could see was Geo quickly performing an uppercut set towards him.

As the uppercut directly hit Gravel in the chin, he flew back out of suprise of how fast the uppercut was. He didn't fall to the ground though as it wasn't a fully powered uppercut. Gravel quickly got up and quickly dashed over to Geo. "Leaf Whirldwind" He ran over to Geo and started performing a flurry of High and Low kicks.* - Wed Dec  9 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gravel Dude(S3an) legs were moving very fast but were easily intercepted by Geo, he was very suprised by how simply he could block the kicks and how he had no power to get past his punches. Still...he was used to it since he knew he Brother was one of the strongest. As Geo said he was proud of him, he simply replied, "Stop talking...Stay focused!" He then smirked  and whispered.."I'm not that little..." 

Gravel was ready to use another Jutsu but then saw that Geo was about to take the offensive, not with a Jutsu but simply a flurry of punches. They weren't to powerful but there were so many of them..in the stomach that they took the wind out of him. Gravel was about to make his move as Geo was done but another backflipping kick hit him straight in the head and Gravel fell to the floor face down first.

After about five minutes of rest he got up.* - Wed Dec  9 22:28:41 2015
