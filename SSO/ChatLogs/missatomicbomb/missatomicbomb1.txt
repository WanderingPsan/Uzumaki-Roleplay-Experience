<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokori(MissAtomicBomb) Hokori let his gaze fall to the heaps of multi-colored sand before him. He had barely given a thought as to which he would use, which he would choose to be his partner in the impending fight with the elder. He walked over towards the gray and silver colored mound, it's scent obvious of iron; it had a thickness to it making it unforgettable. He placed his hands onto the mass, allowing his hands to dig deep into the source. It was heavy, his hands weighed down heavily by the substance. His chakra poured slowly into a small amount of the metallic sand, its weight even more apparent. As he tried his best to control it, the sand would simply remain still; barely able to cause a slight shift in the heap. 
Releasing his hold on the metal, he scurried his way towards the glittering mound of golden sand. He repeated his action, digging his hands into the majestic grains while allowing his chakra to seep and combine with it. As he attempted to control the sand, he managed to lift a small amount into the air; rising from the mound only four inches. It was sluggish, something he couldn't find the patience for. Quickly lowering the sand, he pulled out and moved onto the next pile.

It was his last chance, but who could go wrong with normal sand? He placed his palms onto the mound, feeling the softness of each grain pressed against his skin. His chakra easily flowed through a good portion of the sand. As he stood up, facing the Elder which was testing him; he couldn't help but feel a desire to not fight. He never liked fighting, but if he had to...he would. Raising his hands up to about his chest level caused a sufficient amount of normal sand to rise. He extended his arm outwards as the sand rushed towards the Elder in an attempt to only push him back. The elder, without moving a single muscle, caused a large amount of iron sand to shield him, deflecting all attempts at pushing him. Then, the shield of iron would rush towards Hokori in a stream of metallic water before colliding with his chest instantly knocking him out.
