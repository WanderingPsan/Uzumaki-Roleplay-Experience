<br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) looked to the chef and simply raised his voice as he ordered for himself. "I'll have the usual."

The usual being vegetable ramen.* - Sun Aug 30 14:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply observed as he looked towards Amai. His eyes easily shifting between the five panthers making way towards himself. He wasn't oblivious to the final one of course, but in the short timespan he had, he simply took into account the necessary actions he'd need to make to reach his target.

Moving in a short forward action, Niza's upperbody was inclined towards the panthers in front. As he did this motion, chakra was applied to his footing which he eventually released, propelling himself into the air and towards Amai's direction. Rather than descending on her, he intended to specifically drop down upon the pather in front of her, and crush it, expecting those he avoided to come after him.* - Sun Aug 30 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply slowed his breathing, seeing that Amai's panthers were a bit faster in terms of reaction. To him, it made no difference whether or not the creatures came at him. Niza's body was well conditioned. Even then it made no difference due to his armor.

For a moment, as the first panther clutched onto his arm, he simply let it find its grip, his armor taking the damage for him. In response, Niza raised that arm and simply allowed his other to connect with the creature, bringing it directly over his body in one swift motion to toss it into the ground. 

After doing such he turned, quickly facing the six that were in front of himself. Instead of letting himself get caught between the two forces, he let himself shift in a short instance and easily move across the battlefield with his speed. He made himself move off to one angle as he turned his head, figuring that in that instance both crowds would be at one central point. If they were, he'd simply allow himself to perform a short series of handseals, preparing to release a jutsu.* - Sun Aug 30 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) turned to face Regado as he noticed his approach "I see...Was there something you needed?"* - Sun Aug 30 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) easily focuses his chakra throughout his legs as he begins to bound forward, landing a bit before the fence. As he now stood in front of it, he turned himself around and faced the center of the training field once again.* - Mon Aug 31 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) went to look for that folder.* - Tue Sep 01 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) entered the mansion, sighing as he looked around the room. Niza hadn't wanted to be the Raikage or the Raikage Representative but something told him there was no changing Niklaus' mind this time. Approaching the desk, he simply began to search for the folder, of course, with his eyes eventually finding it. Upon doing so he allowed himself to open it and look throughout its contents until he found one that seemed reasonable enough for the two genin to take on by themselves.* - Tue Sep 01 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) casually observes the house, his eyes scrawling over every detail that could be seen from his position.  As he took in the sight, he simply humme to himself, not really speaking any words as he took a step forward. Niza's head inclined, looking to Amai.

"Tell me, truthfully. Did you split the work evenly with Regado?"* - Thu Sep 03 18:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded, turning to head back.

"Everyone leaves at some point in time. One way or the other."* - Thu Sep 03 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Since we've known eachother for quite sometime, And since..You and klaus still do consider me a pawn, would you like to see something interesting? - Sat Sep 05 09:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply remained where he was as he watched Amai perform her technique. As he waited for her display to end, he remained silent, taking notes on the technique while identifying the differences between what she'd normally do. In Niza's eyes, it was nothing impressive considering it was just her own ink techniques performing punches.

After she'd asked her question, he stayed silent for several seconds, pondering on how to reply without shutting down her display. He was glad she was improving, but he didn't see anything big.

"I do. I see some use in it."* - Sat Sep 05 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) gave a slight nod in response, releasing a single, "Alright" from his lips. After such, Niza would jut his right hand outwards, the backside of his hand showing itself to Amai. With observation, he could be seen that the backside of his hand was still, unmoving and completely straight. It was comparable to a steel plate at the moment.

"This technique also eliminates the opponents defense, stunning them where they stand. The aim of this being their Adam's Apple."* - Sat Sep 05 10:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) steadied himself in a position amongst the arena by himself, preparing himself to combat his invisible opponent as he always did when training. He envisioned himself grappling the figure and removing their footing with ease. Next, his body would fall into the motions of tossing the opponent over his own body.* - Sat Sep 05 12:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) had now envisioned himself against the same opponent, yet in a different situation. As he moved into his actions, he brought his leg upwards, finding his opponents leg to graze over the top of it until Niza's elbow came into play. As he brandished the limb, it came down and clamped down upon the opposing leg, keeping it in place until Niza showed mercy and released it.* - Sat Sep 05 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to see the same vision, his limbs moving and clasping together as he began to perform the technique with ease once again. Both the startup and the finish being entirely simple to Niza at the moment.* - Sat Sep 05 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued onwards with practicing the technique as he felt his knee and elbow meet once again. The technique was fairly easy and presented no problems whenever he performed it, but he figured he could work on impact speed and keeping his motions more tight and confined. * - Sat Sep 05 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued on with his training as he allowed himself to perform the same technique, his leg and arm once again meeting. He of course had no problems with performing it once more, still trying to refine the technique so that it was utterly flawless however.* - Sat Sep 05 12:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) kept up with the technique, easily performing the intersection method as he stood there repeating the same motions to catch the invisible figures leg.* - Sat Sep 05 12:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued with his practices, keeping up his pace as he let his arms and legs move to perform the technique. His eyes and mind working together to spot any flaws and dictate how he should adjust himself to perform better with the technique.* - Sat Sep 05 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continues to let himself perform the technique, both limbs extending and raising to come together as he stood there. His elbow dropped down and his knee raised, both making a connection while Niza stood there with his eyes shut, somewhat resting them, yet, he was just envisioning himself an opponent, their vision being somewhat ghostly.* - Sat Sep 05 13:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to spew out results with his training. His limbs continually made connections as they worked together to flex and perform the technique. His body was beginning to feel tight, getting somewhat of a workout from the training.* - Sat Sep 05 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was still striving for success with mastering his technique as he continued to bring his knees and elbows together. Without problem, he was connecting the two limbs, sweat billowing across his forehead as he remained. While he performed his training, his mind drifted off to begin pondering on what he should do as a means of improving the village.* - Sat Sep 05 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continues to remain stagnant, performing the same repeated action over and over once again. His mind was still wondering about what to do with his new position, yet he his limbs still focused on the training. Once again, his elbow collided with his kneee and allowed him to complete the technique with ease again before he began to move onto repeating once again.* - Sat Sep 05 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) watched Mamoru draw his chakra saber, having expected this to be a more, taijutsu prone spar considering they were both students of Yukio. Yet, he didn't care considering it was better to use the skills one had already acquired. His eyes locked in on the blade and his reflexes kicked in, his body backing away at an angle to dodge the initial attack before coming back in at an angle. His right hand raising as he brought it forward, aiming to connect with Mamoru's chin and throw him off balance.* - Sat Sep 05 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained rather calm as his attack was dodged, feeling the strike of Mamoru's kick land in his stomach region, guarded by his light-weight gear and further cushioned by his already durable body. Regardless that didn't stop him from moving backwards a bit. Even then, Niza didn't leave himself open to chance as he rebounded off his movement, closing in once more to deliver a right cross to Mamoru's face.* - Sat Sep 05 15:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) watched Mamoru's actions as he ducked. Niza was prepared to deliver a followup yet the blade coming for his ankles had to be dealt with first. Rather than leaving them open to be severed by the blade, Niza let himself take a short leaping motion backwards. Yet, as he did so he went through the same feeling he always did in combat. The blade had made its connection, giving him cut, but not entirely too deep. Rather than jumping to the offensive, he retained his distance for the moment, choosing to play the defensive as he readied his arms for Mamoru's approach, trying his best to focus entirely on the opponent.* - Sat Sep 05 15:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) expected a cutting motion from his opponent but a stab hadn't really done much to chage his plan of counter. Using one of his already raised arms, he turned it so that the backside of his hand was facing against the blade. A side-step and a forward motion led him to meet with Mamoru's stab as his arm planted against the blade and his hand moving to push the arm guiding the weapon off course before Niza would bring in the other hand to build off of his motion. 

The second hand, being the offensive one, would aim to plant a backhand into Mamoru's throat and possibly cause the male to stumble backwards and increase the range between the two once again. * - Sat Sep 05 16:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) let his eyes shift down to Mamoru's guard for a moment, smirking as he eyed it. Rather than pressing forward with his backhand, Niza moved backwards rather than breaking through the guard. He simply gave space once more, finding the series of taijutsu ranged clashes to be exciting somewhat. Regardless, this time he just waited for another reaction, his mind remaining locked onto Mamoru as his eyes searched his opponents form.* - Sat Sep 05 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was prepared for Mamoru's approach, watching his blade come at him. His hands moved forward, brandishing the backsides once again to deflect, yet he saw how he fell for Mamoru's feint. Only, it was too late.

The roundhouse met with his own legs, leaving him at a disadvantage now that his balance was disrupted. His leg somewhat buckled and his body motioned closer to the ground. In response to this rather than trying to remain like a ragdoll, Niza brought his body downwards with the leg, trying to move into a leaning, yet crouching position while trying to face Mamoru in preparation for his follow-up.* - Sat Sep 05 16:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) exhaled when the blade was set on the path to his face. His body motioned backwards aiming to enter the standing position he once had before as he did so. His body was now at an angle while he backtracked, finding a connection between his own leg and Mamoru's. 

Responding to that action as well, he let his own legs move into the motion as his arms protruded outwards and he used the motion to send himself in a single cart-wheel. Upon completion of his wheel, he'd try and close in on Mamoru and give him a Left Cross before backing away.* - Sat Sep 05 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) watched as Mamoru had skidded back, his eyes staying focused on him. He figured that now, his opponent was catching on to his defensive style and choosing to make multiple strikes in shorter incriments. This intrigued Niza as he moved forward. However, rather than performing basic the basic cross that he'd been doing so far, he let his right leg protude forward in a low-kick, aiming to remove Mamoru's balance.

Niza's left hand attempted to find a place on his opponent arm, choosing to use his weight against him and lift his opponent. His aim was to toss Mamoru over his shoulder, yet he figured that this wasn't going to be that simple.* - Sat Sep 05 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found himself being stopped by Mamoru's blade. With the knee being assaulted however, he found himself in another rough spot. His body moved backwards as he tried to regain his balance, his once raised leg returning to the ground. Eventually when he found his footing and came to a stop, Niza exhaled once again, finding the spar so far to be one of the best he'd had.

Rather than goin on another assault, he gave a slight nod as he kept his eyes on Mamoru. This time however, he was contemplating if he should become faster now, or just keep up with what he was doing now, considering he wasn't yet all that drained due to having great stamina.* - Sat Sep 05 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) watched for Mamoru's actions in this moment, seeing him make use of his blade again. As Niza stayed standing, he caught sight of the first initial swing, which easily drove him to make his decision in that instant. His legs carried him backwards as, anyone could notice fur beginning to sprout upon Niza's body as he made his movements backwards, a speed boost taking place in his body now as he found himself moving across the battleground out of Mamoru's reach.

A bird making way towards him signaled that he needed to pause his spar now as he raised a hand. "I apologize...but I have to cut this short. Raikage matters call."* - Sat Sep 05 17:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) opens the scroll, allowing his eyes to scrawl over it before allowing a pen to take place in his hands as he wrote a reply.* - Sat Sep 05 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) pivots, turning towards Kumogakure as he bounds off in its direction with haste.* - Sat Sep 05 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Gezo? - Sat Sep 05 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) nods his head a bit before raising a single hand to remove his hat. After doing so, he placed it upon the desk in front of himself.

"You are speaking with him."* - Sun Sep 06 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nods.* - Sun Sep 06 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) inclined his head as he turned to look at Amai.* - Sun Sep 06 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) raised his thumb, easily pricking it before letting his hands move into a short series of handseals. Upon completing it, his thumb pressed against the desk nearby and a small puff of smoke appeared and shortly dissipated right after. Upon completing this, a rabbit appeared in its place. 

"I need you to bring this rabbit to the east of Konohagakure. Scout with it, and be extremely careful. Send a report to me before returning and I'll tell you what to do from there. Watch the rabbits ears however. They twitch wildly when she feels there's danger nearby."* - Sun Sep 06 12:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Ushi. - Sun Sep 06 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hm? - Sun Sep 06 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Care to do a bit of training? - Sun Sep 06 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I'm game. - Sun Sep 06 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) took a pen in his hand, pressing it to paper before allowing himself to scrawl out a short message. He then revealed a bird from who knows where. In a moments notice, he found himself attaching the message and releasing it.

Once he'd done that, he let himself call for a mass of five hundred troops. Rather than prolonging a long message, the jist of what Niza would command them to do is to make way to the east of Konohagakure and set themselves between the village and Amegakure, setting an embargo.

Afterwards, he also chose to signal two-hundred and have them remain prepared in case they were to be called to action.* - Sun Sep 06 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) made a short whistling sound, the rabbit dispersing as it returns to whatever you call its home. Afterwards, he revealed a pouch of cash and tossed it over to Orakuru. "Here."* - Sun Sep 06 13:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) accepted the funds. "I appreciate the donation."

Passed hunna thou' to Ora too.* - Sun Sep 06 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) sighs heavily.* - Sun Sep 06 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) casually enters the room without saying a word as he looks at the inhabitants within. Each and every single one of them had been such a disgrace. With that thought on his mind he simply allowed himself to access a series of handseals, his head flipping about a bit as his single eye of red and black was revealed.

In a short moment, he moved his head to the side to reveal his other side, holding various rings around it when finally a burst of chakra took its place, his form becoming surrounded by a large, orange figure holding both a large shield and a katana.

His susano'o now encompassing his form. Between the two, three handseals were performed with ease and the feeling within the room seemed to darken when he uttered two words, a smirk appearing on his face for anyone that could see between the flaps of his hat. 

"Tengai Shinsei."

In the next instant however, a sound broke through the barrier that protected ones ears, easily moving past speeds that one could not bear. Soon, it breached the roof of the building they remained in and the magnificent sight was revealed. A large rock, came through the roof as it brought itself down upon the inhabitants. Nothing could save them now. They were all doomed to die on this day.* - Sun Sep 06 18:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) my nigga zeno chill out cuz ik u finna see that last rp...it was an omit fam...dont do this...* - Sun Sep 06 18:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) approached his shinobi with a single carrot in hand as he let his eyes scroll over each every one of them. For a moment, he remained silent as he chewed before eventually removing the vegetable from his mouth.

"Right, well. We move now. Seven hundred troops at our disposal. Let us begin on our path to the target. Should you have any plans, share them with me as we move."

With that said, he began to make his movements towards Konohagakure , passing the gates as the small army he commanded followed behind him. Hopefully, his veteran shinobi coming along as well.* - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) kept his head held high as he approached the large wall of Konohagakure. His eyes easily looked over it and found the opening created prior to the current events. As he moved with his army, he attempted to spy for any traps and such. 

Raising his voice enough to call out to his troops, whom approach was more than likely already being noted by now, he gave a simple command, holding a single fist up as a sign to pause.

"Sensory-nin, inspect the gap! Fuuinjutsu Specs, watch for traps! Doton users, stand ready!"

Even then, the Raikage proceeded to move forward, expecting his seasoned troops to follow his lead and be wary of a trapped opening. Should the way be clear, the troops would move into the village and begin their assault, however still remaining wary of any counterattacks and so forth.

The Raikage himself however, planned to stay back until he was sure his troops could easily proceed past the walls.* - Sun Sep 06 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) let his eyes fall upon the construction workers as his troops made their way onwards. His expression was somewhat disappointed as he expected to find some sort of defense for the time-being. Regardless, he let his hand signal change, pointing his hand forward as a means to signal that these two were enemies, and they were not free from this war.

The Raikage's troops would begin to cut down whomever moved in their way, whether it be with weapon or with ninjutsu. Regardless, he found himself entering the village with his comrades, letting his troops move through the streets to combat against any resistance and gain control of the immediate area.

Regardless, he stopped himself and turned to Yuan. "Make way for the hospital. Capture it, and hold it. The rest of you with me." He then set his sights on the Hokage's Mansion, figuring it would be best to take these points early on.* - Sun Sep 06 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) commanded his troops to remain at a stand still, signaling forward for those skilled in the art of Raiton and Doton alike to move forward. Rather than keeping his troops open, he called out.

"I want these traps gone and out of the way!" With that said, Raiton ninjutsu proceeded to take place, holding back the seemingly constant chain of Doton-related traps long enough for those in the art of Doton to get close.

Within a few moments, attempts were made to close over the traps with the Earth around themselves as a means to open a pathway. With the two units and chakra natures working together to let his army through, The Raikage himself used a simple technique to propel himself forth and reach an elevated position, standing amongst a part of the wall that would be stable enough for a better, much elevated view.* - Sun Sep 06 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) sighed as everything seemed to go to shit. His eyes watched over the battlefield as he stood amongst the wall, his troops now having to deal with the shitstorm presented by Zetsumo and his troops. This was unexpected, as he didn't plan for his opponent to have trained demons on their side. However, he recognized the fact that these were entirely different from the one Kastya became.

Rather than remaining still however, he figured he was required to act in this moment.Rather than remaining where he was, Niza moved in a forward motion, his leg strength allowing himself to push forward off the all as he used his own chakra to boost himself in a direction off towards the ground. His aim however, was not for any of those that appeared to be human. 

His first target, turned out to be the one closest to him. This one seemed to be secreting an ash and that was problematic, seeing as it could impare the vision of those in the area. Extending a fist, he aimed to use his velocity and speed to his advantage and increase the maximum damage that his mass would deliver to the creature, hopefully coming down to crush its head in the process as he aimed to bring down the People's Elbow upon it.  * - Sun Sep 06 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) found his drop from the heavens being countered. It was in this moment, that he realized he'd fucked up. With the propulsion from the wind, his hat and was blown away and the cloak that once covered his body revealed his chest plate. In this instance, he was incapable of making a good response due to being in mid-air.

As his body progressively moved towards the ground again. His eyes shifted and caught sight of the stone dragon heading for his position and he simply recalled upon the other various moments where he had once again taken another L. Were it not for his armor, he would surely be dead in this situation, finding himself somewhere amongst the crowd of troops, probably taking a few with him as he landed.
 
The outcome he had wish didn't come, yet, for the moment he was down with a gasp of wind exitting his lungs. For now, he was down, and incapable of assisting his allies as he tries to do his best to regain a standard footing so he could do something, whether it be to retreat or not. To sum it up, he was trying to recover from the blow, but struggling greatly.* - Sun Sep 06 23:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) had come to, the pain from the initial hit rushing throughout his body in all one moment as his mind was now finally awake and in tune with the pain receptors throughout his body. The shock hit him hard and  his eyes opened wide as he moved violently for a moment.

Only for a moment though. Once he stopped, he remained where he was, his chest bounding up and down with rushed breathing. He could feel the empty hole that took place over his chest, the perfect armor he once wore now demolished. It was likely his body suffered broken bones, yet he wished not to move before Dravae could assist him.

After the chakra assisted him in his recovery, probably not relieving all of his injuries yet, but putting him in an alright condition. Regardless, the Raikage had yet to move, finding it better to remain where he was.* - Mon Sep 07 04:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) raised his head after a bit, moving to stand slowly as he draped an arm over the primary area that provided him pain. His eyes looked over the area in front of him. He'd heard Keyshawn, but had yet to catch sight of Amai. Eventually he found the body of one of his more respected shinobi, Yuan.

Slowly, his eyes shut and he exhaled a deep breath. Whispering to himself, he spat a quick prayer out for the young shinobi as he stood there. Eventually, when his eyes opened, he never turned to face Keyshawn nor did he speak directly to anyone.

"Where....is Amai?"* - Mon Sep 07 04:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) turned, now facing Keyshawn as he slowly stepped forward. The current situation left a bad taste in Niza's mouth. As he made way over, he removed his hat from his head and carried it in one hand as the other remained draped in front of his body.

His eyes then began to scan over the wall behind Keyshawn, progressively looking for said position that would represent his impact and simply asked. "Knocked through a wall, you say?"* - Mon Sep 07 04:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) shook his head as he listened to Keyshawn's words. It was unlikely for such, considering Niza had entered the village with his seasoned troops ahead of Sunagakure's forces. And with them around, it was less likely for one to hit a tree, but more likely to have a blow cushioned my several troops.

"Look..Right now. I am -not- in the best mood. It is best that you speak the truth..."* - Mon Sep 07 05:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) sighed.

"We will remain here for some time. I will call for troops to be stationed here. I suggest you steel yourself. You won't get off easy with such an excuse."* - Mon Sep 07 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jendai(Parris111) whispers: Booty) - Mon Sep 07 13:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Do you have any fire techniques you can teach me, any scrolls? - Mon Sep 07 15:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) whispers: I do not. - Mon Sep 07 15:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: How about any taijutsu techniques I can learn. - Mon Sep 07 15:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) snaps that niggas neck.* - Mon Sep 07 15:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) looked over the remains of Smith. His expression underneath his hat was somewhat upsetting but he could only remain still as he cascaded his eyes over them. Rather than speaking words, he kept it all to himself and waited for the two Shinobi from Sunagakure finish whatever it was they needed to do.* - Mon Sep 07 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) let his eyes look over Seisuke and his following of guards. His eyes remained calm, recognizing the seal that he wore. With that in mind, he figured that he  would only need one guard, but it didn't bother him.

"Your father you say? Hm...Well, I am free to speak."* - Mon Sep 07 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) nodded, "Of course."

Raising a single arm, he motioned it in the direction of the Hokage Mansion, "I assume in this here mansion should be fine, yes?" His body was inclined in that direction, waiting for approval. 

Should Seisuke agree, he would move towards it.* - Mon Sep 07 19:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) showed up and stopped everything.* - Mon Sep 07 23:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to prick his finger before allowing himself to perform a series of handseals. After doing such, he'd actively press a single thumb against the desk in front of himself and let a rabbit appear upon the desk top. Rather than doing anything else, he simply set a carrot in front of it and began to place a palm against its soft back. He then smoothed it out along the creature's back, matting down the fur as he petted it.* - Tue Sep 08 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) continued to smooth out his hand across the small animals back. As he did so, he removed a carrot from his pocket and set it ahead of the rabbit. As it inch forward, Niza progressively moved his hand along with it and patted his hand down to reassure it that things were just fine. Suprisingly enough, he felt tension in the summons back and using simply two fingers to give a massage as best as possible.* - Tue Sep 08 02:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) remained calm as he stayed seated as well. Soon as he noticed the carrot already half eaten, and the rabbit ceasing to continue, he placed another hand forward. This hand proceeded to slide underneath the rabbit calmly and lift her, suspending her in the air via one hand. After such, he continued to give his mini-massage with the same two fingers on the hand opposite.* - Tue Sep 08 02:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) continued to care for the rabbit, raising its small body upwards to his face. Soon, his two fingers rose up on the body as they set themselves around the neck. His fingers gripped tightly to squeeze out the knots yet tenderly as to avoid hurting the rabbits. Overall however, he was easily performing the massage, relaxing the rabbit as he motioned his fingers.* - Tue Sep 08 02:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) continued to keep working his hands amongst the rabbit. Both he and the dough were in a relaxed state, a sigh escaping Niza's mouth. Eventually his hands lowered her back down to the desk, letting her lay out on top of it as he closed his eyes, returning his hand into the motion of a rubbing. He was now, once again petting the rabbit as she nibbled away at the carrot before herself.* - Tue Sep 08 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) remained there now, his free arm raising to place an elbow to the desk and a stern fist to the cheek as he pet the rabbit. However, he felt it better to attend to matters outside. He raised from his position and held his rabbit within his arms, making his way to see what was going on.* - Tue Sep 08 03:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) exitted the mansion only to observe several parties partaking in action.At first, he was unsure of what was happening yet his eyes soon set upon the Kirigakure Shinobi. His ears passing over the sound of individuals speaking, yet picking up on the lightning as its tone rang through his ears. The rabbit that once rested in the Raikage's arms was soom let free, moving forward to find refuge in a nearby tree while a layer of fur began to sprout from the this individuals skin. It wasn't obvious, nor blatant, but it was seen from various openings in his clothing.

Regardless, the change took place and introduced a newfound speed to the male, and he took action, stepping into place as he motioned himself to be placed between the initial target and the lightning that seemed to be upon approach. He understoad the capabilities of his own transformation, and with this combined with his already trained body, he was surely capable of taking the brunt of the damage before words seeped from between his lips.

"I live by...two pacts....Family first, and Ride or Die...Yet it is hard when both conflict...."* - Tue Sep 08 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) observed the two as the once again entered another altercation. He was the Raikage now, and in this point in time he was conflicted, having met the hardest decision he'd ever seen fall before his eyes. Rather than taking the options that would upset him the most, he decided to leave things the way they were prior to his intervention.

A short whistle sound and his summon returned to his arms. With that completed, The Raikage makes his exit and leaves the area, gloom coming over him as he was incapable of doing anything it seemed. His fur retracting into his body as he went.* - Tue Sep 08 04:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) raised from his seat as he allowed a single hand to move upwards and grasp the edge of the hat he'd worn ever since he recieved the title. He knew now that there was no backing out of this. There was no avoiding the inevitable course of action to come.

A single nod came from him as he exhaled and motioned forward with speed, his body making way over the desk and approaching Ushinawa's position. Closing in, he'd bring a single hand upwards, the palm remaining lazy until he came near, should that be possible. The intent, purely to slam the backside of his hand into the Adam's Apple of his intended target and stunlock them.

The outcome of this was crucial to his next action.* - Tue Sep 08 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained calm with the movements of his opponent taking place before his eyes. Niza wasn't fully aware of the opposing combatants skill, but he was sure that the introduction of the bladed weapons gave him a basic sense of his skill. However, it didn't help that Niza's recent opponents all delved into the same pool of combat.

Rather than leaving himself open to attack, he raised a single hand, aiming to brush the attack away in a simple motion. His skill in the technique showing his mastery in taijutsu. In the same moment that Niza's hand would make contact however, his body would turn and close the already short gap between the two, his free palm moving inwards to perform the following combination move.

Had his hand reached in time, he'd thrust it into the center of Ushi's chin, stealing his balance from him as another setup for a following action.* - Tue Sep 08 17:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found his combo denied once more, taking note that he'd at least made it to the second part of it. However, he now had to deal with the blades enhanced by fire. Yet, this was another chakra nature that proved useless against Niza's body. Not only for the fact that he could soak it up with his lycanthropic form, but also the fact that he could easily deny this with his gifts from the Gezo.

The cloak he wore, hid his tough shell of an armor from sight previously, but the blades of course would more than likely present slight glimpses and cut through the cloth. In the same instant, his fur spread outwards as a means to handle the ninjutsu, layering what skin there once was as he let his eyes meet Hiru's face. Almost immediately, Niza's head moved forward in an attempt to deliver a strong headbutt.* - Tue Sep 08 17:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded forward now to lead in with a followup technique, finding this one specifically to be versatile enough to be used. A single hand moved forward and he aimed to grip the wrist of his opponent.

A single foot motioned forward and he aimed to remove his footing. Should his opponent not be capable of escaping his stunned state, or remain still for him, he would begin to be lifted as Niza pressed the rest of his body forward, getting underneath his form and using his opponent's weight against them.

The final motion ending with his target being tossed over his body and directly onto the ground. Assuming, the events transpired as he wished, he would turn and observe.* - Tue Sep 08 17:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) paused in place, his eyes remaining on the man as he'd been taken to the ground. Rather than delivering another blow, he simply proceeded to space himself, backing away as he observed. He was simply giving his opponent the option to surrender, however he assumed such would not be so simple.* - Tue Sep 08 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was correct in his assumption that a surrender wouldn't come so easily. His eyes tracking the hands of Ushi with the sight of the lightning ball coming for him. The target, had indeed been a good one as he realized his opponent was catching on to the matter. 

In this instance, he had minimal chance to dodge. Hwoever, he didn't hope to dodge completely, but at the least, defend the face, Turning his head to face away when the strike came and connected, the force pushing him back while he seemed dazed for the moment, attempting to return his vision to Ushinawa's direction. Luckily for Niza, he was durable regardless of his fur or armor, but he of course, felt the pain surge through.* - Tue Sep 08 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found himself recieving another rush of chakra to the head. While his body was durable, logically, these continuous surges were more than overbearing. His body motioned backwards and his arms rushed upwards as a means to cover. his defenses for the time being. He remained dazed from the technique however, remaining where he stood.* - Tue Sep 08 18:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained with his arms raised, waiting for the blur of his vision to disappear until he'd performed the ordinary human act of breathing. There was a change in the air, a smell tingling within his nose as his eyes widened. In this moment, he considered himself on the lesser-hand now as he lowered his arms, searching for Ushinawa once again and finally locking sight upon him. Should he wish to win, he'd have to end the action before the poison could fully set in.

His hands moved quickly into the motions of performing his technique, eventually upraising his hands to make their mark as a guiding tool once he'd ended the series of handseal and allow a plume of fire escape from his maw in Ushi's direction specifically.* - Tue Sep 08 18:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) scoffed as his flames were overpowered, seeing that he'd only gone and made a mistake. Rather than staying place, he allowed the mansion to deal with the technique, moving his body in a lateral motion. He was now much closer to the desk, beginning to make travel towards Ushinawa.

His legs carried him with great speed due to his lycanthropy and his physical prowess. Upon closing distance however, he attempted to deliver a single right cross to his opponent.* - Tue Sep 08 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) gave a light grunt as he saw the flames beginning to bellow outwards amongst the building, and his target moving from once again. However, his eyes were on a single track, following his movements the entire way. He was not to fall for the same techniques anymore, his body turning as he aimed to make another lateral change in position. Setting himself down again, chakra flowed through his feet and eventually released in a short session, propelling him forth to meet Ushi's position.

At the same time, an arm would propel outwards, particularly to catch him in a clothesline if possible.* - Tue Sep 08 18:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) recalled on his monk trainings, trying to remain calm in this moment. He could feel his chakra dwindling and the heat beginning to build up within the building. Sooner or later, an exit would need to be made. However, he found himself making way to Ushi's position once more, keeping a steady and fast pace to close the gaps for a chance at another jutsu. One hand motioned forward. One hand ment to bring the backside of his hand to the Adam's Apple of Ushi. The same technique he'd attempted to start with.* - Tue Sep 08 19:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) looked down upon Ushinawa, seeing Zhen come to assist him in leaving. Rather than acting against him, Niza reverted to his plain form and allowed his hat to take its place on his head again, wherever it came from was unknown. Either way, he was finished, considering his chakra was dwindling.* - Tue Sep 08 19:19:53 2015

Shizan, Nigen says: You guys may want to leave, this place may burn down.~

REPOST* - Tue Sep 08 19:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make his way towards the exit now, finding that there was yet another thing to rebuild. However, this could not be avoided with how things were beginning to transpire.

However, he needed to act before the poison set in. Niza himself had no idea of its capabilities, but he figured it was best to make way to medical shinobi. Upon exitting, he'd throw a single signal up for Kumogakure Shinobi in the area to deal with the flames and cast them out while he made way to the hospital.* - Tue Sep 08 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) raised his head as he took notice of the shadow form above. It intrigued him and insisted that he peer upon the figure that cast such.

A duck.

Uncommon. Yet, something that belongs as a sign of Zetsumo. He recalled upon this from the actions that transpired during the war. He figured, this could only end badly for himself. Moving towards the tree, slowly, yet surely he placed a palm against before finding a spot amongst one of the many branches. Chakra easily surged throughout his feet as he proceeded to leap from said position, preparing a series of handseals as his eyes remained locked on the bird.

His intentions, were to scare it off in case his suspicions turned out wrong.* - Wed Sep 09 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) returned to the ground after some time, seeing the duck remove itself from the general area. As he touched down, he simply looks to those around himself. "I suggest keeping an eye on the skys."* - Wed Sep 09 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) nodded. "Right." 

He then allowed his eyes to close in on Seisuke, focusing upon him before proceeding to raise a single hand. "This technique only requires a single hand. It is not offensive, but is most useful against hand motions, whether this be the handseals of a shinobi, the thrust of a kenjutsu practicioner, or one delving in taijutsu."

His hand then moved from its still position to the right. The action was simple, and actually quite light. It was as if he was softly pushing the hand of someone away from his own. As his hand came to the end of his reach however, he stepped forward in the same motion.

"A brush of the hand and an invasion of your opponents space. That is all this technique takes."* - Wed Sep 09 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) revealed a scroll from within his cloak, tossing it to Seisuke. "Here is a mission. I would like you to show our lead constructon officer around so he may survey the damages."* - Wed Sep 09 19:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) puts eyes on Seisuke once again. Just as before in his previous demonstration, he raised a single hand and allowed it to remain steady for a moment. His eyes closed and he inhaled, before proceeding to exhale. Afterwards, he allows himself to pull back with this hand before thrusting it forward. Rather than the palm of his hand being the focus, the backside of such was.

The knuckles were shown like steel, the force of the strike could be seen as devastating, considering how it appeared. Regardless, he let his arm drop after performing this. "This technique is meant to strike the throat. More specifically, the Adam's Apple. By placing your hand correctly, it can be either used to stun, or kill."

His eyes then fell upon Seisuke, seeing if he could perform it himself.* - Wed Sep 09 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) proceeds to utilize the technique he taught most. His right hand raising upwards as he kept eyes on Hanabi. "This technique shouldn't take much effort at all. It is the most simple taijutsu defense." In the next motion he allowed his right hand to move from one side to the other, the action appearing soft and gentle, yet forceful. However, that was possible, was unknown.

"Try it."* - Thu Sep 10 18:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) nodded, "Right, of course." With that he removed a scroll from within his robes and simply wrote down a notation of his order, assuming this should be just fine for the moment.* - Fri Sep 11 00:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) casually raises his eyes to look around the area of Konohagakure. For the moment, he was silent. Yet, a scroll was removed from his pocket and a letter was written. A bird was sent off in the direction of Kumogakure.

Sooner or later, roughly a thousand troops would be on there way and occupy the village. Afterall, with a majority of Sunagakure gone the village needed some reinforcement.* - Fri Sep 11 20:00:25 2015

Upon stating such, the Raikage broke forth, moving at incredible speeds in such a short instance as he made his way to Keyshawn. A sharp jab of his right arm protruded forth, aimed for Keyshawn's own right. Should he connect, which seemed very likely, the bone structure within the arm would break. After performing such, he was already standing the side opposite of Keyshawn, eyeing the left arm now.* - Sat Sep 12 11:59:34 2015

"You see...I'd be inclined to agree had he heeded my words prior....A coward has no worth...but this isn't my choice. It's his."

Taking in the information that the short sight of Misa's movement had provided, he knew what he was dealing with, but it didn't make a difference considering he knew there was no reason to make this a challenge of speed and strength. He simply waited, figuring that sooner or later, Keyshawn would recieve his punishment.* - Sat Sep 12 12:16:38 2015
