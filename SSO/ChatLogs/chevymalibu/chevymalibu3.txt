Regardless, his eyes shifted over to the land across the water, gathering sights of what seemed to be a purple gas. He assumed such was the result of Tethys and Yan's collaborative trap. Regardless, he proceeded forward with haste after making his observations, intent on lifting his comrade to deliver him back to Kirigakure.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) raised a hand as the bird returned to him, letting it come to rest upon his arm. Soon, he took the message that it delivered and let a single hand draw it open. As his eyes read the words, his face drooped somewhat, giving off the sense of dread that Niza rarely gave, even in the face of death. It pained him that his own brother had stooped to levels so low.

A movement of the arm and the bird was gone, as well as his own hat. Soon, he allowed himself to depart with his own robe as well, letting his own armor show to those within the area, his full head of silver hair showing to his allies and comrades. Soon, he turned, facing the crowd as he spoke aloud.

"I thank you all, for everything you've done for me. Should this be the last time we meet, I hope you improve and become the greatest generation of shinobi. Succeed where I have failed, and make things right for all villages...Ride or Die."

Within the next movement however, Niza was bounding off, over the wall and making way towards Konohagakure's boundaries with great speed, more than likely living up to his name as the 'White Flash,' even if he didn't like the name.* - Thu Sep 17 19:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) proceeded onwards through the area outside of Kirigakure, utilizing the trees as a means of travel, his eyes passing over the troops of Amegakure. However, an idea came to mind. He figured, his speed was a great thing to assist himself and proceeded to make his way to the backside of Zetsumo's allied forces. Upon reaching them, he'd reveal at least two kunai with explosive tags upon them, launching them both into the backside of his troops before continuing on his road to Konohagakure.* - Thu Sep 17 19:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded forth, seeing that he wasn't stopped. They were probably trying to assess what had just happened.* - Thu Sep 17 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) arrived at the gates of Konohagakure, proceeding to move forward as he attempted to assess the number of troops that were still around as well as locate Ushinawa. As Niza moved through the village, he bounded from the wall to the buildings, and onwards, calling out along the way. 

"HIRU!"* - Thu Sep 17 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to enter the area, bounding in with the walls as his initial point. Soon, he landed upon the concrete in front of the Hokage Mansion, observing the flames and the young male that resided nearby. His wounds seemed heavy, but Niza could do nothing to help. Regardless, he turned his visage, looking upon Ushinawa as he hadn't appeared to be concealed from his own visage.

Rather than attacking, he simply called outwards. "Hiru! I've come..." Hoping to cast his attention to his side and prevent him from continuing his acts.* - Thu Sep 17 20:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) thinks: Well, atleast I'm not alone now. .  Right? - Thu Sep 17 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found himself in a moment of weakness. He had no understanding of what had come over him, but it seemed he couldn't move his limbs. Yet, his eyes spotted the movements of Ushinawa and this concerned him greatly. In their prior meetings, he would've counteracted this engagement, yet it seemed he was incapable now due to whatever effect was coming over him. Had it been a poison injected into him in his moment of heat and recklessness? Had it been a genjutsu? It was unknown, yet, Niza, Knight of the Round and Raikage could do nothing but remain there, stunned and open to the stab from Ushinawa. He was now, mortally wounded, a cry of pain coming forth as Niza had never felt such before now.* - Thu Sep 17 20:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: | - Thu Sep 17 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained where he was, still feeling the pain from the attack that Ushinawa had done to him. He'd only realized that he'd just made the pain worse for himself with the thoughts of his relationship between the two. It was addling his mind, preventing a pure focus on the others around him. If anything, his mind was strapped onto Ushinawa and Ushinawa only. 

Even if he could not move, there wasn't much need. However the jolt of pain had relieved him, his neck wounded but his hand shifting itself to the clothe he wore upon his skin, tearing a  long sleeve as a means of a temporary bandage. The moment where he would come to Yan's aid would more than likely arrive soon, but for now he needed to put a stop to his bleeding if he wished to put a stop to things.* - Thu Sep 17 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) wasn't oblivious to his surroundings. The sound of a summoning and the blatantly obvious cloud covering its presence took place nearby. He'd been told of Hanabi's summoning specialty but he'd never expected such to be so far along as he found the giant snake's fangs approaching him and Ushinawa's movements as well.

The moment was hectic and Niza required a reaction, a strong one of course as he now began to pick up the haste, letting his wounded neck fall out of the equation. A split second and he allowed himself to move, a new layer taking over his own body as fur began to sprout, protuding from his own skin as he backed away from the original position. His new location being brought closer to the flaming mansion in the background as he utilizied his own brain power, devising a plan of action as he neared the flames.

In his current moment, he had no care for the effects of the elements as he proved to be nigh-invulnerable to them, his body still however feeling the heat against his back as he neared such. His only requirement now being that the large beast follow him along this path, assuming that he could deal with this threat before Ushinawa could advance on him.

'A betrayal from everyone...none can be trusted.' was all he could think while doing this.* - Thu Sep 17 21:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) whispers: (Watch me get cheesedxD) - Thu Sep 17 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) (*Yan wasn't in the genjutsu anymore? Since an answer wasn't given, that much was assumed. The giant snake seemed to be attacking Niza and since he dodged the attack, it turned its sights upon Yan. Yan wasn't going to stand around and wait. He would jump back away as the snake made its way.. With its distance, it was still a period of around two seconds before the snake would be upon him thereby allowing him a time for a quick response. With that being said, as he lept back, he would be performing a short set of seals with blinding speed. As he landed, twelve plumes of smoke appeared in front of him. 
\
\As the smoke cleared, clones would be within the plumes of smoke and those clones would unleash their own surprise. From Twelve clones was generated the same number in mud rivers. These combined mud rivers would hit the at this point attacking Manda unless it could evade in time. Yan would be transmitting his chakra into the ground, preparing to make an escape if he wasn't killed in that instant.*)

REPOST* - Thu Sep 17 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) spotted the change between the four combatants. Over the roars of the flames, he both behind him and ahead of himself, he couldn't hear words, only action, pivoting himself. Niza's body proceeded to pick up movement, his attempts simply there to keep his body in tact and from recieving any more wounds. In this situation he found himself applying his own chakra to the bottom of his feet, much like the suimen technique.

As the large dragon head seemed to near, he soon launched forward, slowing as he gained height in the air, both his chakra and pure leg strength working together to raise himself into the air. His fantastic attempts never ceasing to get him out of situations. Yet, the aim of the technique was the most important part. To make this simple, rewind to the jump.

Niza didn't only leap, but he angled his body, focusing on the change in Manda while understanding that he couldn't reach the head with the speed the creature seemed to be moving. He was required to protect this individual known as Yan, making his movements guided to reach his only ally in an attempt to save him. In order to do so, his placement was aimed for the tail, hoping to bring his weight down onto the tail of Manda, along the way hoping that possibly his weight could even carry him straight through the tail and leave an opening for Yan to escape or do whatever he had planned.* - Thu Sep 17 21:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found himself in a predicament now, the raiton connecting with his body as it rattled his mind. His brain wasn't doing quite well with the effects of the lightning coursing through his head. It was obvious that Ushinawa carried the weight and skill of a Master with this technique, considering how he pinpointed the head.

Soon, Niza found himself constricted in the grip of Manda, a mistake now that he'd been hit with the raiton technique. However, as he regained his senses, he figured he could get out of this situation without great harm considering his armor and body combined, both proved to be quite sturdy and reliable, especially against physical actions.

He may not have been capable of performing a strong action, but as a soft response, he braced himself, moving his arms outwards as a means to press against Manda's constricting form. At this point, he was only utilizing half of his body strength, slowly working his way up to a full push as a response.* - Thu Sep 17 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) recognized the smoke that only came with the disappearance of a summon, or their arrival of course. Yet, it was in this moment that his vision was fogged, unable to see due to such, but it was obvious to him that this gave Ushinawa an advantage and in that moment, steel touched skin.

Niza recieved another momentary flash of pain, the piercing pain shooting through his skin as he once again found himself in a moment of weakness. A moment of life or death. He was once again placed on the edge just as he'd been when he faced against a demon, Tetsujin, the Gezo, even Tethys and Niklaus themselves. He'd felt such a thing too many times before and in this moment, he found he was incapable of rising again, just as he did before.

He never expected such an easy defeat to take place over himself, especially in the seat of Raikage, but he was doomed. He had failed, and his people would know this. He had been left to remain here in pain, his mind only realizing that he hadn't just abandonded his people, but they'd done the same to him. In his falling moments, he only spoke up to Ushinawa, few words coming forth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained where he lay, his neck proving to have the worst wounds of all, considering he'd taken at least one raiton technique and multiple stab wounds to the back of such.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Maybe if we give them aerial attack.... Kunai with explosive tags, jutsus on their front, and so on. We can bring them to go support that side, and then we strike the back. - Fri Sep 18 16:13:52 2015

Under a body of water... which they could easily hit a water line and flood the tunnels along with the people. All without chakra hoping to make it in time before we starve out. - Fri Sep 18 16:30:56 2015
