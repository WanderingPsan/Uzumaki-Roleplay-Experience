<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: How have you been, Niza? - Mon Sep 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I was wondering. - Mon Sep 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: If you wanted to train with me. - Mon Sep 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I have a technique I must pass down to you. - Mon Sep 28 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure - Mon Sep 28 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I'm going to teach this to you. - Mon Sep 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: In hopes that you can use it for protecting Kumogakure. - Mon Sep 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I call it. - Mon Sep 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: The Welcoming Approach. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Before you can even fathom using it though. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The Welcoming Approach? - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You'll need to learn another technique. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Known as the Monk Shockwave. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Imitate this. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained still, observing Yukio for a moment. He pondered on what the technique could be that he was to demonstrate. However, Niza had felt the pressure pass over him from Yukio, his body seeming to pause momentarily as he remained there in place. A stunning wave passing over him. With the feeling that Niza recieved from his, he assumed this was the technique he had used before. Niza's mind figuring that the technique was applying the pressure of one's chakra and letting it surge outwards.

Once the stun had passed over him, Niza found himself nodding focusing on trying to make an attempt at using the technique. Within a moment, Niza found himself proceeding to focus upon his chakra as he stood there. He inhaled and then proceeded to exhale before attempting to force his own chakra outwards. At Niza's skill level however, it seemed he wasn't necessarily up to par with Yukio, creating a fodder wave in response. 

"This technique is a bit difficult to imitate it seems."* - Mon Sep 28 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he listened to Yukio's words, taking them in as words of importance. For the most part, getting the gist of what he was saying. Shifting his visage to rest upon Yukio, he was unsure of how to respond, as usual, but still gave response.

"I see. I will work hard to understand this. I thank you, Master Yukio."* - Mon Sep 28 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Take this. - Mon Sep 28 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Master it. - Mon Sep 28 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: And keep up your good work. - Mon Sep 28 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) accepts the scroll.* - Mon Sep 28 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall. - Mon Sep 28 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You should have a family, soon, Niza. - Mon Sep 28 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: Life is short. - Mon Sep 28 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I should... - Mon Sep 28 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: I look forward to having tea with you sometime. - Mon Sep 28 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: We can chat. - Mon Sep 28 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) allowed himself to open the scroll which contained the technique showed to him by Yukio. Without a doubt, he proceeded to begin reading throughout the process of the scroll, studying the details within with great ease.* - Mon Sep 28 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Lord Raikage? - Mon Sep 28 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes? - Mon Sep 28 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Is it possible to have a mission? I know...we're in a time of possible crisis...but I just need to clear my head. - Mon Sep 28 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) tossed the girl a mission.* - Mon Sep 28 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) tossed her the reward.* - Mon Sep 28 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to get to work with his training, allowing himself to access the Monk Shockwave technique shown to him by Yukio. With his knowledge of the technique now, Niza figured he could perform the technique on a much larger scale now. He proceeded to allow himself to access his chakra, utilizing the Gift of the Hermit Group. With a half-squat, Niza exerted a single shout. "Ha!" With that, out his chakra went, expelling in a rupturing wave.* - Mon Sep 28 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to enact upon the Monk jutsu, allowing himself to focus within his position. As Niza stood there, he was practically brandishing a massive flow of chakra, hit after hit. Any sensory specilaist would find this feat to be quite devastating, especially for the one practicing it but Niza cared not, allowing his chakra to burst and swell outwards from within himself.* - Mon Sep 28 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained vigilant in his practices, making sure to keep his chakra reserves under wraps as he allowed himself to access his chakra with each usage of the shockwave. His chakra easily bursting outwards to cross the region around him. Within moments, there was a field of chakra passing throughout the region around himself.* - Mon Sep 28 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to pick up on his training once again, focusing his chakra on the act of releasing a shockwave. For a moment, he stood still, eventually letting out his Kiai before sending a wave of chakra running and coursing throughout the area before himself.* - Mon Sep 28 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to allow himself to access the same technique. His Monk chakra still continuing to apply to the situation at hand. In moments afterwards, he was proceeding to pickup on the prime point, allowing himself to access his Kiai and release the shout. With that, an exploding wave of persuasion washed over the area before him.* - Tue Sep 29 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) entered a meditative pose now, letting his mind and body rest at the same time. While Niza sat there however, he continued to focus on releasing his willpower and chakra throughout this shockwave, assuming it would be possibly one of the greatest techniques for him to utilize in his motion for peace.* - Tue Sep 29 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to stay within his meditative pose. His eyes remaining shut and his hands resting upon his lap as he stood there. With this action, he soon found himself actually expelling a chakra wave repeatedly, accessing the Monk's Shockwave technique as he did this.* - Tue Sep 29 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) stuck to his training regime. His meditative stance allowing him to focus on the control of his chakra within solace. As he did so, his Gift began to swirl within, vibrating and humming from the epicenter of Niza. Eventually, he was speaking in a low tone, releasing a Kiai and a wave alongside it. His chakra washing over the area, unseen, and unheard, but felt.* - Tue Sep 29 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to meditate, finding himself to remain with his mind focused on his chakra. Niza had let his mind purposely begin together his monk chakra for the purpose of releasing it in one large wave, yet, the position of Sabo may have begun to impede anothers problem.* - Tue Sep 29 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Think it gives 5+_ - Tue Sep 29 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make an entry upon the situation, his eyes coming across two easily recognizable figures. Niza's expression seemed to falter now as a moment of depression crossed his face. Regardless, Niza made his approach, entering the region that allowed Niza to observe both Ushinawa and Ikaro.

A focus upon his chakra sparked a single warping of it. Soon, he was proceeding to overlay his own chakra with the Gift presented to him by Yukio, pure thoughts of the Fire Temple passing throughout him as he allowed his face to enter a state of solitude, his expression coming to one of peace.

As a presentation to end the altercation, he brought his hands togehter and allowed himself to express a single call with force. "HA!" With his loud call, a force expelled itself from within him and pushed outwards, washing over those present in the area, intent on doing nothing more than calming the situation and even possibly stunning the figures. In Niza's head, he was hoping for this to stop Ushinawa, his snakes should they appear, and Ikaro of course.

Once his wave had cleared, he'd open his eyes and look over the two, expressing a single question. "What is the meaning of this?"* - Tue Sep 29 21:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . You do realise. . . That whenever someone obtains the blades of Kirigakure, they return to Kirigakure upon the individual's demise? - Tue Sep 29 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: They are not passed down. They belong to the village. - Tue Sep 29 21:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: This is no offensive taijutsu. - Wed Sep 30 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It is simply known as, the Misdirect. - Wed Sep 30 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The intention is to guid a strike off course. - Wed Sep 30 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh? - Wed Sep 30 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: This however, is offensive but not really there for more than a stun. - Wed Sep 30 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For this technique, you take the backside of your hand. - Wed Sep 30 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Focus on the ridges of your knuckles for power. - Wed Sep 30 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And plant them within the throat of your opponent. - Wed Sep 30 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Even those with great defense have had trouble countering such a technique. - Wed Sep 30 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see, I will practice it then. - Wed Sep 30 02:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall demonstrate this technique. - Wed Sep 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) performed a simple handsign, allowing Niza to conjur a second version of himself. This being however, didn't really look as well as Niza. As he remained where he stood, Niza found himself focusing in on the throat of his own clone. Within a moment, he found himself jutting out a single hand, launching it for the same point he observed, brandishing the backside of his hand to the throat. Soon after, his palm dropped to his side and he was once again looking at Hideki, his clone gone and no longer useful.* - Wed Sep 30 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) settled himself amongst an empty space within Kumogakure, revealing the Shibuki blade once more. Brandishing the tool to the open world, he allowed himself to begin making movements with it, hefting its weight up with his own strength. Niza was beginning to get more used to it, and therefore attempted to make a single hard swing at the massive area ahead of himself. * - Wed Sep 30 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) took a moment to allow himself to access his innate chakra, focusing within his position, his hands came together to brace himself and eventually found a point of release. A single breath exposed to the world of the living and his chakra was released, washing over the area around himself. Niza was still improving upon the technique, actively using such to enact peace where needed.* - Thu Oct  1 00:14:30 2015
