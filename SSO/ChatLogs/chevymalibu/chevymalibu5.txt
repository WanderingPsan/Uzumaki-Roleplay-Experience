<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) made his way to the western wall of Kirigakure, proceeding to charge chakra into his legs as he approached the wall. Soon, he lifted up into the air, taking flight as he crossed over the boundaries that had seperated him from the armies of Amegakure for so long. Soon, without problem he was bounding across the troops, utilizing their heads as a means of escape.* - Sat Sep 19 21:18:56 2015

At the speed he was moving, he was quite hard to make out, yet, his own eyes spotted a few figures amongst the trees. Once he'd crossed the bridge, he allowed himself to come down to a settlement in front of it, his eyes moving to scan the both of them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to draw forth a bit of blood from himself, accessing the summoning technique. He allows a single rabbit to take place in front of him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeds to step forward, taking the center lane between both crowds now. The insults thrown back and forth combined with the various threats was enough. Niza hadn't needed to see either side strike just to heed Ushinawa's words. But now, he saw clearly, he saw that there was, indeed, no light within Kirigakure.

He swiveled and allowed his eyes to shift around, gazing over the crowd as he simply revealed the robes of the Raikage once again, slipping such on. 

"I sent word. So that you could heed my advice. I believed you'd all do better than this, but it seems threats and insults are the way to go. Your idea of winning is long gone. Kirigakure will become the new Sunagakure, the new Konohagakure. Zetsumo will prevail, and Kumogakure shall take no loss..."

Acting upon such, he turned now to face Ushinawa, speaking aloud, enough for the Kumogakure shinobi stationed within the village to heed his words, or at least, for them to begin spreading his voice. "Kumogakure is to depart. This war is no longer ours. I've seen the truth now. All who've seen such, should heed my words." Another movement, and Niza was now carrying himself towards the exit of Kirigakure.* - Sun Sep 20 16:10:27 2015
