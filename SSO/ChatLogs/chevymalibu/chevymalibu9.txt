<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: This technique is similar to Suimen. - Fri Sep 25 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: However, the chakra that you apply to your feet, is then released to launch you either forward, or upwards. - Fri Sep 25 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's great for covering distances obviously. - Fri Sep 25 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Suimen? - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Do you not know the Suimen technique? - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What's that? - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It is a technique that allows you to walk across water and climb mountains with ease. - Fri Sep 25 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: To achieve this. - Fri Sep 25 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You simply need to focus your chakra into the feet. - Fri Sep 25 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And balance it evenly. - Fri Sep 25 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Fri Sep 25 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Now, since you understand that technique. - Fri Sep 25 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Would you like a clear demonstration of the Hop technique, or do you think you can perform it? - Fri Sep 25 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Demonstration would be nice. - Fri Sep 25 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded before proceeding to bend his legs, obviously allowing himself to make the appearance of a man preparing to jump. Afterwards, he allowed his chakra to begin pumping into the legs, pushing forward into his feet before splaying outwards like the Suimen technique. Once he'd done so, he allowed himself to release the rest of this chakra and enter the sky himself, practically sending himself even higher into the clouds of Kumogakure with great ease. When he came back, he let himself touch down with the ground lightly and looked back to Seisuke. "Easy enough, yes?"* - Fri Sep 25 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Very good, you've got the basics it seems. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Lord Niza. - Fri Sep 25 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'd like to spar you to test my skills. - Fri Sep 25 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I am ready when you are. - Fri Sep 25 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Right. - Fri Sep 25 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Mamoru's initial movement, figuring that he'd utilize the knowledge gained from their last spar. A backstepping motion was made and he found himself just out of the saber's range. Yet, he noticed a cut take place on his leg. It was obvious that Mamoru's skill had improved since their last encounter. Regardless, Niza attempted to retaliate quickly, moving to the right to put himself off-center and make an approach, his right hand raising once he closed back in to deliver a single backhand. to the throat while remaining wary of his left side.* - Fri Sep 25 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Mamoru's response, seeing that his hand had of course missed the intended target, leaving him open to attack. However, it was when his eyes took sight of the legs upraise that he allowed himself to bring in his left arm while simultaneously pushing his body into a lateral motion to the right. Should this instance complete, the left leg follows shortly after and both appendages come down to make a connection with the extended leg, and quite literally render it useless for the moment as he only had the intent to capture this leg wile bringing his right hand back to his side.* - Sat Sep 26 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found his arm meeting with the blade, not only bringing damage to it but shifting his hold. Soon, the only limb he had connected to Mamoru was his leg, which had retracted alongside the elbow. In response to this action, he brought himself into another lateral movement, aiming to position himself to Mamoru's left side and bring up his right hand to thrust a single palm into the shoulder of Mamoru and possibly bring him off of his balance.* - Sat Sep 26 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) aimed to close distance now once again as he saw Mamoru take a position of self-defense. He assumed that his opponent would have the advantage in terms of reaction in this moment as he came in closely. Niza prepared one hand for his own term of defense as the other came forward, to connect with Mamoru's chin, hopefully taking away his balance once again.* - Sat Sep 26 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) felt the impact of Mamoru's strikes as he made his response. He was quite easily rejected his attack and moved backwards. His eyes proceeding to come upwards to meet Mamoru's face. It seemed that Niza was caught off guard in this moment, his legs proceeding to stop heeding his command as he stumbles. He was indeed, in a moment of stun from the retaliation.* - Sat Sep 26 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) recovers now, standing still as he listens to Mamoru's words. "You're welcome. It was a good spar. You've improved greatly."* - Sat Sep 26 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Thank you. - Sat Sep 26 00:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Right. - Sat Sep 26 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose I should return to the public now. - Sat Sep 26 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Thanks. - Sat Sep 26 00:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: So far, each used a particular style that seemed to be unique to those with eyes like that. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I was wondering if you happened to know of this style? - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you mean a martial arts style? - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes, I utilize such a style that benefits from my eyes. - Sat Sep 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But it's purely for meditation and self defense. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: At least, that's how I see it. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why do you ask? - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I was wondering if you could teach me this style. Simply because it didn't seem to be so...rash and offensive. - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But what of Kempo? - Sat Sep 26 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's useful yes, but not applicable in all situations. - Sat Sep 26 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I enjoy it for its defense, but I feel I would require other means to apply as well. - Sat Sep 26 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..Well, I suppose I should explain to you the style I use. - Sat Sep 26 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Kuro with interested eyes. Niza had seen this unique style many times before but he had never had the chance to actually sit down and learn it. As he observed, he simply raised up from his seat, motioning around the table as he took a position lateral to Kuro. Soon, Niza too, was performing this stance, or at least attempting to. His body simply motioning his arms into position and his legs as well, yet he proved to be in a state between perfection and horrendous. Regardless, he attempted to keep eyes on Kuro and perform the same, yet failing to stand at the same standard.* - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: With these eyes, I can see the chakra of other people. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can also clearly see certain points on the body. This style is defensive in nature like Kempo, but it can also be abused and turned into something offensive. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll show you. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he exitted the pose, allowing himself to extend his hand to Kuro's presence. * - Sat Sep 26 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) felt the feeling within his hand quite literally disappear. His eyes observing Kuro's actions. With a simple touch, his hand was practically rendered useless. His eyes then shifted to Kuro's face as he spoke "I see. This is incredible."

With the second tap however, he regained feeling and allowed himself to somewhat flex his hand, clenching and unclenching it as he went.* - Sat Sep 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) thinks: Since he can - Sat Sep 26 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 26 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to remove a scroll from within his cloak, handing it over to Mamoru.* - Sat Sep 26 03:18:24 2015
