<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. We can head there then. - Sun Sep 27 00:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Understandable. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Most of them are higher end. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I'm confident in your ability to dodge. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Right. Should be fine. - Sun Sep 27 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll let you start us off. - Sun Sep 27 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he observed Seisuke. So far he'd only known the young Gezo prince to deal in the art of Fuuinjutsu and whatever Taijutsu abilities Niza had taught him, therefore he could only wonder what else Seisuke had learned. Regardless, Niza began to close the distance, allowing himself to move forward in a burst of speed while his hands raised upwards and began to perform a few handseals.

Chakra within Niza's body would begin to focus into a central point before being released throughout his palms with the completion of the handseals. This produced a torrent of wind which proceeded to move within Seisuke's direction of course.* - Sun Sep 27 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) aimed to continue his pursuit but the introduction of shadow clones had presented quite a problem. He noticed one utilizing his own technique and the other executing a Fuuton technique. As Niza approached, he found himself meeting with this ball of wind, actually letting his chestplate take the impact for such, which mitigated damage for him but didn't prevent him from being blasted back a bit. In response to this, Niza allowed himself to bring up his hands once again to perform a few more handseals. Upon completion however, he'd bring them upwards to his own mouth as a if they were guiding his face. 

Niza fired off roughly two bullets of air from his own mouth, aiming one forward at the clone that struck him and then turned his vision upwards to aim a second at the clone in the air.* - Sun Sep 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as the clone within the aire continued to come at him. Rather than choosing to depend on his ninjutsu tactics, he proceeded to let himself liftupwards with the same technique, his chakra thrusting him upwards into the air to meet his target. A single fist was extended as he planned to let such connect with the clone's face should Niza meet no resistance at the moment.* - Sun Sep 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was on his descent towards the ground once again until he found himself being struck by Seisuke. The attack being rather unsuspecting especially with the force of the weapon and size. In response, Niza couldn't really do anything against it, considering they were in the air. For the moment however, he was subject to free-fall and a recovery attempt to make a safe landing. Either way he definetly recieved some damage from that.* - Sun Sep 27 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) connected with the ground now, his hands and legs touching down first. He then proceeded to lift himself and face Seisuke's position now. He took notice of him sheathing the weapon.  Moments after however, Niza found himself taking himself to Seisuke's path as he let his eyes close in on him, hoping to meet with his own force in response. As a result, a single hand was prepared for taijutsu defence.* - Sun Sep 27 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Seisuke's motions, Niza bringing the hand he had prepared for defensive motions in to redirect the hand. Normally, this technique would utilize the backside of Niza's hand but he used the palm to brush Seisuke's attack downwards and show the entirety of his arm. Secondly, he'd follow up with the most responsive taijutsu technique in his arsenal with the opposing hand, brandishing his knuckles to the throat of Seisuke.* - Sun Sep 27 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as he now had his own opening to deliver another strike to Seisuke, finding it to be a fair trade. A stun for a stun. However, Niza proceeded to bring in his hand for deflection and bring it upwards to meet Seisuke's chin before proceeding to back away from him, his eyes keeping locked upon his student now, figuring he'd come with a response.* - Sun Sep 27 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) let his eyes shift between the two targets. The clone and Seisuke himself. For a moment, Niza believed another distraction was going to be employed, but in response he simply allowed himself to back up once more, exitting taijutsu range as he performed a few more handseal. Soon, he was easily performing the same Air Bullet technique again, targetting both in this instance.* - Sun Sep 27 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) felt confident in his response to the cone until it was overwhelmed by the two fuuton techniques produced by Seisuke. This had of course pushed him away from the two, knocking Niza to the ground in the same instance. He had of course gone quite some distance but he attempted to stand before Seisuke could close in upon him, trying to prepare himself for defense.* - Sun Sep 27 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) seemed to be slacking now as he observed Seisuke and his clone approaching. He couldn't detect what the two were doing but Niza's actions only proceeded to be himself raising a single hand to deflect one. The other however, actually proceeding to fail in defense, effectively finding at least one arm to be struck, pushing him backwards with the strick somewhat.* - Sun Sep 27 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as the clone exitted range and Niza's arm had fallen limp. He had no understanding of what action had just took place but it seemed that he was going to have trouble working with only a single arm. Even then, he proceeded to remove himself from Seisuke's range, figuring that this was the effect of his fuuinjutsu. There was of course no means of him removing it at least in this moment, but regardless he relied on his reflexes to deliver him from his position, moving lateral enough for himself to stay out of harms way.* - Sun Sep 27 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he looked to Seisuke. With his arm rendered useless, he turned his visage to it and simply looked back to Seisuke. "With this, I'd say it's truly your win. Remarkable work. I've never seen someone disable an arm like that before."* - Sun Sep 27 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Sun Sep 27 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I presume this is what you wished to add to your taijutsu. - Sun Sep 27 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ah.. - Sun Sep 27 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: From what I know, his technique disables the opponents fighting capability as well. - Sun Sep 27 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Uh..I don't believe he uses fuuinjutsu for such actually. - Sun Sep 27 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to take a moment to rest up, regaining a majority of his chakra now.* - Sun Sep 27 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That was a great spar though. - Sun Sep 27 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I agree. - Sun Sep 27 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose we should return to the public now. - Sun Sep 27 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: But I found a fondness for his defensive taijutsu. - Sun Sep 27 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Defensive jutsu? - Sun Sep 27 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I heard him once mention something called the welcoming approach - Sun Sep 27 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Oh? - Sun Sep 27 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm...Possibly something for a later lesson. - Sun Sep 27 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I over heard it when he was telling Klaus. - Sun Sep 27 05:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: As do I. - Sun Sep 27 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I you want I could teach you the Ninja Art: Fire run technique. - Sun Sep 27 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm....I think that would be good. - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Lets go outside. - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Of course. - Sun Sep 27 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not wish to start an unnecessary fire. - Sun Sep 27 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed and listened to both Hanabi's demonstration and explanation. His eyes passing over the handseals and taking note of them rather easily. However, applying chakra was going to prove to be the only challenge that would possibly challenge him. Soon after, he allowed himself to perform the action. His chakra working up within himself as he attempted to imitate the technique. Yet, when he attempted to release this chakra, he failed. "How embarassing..."

Re-attempting the technique, he allowed himself to make the handseal once again. His chakra within the post swelling within before focusing into the gut region. It had began to heat up with ease before he allowed it to funnel upwards and out, focusing into a single stream of fire. This one connecting to the ground now and proceeding to make a rather crude circle, but a circle nonetheless upon the ground.

"Hm..."* - Sun Sep 27 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Good job. - Sun Sep 27 05:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You don't have to. - Sun Sep 27 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I feel the need to.. - Sun Sep 27 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I may not know many things but I would imagine that being stabbed in the back is not a good feeling. - Sun Sep 27 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's the worst feeling... - Sun Sep 27 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: If anything I should apologize to you. - Sun Sep 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I was only trying to get on Ushinawa's good side since I sorta turned Hideki against his will. - Sun Sep 27 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Sun Sep 27 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But like I said everything worked out in the end. - Sun Sep 27 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose. - Sun Sep 27 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you know the strength of Sunagakure? - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: At the moment, no. The shinobi from there were very vague. - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you know if they have anyone that can be of trouble? - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Or note worthy? - Sun Sep 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The only name mentioned, is Edge. - Sun Sep 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Is he powerful? - Sun Sep 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Apparently. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I would like to show you something. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The problem is. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That if that Edge person comes out I will be in trouble. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So I would need you to protect me. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Will you come with me to Suna? - Sun Sep 27 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Sep 27 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I can only wonder what you're going to show me... - Sun Sep 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained at Hanabi's side, listening to what she had to say as he moved forward. A nod and he'd begin to speak. "I will protect you, don't worry." However, with each passing moment he was growing more wary of what he could possibly be shown.* - Sun Sep 27 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) extended his own arms to catch Hanabi, attempting to support her. He hadn't wished for her to collapse against the ground for obvious reasons, but his eyes proceeded to trail over to the snakes. As he observed, his eyes widened at the masses of snakes revealing themselves before him. The fact that they were all delivered from within Hanabi had made him even more suprised, considering the amount. For a moment, he was speechless, watching the snakes move onwards to the village of Sunagakure.

"This technique....My goodness..." It was obvious that Niza, was of course, at a loss of words. He had no idea how to respond in this situation, wondering if he should warrant a command to make her stop the snakes or to just leave. Regardless, he remained in place out of sheer admiration for her ability.* - Sun Sep 27 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to observe the snakes from a distance, for a moment, he actually thought about letting this continue. Yet, Sunagakure hadn't really proven to be of any threat to the village. A silight shake of the head and Niza regained his normal composure. "Hanabi, stop this. This isn't right."

He was obviously letting his inner-monk get the best of him once again.* - Sun Sep 27 06:12:54 2015

 His eyes continued to remain on the crowd of snakes which were easily raising the body count of Sunagakure once again. For both of their sakes, and Kumogakure's, he had hoped that they could walk away from this without problem.

He was obviously letting his inner-monk get the best of him once again* - Sun Sep 27 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*Coughs*> - Sun Sep 27 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as she ended her technique. He turned, allowing himself to keep a hand upon Hanabi just incase she still required the support, but he figured she didn't really need it by now. Regardless however, he stayed on the track back to Kumogakure, his eyes passing over Hideki. "We need to leave."* - Sun Sep 27 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right.. - Sun Sep 27 06:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I saw Kenshin and Edge today. - Sun Sep 27 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Although... Ikarus has the same eyes as Suitengu.. - Sun Sep 27 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Which makes me jump to conclussions.. - Sun Sep 27 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Good thing he wasn't in Suna... - Sun Sep 27 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Did you hear or learn anything Hideki? - Sun Sep 27 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Only thing I know from being in Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Is that I saw Kenshin, and Edge in the same place. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Fujitora and Zenaki was there. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Is that good or bad?0 - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Along with Suitengu, and Ikarus. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Dunno - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Could be good, could be bad. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well. - Sun Sep 27 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am going to get some rest. - Sun Sep 27 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll speak to you two in the morning or something. - Sun Sep 27 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right..I'll be doing the same. - Sun Sep 27 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) stood there alone by himself amongst the dirt of Kumogakure. His position was distanced from the homes and villagers as he had no intent of hurting those he was meant to guide and protect. His hand proceeded to reach over his shoulder, drawing for the the great Shibuki, Niza's own Knight of the Round blade. However, he found the explosive tags set upon one side to be rather strange. For now however, he focused his attention on the opposing edge as that seemed to be the best to start with. However, even with his strength, Niza could feel some heft amongst it, his arms being weighed down by the heavy weapon.* - Sun Sep 27 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to work with the blade, utilizing his own strength to begin getting used to it. While he held amazing strength, the blade however, was definetly nothing to disregard with how he was holding the blade. Even then he was quite literally holding the blade in an incorrect form. However, he recalled upon Tethys' usage of heavy weapons and imitated that.* - Sun Sep 27 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to act with the weapon. His arms effectively extending the weapon to make a downwards chopping motion. He was actually proceeding to do so quite well, however, he did have to adjust to the speeds of how fast the blade dropped with wait and watch it come down, his anticipation assisting him now.* - Sun Sep 27 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) kept his eyes forward as he motioned with the blade. He was beginning to get better within tiny incriments, but better nevertheless. His arms actually gaining quite a tense workout from such a feat. His grip had remained tight and he still proceeded to make chopping actions, still yet afraid of progressing into the next portion of training he had in mind, expecting that would just cause an explosion to come.* - Sun Sep 27 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was still actively using the blade. His actions were simply of himself accessing its weight and trying to bring the blade upwards. Each time, his head avoiding the long edge which ahd obviously given the weapon its name. Regardless, Niza started to let his eyes adjust to the edges and simple watched his own strength attempt to work against the force of gravity.* - Sun Sep 27 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) still remained with his thoughts upon training. As he hefted the blade around, he proceeded to shift from a chopping motion and began to do a couple of side winders to further his training. Niza felt strain within his arms, but it didn't matter to him regarding the fact that he could handle it, especially for a while considering his stamina reserves.* - Sun Sep 27 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) still found himself in the same position, utilizing the same weapon. His body shifting around the area and the Shibuki blade following through to make cleaving tactics. Moving with the blade was easy, but performing any form of strike was proving quite difficult. Niza continued to make several crosscut motions, trying to get used to such.* - Sun Sep 27 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to maneuver with the blade, attempting to make sure he was only using the narrow edge over the platform section. With his movements, he found himself stumbling around like a fool. Sometimes misjudging how far he needed to pull the blade back or how much strength was required when controlling the weight on a downward swing. Niza still continued to work for his mastery of course, trying to get even more used to the weapon.* - Sun Sep 27 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) still attempted to keep the Shibuki blade within his hands, working it around his form as he found himself having trouble with controlling the weight. He could lift the blade, yes, and he could move it, but that didn't change how hard the blade was working against him. He felt his grip coming lose with each swing, but he still retained it throughout his practices of course.* - Sun Sep 27 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make stepping motions, trying his best to get the Shibuki blades awkward weight and shape to balance out with his actions. His arms were beginning to feel strain for using the weapon but of course, Niza's everlasting reserve of stamina proceeded to assist him in his usage of the weapon. His body shifting around with the blade's weight in its hands.* - Sun Sep 27 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained in the same area, still twisting and turning with the blade in his hands. His legs shifted raround the dirt as he raised the blade. Niza motioned forward and attempted to make a single slash and prevent the weapon from touching the ground, but a misjudgement of opposing force was applied and the narrow edge still connected with the ground. Retracting the weapon, Niza simply let himself rest.* - Sun Sep 27 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Morning. - Sun Sep 27 15:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Morning. - Sun Sep 27 15:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is it. - Sun Sep 27 15:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It is not a regular blade I take it - Sun Sep 27 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sun Sep 27 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What does it do? - Sun Sep 27 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It has a platform on one side, for explosive power. - Sun Sep 27 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The other side is meant for cleaving. - Sun Sep 27 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: ... - Sun Sep 27 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Interesting. - Sun Sep 27 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've decided to refrain from using the platform until I master my use with the blade. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For safety reasons. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I would imagine you dont want to blow up. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Of course. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to settle himself in a more secluded position, allowing himself to begin practice of his taijutsu tactics. His arm raised and moving over to guide itself to remain equal with the knee. Soon, his knee came up and his elbow dropped, bothing appendages metting in the middle to form the Intersection Method.* - Sun Sep 27 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to practice the Intersection Method, allowing himself to pick up on the actions now, letting his elbow and knee guide themselves into each other. The connection proving to rather powerful, yet barely doing any damage to Niza himself.* - Sun Sep 27 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) brought both limbs together once again, his arm rotating just enough so that his upper body could position the elbow to meet with the knee. With that, his leg raised and both targets seemed to meet in the middle while Niza envisioned a single leg being placed between this.* - Sun Sep 27 19:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to move onwards to the Mansion, expecting Kuro to follow after.* - Sun Sep 27 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's people around. - Sun Sep 27 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) arrived on scene as he proceeded to observe. Niza was moving with haste as he entered the area, but when his eyes actually spread across the area he allowed himself to settle for a moment. Looking back to Kuro and Hideki, he simply stated, "Hang back."

After stating such, he proceeded to walk forward, watching the overflow of snakes come from Hanabi as he approached. A face of sadness came over him, seeing that even with his advanced stage of lycanthropy, he was still proving to be one of the slowest forces in the shinobi world. 

When he was within range, he allowed himself to speak out to Erebus, only asking a simple question. "What...happened...?"* - Sun Sep 27 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Those damn snakes... - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Who would've thought.. - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This is in your name, my lord.. - Sun Sep 27 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Another sinner sent to your gates.. - Sun Sep 27 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Erebus surviving the onslaught of snakes. He knew that the man could handle pain somewhat, and he even dished out some to himself, but what bothered him was that so many strikes seemed to be nothing to him. Therefore, his visage became dark and brooding as he questioned the being before him.

'This was no man. This was a demon. Surely...Himura's thoughts of immortality cannot be true?' he thought.

Hwoever, his eyes motioned to Hanabi's body once again before repeating the same question, in a more calm manner this time. Of course, trying to refrain from instigating violence.

"What happened..?"* - Sun Sep 27 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And go back - Sun Sep 27 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Your actual name is Haru! - Sun Sep 27 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: No, no it is not. - Sun Sep 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Sun Sep 27 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It is Taiga. - Sun Sep 27 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Shut up Haru. - Sun Sep 27 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: See, this is what I mean with disrespect. - Sun Sep 27 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: You disrespected me first! - Sun Sep 27 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded, turning now with silence as he made a simple waving motion for Misa and Kuro. Even speaking to notify them as well.

"Misa, Kuro. We're leaving now." And he expected them to follow after without problem of course.* - Sun Sep 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I did not. - Sun Sep 27 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Annoying woman. - Sun Sep 27 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Where'd everyone go?! - Sun Sep 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ushinawa's son is in the mansion. - Sun Sep 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I am unsure of Ushinawa himself or his wife. - Sun Sep 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: As well as Hideki. - Sun Sep 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Ushinawa's son?! - Sun Sep 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Whooooooooo?! - Sun Sep 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I believe his name is Heiwa. - Sun Sep 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It seems, we're both aunt and uncle respectively. - Sun Sep 27 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So Niza, who is this woman? - Sun Sep 27 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: My sister. - Sun Sep 27 22:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I didn't know you had siblings. - Sun Sep 27 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Practically the majority of the village is my family. - Sun Sep 27 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Rideee or dieee.~ - Sun Sep 27 22:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Probably would ride Niza if I was feeling it. - Sun Sep 27 22:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Kuro, I think we should finish our lesson. - Sun Sep 27 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Where should we go for it? - Sun Sep 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We can attend to the training yard. - Sun Sep 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. That seems like a good place. - Sun Sep 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Please lead the way. - Sun Sep 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: So, where was it we left off? - Sun Sep 27 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded in response. "Indeed. It stopped functioning until you did so again."* - Sun Sep 27 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's just one of the things you can do with the style. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To be honest, I'm not sure if you'll be able to accurately use it as I am, since it revolves around my eyes. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I believe I could still emulate such to some extent. - Sun Sep 27 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I suppose it's possible. - Sun Sep 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the entire theory behind the style is combating while attacking one's pressure points. - Sun Sep 27 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm...I see. - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And attacking these, disable various points of the body? - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's more of an internal rather than an external style of martial arts.  If used properly, it can limit an individual, and if used offensively, it can possibly deal irreversible damage to an individual, even death. - Sun Sep 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: After all, with this style, it's very easy to harm the organs and such.  However, I refrain from such activies, and purely use it as a method of meditation and for self defense. - Sun Sep 27 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see...A calm, yet devastating combat method... - Sun Sep 27 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If a person wished to, they could easily kill another and make it seem like a natural cause. - Sun Sep 27 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hence why control and accuracy is important. - Sun Sep 27 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Interesting. - Sun Sep 27 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Hideki was planning on going with him though. - Sun Sep 27 23:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Well at that moment, I shut them down. - Sun Sep 27 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Then came here. - Sun Sep 27 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Right... - Sun Sep 27 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'll be back Kuro. Give me a moment. - Sun Sep 27 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you think Hideki might be following a path of revenge? - Sun Sep 27 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Possibly. - Sun Sep 27 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What will you do? - Sun Sep 27 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Talk to him. - Sun Sep 27 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. I will. - Mon Sep 28 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. I'd hate myself more if I let another pass. - Mon Sep 28 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Oh. - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Kuro. - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We may return to our training. - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Yeah Kuro, resume your training! - Mon Sep 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. - Mon Sep 28 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok, back to what we were doing before. Do you have any questions thus far? - Mon Sep 28 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: None. - Mon Sep 28 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Kuro's stance, listening to his words just as he'd done before. Soon, Niza was imitating the stance, utilizing his brainpower and knowledge to imitate the same stance as Kuro. Looking at each point of his stance, he adjusted his body. Shifting his arms to become more fluid as well as his own legs, his position becoming low. Eventually, Niza repeated the final part of the message in his head.

'Fluid like water.' While, purely imitating Kuro the entire time. Still holding some trouble with doing so of course. But he was making due with what he could.* - Mon Sep 28 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained still within his stance as he listened to Kuro's words. His crude form was very similar, but not as excellent as Kuro's, but he figured he would reach that point eventually. Yet, his observation allowed him to identify the form of striking Kuro performed. It wasn't incredibly different from how Niza fought himself, but it did utilize the fingers as well.

While keeping his eyes trained on Kuro, Niza attempted to make the same movements all the while, listening in to his temporary teacher for now. He was actually learning quite a bit from this moment.* - Mon Sep 28 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded when Kuro had stated that he was moving on. Niza had of course kept focused, but also allowing his body to imitate Kuro's movements. With each point that was described, Niza attempted to envision himself looking at the human body on a chart. He was practically spying the different points that Kuro spewed facts about as he took into consideraction which were the safest to connect with.

Even as he listened, his body was reacting, creating multiple attacks in the same manner as Kuro, however probably proving to have begun adapting. He simply proceeded to find himself in a more lax form, even more similar to Kuro's now considering how long he'd been working to perfect this stance.

When Kuro had come to a halt with his explanations, he turned his eyes to meet him as he allowed himself to rest hist stance, figuring he had the basic form down, but remembering the points of importance would require some more work. "At the moment, no. This technique is more than I believed it to be it seems."* - Mon Sep 28 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded now as he looked to Kuro, preparing himself in the stance as he neared. Since it was defensive, he knew that he was to wait for an attack to be thrown at him first. Therefore, Niza was simply waiting for the first strike to be thrown at him. "Ready."* - Mon Sep 28 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . - Mon Sep 28 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) watched as Kuro came towards him, anticipating the maneuver. While he had the strikes down, it didn't really fully translate to a defensive maneuver. However, he allowed himself to access his reflexes, removing himself from the position and quite literally attempting to cross up Kuro's movements with his own. Niza's position moved to the right in an attempt to subside the palm as his own right hand came upwards, aiming to push it off course, the opposing hand meant to make a bee line for the finger jab and extend towards the wrist, returning one of his own to possibly change the course.* - Mon Sep 28 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) hadn't been prepared for the switch up in approach when his finger jab altered itself. Niza's initial response failing to enact now as his hand was negated. Although, on the other end of his body, Niza proceeded to focus his hand on trying to follow the movements of Kuro's and sending it directly after the jab with his own palm strike, making an attempt at a trade.* - Mon Sep 28 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as Kuro's efforts seeme to have payed off. Nizaw was easily spying the same process and sor of fethear unil she k they gave me such regardless as well.* - Mon Sep 28 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as Kuro's efforts seeme to have payed off. Niza saw he was easily spying the same process, allowing himself to combat such by moving back and thrusting a single arm forward, his intentions to slip his position and focus a strike on the available forarearm of Kuro.* - Mon Sep 28 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Kuro's actions, proceeding to end his stance after hearing his statement. With that, a nod came from Niza as he readjusted his positioning so that he stood in his normal stance. "Right. This was a good experience, I truly did learn some things today. Thank you Kuro." Niza returned with a soft smile of his own.* - Mon Sep 28 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Indeed it was.  Speaking of training, I wonder what Yukio is up to. - Mon Sep 28 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: As do I. - Mon Sep 28 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Speaking of such. - Mon Sep 28 03:50:49 2015
