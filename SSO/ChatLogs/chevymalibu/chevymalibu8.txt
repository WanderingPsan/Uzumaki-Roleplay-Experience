<br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to begin picking up on his training now as he allowed himself to access the summoning technique. With ease he allowed himself to create the summoning seal and allow at least two rabbits to settle on the ground, one on each side of himself now. After performing such, he began to make quick practice alongside his rabbits.

Niza proceeded to let himself bound around the area, utilizing chakra within his feet to move. His rabbits of course following behind him without much difficulty, especially considering he was sticking low to the ground.* - Wed Sep 23 19:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained on the move, his rabbits proceeding to follow after him as he kept his chakra pumping within his legs. He now had time to crack down upon his movements, considering how Amai had gone now and so had Maloth. It practically gave him the chance to focus on his own skills rather than teaching all the time.* - Wed Sep 23 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to act with his rabbits, pausing at least once for the both of them to hop onto his shoulders. Once they did so, he proceeded to bound around the area once more and let his chakra propel him forward. He was simply allowing himself to get more in tune with the technique, to prevent the heavy stress on his chakra and legs.* - Wed Sep 23 19:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) stayed on the move, letting his rabbits continue to tag along as he focused on the area around himself. He was completely aware of his next target after each bound, letting himself move without any problem. His eyes seemed to be tracking along a pattern now.* - Wed Sep 23 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) still followed the same premise, allowing himself to leap and bound everywhere, hearing the grunting noises of his rabbits as he did so. His movements were simple and fluent, especially when he touched down with the ground. It was rather easy for him to keep going like this with his massive chakra reserves at the moment.* - Wed Sep 23 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeds to begin bounding off towards the Raikage Mansion now with his rabbits both equipped to his shoulders. He was easily making way there without problem, choosing to take to the roof tops to make such easier for himself.* - Wed Sep 23 20:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) plants his foot in Kuro's chest, kicking his heart out.* - Wed Sep 23 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: omit - Wed Sep 23 20:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeds to land at the base of the mountain, allowing himself to settle with his cloak coming down behind him. Once the dust that was kicked up by his arrival had cleared, he simply coughed once and proceeded to face the pathway up to the mansion, both of his shoulders occupied by  a single rabbit. His eyes had then traversed from the pathway, onwards to Kuro, settling upon the boy as a means to inquire whom he was.* - Wed Sep 23 20:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hello. - Wed Sep 23 20:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasant day, is it not? - Wed Sep 23 20:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I believe it is. - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Care for a seat? - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: No, I'm fine. - Wed Sep 23 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, alright then. - Wed Sep 23 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, what can I do you the honor for, Lord Raikage? - Wed Sep 23 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ah...Well...I was just looking for someone to pass missions out to. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Care to take part? - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It would help me with my meditation greatly. - Wed Sep 23 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he revealed a single scroll, brandishing it to the young male."Very well."* - Wed Sep 23 21:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: They should be settled outside of our shopping complex I believe. - Wed Sep 23 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Seemed like the best place to begin. - Wed Sep 23 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed as Kuro seemed to activate his doujutsu. This was something Niza had seen a multitude of times before. From Kisara, Zhen, Quan, and even some random female within Konohagakure. It was obvious to him that there were few in the world with such an ability, and it had intrigued him. Yet, he remained silent only responding to Kuro's words as he figured he'd adress him after his mission.

"No problem."* - Wed Sep 23 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is there anything I should know about this visitor? I wish to make his trip here as pleasant as possible. - Wed Sep 23 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: He's a simple man from what I recall. You could probably show him a rock and he'd be astonished by it simply because it's foreign. - Wed Sep 23 21:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. Then I shall show him the wonders of the village, and intrigue his mind. - Wed Sep 23 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Wed Sep 23 21:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he watched Kuro head off. "No problem."* - Wed Sep 23 21:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I've come for booty. - Wed Sep 23 21:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hello Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 23 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hello... - Wed Sep 23 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I was just wondering. - Wed Sep 23 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You're an official of the Gezo, correct? - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Why won't he go back to his old name...It's much better. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well, what is your take them as a whole? In my stay in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: When they were taking eyes. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It was under the premise of the Gezo telling them to. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Kill anyone with unique traits, preserve their heads. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then ship it to them. - Wed Sep 23 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I had no knowledge of this.... - Wed Sep 23 21:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The people that they send here, their privates... - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: They are going down in anyway possible. - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: My question is. - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: What would you do if they asked you to do the same? - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: To Kumogakure? - Wed Sep 23 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well...I'd have to deny them..and risk the other villages. - Wed Sep 23 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I will support you in anyway I can then, Niza. - Wed Sep 23 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Because you will hav a -tough- problem on your hands. - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Naturally, I've formed a group of like-minded people. - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Though not all the pieces are in play. - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But.. I'm in the works of pulling my resources together... - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Getting a private to come to an isolated location. - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then kill them... - Wed Sep 23 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But not before taking any information they have in order to find out.. - Wed Sep 23 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Just what the Gezo is. - Wed Sep 23 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why they exist. - Wed Sep 23 21:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Can you describe his strength, and ability? - Wed Sep 23 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: From what I've seen so far, they all specialize in some form of Kenjutsu... - Wed Sep 23 22:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: . . . Kenjutsu.... - Wed Sep 23 22:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And when things actually prove difficult for them they...access techniques similar to ninjutsu. - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That's odd.. Do they use any form of Ninjutsu at all?- - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Except without handseals. - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: What? - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: How is that possible? - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've no idea. - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: To what extent? - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This could prove difficult. - Wed Sep 23 22:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: He shot off shards from his skin as well as made various blades with it. - Wed Sep 23 22:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 23 22:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It seems almost as if that'd be useless as well. - Wed Sep 23 22:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Is it because they -know- to avoid it? - Wed Sep 23 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Or is their mind so refined against it, it's effortless...? - Wed Sep 23 22:10:08 2015

Stopping a bit away from the female, he kept his visage locked upon her now. "Hello. You may finish your statement."* - Wed Sep 23 23:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Niza-Sama.. - Thu Sep 24 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If I may. I will accept any punishment you have for her. - Thu Sep 24 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: No. - Thu Sep 24 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am the reason she left. - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well, no. - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: She shares a relationship with my brother, and without her, he will die. - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...... - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Deliver justice...or allow another to walk away from me scot-free... - Thu Sep 24 00:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You did the same to Misa? - Thu Sep 24 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What the fuck is wrong with you? - Thu Sep 24 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Who am I to say no when she wanted it~ - Thu Sep 24 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: You really are fucked up. - Thu Sep 24 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So it was by her choice that you decided to do such a thing? - Thu Sep 24 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Was it really her choice, or did you perhaps curve her to that direction? - Thu Sep 24 00:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm? - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you even know what we are talking about? - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hideki why don't you show him? - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I already know. - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Anything I do can be seen as a sign of agression. - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Already have, I'm not really proud of it either. Considering I was forced. - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You can grow scales. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Misa seemed rather interested in that transformation of yours. So I myself am interested in it somewhat. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...You never should've said that. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, I'm more interested in the thought processes behind it. - Thu Sep 24 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: In two easy steps you can learn experience it first hand~ - Thu Sep 24 00:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You see, I rather understand people because then we can find a common ground. From that common ground, people can advance as a whole to improve this world. - Thu Sep 24 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I rather you not have me digest whatever liquid it was that you gave to Hideki. - Thu Sep 24 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply shuts his own eyes, upraising a single fist as he allows it to connect with the desk. Quite easily, the wood snapped against his bare fist and he easily broke through such, leaving a crack running from top to bottom now, effectively rendering the space useless. He was still incapable of protecting those important to him, even in this position. 

He wasn't just the Raikage, but he was a Knight of the Round Table, a person notable across the land. Within moments he turned to face Hanabi as he proceeded to wave a hand, signaling for the shinobi to force their cuffs upon her. "I understand killing you would be wrong, especially when it would harm those I care about. Yet, holding you within a prison will alow me to ensure you don't trail off elsewhere and pass. Therefore, you are placed under arrest by Kumogakure law for posing a threat to both allies, and Kumogakure shinobi alike. More importantly, family."* - Thu Sep 24 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hold on, Niza. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If she did give Misa the same thing she gave me, Misa will need the same dosage. Or else she will perish. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Can't Marianna do something about it? - Thu Sep 24 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've thought of such. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No, she wouldn't be able to Kuro. - Thu Sep 24 00:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Past tense. - Thu Sep 24 00:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What's done is done Kuro. It doesn't matter by this point. - Thu Sep 24 01:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I understand that, but she should be more mindful of her actions towards others. We can't force things upon people. - Thu Sep 24 01:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right. - Thu Sep 24 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Tell her I wont be able to speak to her for a while. - Thu Sep 24 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Niza. - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why am I being arrested again? - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Because I attacked you? - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For betrayal, necessary investigation, and endangering the lives of others. - Thu Sep 24 01:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ---- - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd hate to interrupt this.. But do you have any missons available, Niza? - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm? - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ushinawa attacked you. - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What do you need to investigate? - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) tossed Hideki a missions scroll. "Yes."* - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ushinawa. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Challenged me. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And I had accepted. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well here I am. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Thu Sep 24 01:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make a step forward, noticing Misa within the doorway. He hadn't wished for her to harm herself in her current state, understanding of it at the moment. His chakra applied to his legs and carried him throughout the room and planted himself near the girl, extending his arms as a means to keep her standing on her toes, purposely trying to cushion her head with the soft rags of his cloak.

"Are you alright?" was all that he said in response.* - Thu Sep 24 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: What's wrong with.. Misa? - Thu Sep 24 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he observed her form. Within a moment, he found himself attempting to lift her, unless she happened to resist. His only intentions were bringing her to find one of the seats by the desk, even if a portion of such was now broke. Once he assisted her in settling down, he proceeded to take a stand where he could assist Misa should she need it and observe Hanabi at the same time.* - Thu Sep 24 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Take her to a bed, I'll take care of her. - Thu Sep 24 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ... - Thu Sep 24 01:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: [This dumb nigga...] - Thu Sep 24 01:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: [Now Mariana going to kill me Q__Q] - Thu Sep 24 01:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) heeded Mariana's words as he nodded, allowing himself to carry Misa off to a bed of sorts, leaving his guards to care for Hanabi. It was unknown to Niza why he had cared so much for this girl, considering this was the first time he'd ever met her. Regardless, he proceeded to make haste. "Everything will be fine. You're going to get some help."* - Thu Sep 24 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Take her to the bed. - Thu Sep 24 01:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply observed the process as Mariana began to treat Misa. Not being a medic himself meant he didn't really understand what was going on at the moment, but he trusted Mariana's abilities as a medic. Regardless, as Niza watched, he remained silent until it seemed like she was done. "So what's wrong exactly?"* - Thu Sep 24 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Well.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I think she is having a fever.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Her tempature isn't that good.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: But a few bed rests, some medicine and she'll be fine. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: The slugs are helping her out too. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She's my student, trust me.. I won't let nothing happen to her. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Thu Sep 24 02:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She'll be fine. - Thu Sep 24 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmmmmmm, I see you are so worried about her, mmm, Raikage? - Thu Sep 24 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I... - Thu Sep 24 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Just don't like to see people in harm... - Thu Sep 24 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She should be resting for a bit. - Thu Sep 24 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...Right... - Thu Sep 24 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose I should get my own rest as well. - Thu Sep 24 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 24 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I'll be here. - Thu Sep 24 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded before proceeding to make his exit, heading off to get himself some rest.* - Thu Sep 24 02:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Not really a people person as you can see. - Thu Sep 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply came to deliver word to the guards. "She's free to walk around. With an escort of course."

After stating such, he then turned his attention to Seisuke. "It's nice to see you've come."* - Thu Sep 24 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see, Do you mind my company?---Ah Hello there. - Thu Sep 24 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make his exit now, ignoring Hanabi as he did so.* - Thu Sep 24 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well that was rude. - Thu Sep 24 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) entered the temple area now, presenting himself to those within. His eyes caught sight of Mamoru and even Kuro along with Yukio. However, he chose to remain silent as he figured that Kuro was beginning his lessons with Yukio, effectively joining Niz and Mamoru as his students.* - Fri Sep 25 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) picked up on his training now, allowing hismelf to focus on the actual art of ninjutsu. His hands easily formed the handseals that so many others had performed before as he allowed himself to simply focus on the situation at hand. His hands easily came together and the chakra within his gut began to swell up into a thick, large mass before eventually pushing out towards his own hands.

The chakra within had quite easily become fuuton, pushing from the epicenter and out from the palms with ease. His eyes simply watched the burst of wind move from between his two palms and conjoin with the wind ahead of himself.* - Fri Sep 25 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) lifted his arms, bringing them near to his body as he allowed his hands to clasp together. Soon, his fingers were easily making several different collective shapes and forms, accessing the art known as handseals. His eyes remainged focused on the task at hand, proceeding to deliver the short combination.

All while he was doing so, his chakra had began to formulate in a single place. Soon, enough for the technique had shifted into his gut. The chakra storing itself there had easily become a thick mass before Niza began to focus, letting it thin out. In the same instance however, his chakra proceeded to shoot upwards and reach for his hands.

Upon reaching his finger tips, they were pointed outwards, expelling a force of wind to overtake the area in front of himself, his palm easily extending to create the Air Palm technique and leave him standing where he was. His arms fell back to his side and he prepared to begin on the next technique.* - Fri Sep 25 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) picked up on another process. His hands clasped together once more to imitate his last usage of the technique. Quite literally, he was attempting to produce a hand movement fast enough that none could particularly see it until he'd finished. His chakra within had began to well up just as it had before. In a matter of seconds, it pushed forward and proceeded to lift off the finger tips, his palm turning in time to cascade the force already released and deal out the primary power, expelling an even greater usage of the wind. Afterwards, he proceeded to let himself repeat this attempt at least three times.* - Fri Sep 25 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) conceded to the art of ninjutsu once more, focusing upon the Fuuton Element even though his prowess should've remained in the Katon Element prior to this event. He simply figured that the peaceful element was something better to practice as he new his techniques so far were meant specifically for self-defence in his opinion rather than offensive means.

Regardless, his hands had now proceeded to extend themselves into a series of handseals while he looked forward. Soon after he'd completed them, he allowed his hands to push forward and let wind roll off of his finger tips, showing the initial start to his own usage of the technique before his hands flipped, palms showing which soon expelled a large force of wind in a forward motion. His hands then dropped back to his side, pondering on how to improve this technique.* - Fri Sep 25 20:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You've been talking about his weaknesses . . . It sounds like you think of him as a threat. - Fri Sep 25 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I do. - Fri Sep 25 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Understandable. - Fri Sep 25 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For now, Tetsujin is an ally. - Fri Sep 25 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 25 20:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: When we set up squads and your village has things that needs to be done, You should try and contact us regarding those things and we might send our shinobi out to help with them and improve relations further. - Fri Sep 25 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Similiar to how Kirigakure had once sent shinobi to rebuild a hospital in Kumogakure. - Fri Sep 25 20:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Hideki's change in tone and his actions. His body and mind simply reacted with the intent for peace as he stepped forward, motioning to take place between the two, being Himura and Hideki. His eyes closed for a short moment. When they had opened, he simply placed his visage upon Hideki.

"Remain calm Hideki. There is no need for violence." Within, Niza's special chakra seemed to give off a burning sensation as it proved he was becoming even more in tune with it, even out of his usual meditative state.* - Fri Sep 25 21:02:56 2015
