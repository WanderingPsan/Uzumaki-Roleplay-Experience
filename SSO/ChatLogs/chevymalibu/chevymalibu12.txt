<br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then he fucked your shit up. - Thu Oct  1 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But you didn't. - Thu Oct  1 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Think of this as a lesson. You faced death's door but didn't walk through.  Now what would happen if you desided to follow the path of hatred? - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm a ninjutsu that turns your body steel. - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) layed his eyes upon Hideki, looking him over for a moment. The wounds he had recieved being all too obvious to Niza as he'd seen a similar result before, considering Niza was on the recieving end of them. A simple nod as he listened to Kuro's words. He now knew what he was to do. He had a goal set in mind, simply because of one saying.

Family First.

Following his motion, he eventually released a few spoken words. "Yes. Our training shall continue."* - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Train your mind. - Thu Oct  1 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: And you never did thank me. - Thu Oct  1 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right, I apologize. - Thu Oct  1 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Thank you uh.. - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What's his name? - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Reguel, I'm studying to be a Medic. - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ---- - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm in a wheel chair <@Niza> - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right, thank you Reguel. - Thu Oct  1 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hideki...I am sorry that I let this happen... - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It happened in an instant. - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No one saw it coming. - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Are...Are you in pain? - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: .... - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'd figure he'd still be in pain with such severe injuries. - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Is there an estimated recovery time yet? - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Doctors told me one month. - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: And if I helped? - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Don't know. - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Maybe ess. - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Less* - Thu Oct  1 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) turned his head to look at Reguel, seeing that he was giving him a statement. One that seemed to be more of a command in his mind.

"Raikage."* - Thu Oct  1 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Right. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Niza. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We need more medics around here. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes? - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mamoru and Mariana also got injured. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How did she get injured? - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She punched him.. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And he turned to a thousand pieces - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: and turned into steel senbon.. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And impaled them. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'll be talking to Tetsujin when I get the chance. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Although... - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: She should have listened to my warnings before... - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess that's why I haven't seen her.  I wonder if she's able to treat her self, even a little. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I got the worst part... - Thu Oct  1 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Broken femurs, a broken ribcage.. - Thu Oct  1 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...... - Thu Oct  1 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: so - Thu Oct  1 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: omit - Thu Oct  1 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Right...Raikage, are there any leftover medical scrolls you can lean me? I need to self study. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've no idea. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I leave that knowledge to the other medics. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ...Right. - Thu Oct  1 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It is. - Thu Oct  1 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm also being trained by Yukio. The two have taught me a lot, and helped me see things in a wider perspective. - Thu Oct  1 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well lucky you. - Thu Oct  1 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm training to be a monk. - Thu Oct  1 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: With Yukio we do meditations, and with Niza, we practice self defense. - Thu Oct  1 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct  1 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Self defense. - Thu Oct  1 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Thu Oct  1 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Shall we begin, Kuro? - Thu Oct  1 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Sure. - Thu Oct  1 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Of course. - Thu Oct  1 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Shall we be off? - Thu Oct  1 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are we going to practice Kenpo? - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall show you the first two techniques. - Thu Oct  1 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm ready when you are. - Thu Oct  1 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply raises a single hand, this being his right as he looks to Kuro. As he looked onwards, he simply stated. "Watch closely. This is very simple."

Once stating such, he allowed himself to move his right hand, palm facing outwards. With a single swiping motion, his hand now rested on the opposing side of his own body. His expression remaining stale and simple as he kept his eyes upon Kuro. "This technique is the Misdirect, a counter to many direction physical attacks. Apply this to the strike, and your opponent is left open for a free strike."* - Thu Oct  1 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he saw Kuro perform the technique, seeing that he did just fine with this technique. "Good. Now for the following technique, the Backhand Choke."

Setting himself in a sort of stance, Niza, still holding his hand in the end result of the Misdirect. Rather than lowering it, he turned it over, expressing the backside of it as he brought it back across the body, envisioning the throat of a singular figure. As his hand reached that point, he thrusted it forth, placing the knuckles within the ridges of the Adam's Apple. "This technique stuns the opponent, leaving them open for another following strike."* - Thu Oct  1 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded as he had observed, a presence taking place to his own left. However, disregarding such for the moment he simply continued to speak with Kuro. "Indeed. These two techniques are very important for the ones to come, as they are both the openings to them. For now, I want you to make use of these techniques and master them."* - Thu Oct  1 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Thu Oct  1 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: In our next session, I will test you to see your prowess with these two techniques. - Thu Oct  1 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, maybe I should've been a monk. - Thu Oct  1 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Very well. - Thu Oct  1 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Watching you two is interesting. - Thu Oct  1 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Is it really? - Thu Oct  1 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: No. - Thu Oct  1 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then what do you find interesting? - Thu Oct  1 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Just learnin' about self defense, I gotta have some taijutsu knowledge as a medic. - Thu Oct  1 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Of course, Kuro gets more training. - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  1 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps you should speak with the Raikage about teaching you the basics? - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I should. - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sorry I can't heal ya. - Thu Oct  1 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm Reguel. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Long as I don't strain myself too much and only use my arm muscles I should be okay. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you as well.  I see that you and Mamoru are rather close. - Thu Oct  1 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhuh, we're partners. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I wonder if I can scare someone someday by talking in katana form. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I require all currently available shinobi capable of combat to be on guard at all times. - Thu Oct  1 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Those that are injured, I would like to get to a safe location. - Thu Oct  1 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Kumogakure will now be preparing itself for defense. - Thu Oct  1 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Right. - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Which is why I want to study taijutsu. - Thu Oct  1 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'd indulge in teaching such, but right now there is little time. - Thu Oct  1 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then I'll focus on working on Medical ninjutsu for the time being. - Thu Oct  1 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) casually raised his head, laying eyes upon Kirie. His expression falling into one of both curiosity and displeasure. The presence of Kirigakure not really pleasing with the past events as well as the recent knowledge he'd just obtained. Within a moment, Niza was actively making a motion forward, placing himself ahead of the crowd that remained behind him---at least now.

"State your business for being here."* - Thu Oct  1 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: Questionable. - Thu Oct  1 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) shifted his head, looking off-center for a bit as his eyes peered at the ground before him. His mind lingered on her words for a moment, only recalling the results of the last pleasure trip being taken by a Kirigakure-shinobi, that being Himura. Once Niza had came to a conclusion on what to say, he simply gave a short response.

"I do mind. The presence of Kirigakure here makes it uneasy, not only for me, but for my villagers as well. For your safety and the safety of both our villages, it is best you leave."* - Thu Oct  1 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Raikage. - Thu Oct  1 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If you need me send a Messger Bird. - Thu Oct  1 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I need to soliude myself in the hospital to study, mind giving me directions? - Thu Oct  1 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You passed it on your way out of the mansion. - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: First door to the left. - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Alright thanks. - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You're welcome. - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll also need some tools to make my senbon launcher automatic. - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'll see what I can do. - Thu Oct  1 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Alright thanks. - Thu Oct  1 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) allows himself to access his own chakra store, allowing himself to focus on shutting down the chakra pathways with the application of a single handseal. Niza was now standing there with a dormant chakra pathway. Soon, he allowed the chakra within him to burst back to life, flowing once again.* - Thu Oct  1 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to focus on the chakra pathway, allowing himself to deactivate it once more with the application of his own handseal. Soon, it was asleep and eventually he found himself reactivating it with the release of his own hands.* - Thu Oct  1 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to focus on the usage of the Kai technique, allowing himself to cease the usage of his own chakra pathway. As his chakra came to a stop, he took a single breath. After doing such, the chakra pathway began once more.* - Thu Oct  1 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access the Kai technique, progressively shutting his own chakra pathway on and off as he performed the single handseal. His eyes remaining closed and his breathing light. Niza was intent on mastering the usage of this technique, aiming to work enough for his usage to require no handseals whatsoever.* - Thu Oct  1 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access the Kai technique, allowing his efforts to manipulate his chakra take over with ease. Niza was finding himself to have no problem whatsoever with progressing through the techniques necessary steps. With each usage, he would reactivate his chakra to begin the process again, reversing the pathways with each use.* - Thu Oct  1 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to mainain the technique, his chakra easily coming to an end with the usage of Niza's handseal. His eyes still trained forward as he tested his mind's ability to relay its knowledge. Once he'd released the handseal, his chakra sparked, coming back into play as it took place within his body now, flowing in the opposing direction.* - Thu Oct  1 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to apply the Kai technique, finding it to become rather easy the more he practiced it. His need for holding the handseal lessening as he went. Each attempt of his making his chakra stop and rebirth in the opposing direction. * - Thu Oct  1 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) the application of his handseal combined with his chakra pathways, still continued to lead his chakra on the route of canceling itself out. With the release of a handseal, his chakra found itself moving through once again in an opposing route.* - Thu Oct  1 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) accessed the Kai technique once again now that he was alone, allowing himself to focus his chakra throughout his form. A simple handseal and it had expelled itself, ending the work of his pathways for a moment. Within a few seconds however, his chakra burst back in, moving through the pathways at full power in the opposing direction.* - Thu Oct  1 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) still followed along with the technique, accessing the handseals as he went on. Niza was progressively getting better with the technique now as he seemed to be shutting down the chakra pathway with even less time now.* - Thu Oct  1 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to train in the art of the Kai technique, easily shutting down the chakra pathway and restarting the process as he went.* - Thu Oct  1 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access the same technique, allowing himself to focus his handseal application to his chakra pathways.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained on the same action, still applying his knowledge to the Kai technique as he worked to improve his own experience with the technique, effectively stopping his chakra pathway and restarting it. * - Thu Oct  1 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access the same technique, actively utilizing the Kai jutsu. His experience with the technique being rather high. Hwoever, he still continued to remove the use of his chakra and reinstate it at a different rate and direction.* - Fri Oct  2 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access the Kai technique, allowing himself to perform the one handseal, focusing upon his chakra pathways for a moment before feeling it come to a standstill. Soon afterwards, Niza was sparking up the pathway once more, letting it flow in the opposing direction again.* - Fri Oct  2 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) repeated the Kai technique.* - Fri Oct  2 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) allowed himself to utilize his strength to retrieve the Shibuki blade. With a few akward motions, Niza now held the weapon in front of himself, two hands linked to the hilt of the large weapon of destruction. He now stood there, attempting to weild the blade in front of himself, yet appearing a bit off in his stance, even with his strength.

Niza shifted around his body weight, allowing himself to attempt a more focused stance. The intent of alleviating the weight upon himself as he weilded the blade. All the while, Niza was making sure to keep the explosive edge pointed outwards, away from his own body. 

A step forward and Niza was throwing the blade's weight forward, creating a single, lateral slashing motion within the air ahead of himself. For a moment, finding his weight to follow afterwards. A single step taking place from himself with some resistance to keep himself standing within the region. A grunt as he realized his mistake, fixating his mind on removing that possibility once again

Continuing to work with the blade, Niza finds himself still holding some sense of trouble. For the moment, his focus remained on actually being able to strike with the blade effectively and move unweighted with it. Continuing to keep the blade within his hands, he made another attempt at swinging the weapon, keeping his weight from bolstering forth alongside it in this attempt, yet, cutting into a spin with the weapon. Another grunt for his mistake.

Niza's analyzation seemed to be that he was applying too much force into his attacks, as well as letting himself be carried by the weapon rather than having the weapon be carried by him. A moment of pause and he brought the blade inwards to himself, raising it upwards to meet with the shoulderblade. He was now effectively resting the Shibuki as he gave himself a moment of rest.

After a few minutes, Niza was active once again, making one large downward swing with the blade. His muscles flexing as he went into the action. A lean in followed afterwards, a single leg bracing itself as the other went upwards in an angle for himself. With the end of the blade meeting the ground, Niza found himself coming back to a relaxed state, hefting the weapon up once again now.* - Fri Oct  2 10:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed Heiwa for a moment, only wondering how much it had happened to affect the child. Then his eyes shifted to Hideki and Niza's expression remained stale. It wasn't until his head drooped that his true feelings were revealed, an expression of sadness drawing out across his face before he proceeded to place the Raikage hat upon his head. 

Turning his form, Niza made his way towards the door only pausing to look back over his shoulder and deliver a few words. "I'll be away for a while. Only contact me in dire need." Slowly lumbering away, his shoulders seemed to be weighted and his legs sluggish. 

It was obvious, the Raikage was hurt by this information, no longer caring for anything past this fact.* - Sat Oct  3 00:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) nodded before exitting.* - Sat Oct  3 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) allowed himself to simply enter a state of meditation now, holding heavy thoughts upon his mind with the loss of not only Ushinawa, but Mariana as well. As Niza allowed himself to settle within the dirt, he simply found himself seething on thoughts of pure rage, shifting his hands around within the soil for a moment of expression as he awaited the heavy breathing of himself to subside.

Once such had been done, the Raikage proceeded onwards with his meditation, now slowing his breathing as he came to bring his hands to his lap. While in this position, the thoughts of anger had begun to wash away, Niza attempting to dive into a state where he was in control, where his rage as non-existant and he could overpower the fumes that seemed to want to take over in this moment.

As he continued onwards, his chakra had began to seep into the earth beneath himself, easily spreading outwards as his peace of mind was beginning to encase the immediate area around himself. As Niza did such, he continued to think only thoughts of positivity, recalling upon the good times he'd had with his family and friends. The ambition that he had for Kumogakure that had once been seemingly disappearing, was slowly reforming, bringing a new light to Niza's scenario as he watched over the area around himself.

Each change in memory resulted in the act of Niza taking in a breath of air, his chest raising in the same instance before allowing himself to exhale and release it. His demeanor had now become calm, and nothing could potentially ruin this for him as he attempted to find his place of solace, his Nirvana, his one true happy place, still finding his path to such a thing to be one of the murkiest things he could possibly come across.

Regardless, Niza continued to remain in this state, unmoving, and rather calm appearing, feeling no need to break into any rash actions of violence or defend himself from an amazing threat. No matter at how he seemed to look at the situation, he was peaceful on the outside, but practically one of the worst things on the inside. Still continuing to release his chakra in calming waves as he stayed his place.* - Sat Oct  3 04:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) kept eyes upon Reign the moment he had entered the building, figuring that his weapon was was going to be particularly devastating in the event of an attack. However, the introduction of it hadn't worried Niza, his legs tensing up only for a moment before proceeding to make a motion in response to the drawing itself. Upwards Niza had went, making a bounding motion in a forward instance to not only bring his body over this singular opponent but deliver himself to a much safer region, one capable of granting him the ability to utilize ninjutsu.

Upon landing, should it come safely, he'd simply turn and look back at his temporary opponent, beginning to focus on the chakra within his form and prepare a set of handseals.* - Sat Oct  3 05:32:48 2015

Niza's hands had by now, completed the handseals necessary for the jutsu, having only held them to hear the villainous figure's voice. Within the next moment, his chakra was being applied and his palms thrust outwards, soon clapped together as he intented to thrust out his Fuuton chakra and let it form a stronge gale to possibly, knock Reign over or remove his footing, and even create an opening for his own allies. * - Sat Oct  3 05:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nods, looking at the house ahead of himself. A simple nod, and Niza was now stepping forward through the doorway, peering around to see what he could possibly have setup for him.* - Sat Oct  3 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply observed for the moment, having some trouble making out most of what was in the room, other than the beds of course. His eyes gradually looking between the two, spotting the silhouettes that seemed to begin joining him in the room. For the moment, Niza had no idea what this could possibly be, considering he'd yet to see anything more. He figured, if this is what Heiwa had set up, then it must have been a clone technique of sorts. Rather than moving, he simply spoke to the child, "Is this what you meant to show Hideki?"* - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nodded now as he recognized the movements of the silhouettes. As he observed, he took note of the drawback they produced, giving Niza insight to the arc and recognizing that he was now in the line of fire.  As his eyes noticed the shape both had taken, he had confirmed that this technique was some form of clone and simply allowed his body to reposition itself, taking a moment to create a set of handseals, setting a jutsu in place for later before crossing from one side to the other, leaving himself against the back wall as he expected this position to become the target.* - Sat Oct  3 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) took note of the silhouettes failures to change their mark towards his new position. As a response, he simply watched the shift in either clones position. As one neared Niza's position however, his visage seemed to gain more insight to what it was exactly, and with a simple smirk, he recognized exactly what the technique was, figuring that he couldput a stop to it at this moment.

Yet, Niza hadn't wanted to send Heiwa's good work away and make it all for nothing, and simply continued to submit to the technique, allowing himself to access the technique he'd set prior, moving back to his original post with the use of the Kawarimi Technique, a log being left in his place, for either of the silhouettes to strike.* - Sun Oct  4 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to think to himself about Heiwa's ability and usage of the technique, finding it rather impressive. However, Niza's usage of the kawarimi technique lefth im wth his back against the clones. His only response within this moment was to simply turn, facing the approaching clone now. The only thing he could possibly see was the movement of a child's fist coming for him, and in response he simply stood still, prepared to handle whatever came for him, considering his own durability, even thought he knew Genjutsu was a mind battle.* - Sun Oct  4 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observed the clone that seemed to strike him for a moment, taking note of the differences between reality and the genjutsu. He could recognize a genjutsu with ease but the effects of one had to be tested for his confirmation. However, his suspicions had been confirmed.  Taking a moment to settle down he allowed himself to raise his head once again, letting his body remain stagnant as he began to place a simple focus on his chakra, the pathways of himself beginning to slow down and come to a stop.

In the same instance however, Niza's head shifted position, just enough so that the kunai couldn't hit dead on target but rather, graze just above the ear, figuring he could handle such an injruy if these clones were capable of producing real kunai. Upon connection however, the chakra pathway would begin again, acting in reverse as Niza had begun to let his own chakra counteract the genjutsu.* - Sun Oct  4 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) turned now, facing the doorway as he looked for Heiwa. A simple nod and a smirk came forth before he began to speak. "Very good Heiwa, I'm impressed."* - Sun Oct  4 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I did indeed. - Sun Oct  4 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found himself entering a state of meditation now. His body sitting amongst the ground as his Monk chakra seemed to ensue throughout his form. As Niza remained there, his mind focused on relaxing and peaceful thoughts, carrying these throughout the area now as he seemed to keep a generally calm head on his shoulders.* - Sun Oct  4 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access his state of meditation, simply allowing himself to focus on the positivity within the region behind him. As he seemed to remain in this state he found himself releasing a wave of chakra across the earth efore him, invisible to those without some sort of sensory ability.* - Sun Oct  4 04:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply took notice of things beginning to grow out of hand, his eyes recognizing a lycanthropic transformation take place. The combat taking place in the area rather growing annoying to Niza as he simply wanted a state of peace. Niza had simply began to focus, his eyes closing for only a moment before finally opening. A simple breath passed from his form and out into the open as he proceeded to look over those around him.

As he released this breath, his chakra began to spread amongst those within Kumogakure, generally carrying itself over the many that had remained there and proceeding to put an end to their combative actions, actually leaving them in a stunned state for the moment. After letting his chakra wash over his people, he simply stepped forward, beginning to speak outwards.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) gradually stepped forward now, turning only to look amongst the crowd. As he looked over them, his face grimaced as he simply stated. "Silence." The pressure of his jutsu still seeming to enact as an aura around himself now, soon beginning to settle. 

Niza had now begun to pace back and forth, his eyes still looking amongst the crowd.

"You want something to do? You want to get physical? Then give me some pushups instead of attacking each other over some -nonsense-. Do a mission. Train your techniques. Anything but act like such children. You are allies, shinobi of Kumogakure. Do not falter and come off as someone to disrespect. Stand tall and be the man or woman expected of you, otherwise your opponent will slay you where you stand."* - Sun Oct  4 05:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to sit in a meditative position, allowing himself to begin focusing upon the chakra within his body as he relaxed. A state of peace seemed to instill itself across the area, Niza remaining as the simple focus point while he allowed himself to begin pushing the chakra outwards from his body. Keeping in such a well-balanced state, wave after wave released from Niza's inner-being without problem.* - Sun Oct  4 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained settled within the soil, his body still producing massive waves of chakra to flow throughout the area. Niza was easily overpowering the lesser power with his peaceful aura, should they come near that is. However, as Niza remained, he gradually grew even more like a statue, his breathing beginning to slow now as he entered a meditative state that worked entirely in his favor.* - Sun Oct  4 13:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to access his shockwave technique throughout his meditation. Niza's state being rather serene now considering how calm he'd forced the area to be. His legs remained still and his upper body even more still. The need to move was easily being removed and replaced with his search for serenity in this state, his mind crossing a veil to search for his most pure thought.* - Sun Oct  4 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained still within his meditative position, finding it rather soothing with how things were in the area around himself. As he remained relaxed and settled, his chakra still motioned over the land in a simple wave, carrying over the general area. As Niza seemed to remain completely still, negating all negative emotion from himself.* - Sun Oct  4 15:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Oct  4 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Can we go outside then? - Sun Oct  4 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Oct  4 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) simply remained still, watching over Heiwa as he did so. Niza's eyes simply tracked the movement of the boys hands as he stood there, recognizing that he was to perform a jutsu of sorts. As Niza stood there, he found his eyes coming to focus on Heiwa's raised hands, his mind focusing in on them or rather, just above them to see what he could possibly be doing, yet, should nothing be produced he'd either have to assume that the jutsu was done wrong or it wasn't ninjutsu as he expected.* - Sun Oct  4 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) shifted his visage upwards once again now, focusing in on the massive ball of flames approaching his position. Afterwards, his hands seemed to look back towards Heiwa, focusing in upon him as he smirked.

'Another genjutsu.'

The ability that Heiwa had shown to Niza so far had indeed impressed him, considering there weren't many genjutsu practicioners out amongst the shinobi world. Niza had of course felt the heat, continuing to remain under the effects of the genjutsu for a moment. However, after a bit, sweat began to form upon his head and he allowed himself to initiate the same Kai technique as shown before. His body's chakra flow seemed to slow and eventually cease altogether. Soon, he found his chakra beginning to return at an even faster rate, becoming an overpowering force for a mere moment as he negated the genjutsu. Keeping the same smirk, he observed Heiwa.

"Very good, Heiwa. You never cease to amaze me."* - Sun Oct  4 17:52:12 2015
