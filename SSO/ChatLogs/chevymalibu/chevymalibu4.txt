<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The army will be able to retreat before Zetsumo shows up, that much is certain if we place the attack at the furthest point from him. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) picked up on his training once more now that he was no longer hindered by the title of Raikage. In his small area of solitude within Kirigakure, he allowed himself to raise a single leg, his knee coming upwards with force in order to connect with his elbow, producing an equal amount as they connected. The technique being done with ease now.* - Fri Sep 18 19:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) brought his leg back to the ground, a breathe escaping from within as he raised his eyes once again, letting them focus forward. Afterwards, he allowed himself to proceed onwards with the technique. He allowed himself to bring his leg back upwards and his elbow downwards, the knee connecting with an equal force for both sides being produced.

"I shall not be betrayed..never again..."* - Fri Sep 18 19:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) approached the Hogo Isle, figuring it was best for him to pay his respect to Tethys. Niza was unsure of any place where he could do otherwise. Yet, in that moment, he made way across the bridge, connecting the two seperate lands. A face of tears without the liquid drawing from his eyes set upon Niza's face. He remained silent, moving forward without any words being spoken. He simply began to mouth a prayer as his monk ways had taught him to do so.

However, upon closer inspection and forward movement he spied a seal, his eyes rolling over a nearby scroll.* - Fri Sep 18 21:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) nods, "Thank you. I appreciate it."* - Fri Sep 18 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Any time. - Fri Sep 18 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) allowed himself to open the scroll, reading through such carefully as he found that it was the Will of Tethys. He had indeed, left behind enough for the current village to prepare them for the future. IF anything, he had hoped this would provide ambition and restore hope to the villagers and shinobi. With that on the mind, he made his way to the center, preparing to share this newfound knowledge amongst them.* - Fri Sep 18 22:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) was required to pick up the slack now that Tethys was gone. Not only was he now the last to follow the Ride or Die anthem, but he was the only person he could trust now. With that in mind he began to work on his own techniques, choosing to open his thumb to let some blood come forth before proceeding to summon forth two rabbits. He proceeded to whistle, changing the pitch of it to give the scouting signal to them. In no time at all, they proceeded to move on and make way outside of Kirigakure's walls and search for anything of note.

After doing such, Niza proceeded to allow himself to begin focusing chakra into his legs, figuring it would be best to gain mastery on his own technique. He proceeded to lift off, not going upwards but moving in a forward direction. His body now being carried across the water with ease.* - Sat Sep 19 10:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to work with his leaping technique, continuing to launch himself across the waters, motioning back and forth with his chakra working as a self-propulsion system. His legs lifted off the ground as it appeared like he was dashing forth, a simple arc taking place with each movement. His eyes focused on the landing point, rather than the air around him however.* - Sat Sep 19 11:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) remained in motion, never stopping as he continued to leap across, from bank to bank. His powerful legs carrying him a great distance as he moved forward. His chakra still working throughout his legs to enhance the distance, carrying him over the waters with ease.* - Sat Sep 19 11:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) continued to let himself motion  back and forth across the waters, his ears openning up as he heard the return of his rabbits. COming down upon the bank nearest to them, he allowed himself to pause his actions and squat down enough to deliver a carrot to the two, finding their recon to be very resourceful, even if there wasn't much information to return. Soon afterwards, he proceeded to pickup the slack and move at an even faster speed across the river. He would soon, live up to his current title.* - Sat Sep 19 12:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Will do. - Sat Sep 19 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Otherwise, those rookie details in the genjutsu part will mess them up for life. - Sat Sep 19 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see. - Sat Sep 19 17:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: He is leaving again... - Sat Sep 19 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: So much for training. - Sat Sep 19 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I only do as much as I can..If all hope fails, we will need to fight and get the civilians to safety away from the village . - Sat Sep 19 17:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So much for training. - Sat Sep 19 17:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) observes Fujitora as he leaves, remaining silent. He then turns to Kirie, "I'd assist you if I could but I believe our skillsets differ greatly." With than, he turns, facing the exit of the island as he began to make way for the bridge.* - Sat Sep 19 17:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Do you have time? - Sat Sep 19 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Once I distribute these scrolls, I shall. - Sat Sep 19 18:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 19 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Possible. - Sat Sep 19 18:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Sat Sep 19 18:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ah... - Sat Sep 19 18:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If he operates them. - Sat Sep 19 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Manually. - Sat Sep 19 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Or are they meant to be kept secret? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Had he gotten caught in his genjutsu and his focus dispersed, would the masked be rendered useless? - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's the theory Tethys came up with, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: The contents were a variety of Tethys' techniques. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see, Interesting. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: He didn't have an oppertunity to test it did he. - Sat Sep 19 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Niza... were there any about how to wield swords, or sword related information? - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: At least he was able to pass down his Techniques, They will be most useful in the battles to come. - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess not, Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: When I remember seeing him, I don't recall any threads being used to control them. This is somehing different than puppetry, I believe. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Well..we need to test that theory out. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If it works, we'll have one card to play. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Another question.  - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I wish there were Jin, but sadly there are none... - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That would be hard to test though. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads..yo- of course. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Sending a squad to do that would be suicide. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm... - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: I'll have you guys know that I am not human. Don't want any ass whoopings. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: These threads sound seemingly pretty durable. - Sat Sep 19 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: If they were just normal threads then they would be no problem.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: These threads, perhaps are composed of chakra. I know of only one style that could counter those effectively.  - Sat Sep 19 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: But yeah, the masks' bodies seem to be composed of these threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Maybe you could stick them together. - Sat Sep 19 18:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Actually Koeki. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Theres a lot of those mud clones and that syrup water jutsu. That might tangle them. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Lead the way Izanami. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I asked Tethys on that too. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Zetsumo was able to operate them, and still fight himself, from high in the air. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He infromed me the threads were easily cut but blade edge. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: Just cut them threads down. Don't you guys have a chakra cutter yet?! - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Hm. - Sat Sep 19 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But...He stated the threads are wicked fast. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Wicked fast. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Well, we need something even more fast than wickedly fast. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm... - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I believe most here would not outpace his threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Or somone more specifically. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: The armor handed out might be durable enough against the threads. - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: I need to make contact with kenshin.  - Sat Sep 19 18:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yet... - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: You guys need a plan created by an experienced strategist. - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Infact, I've alrady thought of a squad designed to kill Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Zetsumo's nearly destroyed my own. - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Did you? - Sat Sep 19 18:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Next you have Hassan. - Sat Sep 19 18:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hassan can easily take out the lightning mask Zetsumo has. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: Speed, Defense, Strength, and Intellect. All that is needed is combination, which requires teamwork. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Plus, Tethys told me Hassan has Genjutsu. - Sat Sep 19 18:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Next you bring either yourself, Koeki or Setsuna. - Sat Sep 19 18:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I don't want to be rude on Lera's behalf, but theres no way she can be on the same battlefield as Zetsumo without a guard. - Sat Sep 19 18:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why am I a qualification...? - Sat Sep 19 18:18:01 2015
