<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) proceeded to make his way down the mountainside, finding himself at the base now. Looking towards the direction he'd originaly heard the screams come from, he allowed his visage to take place in the direction of the screams, hoping to be capable of stopping the scenario.

Yet, it was too late for the inexperienced Raikage as he found his own armor being destroyed by the Speed Star, and secondly his face being clutched. Niza remained within his grasp, incapable of escaping the brute. Overall, Niza was practically dead, or dying, whichever made more sense.

Regardless his chest was practically void, and he was now being used as the weapon of Kenshin to defeat his own allies. It was then that he realized this was his final moments, pondering on the thought of why such a force had come to doom his village.

And more importantly why Niza was so useless. Just as he always was within any event that dealt with combat, or the defense of another. An attempt to make words came from within Niza, but it didn't matter. A hand prevented such from happening, but he was glad now that he could join his allies, Niklaus and Tethys in the afterlife.* - Fri Oct  9 01:23:37 2015

"Ken-" 

Blood spurts forth from within first however, leaving him silent for a moment before attempting to push past such and deliver speech once more. "We..didn't..kill..Koeki!" With each attempt at speech, a shot of blood exitting his throat inbetween each word really.* - Fri Oct  9 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) rolled himself over, simply laying there with a hole in his chest pretty much. For the most part however, he was still alive, thanks to his armor for cushioning the blow. Yet, as Niza lay there, he simply wished that he'd been the one killed, rather than the thousands of shinobi that had just been lost before his eyes.

Especially when it was due to lies. 

A simple look of grief settled upon Niza's face as he cascaded his vision over to Yukio, to Genesis, to Regado, and whomever else he could see. Soon his face faltered to one of a failure, realizing that it was just in his own nature to fail those he promised to protect. Coughing out another spurt of blood, letting it roll down his chin, he simply stated.

"I'm sorry."* - Fri Oct  9 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) found a healing pill entering his mouth, troublesome at first, considering he was coughing up blood and what not. The act of this was rather overwhelming and caught him off guard, cuasing Niza to go directly into a coughing fit, his throat filling with blood while such seemed to fling across his form. Rather than just giving him a pill, he required much more.

He required an actual procedure to assist him, his throat needing to even be cleared before he could swallow. But regardless, his coughing fit would simply remove the pill from within his mouth, leaving it on his chest, or possibly letting it roll to the soil.

Once his fit had seemed to calm however, Niza made no further movements, remaining where he lay with a pained expression, not even from the physical strain, but pure emotional pain. His eyes however, did apply themselves to Marrisa's form.* - Fri Oct  9 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) cascaded his vision over to Marrisa, only a bit irked as he knew how dire his own situation was, and how he was practically incapable of surviving this. Only due to the fact that his only available medic was in a state of depression, and Misa was off somewhere playing with snakes. 

As Niza layed upon the bed, a simple thought crossed his mind now as he wondered what the afterlife was like. He envisioned it to be a land of peace and tranquility, assuming that both Niklaus and Tethys could enjyo themsleves to the fullest within this land. Yet, as Niza thought about this, a smile drew across his face, finally realizing now that the trio of Ride or Die would be reunited once again. 

He threw away the thoughts of selfishness he held ever since both of his comrades died. He threw away the anger he held when his one impromptu love, Aiko, had died. He let his mind rid itself of the countless moments where he'd grown tired of watching people die before his eyes. Soon, the smile faded and he thought of those that he'd be leaving behind should he pass, but that was inevitable, and he could do nothing to prevent it.

All he could do was allow himself to think of the good now, remembering the bonds he'd gained with the shinobi of Kirigakure, Konohagakure, and Sunagakure alike. Remember thing the times when practically all of the villages stood united, and the times when they stood apart. The basic rivalry from all villages coming to assist each other in one way or another, until a new power player stepped in and practically ruined their interrelations.

The event of one lying to Kenshin made Niza only wonder who could've been acting against the Shinobi World. Who had such a power to sway one of the most feared men into such a rage that he'd kill himself? But such a thing would never be answered, at least not to Niza. However, as he remained still upon the bed, Niza figured he only had a few more points of talking before the overflow of blood and stress being carried over his body ended his life.

Due to this realization, Niza simply let himself turn his smile into a half-frown, half-smile sort of, finding himself to be glad that he could watch so many great shinobi grow before his eyes, but sad that he couldn't progress as they'd done before him. Now, accessing his final breath, he simple delivered his words to Marrisa.

"Kenshin...w-," pausing as blood spurts from his mouth, "was lied to...Yukio...can lead." Afterwards, he'd simply allowed his head to rest against the pillow, finding it extremely straining for himself as he practically choked to death, finally passing on into the afterlife, joining Kenshin on this fateful day. It was definetly good times while it lasted though.* - Fri Oct  9 03:47:50 2015
