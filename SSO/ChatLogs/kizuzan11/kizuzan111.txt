<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Yoshino. - Sat Dec 12 21:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) walked over towards Menma with a loli like walk. On she could be seen nothing at all. She would seem to be un armed. But if she were to have a sight perk, he could see that she really was unarmed.

If she was allowed near Menma, she would simply hold out her hand to offer a shake. "Nice to meet you Yoshino!"* - Sat Dec 12 21:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) tilted her head to the side as he backed away from her. "Its just a simple hand shake though........." she said as tears began to fill her eyes.* - Sat Dec 12 21:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Because. - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: That can be our secret to keep you from betraying me. - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: And at the same token It'd cause problems if I actually saw you like that and you told others. - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: I don't like this type of secert....... - Sat Dec 12 22:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: To ensure we don't betray eachother, We aren't supposed to like it. - Sat Dec 12 22:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: And if we both make it out of this alive, I'll make it up to you somehow. - Sat Dec 12 22:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: You do it first then... - Sat Dec 12 22:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Same time. - Sat Dec 12 22:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: How about we do it for each other? - Sat Dec 12 22:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Go for it then. - Sat Dec 12 22:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Let's go south so no one sneaks up on us, Best to have our backs to the wall watching the only exit. - Sat Dec 12 22:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 22:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) would begin to walk towards that direction.* - Sat Dec 12 22:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: Alright....... - Sat Dec 12 22:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: I'll Start with your pants and you'll start with my shirt? - Sat Dec 12 22:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Sure... - Sat Dec 12 22:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) walked up towards Menma and grabed onto the belt of his pants. As she was holding onto it, she would wait for Menma to grab onto the bottom of her shirt before she would do anything.* - Sat Dec 12 22:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) waited untill Menma reached down and had a firm grasp onto her shirt. As this was happening she would make sure her hands were positioned well so that they were under nether his armpits and the opennings of his shirt. So that once Menma had his hands on her shirt, She'd immediatly send chakra towards her palms and shoot them up to reach up under his shirt. Aiming to place both of her hands onto the sides of Menma's shoulders. If she was successful, The chakra in her hands would then began to flow into Menam's skin and create a weird type of seal on them. The seals would spread throughout his arms, immobilizing his use of his arms completly. She would keep a first grasp onto his shoulder and hold onto them for as long as she could.* - Sat Dec 12 22:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) says: Alright - Sat Dec 12 22:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) notice Menma's hands moving up, so instead of trying to grab onto his shoulders. She instead moved her hands around his back and attempted to grab Menma into a hug. In which would then huge him tightly and press her body against his. While she did this, she would bite onto Menma's torso as hard as she could, as well as begining to place the seal onto his lower back instead.

But she would still take the hit from the chop thta was aimed for her neck. But surely by the time he had done that, Her seal would have been placed along his spine area on his back. Immobilizing him from the waist down, unless he was a clone again and disperses from the bite.* - Sat Dec 12 23:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) is knocked out.* - Sat Dec 12 23:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iwatobi(Kizuzan11) stared at Kami as he began to walk away from the area.* - Sun Dec 13 01:00:32 2015
