<br><br><font color=yellow>*Koh(Lip) steps into the tea shop, his scarf and village headband obscuring the lower half of his face. He had come to see if he'd find a quiet spot to rest but quickly realized that wasn't the case. Figuring he would still be able to sit peacefully, Koh makes his way over to the other side of Jover and finds a seat against the wall. Letting out a muffled sigh, the boy leaned back a bit and closed his eyes without aword.* - Tue Nov  3 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Koh(Lip) slowly made his way toward the field, making sure not to get too close to the shinobi he could see up ahead. He wasn't trying to hide from them, but he didn't want to interrupt what ever they had going on at the time. Finding a spot near the fence line, Koh would plop down on the dirt, a small cloud of dust kicking up from beneath him. He then watched on to see what was going on.* - Tue Nov  3 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You wiped out an entire village? - Wed Nov 11 22:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I just showed up, did some practice people died, i left. - Wed Nov 11 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Koh(Lip) had no idea what was transpiring in the midst of the Kage's mansion, but he would soon find out. After walking several minutes from his home in order to inquire about missions, Koh found himself walking into a smog-filled office. Once he'd realized something funky was going on, the boy tried his best to turn around and leave but his body reacted to the concotion in the air. At first, the boy began choking, gagging in between each cough for a moment or so. After several seconds, Koh began to heave violently, vomitting all over the hard wood floor beneath him. "What the- Hrrrrrnnnnnnngggggghhhhhh" was all he could get out before he released his lunch all over the flooring.* - Wed Nov 11 23:18:11 2015
