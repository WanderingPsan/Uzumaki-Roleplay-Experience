<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way to the academy courtyard. She'd previously checked the waterfall that she could generally find the mizukage sitting beneath. That was not the case this time around; however, and she decided to check the next place on the list which just so happened to be the place where it all started; the academy coutyard. As the girl made her way across the village she was greeted by a small number of children. The same children that she had previously shown off too. They all chanted her name and requested for her to show them some more of her shinobi techniques. 

After several moments of contemplation the girl decided she couldn't lose to much by showing them a thing or to. It also gave her an excuse to practice some of the techniques she had less time to actually practice, or simply forgot about. The girl allowed a smirk to cover her expression while she mentally prepared for what would happen next,

"Watch closely now. It won't be long 'till you'll be able to perform stuff similar to this too. I'm not much out of the academy and i've already learned more than I figured i'd ever be able to. You can do the same as long as you stay true to your intentions and put in the work. Hell, you may even be able to do more if you are one of those people that are prodigetic, or a simple genius. You can do so much with your life so long as you try!"

She ended her small speech and began to focus on the task presented before her. It was always nice to do things before falling back into the usual grind that was her missions. The smirk on her face progressed into a grin. She was enjoying every ounce of the attention being granted to her. She remember when she herself was one of the children watching the shinobi perform their techniques. It was those moments that led her to being what she was now, and where she'd eventually go.

Hell; even at her current level the girl found herself in a similar situation to the kids when she watched higher ranking shinobi fight. The fluidity, speed, accuracy, and overall polish of their movements was simply amazing to her. The amount of practice it took to get that good wasn't something she sold short. She realised that if she was ever going to be that good she'd have to dedicate the vast majoriy of her time to her craft. That she'd never be able to give up, and to surpass others she'd have to work while they rested. She had to put in the grind that nobody else wished to do.

A single hand dipped into her backpouch to draw a shuriken from it. The shuriken was then placed at rest within her hand that was now being cocked back into a throwing position. In a single motion she threw the shuriken, but when it made impact with her target it became clear that she had thrown two. One was hidden in the shadow of the other which created the technique she had used. 

She was given applause by the small crowd that was ever growing by the moment. Some adults even stopped to watch the young Senju's demo of her craft. She loved it; through these actions she was able to showcase her progression to those around her. If there was any immediate gain from her training it was this. She may still be incapable of winning fights, but she at least had enough basics down to show where she intended to go. The lower level techniques she used now could be something of true spectabcle one day. 

Next the girl began to exert chakra into her own body. This in turn caused her metabolic rate be in a way super charged. This granted her a temporary increase in overall movement, and allowed her to almost instantly make her way to her desitination. Which was a couple meters away in front of a tree. To the blind eye a puff of smoke appeared from her body and she teleported to the spot. This gave the illusion that the technique was much greater than it really was to the civilians whom all applauded loudly. The girl's smile contiued to grow.

She hadn't even gotten started yet. Those were two of her more basic techniques. The girl made her way toward the tree after she was able to shake of the disorientation that piggybacked with her application of the previous technique. During her approach the girl jumped into the air and threw her foot forward. BANG! She slammed it staight into the tree with a highly considerable amount of force. The tree flexed and many leaves fell, but she wasn't able to down it. She simply bounced backwards and landed on her feet. The foot that was used to kick the tree hurt quite a bit, but she managed to shake it off.

The girl had given the children a demo of her more physical techniques; now it was time to dig into her chakra based abilities. She began to form handseals while allowing her chakra to manifest and grow within the center of her body. As the girl completed the handseals the chakra that had manifested made it's way up her throat and into her mouth,

"Water Style: Raging Waves!"

Immediately after she chanted the name of the jutsu; the girl expelled a large quantity of water from her mouth. It took the form of a large wave and casacded across the area in which it was used. In the wave's wake a considerable amount of residual water was left behind. This allowed her to increase the effect of the next technique she intended to show off.

She once again began to form handseals which in turn allowed her chakra to manifest and grow. This time; however, instead of suiton based chakra she was using doton based chakra. When it eventually began to brim she allowed it to flow up her throat and into her mouth,

"Doton: Mud SIlhouette!"

The girl chanted, before expelling a large amount of mud from her mouth. The mud mixed with the water that already existed and took the form of a quickly flowing river. If anyone was caught in the technique they'd have a hard time escaping the stream of mud infused water and would more than likely fall victom to the current if they lacked the physical strength to escape such an ability.

Once again the girl began to form a set of handseals. This time she wished to utlize a technique she had learned not too horribly long ago. This technique came from someone she looked up to, and was something she wished to master. It could prove as a very valuable asset of her arsenal and it would perhaps be the decision maker in one of her future battles.

Instead of allowing the chakra to flow up her throat after it manifested as a part of her technique; the girl focused the chakra toward her arm. When she finshed the seals the girl released chakra from her arm which in turn allowed her to manipulate the water to her will. As the chakra was poured in the chakra rose and formed into a sphere like shape with the girl's arm acting as the main magnetic center of the seal. This effectively created a prison out of water that could easily be used to restrain an opponent.

The girl finished her demonstration of the technique before pulling her arm back and allowing the water to fall back into it's original shape. She didn't hesitate in performing the next and final technique she wished to show. She'd go out with a bang for the crowd and leave them left in suspense. She simply waved to the crowd before continuing.

She formed a set of handseals then concentrated on her chakra in order to form a veil around her body. This veil allowed her to cut into the earth with relative ease and fade into the ground. In her wake the earth appeared to be completely undisturbed, which left most of the spectators completely lost as to where she had gone. She traveled a fair ways before resurfacing alone. She was quite fatigued from performing so many techniques in such a short amount of time, but she figured she'd still be able to carry out her missions for the day.

She finally drew the first scroll from her backpouch that contained the details of a mission she had been assigned by the mizukage. After taking a brief moment to go over the details of her mission the girl briefly closed the scroll and took off in the direction of her first objective. When she got there the girl retrieved a shovel from one of the construction workers and set off to work.

As she dug the girl whistled a happy tune to keep her from going completely insane. When she threw the dirt from the hole; she was sure that it all went to one pile. She'd been given two missions like this before, and she was quite sure she'd simply be ordered to fill the hole right back in after she was finished digging it. Putting it all into one pile made the second task far easier than the first.

She continued to dig, and eventually reached the depth that was required, but needed to widen the hole. After several more momenets passed of digging she found herself happy with the overall makeup of the hole after using her shovel to judge the depth and width. They were both equal to the length of the shovel which in turn granted her the knowledge that the hole was both six food wide by six foot deep,

"Perfect." 

The girl thought to herself as she climed out of the large hole. She then drew the second mission scroll from her backpouch and quickly examined the contents. It ended up being just as she had expected. The so called construction company didn't have clearence to dig in this spot and thus the hole needed to be filled back in.

She didn't expect any more, or really any less from the mizukage at this point. This was the whole reasoning behind why she had piled the dirt in such a way that'd make it easy to fill the hole back in. As soon as she put the scroll away and had taken a small amount of time to allow her stamina to return to it's normal form; the girl took off from the spot.

She returned several moments later armed with a rake. She'd begin to rake the dirt back into the hole. This made the overall task much easier for her. It was completed over the course of a few minutes. She had it completely smoothed out in about half an hour. There was evidence of the hole being there via a huge bald spot in the crust of the earth, but the dirt was packed tightly back into place. In a few weeks grass would grow back over the area and it'd look completely as it did before she ever touched it.

The girl retrieved the final scroll for the day and it was the same as the first mission she had recieved as a shinobi. She was informed to pick up trash around the village before returning back to the mizukage for her minor reward. The girl sighed; she really didn't feel like doing this mission at the moment given, but didn't have much of a choice. She needed to completed it quickyl so she'd have time to goof off before she had to complete her next set of missions. 

Maybe she was currently doing the missions wrong. Maybe she should put them off and complete them at the last moment then once again slack when given the next step rather than completing them as soon as she was given them. The only problem with putting them off is the fact that it brought with it the chance that she'd fail to complete them in the time allotted and thus be subjected to punishment for such action. This encouraged her to do  it as she always had rather than changing her methods.

The girl rented out a large trash can and began to make her way across the village. She collected trash from place to place with a pointed rod and placed it into the trash can. She didn't use a bag, but worked out that filling the trashcan was the equivilant to three bags full of trash. 

As she made her way across the village the amount of trash present seemed nearly infinite. This was bad for her in her casual life, but for the mission it was good. She had to make less of an effort to find the trash and was able to more easily fill up the trash can. She completed this task  in only what seemed to be half an hour. When she was finished the girl made her way back to the kage mansion to collect her reward.* - Fri Oct 30 21:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) nodded in response to the mizukage's dare. She quickly backed away from the table and placed both of her hands against the hardwood floor of the bar, or whatever this place was. She then proceeded to place pressure onto her hands and eventually managed to suspend her feet straight into the air above her.

The girl's hands didn't begin to burn right away, but it was sure to come in the next passing moments. She hadn't really ever trained this way and thus her ability to do something of this nature was lower than if she was simply told to run laps or something. She guessed it benefitted her and kept the game going so she couldn't really complain,

<I know how I am when i'm drunk and i'll need to be drunk to follow through with these actions.>

the girl thought to herself before the thirteen year old chugged the entire bottle in one go. The burn left behind caused her to wince, but she was able to get past it. She didn't feel any effect of the sake at first, but she'd soon be drunk off of her ass.
