<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) says: .... - Thu Nov  5 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Oh, he's distracted. Should I wait? - Thu Nov  5 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Ah, well, if you want to join our fight..just jump in. - Thu Nov  5 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: C'mon - Thu Nov  5 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) silently followed the man. She didn't really know what she could do in a spar against someone of his rank; he had to be much better than her she assumed. She was pretty weak even by genin standards, but she'd do her best to not disappoint the blondie. They made their way from the center of the village to a sand-filled arena.

The terrain was alien to the girl. It took her a few moments to fully adapt to the shiftiness of the sand beneath her feet. She didn't really favour it, but took it as training in her ability to adapt. That was a huge part of being a shinobi and was fully applicable to the situation now presented. Her face revealed a slight smirk, but hidden behind it was a moderate sense of nervousness and self doubt,

<Here goes nothing...> 

the girl thought to herself before launching off of her right foot. Her speed was well above average for a genin, but still nothing spectacular. She accelerated to her top speed before launching into the air. Once in the air the girl shot her right foot forward and aimed to dick the man right in the face just as she had done against Ortho. Within her mind she chanted,

"Dynamic Entry!!!'* - Thu Nov  5 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued flying for a fair amount of distance before managing to land and regain her footing. As soon as she turned around the girl was greeted by a stream of water being expelled from the man's mouth in her direction. She had rather slow reflexes, but was able to make the best of the time given to her by the man before he fired in the form of a step northward. After stepping out of the way the girl directed her piercing yellow gaze toward her opponent. It was clear she'd be playing a game of try to hit and get hit with him, but she only aimed to land at least one hit.

The girl once again took off in the direction of her opponent. There was no sign of fatigue in her approach. This time instead of jumping she opted to close the distance between the two before forming a set of handseals of her own. If there were jutsu to be involved she'd do her best to contend in a two-dimensional fight even if her elemental skills were fighting. 

She performed a set of handseals mid sprint and began to allow her chakra to manfiest within her chest. It made it's way up from her chest, through her throat, and into her mouth before she was prepared to fire off her answer to the man's wave of water,

<Water Style: Raging Waves!>

A large amount of water was expelled from the girls mouth. Immediately after exiting her body it formed into a decent sized wave and quickly overtook the arena. A large amount of excess water was left in the wake of the wave. The girl used the jutsu to attempt to gain a positional advantage on her opponent while he reacted accordingly to her jutsu via moving southwest.* - Thu Nov  5 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) noted that the man had indeed managed to fire off a second jutsu before she finished her own. This caught her off guard, but somehow her jutsu was able to overpower the stream of mud he'd followed up his original jutsu with. This more than likely surprised Mana more than it surprised her opponent, but she didn't allow it to slow her down.

Following the wave of water she instantly began to start forming another set of handseals. Chakra began to manifest in the center of her body before branching off toward her arms. She extended her right arm forward and placed it atop the water. This whole process was extremely slow due to her lack of mastery, but maybe she'd get lucky again.

The water reacted to the chakra in her hand and began to raise and form into a dense sphere of water around her opponent. The sphere used her arm as the main magnet that'd hold the prison together. If her opponent was caught by this technique it'd be fairly hard to escape even if the girl had little to no skill in the elemental world,

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I hope she's easier to find this time around. - Thu Nov  5 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) had been caught(!) She now seemed to be a shinobi seed that was waiting to sprout from the ground. She'd wimper due to the situation she was placed in, but was released almost as quickly as she was caught. She'd simply bow in acknowledgment of the spar ending,

"Well that kind of trailed away from taijutsu. I'm not very good in that type of fight, really, but it was fun. Thanks!"* - Thu Nov  5 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, good job. Keep it up. - Thu Nov  5 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You are ready then, Tetsumi? - Thu Nov  5 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov  5 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Either of you care for a little training session? - Thu Nov  5 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What kind of training? - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Just a spar. I'm not very skilled, but i'd like to try and hone my craft any chance I get. - Thu Nov  5 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I don't know how I feel about hitting girls.. - Thu Nov  5 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Don't worry. I'm use to being hit after being in Kirigakure. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) stared at the girl who agreed to face off against her in a spar. The girl wasn't really sure what to expect from her opponent. To make things worse; her opponent had the blessing of being able to watch her fight against the higher leveled shinobi. She didn't really know how to approach this spar other than via playing cautiously.

Her golden gaze narrowed. Every observable detail was taken in by the younger girl. This wasn't much considering the younger girl's lack of experience accompanied by the fact that she didn't possess any skills that'd aid her in the assessment she made. 

The red head simply assumed a basic stance and awaited for her opposite number to initiate the spar with the simple trigger,

"Come..."* - Thu Nov  5 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yoo. - Thu Nov  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) realised that this wasn't going to be an ordinary spar by any means. Her opponent made that much apparent with the release of smoke to begin. It was either poison, or simply used for cover. Either way both meant that the girl needed to reposition. She wouldn't run the risk of inhaling the smoke, or remaining within it to give her opponent an immedaite gateway into starting the spar. She still didn't know what to expect from her opponent. She wasn't playing any of her hands right off the bat other than the fact that she had doton as an element. This wasn't favorable.

The girl proceeded to backpeddle backwards. When she finally realised that her opponent had fallen beneath the ground the girl quickly reacted with her own use of the same ability. The girl continued to scan the area for any type of clue that may aid her in finding out the location of her opponent. She'd quickly note the two that had arrived to observe their spar,

<Scouts, or does Sunagakure just have a normal population of spar watches? Interesting and different either way. Usually i'm use to carrying out my spars in isolation simply due to the fact that nobody cares. Being watched adds pressure and certainly makes things more interesting.>

The girl decided to take the break in combat as a chance to mold the area into something that'd better compliment her style of combat. She hastily formed a set of handseals which in turn caused chakra to manifest in the center. The chakra then focused and snaked it's way up her throat and into her mouth,

<Raging Waves!> 

The girl chanted within her head before expelling a large wave of water. It wasn't used for it's brute force, but to create a standing amount of water on the arena. It also rushed into the girl's hole and trailed behind her,

<What will you do now?>* - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to stay on the move. If it was a battle of stamina to avoid getting opened on by her oppoent, she'd be more than willing to participate. She figured as long as she stayed in motion her opponent couldn't close the distance between the two. The water she had spawned also wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. * - Thu Nov  5 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to run, she was basically being herded at this point. She had a vague idea of where her opponent had been and decided she wouldn't back track. She'd simply continue to run in a northwestern direciton as quickly as she could in the hope that she wouldn't be caught. 

What on earth could her opponent be planning?* - Thu Nov  5 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) took action as soon as she heard the explosions. She performed a swift set of handseals before enveloping her own body in a veil of chakra. The chakra caused the sand below her to soften and allowed her to slip into it. This left her completely out of sight of her opponent and allowed her refuge from any sort of equipment that was thrown her way. She went deep enough so that the tags and such would also be proven ineffective.

From beneath the ground the girl began to make her way toward her opponent. She had a clear cut strategy within her head of how she was going to strike her opponent. She currently resided in the residual smoke from the bomb she originally threw to start of the spar. If she was standing in it then it was most likely not poison unless she was a masochist that planned on harming herself.

The girl didn't really know, but she wasn't about to run into it herself before she was absolutely sure that it was safe. From below the ground she observed the girl's movements via the magnetic forces available to her. This allowed her to track her movements despite her inaudible steps. From here the girl simply waited for her opponent's next move.

The prey had become the hunter as the tables were basically completely flipped. She didn't really have any equipment she was willing to use in order for traps to be made, but she did have a few strategies fresh upon her mind that may give her the advantage.* - Thu Nov  5 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to travel. She was careful not to go where she had already been. She could no longer sense her opponent, but she did her best to not allow this to disuade her. The girl continued to travel north and eventually surfaced along the nothernmost wall of the arena. Her eyes instantly locked with those of her opponent upon resurfacing, and she did he best to not allow the girl to make the first move. Apart from the strap the entire situation seemed to have been reset with all things considered.

The girl began to run through another set of handseals before expelling a large amount of mud from her mouth. This mixed with the already placed water and created a decently sized flow of mud that'd rush toward the girl. The tanto and wire would most likely be swept away by the mud. This would cause her opponent to trip if she attempted to continue her stance upon the wire after the girl surfaced.

The girl did her best to remain vigilant when she shot her jutsu. She didn't know how fast her opponent was, but she did take in the fact that she was -very- resourceful. She also took in that she didn't take spars lightly. Explosive tags seemed to be a favored tool for her and them things could cause some nasty damage if they hit. 

The girl's golden gaze rested upon her opponent for now; however, as she wished only to gauge her reaciton before her next move. Hopefully the mud jutsu would prove effective and give her something to follow up on.* - Thu Nov  5 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: let's move - Thu Nov  5 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Not here. .  - Thu Nov  5 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) was fucked up on this turn.* - Thu Nov  5 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) didn't waver; she simply gave in at this point. It was clear the other shinobi was more experienced and capable than her. At this point she simply awaited to be released. Once this was done she'd simply step away and press on as if the spar had never taken place.* - Thu Nov  5 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Hmm... - Thu Nov  5 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Well after those two spars i've still not accomplished the taijutsu workout I was looking for... - Thu Nov  5 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taijutsu training? - Thu Nov  5 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah; it's what i'm trying to get good at, but I lack enough skill in it to match up to my opponents. - Thu Nov  5 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So I have a hard time finding a decent sparring partner. - Thu Nov  5 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I ask, why are you pursuing to better yourself in taijutsu? - Thu Nov  5 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What will you do in the face of those who robbed the life of your family and friends? Will you seek revenge? - Thu Nov  5 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: When things come to fighting I want to be able to be a force strong enough to prevent those close to be being harmed. - Thu Nov  5 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Good question. I'll tell you when I know myself. - Thu Nov  5 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Here's some advice, don't look for revenge. You'll only hurt yourself. - Thu Nov  5 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Hey uh...youthitude over there. How about a friendly spar? - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If you wish, I'll teach you something that'll aid you. - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: You will? - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: An engage between you and I to determine the outputs of our youth!? Certainly! - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. It's a defensive technique. - Thu Nov  5 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sounds interesting. - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This is the technique of a friend of mine, and of my teacher. - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) waved off the youthified boy of a man before her temporarily. Her golden gaze found it's way to the person who'd approached her. She'd do as he said and simply threw a punch in his general direction unsure of what actions were to follow.* - Thu Nov  5 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The key to this technique is movement. You should move as if you're like water, and react accordinly. - Thu Nov  5 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) was caught off guard. Rather than simply block, or dodge her attack the man chose to parry it. This knocked her off balanced and allowed him an opening to land a free strike. Definitely something she wished to learn and wanted to be capable of utilizing in the future. Given the simplicity of the technique it couldn't be so hard.

She quickly asked the man to strike at her. She assumed it'd be as easy as one two three. It wasn't; however, as she lacked the reflexes to actually pull it off the first time. His strike came through her guard and struck her right in the face. The girl winced at the pain, but was able to shake it off for the most part. It wasn't like he put that much force behind it.

Given it was a simple technique the girl found it hard to put too much detail behind how she learned it. She simply asked him to strike again, but this time remained on focus in order to correctly parry the move as it was performed. When Kuro attempted to punch her she successfully knocked his hand to the side and countered with a punch to his throat instinctively,

"Oops..."* - Thu Nov  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Working on it... - Thu Nov  5 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Shall we begin? - Thu Nov  5 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Indeed. Come at me when you desire! - Thu Nov  5 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) nodded in acknowledgement of the jumpsuit jackie's words. The girl's golden gaze found it's way to that of her opposite number's. She wasn't quite sure of his abiltiy, but given her observations of his workout he most likely focused on taijutsu. His entire outfit seemed to be focused around that one singular thing. She chuckled. The more she examined the man the more goofy she realised he looked.

Without much hesitation the girl launched off of her right foot and aimed to close the distance that loomed between the two at the beginning of the spar. After losing the first two she hoped she could at least contend with this man child, or maybe even that he'd allow her to contend. She really didn't need any more hits to her pride today.

When within a reasonable distance the girl trampolined off of her feet and went airborne in a spinning motion. A single foot was extended outwards toward the boy. The girl aimed to kick him in the upper portion of his body to begin the spar.* - Thu Nov  5 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || Things were just as the girl had previously assumed. It seemed everyone that lived within this village were simply too much for her. The boy was obviously well versed in taijutsu. That much was told through the way he moved. He blocked her first strike and directed a counter attack toward her. 

He bent low to block, but the girl felt like she may have an oppnening. Acting on this feeling along with the fact that the boy pulled his attack she managed to force her body into the backwards rotation required to complete her technique via utilizing the momentum created against her foot in the original kick. This allowed the girl to reverse her motion and execute a second, more powerful lower sweep of a kick. 

If the girl succeeded she'd rise back to her feet and aim to continue her attacks. She didn't want to give her opponent a chance to rest in the middle of battle. Any advantage she'd do her best to press, but at the end of the day she found herself at the mercy of her opponent. Anything she could do; he could most likely do better,

<This is rough!>* - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) grinned for a split second after noticing her kick had landed. This all changed; however, when she realised that kicking the youthful fruitloop was the same as kicking a brick wall, or even a mountain. He remained unwavering from the force of her strike which caused a mild amount of pain in the leg she'd used to sweep him. She recoiled backwards and ultimately gave in. She was growing tired of fighting losing battles. She'd simply ask,

"Have any taijutsu pointers?"* - Thu Nov  5 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: The idiot is getting a little better. - Thu Nov  5 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: That was how much I did when I was as experienced as her. - Thu Nov  5 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) directed a rather deflated look towards the man. The regimine he had suggestedd was nothing compared to what she already did. She followed up his statement with,

"I do one thousand push ups, 600 sit ups, 200 mountain climbers, 100 jumping jacks, and 2 hours of standing on my hands..."* - Thu Nov  5 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Great! I was simply advising a toned down training regime for someone of your experience! - Thu Nov  5 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Does wearing an outfit like that make you stronger? - Thu Nov  5 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't really know...probably because all we were ever taught was how to pick up trash, chase dogs, clean steps, and dig holes. - Fri Nov  6 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh and how to build houses. - Fri Nov  6 03:47:50 2015
