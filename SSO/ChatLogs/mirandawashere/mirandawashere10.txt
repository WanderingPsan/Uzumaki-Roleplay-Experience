<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Looks like it's you. - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) silently stared down her opponent. The name her opposite possessed was simply too long for the girl to have any interest in memorizing such a thing. She'd perhaps later learn it via repition, but for now the girl'd ulitmately be dubbed, "Red Purple" in Mana's mind. 

Her opponent rolled the first move in the spar, but didn't seem to possess the speed to make a strong impression with her first actions...either that or she was hiding her speed. Eitherway the girl decided she'd attempt to use the element of surprise in the hopes of catching her opponent completely off guard.

Instantly the girl launched forward off of her right foot. She nearly instantly accelerated to her top speed before throwing her body into the air. Once in the air the girl directed her right foot toward her opponent, 

"Dynamic Entry!"

The girl exclaimed during her mid air charge in an attempt to catch her opponent off guard with the sudden kick to the face. If it landed it'd prove to be a strong start; if not she'd probably look a fool.* - Thu Nov 12 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) grinned when her kick successfully found it's mark. Her opponent recoiled backwards from the kick, but she was utterly shocked by the action to follow. Her opponent managed to grasp her by the foot she had delivered the kick with and performed a counter measure in the form of a devastating strike to her own jawline.

The girl's body was slightly stronger than normal, but the hit still hurt slightly. If allowed the girl found herself recoiling backwards from her oppoennt. Pain was relevant along her jawline, but it wasn't enough to disuade the girl from continuing her attempts to down the opponent. 

After taking a moment to fully recover her mental focus the young female prepared for another assault. This one carried much more speed, power, and finese than the original as it was something the girl practiced daily to master. It was most certainly one of her most polished skills. 

When the distance between the two had been lessened once again to a workable distance; the girl started her assault in the form of a low kick aimed at the base of her opponent's frame before the girl practically floated in the air to deliver the second and third strikes of the combination. These were respectively a mid and high kick. To finish off the combination she'd aim to land a brutal heel drop toward the top of her opponent's head while exclaiming,

"Kirigakure Style Taijutsu: Raging Hurricane!"* - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl's wombo was interrupted by the swift strikes of her opponent. Given her current focus and the position she was in the girl was left wipe open for the retaliation that was to come shortly thereafter. Her opponent's knee came slamming into her chest, which knocked the wind out of her. Before she could even register what was happening the knee was followed up by two punches to her arms.

This left the girl sliding backwards away once more. She couldn't wrap her mind around the fact that her opponent seemed completely unphased by her attacks. She had focused to make sure such a thing -wouldn't- happen again after last time. She was forced to come to terms with the fact that she was still -too- weak.

Having pulled her trump card so early, the girl wasn't exactly sure how to continue. Both of her arms ached and she strugged to catch her breath. She wasn't neccesarily fatigued, and the strikes hadn't done too much to harm her, but she questioned if she could really win this battle. The immediate answer she found was a simple no; nonetheless, she had to keep pushing forward. If she stopped and gave up now she'd always be this weak. 

Brute force alone obviously wasn't enough to stop, or even really phase her opponent. She'd have to find another method of attack if she wished to even keep the spar interesting. The girl sighed; this truly was a pain in the ass to deal with, but if it were for real she'd probably be dead right now to be honest. She'd have to gain this experience sooner or later anyhow,

"I'm not going to give up until my body can no longer move..."

the girl stated in a sharp tone. Once again she spud toward her opponet, but this time she didn't immediately go on the offensive. When she drew close to her opponent she aimed to side step around her. No punches were thrown, but she was within a close proximity of her target. * - Thu Nov 12 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl continued her approach. There weren't many openings in her opponent's style. She stayed on the move and seemed to be far more expeianced in the art of combat than her. This most certainly made matters more difficult than they needed to be; however, difficulty wasn't always a bad thing.

Her opponent's words registered within her mind and were quite easing to be honest, but the girl knew she had her work cut out for her. Even without the sword that combination of strikes her opponent had performed previously still -hurt-.

Finally opting to go on the offensive again the girl aimed to step into her opponent. Her immediate focus was to grasp cloth covering the pectoral of her opponent's right arm. At the same time the girl's left hand was motioned underneath the her opponent's right sleeve near her tricept muscle. 

If these two motions were successful the girl pulled her opponent above her before tossing her over her back and onto the ground behind her body. Using the momentum of the throw the girl followed through via driving her right elbow directly into her opponent's right shoulder,

"Morote Seionage!"* - Thu Nov 12 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) flinched from the pain, but was able to follow through with her technique. This time there was visible evidence that her strike had indeed effected her opponent. This gave the girl a slight amount of momentum, but she knew it was no where near enough to win the spar and expected immediate retalliation from her opponent.

When her foe rose from the ground they immediately attempted to strike back at Mana. The girl was ready for this; however, as it was to be expected. This helped her make up for her otherwise poor reflexes that'd otherwise lead to the usual failure of the ability she was to perform next.

The girl waited for the critical momnet in her opponent's kick before aiming to knock the girl's kick away from her body with her right arm. Immediately following this motion the left handed girl threw a left handed strike aimed directly for her opponent's throat in an attempt to knock her even furhter off guard and stun her temporarily.

To finish off this quick combo the girl utilized another of her many skills that she normally didn't get a chance to show. She sprung off of her right foot in a twisting motion before directing a high sweeping kick toward her stunned opponent's upper body.

Working off of the momentum gained from the impact of the first kick the girl reversed the rotation of her body while airborne and proceeded to land a second, much more devastating, low kick to her opponent's shin area,

"Twister!"* - Thu Nov 12 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) glided gracefully through the air following her attacks. She landed a few feet back from her opponent. There were absolutely no visual signs of physical fatigue upon the girl's frame. Her stomache was slightly bruised beneath her jacket, and her arms had definitely felt better before the spar, but there was nothing done to prevent her from fighting at nearly one hundred percent. 

She'd basically played every card she had with that last combination of attacks; yet her opponent seemed to be only slightly phased when the dust settled. She wondered what the girl meant when she said she was going to get it, but didn't bother hanging on those words for too long. She knew she'd find out soon enough.

<What now?>

the girl thought to herself. She opted to not go on the offensive this time around, but to simply wait and watch. Perhaps she'd find another opening to strike, or simply be molly whopped by her opposite number wh was clearly stronger in the straight up battle.* - Thu Nov 12 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) decided that there was no simply no way for herself to stand a chance in the battle as things had currently progressed. Even the girl's critical strikes that were completely unguarded seemed to be completely useless toward her opponent. To make things worse it seemed that her opponent seemed to LIKE being struck. It seemed like she was feeding off of the pain that had been inflicted upon her. 

This was mildly disturbing for the female, but she did respect it largely. Maybe one day she herself could find a way to gain drive from pain...to convert her pain into the fuel that allows her to carry on in a fight. The efficiency of such a skill was remarkable within her mind, but she needed to focus on things as they currently stood. 

Her opponent came forth, but the girl wasn't being cautious as it so happened. She was preparing for what was to follow.  The girl clenched her fists tightly. Her facial expression warped, cringing in anticipation for the burst of charka that was to follow the opening of a gate; the girl's true trump card. The one thing she had to fall back on in a situation where everything else had failed. She swore to never use it in a spar, but for just once she wanted to see if it'd make a difference. If she'd prove capable of victory upon removing the restraints of her muscles, "Gate of opening..." she stated lowly through clenched teeth. Each letter was a true struggle to pronounce due to the amount of strain now placed upon her body, "Open!" she suddenly exclaimed with the release of chakra caused by opening the first of eight tenketsu within her body. This allowed her to use her body's full potential in combat without the natural restraint placed upon her muscles in the act of self preservation.

Utilziing this sudden increase in power the girl aimed to catch her opposition off guard. She completely ignored the punch the girl looked to send, and went straight in for a headbut against her opponent from a full sprint. Little did she know that her opponent also had planned a head but which thus left them crashing into each other at full force.* - Thu Nov 12 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: ......Wow, Mitsunara is crazy as fuck.... - Thu Nov 12 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) recoiled backwards from the strike. The girl lacked the durability the other possessed to be able to tank such a blow. The same amount of blood found itself escaping her dome, but the girl suffered much greater damage than it appeared. If she hadn't decided to just go all out with hit now then she'd most likely give out at this moment,

<I can't quit now. I can't allow her to win...not after I showed my trump card. They won't speak...they'll keep my secret. There's only two..i'll show them what i'm really capable of. I'll use...-it-...>

the girl thought to herself. She really wished there was another way, but the position she was in proved that there wasn't. The time to act was -now-. Slowly the girl began to unwrap her scarf in a long, drawn out manner. Afterwords the scarf was used to wipe the blood from her forehead before being dropped into the sand. 

Next the girl began to unzip her coat. After a few moments the coat fell to the ground below her. Beneath the jacket a green, sylish jump suit was revelead. This removed and restriction placed upon her body by her usual clothing, but wasn't the main focus of her move.

Now in her jumpsuit the girl mentally prepared for what was to come. She accepted the fact that after this move she may have to rest for a few days, but she had -something- to prove. Carrying on she crossed her arms in a shield like pattern once again. Her facial expression shifted from one of agony to one of complete calm. Her entire demeanor changed temporarily,

"It's not over..."

she stated through gritted teeth. The only explanation for her sudden shift and demeanor and the effects of the attack deminishing was her opening of the second gate, but she wasn't done yet. Her arms remained crossed, and her facial expression shifted once again, cringing in anticipation for the greater burst of chakra and increased rate of blood flow that'd follow her next opening,

"Gate of life..."

the girl stated through gritted teeth. She litteraly hung on each letter as her focus was redirected. True pain was apparent within her voice before she suddenly snapped, "Release!" a huge burst of chakra emitted from her body. Her skin shifted to a reddish tint as a result of her cardiovascular system basically being forced to increase it's work load. She -wouldn't- go any further than this; however, and immediately aimed to use the technique she'd originally started the spar out with.

Her speed was nearly inhuman when compared to her original speed, and the technique was carried out with much more polish due to her overall increase in ability. The first strike came quickly up high, and was immediately followed in a spinning motion by a second kick to her opponent's mid section, and a third to her upper frame. The combination ended with a swift heel drop the to top of her opponent's head. * - Thu Nov 12 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) whispers: 35 damage I think.) - Thu Nov 12 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Looks like Mitsunara has her hands full. - Thu Nov 12 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Oh, theres that girl from earlier - Thu Nov 12 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) charged in for her strike, but wasn't neccesarily prepared for her opponent's counter. She didn't expect her to be quick enough, but was brutally interrupted mid combo by the female's summoning of some kind of unnatural sword. The downward arc made contact with the creamy flesh of the female during her combo. She managed to reduce the damage slightly in a last ditch effort a moving backwards, but her body caught a pretty good knick.

A large amount of blood began to stream from the mark of the blade. The girl's body remained motionless in the sand. Her cardiovasular levels and blood flow returned to normal along with the tone of her skin. Her breathing drew short and quick as she entered a state of complete physical exhaustion. She could not longer help herself, and the spar was most certainly over. She managed to speak in a breathless tone,

"You won this one..."* - Thu Nov 12 23:33:58 2015
