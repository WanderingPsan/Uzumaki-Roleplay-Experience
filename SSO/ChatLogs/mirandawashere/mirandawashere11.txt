<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way toward the square. That was where the girl could generally locate the Kazekage. He was much different to her than the Mizukage; thus, she wasn't quite sure which she liked more. The Mizukage seemed more overall responsive, but the Kazekage gave higher ranking missions. The missions being given to her by him; however, ultimatley fell near the same category as the ones she'd been given by her previous kage.

The young redhead carried herself at a brisk pace that'd be placed slightly above a jog in terms of relative speed. This brought her to the square in a decent amount of time and allowed her to refrain from breaking a sweat. She was able to keep up a higher pace in Kirigakure without breaking a sweat due to the overall cooler weather Kirigakure experienced. She definitely had to tone it down in the harsh desert climate she now faced.

When finally in the square the girl requested a mission from the kage. After a few minutes of waiting he simply nodded and tossed her a scroll. The girl wasted no time in opening the scorll and examining it's contents. She had been assigned gate duty by the kazekage. A relatively simple, but important job. She'd stand beside the usual chuunin that work to keep the village secure.

With her objective clear upon her mind the girl set off towards the gate. She found herself half way they within mere moments before seeing a snake. In reaction to the sighting of the snake the girl immediately stopped and allowed her body to fall to the ground. Her feet remained fully extended upon the grainy sand that lined the flooring of the village while her hands rested before her spread to be even with her hips.

Slowly the girl began to lift herself from the ground. Upon doing so her arms crackled slightly in response to the pressure being exerted upon them. This caused a miniscule amount of pain to surge through the girl's body temporarily, but didn't cause her to halt in her action. Once her arms were fully extended and her body was at rest off the ground, the girl began to lower herself.

She repeated this process once again, but in a faster manner. As she progressed further she picked up the pace. She controlled her breathing to maximize the effectiveness of her lung compacity. After a while she began to feel that all-too-familiar burning in her arms that most taijutsu specialists knew. They progressed through hard work rather than reading unlike shinobi whom focus upon other specializations.

After the girl had completed one thousand push ups she rose back to her feet and continued on her journey to the gate. She found herself arriving there about five minutes after her push up session. Her hair was now considerably more messy, and the front part of her coat had a moderately thick coat of sand to cover it. The girl did her best to brush the sand out before checking in with the head guard.

From there she found her way to the upper wall of the gate that served as the main entrance to her village. Once atop the wall the girl turned her focus toward the seemingly infinite desert that surrounded her village. Her vision granted her nothing other than the occasional cacti accompanied by sand being blown freely by the wind.

About twenty minutes of eventless guard duty passed before a singular man pushing a cart filled with some sort of item became present upon the horizon. As the man drew closer it became apparent that he was pushing a cart full off...cabbages? Yes, they were most certainly cabbages. The girl wondered how they lasted through the harsh, dry climate of the dessert at the pace the man currently traveled.

When he eventually made his way to the gate the girl dropped down from her perch with the sound of the base of her shoes meeting the hard ground below resounding through the area. A golden gaze quickly scanned up and down the man before the girl stepped forward and spoke in a sharp tone,

"Name and reason for entry?"

The old man possessed a lazy eye, wore a goofy ass hat that looked like it was simply an upside down shoe and wore clothing that was covered in dirt, saliva, and what seemed to be manure. His armpits, legs, and chest were covered in a thick coat of nasty hair and he smelled of rotten eggs. The man stated in a overall eager tone,

"I've come to sell my cabbages. They are the best in the land."

The girl directed doubetly glared at the man. There was no way people would be interested in purchasing food from such a vile being. The food he currently possessed were more than likely infected considering the overall hygine of the man who grew them. 

This led the girl to to conclusion that the man's food supply needed to be purge. She also couldn't allow such a pig entry into their village. He probably carried diesase and would infect the common folk. That could lead to a horrible epideminc that she simply wouldn't be to blame for. She knew if she summoned a jounin they'd say the same, so she took matters into her own hands.

Immediately after passing her judgement the girl snapped into action. The distance between herself and the cabbage man's snapped to zero in less than a second. The girl proceeded to direct her right foot toward the cart that carried the man's cabbages. Without much effort the feeble cart was broken in two. This prompted the cabbage man to yell out in agony,

"MY CABBAGES!!!"

After breaking the cart the girl proceeded to smash each cabbage individually. They stood no chance against the pressure of her foot being smashed into them. They'd shrink into the sand while being bursted into thousnads of smaller pices individually. When the girl felt her handy work was complete she directed her focus back toward the non-cabbage man and stated in a blank tone,

"Got any more cabbages?"

After voicing her question the girl turned away from the now sulking man and made her way back toward her perch atop the main gate. The man remained in front of the gate for several moments before eventually giving up and turning away from the village hidden in the sand. After a few moments the image of his viage faded back into the vast abyss that was the desert.

After taking several moments to admire her handy work the girl reported her actions to the cage via a random shinobi that was standing around. He later returned to report the acceptance of her actions in the situation and to inform her that her guard duty was effectively ended for the time being,

"Mission accomplished."

the girl stated in a cheerful tone before dropping from the top of the wall and making her way back into the village. Once again she proceeded at a brisk pace toward the center of the village. It was becoming more and more apparent to the girl that every village had a bunch of empty space. Most of the inhabitants gathered in the middle. If there was ever a terrorist attack she wasn't sure if the center was the most dangerous or most secure spot. Man; her feet were growing sore.

Upon reaching the half way mark toward the end of her journey the girl stopped to take a breather. Crashing the cabbage man's dreams was quite exhausting...at least more so than she had expected it to. A bottle of water was drawn from her back pouch and consumed. She also took a few moments to stretch and perform a few jumping jacks to get the blood pumping once more. 

After she was content with her little pit stop the girl resumed at a quicker pace than before. This time she was near her top speed and made the five minute trip in less than two. When she arrived she was slightly out of breath and pain was apparent upon her ribs. It took her a few moments to regain herself before voicing the completion of her mission to the kage; an action that seemed redundant since he had relieved her, but was most certianly neccesary to gain her reward.* - Sun Nov 15 01:45:23 2015
