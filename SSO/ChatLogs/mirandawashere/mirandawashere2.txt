<br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: So, I guess to begin...Is it safe to assume ya' don't know the Suimen technique? - Mon Oct 26 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I do not. - Mon Oct 26 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright...We'll start there then. - Mon Oct 26 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Well, you see how the Mizukage and I are standing on this here water, right? - Mon Oct 26 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I usually just go for a swim when I need to give her something. - Mon Oct 26 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Heh. Alright. - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Well... - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: The Suimen technique is used to walk across water. It's also good when you wanna go for a climb, like say you wanna climb that tree over to your left there. - Mon Oct 26 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Of course though, the tree is easier since it's not really movin' or nothin'. - Mon Oct 26 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: To actually use the technique, ya' gotta focus some chakra into your feet. Nice and even, then you should be able to walk on it smoothly. - Mon Oct 26 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Too little chakra and you'll just slip. Too much and you'll probably hurt ya'self in some other way. Who knows. Just uh...If you do mess up, be careful. - Mon Oct 26 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Got it so far? - Mon Oct 26 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I want you to try it out on that tree real quick then. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl simply nodded to the elder shinobi before turning to face the tree she'd been instructed to try the technique on. If it was as simple as focusing chakra to her feet; she assumed she'd be able to ace the jutsu without putting forth much effort. 

As a result of that thought she hastily set forth toward the tree. It was as if she were playing chicken with it at first, but she finally leaped into the air miliseconds before making contact with the tree. This allowed the base of her feet to make contact with the bark and she'd continue to run while focusing a large amount of chakra to her feet. She only realised she was focusing too much when her right foot litteraly stuck into the tree and caused her to trip up and fall back to the earth where she'd land harshly on her back followed by her head recoiling into the cold hard ground below.

"Damnet..."

she uttered under her breath. This didn't do much to deter her; however, as she swiftly rose back to her feet and set her gaze upon the tree once more. She had been close to success and only needed to make one minor adjustment to actually succeed. She began to run at the tree again, but this time formed a tiger seal as a means to help her focus her chakra. A moderate amount was redirected to her feet and she lept once again upwards. This time she found the happy medium in focus and made her way to the top of the tree before doing a backflip and floating back to the ground gracefully.

Upon her success she walked across the water without much effort to report her success to her teacher...she'd even ask,

"What now?"* - Mon Oct 26 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? Oh. - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Quick learner, heh. - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Anyways uh.... - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh... - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: What do I usually teach next... - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Did madam mizukage say we're family? - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? She never said nothin' about that to me. - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh. I was going to ask if you never got tired. - Mon Oct 26 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Normally I don't heh. - Mon Oct 26 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: But uh... - Mon Oct 26 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Say...What'cha know of Suiton and Doton so far? - Mon Oct 26 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I can make a wave of water. - Mon Oct 26 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright... - Mon Oct 26 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I'll teach ya' two techniques today. - Mon Oct 26 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: And from then on, I'll teach ya' more as I master more. - Mon Oct 26 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: The first technique I'll show ya' is Suiton-natured. - Mon Oct 26 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: It's pretty basic, just a stream of water really. Nothin' too fancy. - Mon Oct 26 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Since it's so basic, it's not as powerful as the wave technique you're talkin' about. At least for someone who's starting out with it. - Mon Oct 26 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl observed the demonstration the man performed as a means to teacher her the jutsu in quesiton. Moreso she took apart every piece of information that was offered before her and split them into smaller sections to tackle. It seemed like a lot of jutsu focused on simply pooling chakra. She could tie logic to that really, but it was still starting to grow kind of old to her as a concept.

<I'll do my best.>

she thought to herself before mimicing the string of sealts the man had demonstrated. While she mimic'd the seals she did her best to pool chakra within her gut before allowing it to flow upwards. This was similar to what she'd do with her other jutsu; so the whole process was not completely foreign to her. If anything it was a little easier. Unfortunately for her she just ended up spitting out a modest amount of water. SIlly her...she'd forgot to hold it in and let it build up.

The second time she performed the seals and allowed her chakra to pool once more. This time she slipped on a seal mid way through completion which instantly resulted in her failure of learning the technique, 

<Damnet...one more time.>

the girl told herself before once again performing the set of seals. This time she went -very- slowly and began to pool her chakra once again. As the process of the hand seals came to an end the chakra reached her mouth and caused her cheaks to puff up,

"Suiton: Mizurappa!"

she chanted within her head before expelling a decent amount of water in the direction of her teacher. Damnet she'd forgotten she was facing him...good thing it wouldn't do much damage considering she had little to no ability in actually using ninjutsu. * - Mon Oct 26 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Hm... - Mon Oct 26 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 26 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: This technique is pretty good for escape. - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: It's also really useful when you wanna get around without being hit by some random ninja. - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Is it that burrowing jutsu? - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I guess you've seen it before then. - Mon Oct 26 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Makes this a bit easier. - Mon Oct 26 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || Once again; the girl observed closely as the elder shinobi explained the technique before demonstrating it. She automatically cut it into smaller pieces within her mind and formulated a plan for carrying out the technique. This one was going to be much more difficult for her...that much was certain. She had absolutely no practice in utilizing her doton element, but she'd do her best to mimic his motions.

Firstly she formed the seals and focused on enveloping herself in chakra...so that it'd form a veil. This was quick to fail; however, as she never actually started moving following that motion. Damn...the ground below her seemed pretty hard. She sighed quite loudly before redirecting her focus back to the task at hand. She wouldn't allow herself to be discouraged.

Once again she performed the string of seals, but unknowingly messed up on one of them. A simple finger being out of place, but it was enough to mess up the rest of the process of the technique. This time the veil was slightly more complete, but was out of whack due to the chakra being focused poorly as a result of the missed seal.

<Damnet...>

she cursed to herself. Once again she began to form the seals. Her chakra pool was actually quite low; unlike her stamina pool and she was starting to feel mental fatigue as a result. One or two more tries was all she had left in her, and this try was already messed up by her lack of focus on completing the technique. She had almost sank, but as soon as she started thinking about how much chakra she had left she stopped with her calves submerged into the ground.

<SO close....this time for sure.>

she told herself. It had to be this time, or she'd have to wait for another day to learn it. She'd be spent mentally after this attempt. After freeing herself from the ground she formed the seals once again while focusing on her chakra in order to create an enveloping veil as previously shown by the elder shinobi. Once it was formed she slowly began to sink into the ground.

She moved a short distance, but when she reemerged she grabbed one of the elder shinobi's feet and yelled out, 

"Boo!"

in an attempt to scare him. A deivous laugh would surely follow her attempt regardless of success or failure.* - Mon Oct 26 05:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl blankly stared forth at the child who had approached her. She listened to his request, but wasn't really able to offer much of an answer. She knew she wasn't much more talented than the boy before her was which ultimately made her no help in the matter of his training,

"I would if I could."

she stated in an apologetic tone. Afterwords she'd extend a hand for a shake while her piercing yellow gaze met with that of the person opposite to her,

"I'm just as new as you are."* - Mon Oct 26 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl blankly stared into the man's eyes as he voiced his request. What he wanted became even more obvious after she gestured to the wooden sword that was currently strapped to his person. The girl wanted to spar him deep down, but she had other obligations to fulfill. It simply wasn't possible at the given time, but she'd sure love to at a later point.

"I'm sorry, but I can't right now. Seek me out tomorrow or so and i'll have a different answer for ya!"

she explained in an up-beat tone before flashing her perfectly white smile to compliment her sudden burst of cheerfullness. Afterwords she'd proceed to exit the scene to the north at a brisk pace. In her wake the parting words were heard,

"Farewell for now!"* - Mon Oct 26 08:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || Once again the girl made her way over to the base of the waterfall where her beloved mizukage was generally to be found standing. Instead of swimming as she normally did; the girl this time simply walked atop the water via employing the aid of her chakra via redirecting a small amount of it to her feet. It slightly drained her, but not enough to realistically make much of a difference in the long run. She didn't intend on using any techniques in the near future anyhow. She'd been taught a few, but that wasn't where her heart rested at the moment. She wanted to mainly focus on honing her skills in taijutsu. She wanted it to be her main form of engagement...and the jutsu to be her crutch in case she faced someone whom the taijutsu would not work against. She also had one final trump card in mind, but that didn't matter for now.

After being lost within her own thoughts momentarily the girl managed to recenter her focus upon the objective at hand. She drew a single scroll from her back pouch which contained the details of her first mission. After a few momnets of reading she came to the conclusion that she needed to run and pick up a scroll before returning it to their contact. That was pretty easy, but also boring. It was also a workout; so the girl couldn't really be too upset about it overall.

The scroll was placed in a secured box at the entrance to the village. The girl was pretty much starting on the complete opposite side which made the task a little bit more daunting, but nothing compared to building a house, or even really digging a hole. As soon as she was off her pace never fell below what was a jog when moving around civilians that also occupied the inner walkways of the village. She wasn't going to be rude and run through them, but that also slowed her down slightly.

Before long she had made it across the village and proceeded to secure the letter before turning on the return trip. This time she focused on maintaining a constant, stubstainable pace that'd allow her to not tire herself out before she started the next two missions. Once again she ran for a few momnets before making it back to her starting point. 

"Here ya go sir!"

she stated in a cheerful voice before tossing the letter over to her contact. She waved him off and waited for him to fade out of sight before moving onto the next scroll she'd been given previously by the kage. This one contained details of another escaped cat in the village. It seemed the crazy cat lady was at it again. The girl felt sorrow for the poor cat deep down, but knew that the village pretty much -had- to take any funds they could get and that the crazy cat lady was more than likely paying a decent sum of cash to have said cat returned to her possession.

The girl set off once again; firstly checking the academy to see if it had returned to it's slumbeirng spot. Unfortunately for her she came to the realization that it wasn't going to be that easy again upon seeing that the spot the cat occupied before was empty. This meant it was most likely up and about in the village which broaded her search to pretty much anywhere and everywhere. She sighed audibly before turning on her heels and taking off toward the exit of the academy courtyard,

"Now if I was a cat...where would I be?"

she asked herself under her breath. She spent the next several moments checking through most of the general stores. She figured it was possible for the cat to make it inside of them due to their doors remaining open for a large portion of the time within the village when it wasn't raining. Originally her search showed promise when she was able to locate what seemed like shedding in one of the stores. It was a match to the colour of fur the cat possessed, but the cat was nowhere to be found after extensive searching within the store,

"Just missed him..."

the girl thought to herself as she made her way out of the front door and back into the main passageway throughout the village. Next she decided to check around the allies and garbage cans. Perhaps the cat had grown hungry and went to search for itself some food. If that was the case the alleys were perfect since it'd be able to devour both mice and old food that had been thrown out. 

Unfortunately she hadn't managed to find anything, but was given another tip by a passerby that had taken note of her extensive searching. Upon asking her what she was doing and her explaining her mission to the man he informed her that he'd saw a cat of a similar description sleeping on the top of the steps to the academy a few minutes prior to his encounter with her. The girl slammed her palm into her face then made her way toward the academy. He must of eaten then went to take a nap.

When she made it back her target was clearly in sight before her. It was just as the man had said. The cat laid at the top of the steps comfortably asleep. Once again the girl inched her way toward it, before pouncing on it at the final second of her approach. Success! She'd once again captured the cat. Now she made her way back to the owner to complete her second mission. She gave the cat three or so days before it escaped again and she'd have to go and hunt it down just as before,

"Damn crazy cat ladies and their cats..."

she thought to herself, cursing the trivial task that she found herself subjective to multiple times. Finally she drew the third scroll and examined the inner writing. Now she found that she had to hunt down a dog that was reported to have been attacking children and the such within the village. This meant that it was vicious and she'd most likely find herself putting it down after contact.

It was a gruesome task, but someone had to do it. She wasn't strong, but she was in the happy medium if not being too weak and not being too strong to waste her time with such a manner. After a few moments she found herself standing in the location where the dog had been reported to doing it's dirty deeds. It didn't take her long to find the dog considering it came running -at- her right off the bat. This would be bad if she was a civilian, but it played to her favor as a shinobi. She'd taken a few classes in the academy about how to effectively kill a dog in the least painful way for it without using a weapon. The manner she intended to use wouldn't even require blood being drawn from the target.

When it finally pounced upwards at the girl she allowed it to bite into her arm. She didn't even flinch in response to the pain inflicted in the area due to her stronger than normal frame, and used the opening to grasp the dog's head. In a singular motion she twisted it tightly which in turn instantly broke it's neck and rendered it lifeless. She grasped the now dead dog and drug it across the village back to the kage as proof of her completion of the mission,

"The deed is done; though I honestly wish there would have been an alternate way of handling it."

her words came in a rather sad tone, it was clear that she was mentally troubled by the action she had completed, but it was for the sake of the village so she forced herself to move past it. Now she made her way across the village and found herself witnessing her best friend interacting with a male she did not know,

<What're you doing...?>* - Mon Oct 26 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Who's that? - Mon Oct 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl silently stared at the man for a few moments. She didn't know why, but he gave off a vibe that led her to feel like he was trying to cover something up. If the girl wasn't so innocent minded; she'd be able to easily decipher exactly what was going on, but was things stood she simply dismissed the thought entirely for the time being as she responded heartily,

"Hi! I'm Mana. That's Chi over there, my bestest friend!"

After he introduction she flashed her perfectly straight, blidingly white smile while piercing yellow eyes met with those of her opposite number. She was quite unique in many ways it seemed.* - Mon Oct 26 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl blankly stared at the man for a few moments. It became clear that she was much more primal than her partner. The gears in her head turned rather slowly as she registered what had been spoken to her. After analyzing what had been said she was able to decipher that they were going somewhere for good training.

This led her to the desire to join the two in whatever they were doing. Maybe it'd even be physical training where she could use her amazing stamina to her advantage! She also had a strong body that'd allow her to take much more pounding than her friend who was quite frail. She finally came to the conclusion that along with her desire to train and become stronger; she also wanted to make sure that the man wasn't too hard on her friend. It would be her first time training with anyone besides her,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl observed as those around her began to strip .They were quite strange conditions to train under to be honest, but she trusted in the intelligence of her best friend. Her friend had to know what was best for the both of them; so she had no reason to refuse, or even hesitate, really. First she started by unwrapping her scarf, revealing the milky white skin beneath. It wasn't neccesarily soft; however, as a result of her training. That wouldn't be noted until later though.

Next she began to undo her female coat. This took a few moments before it finally fell to the floor to reveal her final article of clothing that consisted of short shorts and a sports bra. She didn't really see a point in removing her shoes as they helped with her traction when running, so she left them on unless informed otherwise. She spoke in a high pitched tone that was somehow both soft and sweet,

"How is this? Good enough?"

following her speech she winked at the man before both her and her friend. She was ready for her training to say the least.* - Mon Oct 26 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Taijutsu. - Mon Oct 26 20:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Taijutsu for Mana, Genjutsu for Chi. - Mon Oct 26 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Very well then. - Mon Oct 26 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl rather reluctantly accepted the embrace of her fruity friend, but quickly retracted herself from the hold. The girl was honestly quite confused as to what was going on, but she wasn't going to quesiton it directly. Instead her attention was directed to the man before the duo,

"So how do we go about our training?"* - Mon Oct 26 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl closely examined the actions of her new instructor. She noted every motion that had been taken by him in order to complete the technique at hand. It was a little different than the jutsu that she'd previously learned. There were no handseals and she was basically left to kind of just attempt it on the air given that there was no solid object to make impact with. Quite a bother indeed, but she eventually decided that the best way to do this was to simply let it happen. To let it pan out and work out the kinks through trial and error. How hard could it really be?

First she tightened the laces on her shoes so that they may not fall off during her attempt at the technique, <Here goes nothing...> the girl thought to herself. Inside her mind she visualized what could best be described as a slowed down visualization of the elder shinobi as he used the technique. He started with a high sweeping kick. It worked like a feint, but it was actually followed through with. It was used to cause the opponent to block up high and leave the lower portion of their body open. She then noted that the man used the recoil of the original kick to transition into the second kick that'd be meant as the overall haymaker of the attack.

First the girl attempted the kick up high. She bent her knees and prepared to pounce. Adrenaline was beginning to pump through her body in reaction to the tension being built in anticipation for the move. All at once she threw herself into the air, but wasn't able to actually kick in a spinning motion as he had. She ended up simply falling back to the ground inbetween the two.

<Shit...>

she cursed to herself. After taking a moment to revisualize exactly how the man carried out the kick, she attempted it one more time. This time it proved to be successful, but she wasn't able to properly utilize the recoil created from the first kick to lead into the second one. She instead ended up bouncing off of the makeshift target and slammed into the ground face first. 

Once again she rose to her feet and took a moment to wipe most of the dust from her visage that had accumulated when she fell. Her face slightly stung, but it wasn't enough to keep her from returning her focus to the technique at hand. 

<I'll have it this time for sure.>

the girl told herself before once again bending her knees. Finally she lept into the air and performed the former part of the technique with flying colours. Immediately after the first kick landed she transitioned into the second which made impact with the log within a second of her first kick. A smile was now clearly apparent on her face as she couldn't help being happy with herself. She'd finally managed to learn something that she was interested in actually honing and immediately gaining proficiency in.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. Lets head to the beach. - Mon Oct 26 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) followed in uniform.* - Mon Oct 26 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) did the same, but she wasn't really nervous. She was more confused as to why they were carrying out these actions than anything else.* - Mon Oct 26 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Or.. just your top, really. - Mon Oct 26 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Whichever you prefer. - Mon Oct 26 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) turned to look at the man with a confused look on her face. She wasn't entirely sure why he'd make such a request and she felt the need to reject him harder than a puerto rican trying to get a loan, but she also had a sense of curiosity as to what this massage was. She was assuming what he was trying to do now was also what he'd done to Chi before she originally arrived. That may explain why he was trying to hide something.

She'd humor him for now; she never really saw what the big deal in hiding everything was about anyways. It only took a few moments for the girl to remove what remained of her already stripped down clothing. Her features remained completely hidden by the water they resided in, but her panties remained intact.

"What do you want now?"

she asked in a rather low tone as the feeling sat in for her. All the while she was physically standing against the flow of the water to keep from drifting back to shore. This was a physical task that taxed her stamina ever so slightly as time moved on.* - Mon Oct 26 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl had absolutely no clue as to what was going on. The man had approached her, which reactively caused her to tense up. She was expecting a surprise punch, or something of that nature. Her body was ready for a fight in the water, or something. It made sense for training considering that it'd be hard to move in the water and create an enviroment harder than one she'd ever fight in.

Instead; however, he gently grasped her thigh and placed her leg around his body. This caused her to pivot slightly and to also reactively lean into him ever so slightly. She was completely confused by the gesture, but didn't stop him simply because it didn't really feel bad.

She couldn't deny that she liked the feeling. It was simply electrifying as the man's hand glided lightly across her boob, but he was also lucky she wasn't around her period otherwise she'd of been sore and probably slapped the shit out of him. 

As his hand made it's way to her nipple the girl allowed an inaudible moan to escape her lips. Her hand wrapped around his body and began to softly rub the lower side of his back. It was honestly quite awkward due to her inexperience, but it -may- feel nice(?)* - Mon Oct 26 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) another moan escaped the girl's lips  as she was basically being taken by the elder shinobi. She had no idea why, but this was happening and she didn't possess the will power to make it stop. It just felt -too- good despite the voice in the back of her head telling her she should finish it. That she should withdraw before it was too late. To go before the path is irreversible. 

She was alerted to the feeling of his opposite hand trailing down her stomache. Every portion of her body he touched left the urge to be touched there again. She couldn't help herself; she was losing it. She was failing the battle to make it stop and giving in to her more primal urges. The urges that kept her race as a whole in tact.

"Grasp my breasts like a man if you're gonna do it."

she finally stated through clenched lips. The hand that once resided along the man's backside made it's way toward the front. Oh my; he seemed to be quite excided by the situation. The girl smirked; as much was to be expected and she would've been upset if it was any less. A single finger trailed across the cloth that covered his length, teasing it.* - Mon Oct 26 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) awakened momentarily after the event had taken place. At first she wondered if everything that had happened had just been a dream, or if there was more to it. A single eye opened and took in her surroundings. She was stripped down to her panties on a beach. Sounds like she had been to a hell of a party the night before if not for her ability to remember everything that happened. 

Her eyes met the figure that had caused the entire sequence of events to happen in the first place. That man rested directly south of her and seemed to be watching her caringly. She somewhat felt differently toward him following the events, but didn't put much thought or focus into this,

"So that was the massage...?"

she asked, wondering what his response may be.* - Mon Oct 26 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Not really. I expected a 2 minute massage. Not that...that was most certainly...different. - Mon Oct 26 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) got dressed and rode home with a caravan. She climed in back so they'd be off. (+2 points for this ref?)* - Mon Oct 26 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Did you want to do that spar? - Tue Oct 27 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: No. - Tue Oct 27 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Oh.. - Tue Oct 27 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. He approached me last night wanting to spar, but I had to turn him down because I was going to bed. - Tue Oct 27 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Ah. - Tue Oct 27 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Seems like he's dozing off. - Tue Oct 27 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Looks like it. - Tue Oct 27 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The name is Heiwa, and sure. Where do you want to do it? - Tue Oct 27 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Doesn't matter to me. - Tue Oct 27 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Do you want me to hold back, or not? - Tue Oct 27 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Don't hold back. - Tue Oct 27 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) directed a blank gaze in the direction of her opponent. A piercing yellow gaze sized him up to be quite a bit smaller than herself. This meant he was also most likely younger which played a lot to her advantage in the spar. She didn't really want to be known for beating a child, but it was customary in her village to not hold back when challenged. She'd show no mercy on the battlefield even to those lesser than her. The small wooden sword even gave the kid an arguable advantage over her in terms of straight up fighting.

She assumed a fairly basic stance. Her hands were placed infront of her body with her right slightly before her left. One was more for offense while the other served a mainly defensive purpose in the case of being caught in a pinch. After taking the time to remove a few of her bangs from her eyes she motioned for the boy to come.

Every fibre in her body was prepared for his assault. Adrenaline began to course through her veins in immediate response to the anticipation she felt for the situation. This was her first fight outside of her best friend, and she'd do her best ot not end up losing. That on top of the fact that she was facing off against a six year old...that'd be pretty embarassing to lose for both her and her clan,

<Show me your moves...>* - Tue Oct 27 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) observed the boy as he made his approach. It turned out that he was actually of a lower skill than she currently was. This was quick shocking considering that she was the hard definition of average if you take away being able to take hits and stamina. She remained ever patient for the boy to approach her, but it became clear that she needed to give him a hand in closing the distance. 

As a result the girl paced forward slightly before reforming her stance. She parked herself in such a position that he could close the distance between both him and herself in the next moment. Now all she could really do was wait. Wait to see what he would do with his wooden sword. Wait for the spar to officially begin with the first exchange of blows.

She wouldn't be able to test her strength most likely, but she wasn't going to go for a quick win. She'd take her time and perhaps even work to improve his confidence and offer him a chance to learn a few of the flaws in his technique at an early stage before worse habits snowballed from the original issue,

<Come on...>* - Tue Oct 27 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to watch the boy up until the final moment in his approach. He'd seemed to choose to come at her from an angle. That gave him the advantage of reach and also potentially allowed him to put more power behind his attack. It was quite a nice strategy the girl concluded, but unfortunately he was going to be met with the reality of the situation. Even if the girl wasn't very skilled; her at base was enough to keep up with the movements of the boy. A slight smirk manifested upon her face when the boy went for a cross-body swipe.

She intended to use her advantage of perception, and anticipation to avoid the strike by moving backwards with her superior speed. In immediate reaction she'd step into him once again, but this time her entire body was thrown into the air. This left her defenseless if he could react, but she put her money on him being to slow to react when she came at him with a sweeping kick aimed to strike him up high.

<Will you attempt to dodge, or block?> 

she questioned the boy within her mind. There was one correct answer, but she wondered if he'd pick the right one.
* - Tue Oct 27 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) smiled slightly when she had managed to land the first part of the kick, but failed the second portion when his almost unreal reflexes considering his age kicked in. She found herself completely defenseless to the incomming strike from her enemy and braced for impact. The sword hit and she flinched, but reopened her eyes after realizing that the strike barely hurt. There was no way he was holding back,

<Small and quick, but lacks strength. He'll be pretty scarey when he hones his craft more finely. Wonder how he'll handle the damage dealt by my first kick though?>

The girl once again arose from the water where she had fallen and turned to face the boy once again. Since he had higher reflexes she decided it'd be best for her to allow him to close the distance, but make the first move since she got a natural advantage in reflex that way. IT surely wouldn't bridge the gap between the two, but it may at leat make things a little more interesting,

"Come."* - Tue Oct 27 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) moved directly toward the boy. She had noted that his reflexes were higher than hers and that she probably couldn't beat him based on reaction alone. Her greatest advantage lied within the strength of her build be it her durability, or just overall strength. She smirked when he revealed his striking pattern as a plan had already been formulated within her head. 

It was quite simple, really. She knew he was too quick to dodge and strike; so she'd have to choose one or the other. If she dodged she wouldn't be able to hit him and it'd prolong the fight. She probably had more stamina, but if she didn't dodge she'd be able to strike him. He'd take more damage from her strike than her from his, and if she dodged there wasn't a guarentee that his strike would actually miss it's mark despite her efforts. She wasn't exactly the most quick on her feet.

This pretty much settled the question of how her next course of action should be carried out. She stepped forward, something that ma be unexpected, and allowed the boy's strike to land. At the same moment she launched an attack of her own. It came in the form of a simple punch that carried the majority of her body weight behind it.

She put everything she had into this strike, even throwing her foot forward. It was meant to make impact with the kid's face at the same moment his strike made impact with her center effectively making the two trade blows between one another. 

She'd instantly react to a sharp pain in her gut. Taking a direct hit from anyone using any kind of weapon would hurt at least a little; even if it was a six year old weilding a wooden sword. As soon as the trade was over she'd take a few steps back if the kid was hit, if she was hit she'd do something else.

<Slow to apporach, but fast to react. Very impressive for his age.>* - Tue Oct 27 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl's attack went as she had planned it to. She smiled; noting that sometimes in order to win you simply have to be unpredictable, Especially when against more intelligent opponets who favor anticipating moves rather than reacting to them on the spot. She'd immediately make her way to where the sword had fallen into the water and retrieve it before it had sunk too deeply into the pond and was rendered irrecoverable.

With the sword in hand she'd give it a few playful swings, but didn't really favor the feel of the sword in her hand. It just wan't her thing she supposed. She'd slowly make her way over to the small child who was now lying on the ground a few steps away from her. She honestly felt kind of bad about hitting him so hard now that she was seeing the result. The strike he had landed stung slightly, but she was mostly able to just shake it off. 

She'd flash a genuine smile that showed off her perfectly straight, white teeth. Yellow eyes descended to meet those of the boy's as she spoke in an upbeat, and even slightly more high pitched tone.

"You gotta be careful anticipating so much. Sometimes opponents will play that card to their advantage and do something that isn't neccesarily the best move overall, but is the best situationally due to you tunneling on another move. That in turn will allow them an upper hand on you in combat and could even cause you, or a squad you made a plan for's life/lives."

After her small lecture the girl extended her right hand forth aiming to give the small child a hand back up to his feet. If he accepted she'd give him a comforting pat on the head before continuing to praise him while giving constructive criticism to help him with his training in the future,

"Your reflexes are great, along with your ability of perception. You may want to work on your actual speed a little bit so you can close distances faster against ranged opponents. Your strength is also lacking and probably worth some work, but you must also consider that when you use a real sword it won't require too horribly much strength to do a good amount of damage. Overall I think you have a very promising future."

When she finished she'd made her way back across the pond and stop in the middle. She wanted to get some practice in with her kicking jutsu and thus she proceeded to perform a high kick followed by a swift low kick. The high was more like of a feint, while the low was clearly the one that packed the most punch. The technique was clearly what the boy had been subjected to previously in their spar.

"Gotta work hard to gain hard. If you can work on that and maybe even pick up a few supplementary jutsu to compliment your style; you can most certainly go far. Just remember that you can grow stronger every day and strive. The best are only the best temorarily and every empire that rises eventually falls.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) simply nodded in response to his acknowledgement. She noticed that the boy was watching her training, but it didn't really matter to her. The technique the girl was using was a one shot wonder; something that usually wouldn't work twice on the same opponent. If he could gain something by watching what he already knew then she figured there was no reason in holding back.

She continued to kick the air. With every attempt it was actually apparent that she was becoming more aquainted with the movements of the technique. They grew more crisp and accurate with each repitition. It was begining to become obvious just how much stamina the girl possessed as well. She'd just done three missions, had training with some stranger from another village, completed a spar, and was now training the technique she had learned from the stranger. 

It was quite amazing, really. As the girl continued to repeat the technique she began to progressively grow more and more bored of it. She had by no means mastered it, but was quickly burning out on her practice for the day. She completed it about ten times before she finally decided to call it temporarily. She turned to ask,

"Do you have any pointers for me? Notice any flaws in my strategy that I could work to overcome? What do you think is a vital point for me to focus on in my training? What did you see as a hole in my overall performance? Was there anything you could immediately take advantage of?" 

The girl finished her barrage of questions before making her way back across the pond via utilizing chakra at the base of her feet. Once again within a reasonable distance she'd cross her arms and await his answer to her questions as they were asked.* - Tue Oct 27 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) heard the announcement made by the mizukage and thus sprung straight into action. Without wasting as much as a mere milisecond to think her entire body pivoted on one foot to turn a complete one-eighty and she began to make her way toward the academy which just so happened to be on the complete opposite side of the village from which she resided,

"Damnet."

On her way to the academy she noticed an elderly woman trying to carry her groceries up a flight of stairs. The young shinobi simply couldn't pass by such a struggle and not offer her aid. This took her several moments and more than likely made her late to the meeting. Nonetheless she eventually arrived and offered her apology,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl completely ignored the man who had arrived. In fact it seemed as though she did everything within her power to stay away from him. Perhaps something unfavorable had taken place between them that she'd wish to forget alltogether. Regardless the entire situation was completely awkward for her now. 

Once away from the academy courtyard the girl opened the first of three scrolls she'd been handed for missions. As per usual she was expecting some dumb request that seemed to only really seemed to carry two purposes; to pad the village's mission completion rate and to keep her from being too horribly bored. 

Unfortunately the second part of the two drove the girl to complete them and thus help the village with the first. The rewards weren't honestly much to brag about. The yen offered was lower than she could make by simply sitting around and taking her shinobi salary. That at least seemed to be what most of the people around her seemed to do which in turn snowballed the first problem. Maybe if the village offered better rewards and less trivial missions they wouldn't have to issue as many to the few that did complete them due to everyone taking part and actively contributing to the mission completion rate.

The first scroll contained details that instructed her to clean up trash around the village. This mission in particular interested her simply because it was the first one she'd taken after becoming a genin. She remembered feeling like she was actually a part of something when she first completed it. Like she was actively contributing to her village; actually helping thouse out fighting by giving them a clean place to return to.

That was different now; she'd come to the realization that the amount of trash that accumulated overtime simply couldn't be taken care of by the efforts of the occasional genin. Even if she did ten times the required amount of trash collection; she'd most likely fail to put a dent in the trash that loomed on the ground throughout the village.

First she made her way to the academy courtyard. The younger children were either nasty, or simply didn't know what a trash can was. Throughout the playground alone she was able to fill up five bags with trash. It was almost as if they made an effort to litter the ground. She collected things ranging from milk cartons to shinobiman magazines. She always winced when she caught the occasional picture of smut on the occasional cover, or ripped out picture. She never understood how seeing females naked allowed men to do their thing. 

Putting that whole experience behind her the girl next made her way to the restauraunt. Nobody seemed to care for what they did with the take out containers after there was no food left. This in turn made it easy to complete bags she had left to fill thanks to the larger size of the trash she'd collect. After only a few minutes of running around and grabbing trash she'd successfully accumulated and delt with ten bags around the village.

She opened the next scroll and read that she had to deliver flowers to the contact's lover. This made her feel a bit of jealousy for the female she hadn't realised existed until now. She wished someone cared about her enough to send her flowers, but for the most part her dedication to her duties as a shinobi prevented her from meeting such a person. The only people that even had a reasonable chance were those she regularly communicated with as a part of her shinobi career and even then she had no particular interest in anyone.

Without really hesitating the girl made her way across the village and quickly located the female in question. She made her way over to the female before nudging her on the shoulder. When the female turned the girl was actually amazed by the beauty she possessed. The girl wasn't lesbian, but she could clearly tell why someone would want to send this woman flowers. The proportions of her face, her perfect hair that seemed to defy gravity. Even the grace with which she moved added to the overall attraction of the female now before here,

"Amazing..."

the girl thought to herself. She would have been jealous if she hadn't been raised the way she was. She accepted beauty for what it was, but it wasn't exactly what she aimed for. She wished to have someone send her flowers because she wanted somone to love her for who she was; not how she looked. Beauty always fades eventually, but the character of a person remains forever. That's why she wished to be sent flowers...if someone loved her for her character then the possibility of them being tied together for life became present.

Instead of singing; the girl left as soon as she announced who had sent the flowers. She opened the third scroll and realised that she had another gruesome task to complete. Another dog had been observed attacking villagers viciously. She had killed one the day prior that was out causing trouble via attacking villagers. This was truly sad, and she knew she had to take care of the dog as quickly as possible in order to prevent greater action being taken against stray dogs by the village. This was sure to give them a bad rep, but the girl knew they weren't all bad.

She rushed as quickly as she could across the village and located the dog in question. This time the dog was busy tearing into some nearby trash which meant the girl benefitted from the element of surprise in the encounter. She inched forward before she was in suitable range to get in a little practice with a technique she'd been taught. It had to be altered to fit the dog's height, but she assumed it'd be suitable in dealing with it.

She started by rushing at the dog, but threw her body into the air at the last moment in a spinning motion. A single kick was directed toward the dog's head. As soon as the foot was in range the dog suck it's fangs into the girl's foot. This went directly with the girl's plan. She proceeded to rip her foot out, and use the force created from the impact to throw her body into a second, lower kick. The second kick carried enough force to render the dog out of commision. 

The image of the lifeless dog the girl was greeted by as soon as she rose truly broke her heart, but what had to be done had to be done. As she had before she took the now lifeless dog into her hands and began to make her way back across the village in what could best be described as an encumbered jog of sadness.

As she made her way across the village she was met by questioning eyes of the civilans. She understood that the average joe probably wouldn't be able to make sense as to why a thirteen year old girl would have any business carrying a dead dog across the village, but the looks still hurt and only acted to increase the overall weight of the action in the girl's heart.

Once back to her kage's presence she provided the corpse of the dog to the kage and accepted her cash reward for the mission. A simple nod was offered to the kage before she turned to exit the area. She had immediate training to do and wanted to tackle it as quickly as possible.* - Wed Oct 28 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way over to the trainign ground she favored using when she wished to train alone. It was rare for her to visit it considering that she rarely ever trained alone and only really did when she wanted to practice something she wished to keep hidden from the general populance. This generally meant she planned on training something that may one day prove as a trump card in a life or death situation. 

That wasn't what she was doing today; however, she simply felt the need to return to her roots and train in a more primal way outside of sparing, or using the same technique repetitively. She made her way to the center of the area where a single tree stood tall. Through inspection she quickly made out that the only damage done to the bark of the tree was from that of her own punches and kicks.

This allowed her to deduct that nobody else had utilized this location other than her. With that deduction she came to two answers: nobody had felt the need to use the spot, or the one she hoped: nobody had found the spot yet. If it was the later rather than the former then the chance of her being walked in on during her training was diminished, if it was the former than the chance existed, but was still quite low due to the distance between the spot and the areas that saw the most traffic.

After taking a few moments to stretch and complete the neccesary preperations the girl strode over to the bark. First she laid a single punch into the tree. The contact of her fist with the tree resonated throughout the area before swiftly resounding as a result of her second blow being delivered. This continued to repeat for several hours before the girl began to feel the effects of this training in her arms. The bark of the tree slightly diminished from her work out, but she didn't possess the strength to deal any real damage to it even through intense repitition.

Next the girl moved on to working out her legs. She procced to deliver a swift horizontal kick to the log, and followed it up with another. This again continued for several hours before she began to feel tired. The kicks had more of an effect on the log, but ultimately met the same fate as the punches. She simply couldn't kick hard enough to crush the bark to the extent that it'd begin to break. It was good because she could train more without having to move, but also bad because it meant she was still weak for the most part. At least in comparison to other shinobi of her specialization.

After she had kicked the log to her heart's content the girl took a few moments to rest. This was primarily for her mentally, not physically. She'd never really found her physical limit through mere training, or even fighting alone. Not even with the emplyoment of the technique she wished to practice to wrap up the training session. It was the primary reason she wished to isolate herself from any other person for the training of this technique in particular. She wished to keep it completely hidden from knowledge and doubted if she'd ever need it.

To complete the first step of the technique, the girl crossed her fists and began to focus on the eight major chakra points that were scattered throughout her body. The first one was known as the gate of opening, and basically removed her brain's natural restriction on her muscles. This allowed her to use all of her muscles to their full extent, but carried the risk of tearing them through expansive use. Nothing happened to her physical appearence, but mentally she knew she had succeded. She released the technique and exited the area to follow. She was more than happy with the results.* - Wed Oct 28 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way to the Mizukage's place. She had one goal clearly on her mind at the given moment and that was to be given and to complete her three missions she was called upon to do daily. They were usually the most basic of missions; earning the rank of E. They possessed little to no danger during their completion, and the girl was able to make easy work of most of them. The rewards were minimal, but she assumed they'd help her to gain experience as a shinobi and to perhaps gain the favor of the mizukage if she established herself as a consistant hard worker in the village. Through the missions she felt she was able to accurately show her dedication to the village via performing many tasks that'd be more fit for a small child rather than a shinobi. Despite the lack of difficulty in the tasks; however, she could honestly feel her own skill increasing throughout the tasks. She was growing stronger every day even if it wasn't immediately obvious.

Upon voicing her request she was given three scrolls which contained detailed objectives that she must complete in order to suceesfully pass the mission. This completion was then tallied into the mission stats of the village, and counted as a check for her in the mizukage's book. She was also given a smaller cash reward, but it was less than the girl simply made sitting around. God she was beginning to repeat herself in thought now...perhaps she should get onto the mission at hand.  A single hand was placed upon the opening of the scroll. She hesitated for a few moments; there was absolutely no anticipation for what laid within. She knew it would be some stupid task that'd probably result in nothing and have to be done again the next day. She even yawned before actually opening the scroll.

The first one was the same as several before it. She was instructed to locate a missing cat that had once again escaped the crazy cat lady. She began to question where the crazy cat lady got so much money. Even if the girl herself didn't make much, she knew the village held out at least ninety perfect of the proceeds from her. She'd already completed this mission two times prior, which really added up. The crazy cat lady must have a fairly consistant job, or simply have nothing else to spend her money on. The girl concluded this from how much mone she spent on her cat alone. A cat that didn't even like her. One that ran away almost every day and required someone else to catch and find.

Immediately the girl made her way toward the last area the cat had been spotted. Along the way she came across a group of children who seemed to be highly interested in her headband. They all crowded her and begged her to show them one of her shinobi techniques. She couldn't simply let them down, but she also lacked anything extremely flashy. She had to at least try to impress them with a show of taijutsu. She'd managed to hone one of her two techniques decently, but the other one still had a long way to go before she was completely confident in her ability to consistantly perform it on a high level without exhausting her stamina more than it needed to be. Regardless she saw it as a decent opportunity to train her ability.

She quickly located a tree that'd be suitable as the target for her attack. With the group of children watching she tightened her headband before exclaiming, "Now watch closely!" the girl exclaimed before accelerating into a full-fledged sprint. Once the majority of the distance between both herself and the tree was covered she launched herself into the air and extended her right foot. BOOM! Her foot made contact with the tree and caused several leaves to fall from the upper portion of it. The girl recoiled backwards, but managed to stick the landing following the technique. A bow was offered to the crowd before she turned to face the trunk once more. All of the children wanted an encore it seemed and she'd be just the girl to give them one.

This time she took off at the tree, but only at a slight jog. This technique was also sort of new for her, but she had far more confidence in her ability to perform it and showed no hesitation in showing it off. Once the distance between both her and the tree was short enough to reasonably initiate the technique; she sprung from her feet and threw her body into a twisting motion while airborne.

Her foot extended mid air and was thrown high into the tree's trunk. It was notable that this kick didn't contain much power and that the girl immediately utilized the force pressed against her foot by the tree in response to the kick to throw her body into an opposite motion. This led to her striking the tree once again with her opposite foot at a lower angle. A loud BANG resounded through the area while the girl remained low to the ground following the technique.

This ability led to the children cheering considerably louder than for the previous one. It made sense the girl reasoned, it was the flashier of the two even if they shared the same ranking. She couldn't undersell the value of either; however, as they both proved to play a large situation part of her aresnal. Dynamic entry was great for catching opponents off guard and allowing her to get the first strike in; whereas Twister was better for winning an exchange in blows. It didn't work more than once on the same opponent most of the time, but it usually guarentee'd her at least one free hit after a fight had already begun. That one hit had made a large impact in one of the spars the girl had been in. It was also the mental game of them being afraid of her repeating her actions. Overall both assisted her in keeping her opponents on their toes in combat which in turn didn't allow them to get comfortable as the situation rapidly evolved around them.

After the girl had finished showing off in front of the children she was pleasantly surprised by what happend next. The cat she had been previously searching for jumped from the tree and landed on her shoulder. It seemed to be acting in a way that signified that it had given up. She guessed it had thought her attacks on the tree were directed at it, but in reality she didn't even know it resided there. It was a true two birds with one stone situation that allowed the girl to bypass the tedious process of actually searching for the cat throughout the village. This inturn caused a small grin to manifest across her face. 

She reached into her pocket to withdraw her second scroll. This one contained details of the mission she personally hated the most. She didn't know why, but she just hated the idea of sweeping the steps of the kage mansion. So many people passed through the mansion that the steps were pretty much cursed to always be dirty. The results of her tedious sweeping were generally wiped away only moments after she finished such a task. It was still a task that had been given to her at random; however, so she pretty much had no choice other than to do it. Sometimes she wondered if she could request swapping out missions, but never really worked up the courage to ask. She felt like it was in a way undermining the mizukage even -if- they were given the missions completely at random.

After making her way across the village at a brisk pace the girl quickly located a broom that had been convieniently left for her to work with. She took the broom into her hand and began to sweep the steps that cascaded around the entrance to the mansion. She started from the tip top and began to work. It seemed like only a few moments before she'd finished up the first steps and moved onto the second. The task wasn't hard, but it was most certainly time consuming for her. There were at least twenty steps in front of the building and the motion of moving the broom quickly began to beat into the girl's head.

The constant rhythm of the sweeping; however, granted the girl serenity in a way. It was always present, and never changed. It made the world around her fade momentarily and caused her to enter would could only really be described as a sedated state. Sweeping was something she had to do at an early age. It never changed and even when she was younger she'd always fall into this state. She didn't like sweeping overall, but being in this sedative state could be nice every now and then.

It allowed her to escape the reality with which she wa faced. To enter her own plane and to only see what she wished. Several faces flashed in this plane; some she recognised and some she did not. It seemed almost as if the ones she did not recognise were ones she was destined to meet. That situation had happened earlier at the gate when she passed the woman known as Marissa. She'd never saw her before, but she never forgot a face. The face of that female seemed like that of a long lost friend. She was quite sure given where they were mutually from that she'd never met that person before, but she'd saw that face in her visions at least once. It was surreal. She didn't know whether to believe it was real, or give in to the thought that she may be going crazy, or even just imagining things.

Maybe she was giving herself a false sense of reality. Maybe she only felt like she saw the face beforehand because she wanted to. Maybe it was all in her mind. She had been told that seeing the future through visions and such was all a myth. All just mind games, but they seemed to real. It was possible she was fooling herself by believing they were real when they didn't. Just as a magician leads people to believe their magic is real. It isn't because the magic is truly real, but that the person they're showing their trick is willing to accept that the trick is real. That they're willing to look past any kind of logical explanation and automatically sell the trick away to magic. 

Throughout this track of thought the girl only came back to reality to the sound of her broom scraping across concrete rather than the smoothed stone the steps were made out of. She smiled upon gaining the knoweldge that she had indeed finished the task as it was assigned to her and quickly drew the third and final mission scroll from her pocket. Her hands were tingling with anticipation. Anticipation not from what the next task may be, but because of the fact that she could now see the light at the end of the tunnel. She was nearly finished with this daily grind she'd now subjected herself to routinely. That grind being the missions she knew all too well now.

She was relieved to see that the final mission was one of the most simple and quick ones. She simply had to run to the gate and pick up a letter then return it to the contact. As quickly as she read the scroll the girl was off and on her way to the gate. It was another sunny day in Kirigakure and everything seemed to be beaming with life. Something quite different than things were when she first gone. It was beginning to seem like things were genuinely looking up for the village. They were rising from the ashes of previous failure like a phoenix. She was a part of the generation that she hoped would prove capable of aiding her village in it's rise to being one of the true greats.

After several moments of running the girl arrived at the main gate and was able to quickly locate the courier whom which had been waiting for her. He asked why it had taken her so long to arrive for the letter after she was sure the mission had been handed out. The answer to which the girl explained in a rather embarrassed tone,

"Uh...sorry. This one kind of took the last priority. I had to sweep the steps of the mansion. That took me several minutes. Then I had to locate a missing cat, but during my search I ran into a crowd of kids whom asked me to show them some of the techniques I had picked up as a shinobi. I decided to humor them via performing a couple against a nearby tree. It was then that the cat that I had been looking for fell from the tree into my arms. After that I opened this scroll and made my way over here."

The courier simply nodded, almost in disbelief of the girls story. He didn't really care in the long run. His task was accomplish and he dissappeared in a blur of speed. The girl was sure he had more people to deliver to and was only thankful that he had actually waited on her. It would of been extremely embarassing to fail an e rank mission simply because she had gotten lost in thought while sweeping and chosen to show off in front of a few kids.

The travel back to the mizukage took little to no time at all. She found herself before him with the three scrolls each marked as completed. She'd present them and await her reward. As soon as it was given to her she offered a bow to the mizukage and took off. Once a decent distance away from the group of people she withdrew a couple scrolls from her back pouch and began to read them each,

"Man this woman didn't give me anything I could really use, but I guess learning these can't hurt."

the girl thought to herself as she flipped through several pages. She learned pretty slow, but given the time she had to dedicate to the scrolls she'd manage to learn them all before moving on to her next task.* - Wed Oct 28 21:17:00 2015
