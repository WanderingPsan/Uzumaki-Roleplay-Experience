<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So. . What's the plan now Ortho? - Wed Oct 28 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have a plan to put Vessul to full use. - Wed Oct 28 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: oh? Do tell. - Wed Oct 28 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll personally fund him in his efforts. I'll buy enough weaponry and armory to give the Shinobi World no reason to contact the Gezo. - Wed Oct 28 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From there, I'll locate a few tailors and fund them in their efforts. - Wed Oct 28 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And the same thing for the Vessul, I'm doing for the tailors. - Wed Oct 28 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . I am a Tailor. .  - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I know. - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: but. . WHat are you funding? - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But.. I don't want to put you in danger- - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I see. .  - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, quite frankly, I'm looking to put the Gezo out of business. - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Detach the shinobi world from them. - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's a Dangerous goal. - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Exactly why I didn't.. burden.. you with the task. - Wed Oct 28 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I see. . Well. . Alright - Wed Oct 28 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Either of you saw the mizu? - Wed Oct 28 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Apart from that, I've just been train- - Wed Oct 28 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Last I saw, she was in front of the Academy. - Wed Oct 28 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Anywho. .  - Wed Oct 28 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Enjoy your training my love. .  - Wed Oct 28 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am going to go to Konoha and then return hom.  - Wed Oct 28 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: After speaking with the Mizukage - Wed Oct 28 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Did she just call him love...? Interesting... - Wed Oct 28 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: good bye young one. . - Wed Oct 28 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Train hard - Wed Oct 28 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yup. - Wed Oct 28 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi, you awake? - Wed Oct 28 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. - Wed Oct 28 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Just looking for the mizukage so I can report my completion of those darn missions. - Wed Oct 28 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Why? - Wed Oct 28 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Free to talk before you do? - Wed Oct 28 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sure. - Wed Oct 28 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Here? A few feet away..? - Wed Oct 28 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Wonder what he wants...? - Wed Oct 28 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. - Wed Oct 28 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe somwhere more private? - Wed Oct 28 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: If you think anything like before may happen, you're sadly mistaken. - Wed Oct 28 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That.. wasn't my intentions, but your words haven't fallen on deaf ears. - Wed Oct 28 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Just making sure that was clear. What else could it be? - Wed Oct 28 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: About the subject, but the reenactment isn't my intentions. - Wed Oct 28 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I can probably assume what then,  lover. - Wed Oct 28 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Shall we get going then? - Wed Oct 28 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd prefer doing it here. Nobody is around. - Wed Oct 28 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, you're right. - Wed Oct 28 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No one. - Wed Oct 28 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways, it's your choice. - Wed Oct 28 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well. About the last time you and I spoke: I did not intend for there to be any.. awkwardness between you and I. - Wed Oct 28 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wanted to assure you that I am not the type to spew your name across the world as someone 'easy'. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And that, despite all that, I do wish for a friendship with you and Chi. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You two show potential, and I wish to invite you two to an organization I am forming. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The details of the organization is what I wanted to discuss in private with you. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Uh huh. Most of that was driven by Chi. I wasn't even sure what was going on the majority of it. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Then let's go. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Yeah, now she wants to talk in private. - Wed Oct 28 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lead the way then. - Wed Oct 28 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) shrugged. She didn't care much for the entire situation as it stood, but she was still a -very- curious person. She possessed such curiosity that could end in her demise some day, but she couldn't really help it. In response to the man she simply shrugged before turning and making her way off from the scene.* - Wed Oct 28 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: followed close pursuit. - Wed Oct 28 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, I'm going to be blunt and honest. - Wed Oct 28 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to destroy this shinobi world and rebuild it with a new ninja system. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to take away all funds that the Gezo makes by helping local Blacksmiths, Armorsmiths and Tailors enhance their business. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to politically and economically destroy the Gezo. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: This sounds familiar. I think he was speaking of it with the girl earlier. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From there, I wish to take each village system and crumble it down to my feet. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: May I ask a question? - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Take out the whole idea that there is a Sunagakure, Kumogakure, Konohagakure and so for- - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What is the Gezo? - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The Gezo Empire and the Gezo's are a mass of higher ups. They are the ones the legal Kages of each main village go to for aid. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Weaponry, Clothing, Food, everything. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to cut that out. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We, as Shinobi, shouldn't resort to going to some freak Empite to aid us. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We should be able to look to our own and trade money for services. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hence why I wish to find a Blacksmith, Armorsmith and Tailor. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Weaponsmith* - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Makes sense. It sounds like they just benefit greatly from us while giving minimal in turn. - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Exactly. - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Once the Gezo Empire has no influence on us, I will then look to politically destroy each village. - Wed Oct 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to eradicate the idea of different villages, and make it all one entire world. - Wed Oct 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm not sure about your final point. I feel like diversity has to exist in the world to some extent. It'd be hard for one body to rule over the entire world. - Wed Oct 28 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Diversity will exist in everyones mindset, that is a given. However, that doesn't require a village being stronger than the next and have the next village afraid to interact with the rest of the world. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sunagakure, right now, is the strongest village. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everyone scurried to Sunagakure when Konoha and Kumo were destroyed. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What's the point in Sunagakure having so much armed forces? - Wed Oct 28 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I feel like maybe cutting down the number, but leaving at least two or three would be the best move. That way trade can still exist. Equality needs to be present as well. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Trade can still be made, but at a country level. - Wed Oct 28 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So much focus has been put on individual villages, that the remaining country have been neglected. - Wed Oct 28 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Take out these villages, expand the shinobi across their respective country. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow them to explore and enhance their will from a young age.. that way heartache is lessened in the future. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The more you experience at a young age, the less likely are you to be the next 'villian' of the shinobi world. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's always the shinobi that experience heartache when they're big and strong that end up destroying things. - Wed Oct 28 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Perhaps, but do you really think all combat can be abolished? - Wed Oct 28 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course not. Diversity will still exist, but a higher level of understanding will also be made. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Understanding leads to sincerity. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sincerity leads to compassion - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Compassion leads to love. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Love leads to true peace. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Love leads to betrayal. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: In some cases... - Wed Oct 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I can not deny that, for it is a factor in some cases. - Wed Oct 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But if the love was real, then even the mistake of betrayal could be forgiven and worked through. - Wed Oct 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Perhaps. Honestly i'm willing to give your idea a shot, but I can't deny my skepticism. If I join your organization what will my duties entail? - Wed Oct 28 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well. I wish to sway your mind from the fact that I intend to only use you for sexual purposes. I find you attractive, yes, but business is business. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: In turn, I will continue to hunt down a Taijutsu specialist and have them train you. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No matter the cost. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish for you to keep me updated on your progression wants and needs, I will see to it that they're met. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What do you want from me in turn? - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Loyalty. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just to know that any information you get about this organization stays within this organization. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Fair enough. - Wed Oct 28 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I am able to place a Fuuinjutsu seal on you, but I wish to give you the benefit of the doubt before I resort to that. - Wed Oct 28 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd probably rather not know what that seal entails. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I've read about some of those things...they're pretty formidable. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The hinderous of you speaking information. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: In any way, shape or form. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's what I figured. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So I must ask... - Wed Oct 28 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Why me? I'm just a freshly promoted genin with little to no skill in anything. - Wed Oct 28 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That goes back to what I said before. Allow people to experience the true shinobi life at a young age, then later in their life they'll be prepared for everything. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not only that, as I stated earlier as well, I see potential in you. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: How large do you intend on making this organization? - Wed Oct 28 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A handful. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe four or five. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's small. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Counting Chi and I that's three others... - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd assume your girlfriend is in. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: SO that's one other... - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The anbu member you were with earlier? - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not allowing Marrisa to join the organization. - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like I said, this is strictly business. - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh? - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doing business with loved ones and family will result in destruction. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I do not know the ANBU Agent from before. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I met him when I found you in front of the Academy courtyard. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I see. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Also, once again, I wish for there not to be any.. awkardness.. between you and I. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What happened after the training the other day will stay between you and myself.. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Should probably stop brining it up then. - Wed Oct 28 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Marrisa knows of- - Wed Oct 28 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well then, forgive me. - Wed Oct 28 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, that is is all I had to talk about. - Wed Oct 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What does she know of? - Wed Oct 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What happened between you and I. - Wed Oct 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's nice. - Wed Oct 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I openly told her. The truth and all. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Probably why she always gave me that look. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She thought you and I had intercourse, I assured her that we didn't. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No penetration, in any form, was made. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl curiously made her way over to the water  directly behind the elder shinobi. She closely observed his utilization of the jutsu that she sought to learn; taking pretty much every detail down within her head as it was performed ranging from the handseals to the actual use application of the jutsu. It seemed to be fairly simple; she'd use her suiton chakra to create a magnetic force for the water to form around. This allowed her to create a makeshift prison in the water.

As soon as the elder shinobi's demo of the jutsu the girl attempted it on her own. She performed the string of handseals that had previously been shown to her. Once complete she allowed chakra to flow from her hand into the water, aiming to shape it before her. She managed to get this far, but the water didn't actually shape in reaction to her chakra. Instead a small amount of water was released from her mouth in reaction to the expellation of her chakra,

<Oops...that's the wrong technique...let's try this again.>

Once again the girl completed the handseals as they were shown before allowing her own chakra to flow into the water. This time the water began to rise and shape to her will. The girl was close, but it was to no merit. The water thereafter fell back to it's original form. It was clear to be a tough technique for the girl to pick up. She'd have to close out the world around her and purely focus on the task at hand. Only then could she possibly complete the technique given her current mastery over suiton; which was very underwhelming to say the least.

For the final time the girl closed her eyes and allowed herself to enter a state of complete relaxation. She loomed within the darkness of her mind, and envisioned the elder shinobi as he performed the technique originally. From the seals to the actual execution she played every detail back to herself in slow motion. Almost immediately she was able to detect her mistake. She sighed, it was pretty simple where she had to gone wrong and it'd be easy to fix.

She reopened her eyes and stared at her reflection in the ocean before her. She attached the vision of Ortho as he performed the technique originally to her own mirror image. After doing so she began to form the handseals he'd shown her. After that she began to focus her chakra, letting it brim. Once she felt prepared she allowed it to flow into the water before her. In reaction to her chakra the water molded to her will. It slowly began to rise and formed into a pressurized sphere of aqua that used her arm as it's focus. After holding it for a few moments she released the technique.

"I guess that's it..."

she stated aloud, before turning to face Ortho. Only then did she notice the small crowd that had formed,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) nodded in response to the female she had just met, but was now going to engage in a spar with. She had no idea what exactly to expect from the girl except that she was most likely strong. That was derived from the fact that she was previously observed carrying a -large- sword around with little to no struggle on her end. That within itself was enough to stir up the Senju's nerves,

<Can I really take her?>

 After her words were spoken the young female sprang into action. Her pace equivilant to what would be expected of your average D rank genin. It was quick enough for her to close most of the distance between her and her oppoent, but not quick enough for her to be confident in making the first move.

She'd slow down a few yards away from the opposite female and assume a basic sparing pose in anticipation for the retailiation that was sure to come from her opposite number. Her piercing yellow gaze locked with that of her opponents. It most likely felt like every single action taken by the female before her was being stored into some type of data base. The young girl did her best to prepare for what was to come no doubt.* - Thu Oct 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Ooooh... Well I'm free right now. - Thu Oct 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi, Takeda. Send a bird when you're done. - Thu Oct 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fine. - Thu Oct 29 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) had been expecting the female to be quick, but she was taken off guard by how little she hesitated with her assault. The speed of her punch was much higher than anything she'd dealt with as well. This was most certainly not a good situation for Mana, but she'd do her best to perservere.

She couldn't react to the strike as it was sent, but she did have her only calling card to back her up; that was her durability. The strike had enough strength behind it to cause a minor amount of pain to the girl, but she was able to shake it off for the most part. 

Following the punch the senju did her best to retaliate in the time it took her to recover from her strike. This retaliation came in the form of a swift kick aimed for the titan's shin. It was pretty primal, but effective if it hit. She' probably most certainly know it was there,

<Outclassed...>* - Thu Oct 29 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Ortheo better have someone to teach me some taijutsu. - Thu Oct 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I need it. - Thu Oct 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Masa is too much in the middle. . .either people can't help her train because they're too weak, or too strong. - Thu Oct 29 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) smiled when her attack found it's mark, but was swiftly met with a dose of reality when it had seemingly no effect on her opponent. She suddenly found herself being lifted from her feet and being tossed back several yards before managing to recompose herself and listen to the female's words as they were spoken. The girl was left without an answer. She'd honestly put basically everything she had into that last attack, and it proved to be completely useless. 

This was clearly painted across her face mixed along with what seemed to be anger. She'd been put into this position by someone who most likely knew that such a difference in power existed between herself and her opponent. With the tools she was given the girl didn't really see how she'd do as much as leave a scratch on her oppoentn, while she herself would most likely be beaten into a pulp if things carried out.

She sighed audibly, before closing her eyes. There wasn't really much of a chance of the fight ending in her favor, so she decided to simply attempt to use it as a learning experience. Maybe she could aid her opponent in learning about the volatility of the people she faces and being prepared to act on the run. Sometimes doing something completely random can work to one's favor. Like using an attack that is meant to be used when undetected blantantly infront of someone and hoping they don't simply destroy you. That could catch someone off guard and give you a heads up if it worke to your favor.

After escaping her mental charade the girl decided she'd do just that. Since there was no chance of winning legitimately she'd attempt to use the few techniques she knew to at least be able to do something to the titan of a woman before her. 

She launched off of her right foot, and almost immediately reached her top speed in the distance between herself and her opponent. Once within a few yards she jumped into the air and extended her right foot outwards, aiming to kick the titan of a female right in the chest(what would normally be someone's face.)  as the kick was delivered the female shouted out at the top of her lungs,

"Dynamic Entry!!!!"* - Thu Oct 29 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl's attack caused the opposing female to slide back a few inches, but the kick didn't pack nearly enough punch to do any real damage to her. This left her in a very vulnerable situation indeed, <I'm going to have a bad time...> the girl thought to herself mere miliseconds before she was grabbed by the titan of a woman. What came next was alien to the female. She was thrown over her body and sent hurling like some sort of human football. She made her impact with the ground several feet on the opposite side of her aggressor.

The girl remained on the ground for a few moments before she eventually rose back to her feet. Her body was in moderate pain where she had landed, but she wouldn't allow this to stop her from pressing on. She never knew when to quit. 

As immediately as the girl rose she'd take off forward once again. Most of her hesitation was gone now that she'd came to peace with the strength of her opponent. She realised that she was completely at the mercy of the titan. That she was fully at the mercy of her opponent at this point. 

Once the distance between the two had been closed the girl sprung from her feet going airborne in a spinning motion. Mid-spin her foot extended outwards and aimed to strike the titan of a female in the same spot her original kick did; however, the first kick was more of a feint than anything.

If the girl did anything but completely dodge the kick; it'd be followed up by a swift second strike that operated off of the recoil generated by the first. The second strike was in the form of a kick directed at the lower portion of the titan's body aimed directly at her feet. The bigger they were the harder they fell and she only hoped she could cause the large woman to topple over on anything besides herself preferably.* - Thu Oct 29 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) smiled at the apparent success of her attack. The girl had absolutely no idea how to follow up the move; however, as she had never expected to get this far. She'd rise to her feet following the successful sweep before backing away from the woman once again. She knew she didn't have the ability to contend with her on the ground. She'd simply be womanhandled by the titan of a female. She had to find another way to deal some sort of damage to the female.

The girl hastily crafted a plan, but it was extremely risky for her to carry out considering her large chakra. She performed a string of handseals and began to allow her chakra to build up within her chest. Within her chest the chakra brimmed and continued to grow. As it grew it made it's way up the girl's throat and eventually to her mouth,

<Water Style: Raging Waves!>

the girl chanted in  her head before expelling a large amount of water from her mouth that sought to sweep throughout the area immediately before her. She made no move other than creating a couple feet worth of water that covered the ground where the two currently resided,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl had completed her jutsu, but wasn't quite ready for the second phase before her opponent had risen from her knocked down state and proceeded to attempt an assault on her. 

The punch to her stomache sent the girl barreling backwards and officially ended the spar for her,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way into the building. She wasn't aware that there was some sort of meeting going on; so she simply stumbled in upon it.  She'd direct a look toward the kage that was mixed with both apologetic and embarassed emotions. She figured since she'd already interrupted the mission she'd go ahead and voice her request before taking her departure from the scene.

"May I have my uhm...missions. I'm sorry to interrupt. Didn't know you were busy."* - Thu Oct 29 21:02:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) closed the door on her way out.* - Thu Oct 29 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) thinks: This bitch weird as fuck. - Thu Oct 29 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Oh it's that girl I was going to kill. - Thu Oct 29 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way out of the kage building as hastily as was possible for the female. She didn't want to spend another second around that stranger that was present within with the Mizukage. Something about him just seemed...off... to her. Something was slipping. The demeanor with which he acted; the way he spoke of taking a life so carelessly. This was something the girl hadn't been subjected to in her life. She figured everyone respected life as the greatest gift to man. That they all respected life for what it was and did all they could to protect it. That fantasy; however, was ripped away by how the spoke. It was clearly evident that he had a large amount of experience in taking lives. 

The words of a stranger was enough to throw her off center. To put her on the ultimate tilt. She simply couldn't wrap her mind around it despite her desperate attempts to do so. Maybe now she could realise the ideology she'd been exposed to. Maybe that stranger was right. Maybe the current system was flawed; maybe it was time to orchestrate a change in the way things were currently handled. The problem with change was that someone had tro start it...had to nourish it. It'd begin as a baby, but through time it'd grow strong. It'd expand and spread it's effects across the general populance upon being cultivated, but to do so meant taking drastic measures. The first action to began this growth would have to be the fall of the last.

The girl sighed audibly after drawing a scroll from her pocket. It was another meaningless mission. She had to complete it, but the vast majority of the reward was taken by the village. She began to wonder if she only lived a life of giving. When she thought about it; almost every action she had ever taken was done in order to give to the village. To give to the kage who quite frankly seemed to sit on her ass all day and simply hand out the tedious missions. The same ones she'd been completing for her entire shinobi career. She'd been offered training once, but it wasn't even in what she showed interest for. It was in something else by someone else. Maybe it was about time for things to change. Maybe it was time for her to start to consider the bigger picture of it all.

A look of aggravation quickly formed upon the girl's face. The only thing she could admit the village did to benefit her was to keep her safe. They had tought her the basics of combat, but nothing that could allow her to keep up with those around her. She felt like she was now standing still. She was lost in the echo of time. Everyone around her was growing stronger through training, but she was left to simply do missions and attempt to gain some sort of physical power through the completion of them. That power wasn't anything compared to what she felt she'd be capable off if she was offered a legitimate teacher; however, it seemed like such a thing was impossible to find with the way things currently stood.

Hope, that is what she had been left to cling to. She could only hope that such a person would eventually show up. It was all she could ever do realistically. This caused her to slowly begin to resent those around her. The ones who seemed to be constantly progressing; the ones that were prospering while she found herself stuck in neutral. She felt used to the maximum extent. She paraded around doing the dumbest of tasks for a village that most likely didn't even value her as a capable member of it's military. She'd even bet that the elder made fun of her when she came in for her daily tasks; that there was a grin hidden behind the mizukage's mask as she tossed her more of her tasks that could be figuratively reffered to as shit. Shit that she'd asked for.

It was a -very- negative trend and thought process for the girl. She was able to safe herself from devling deeper into the chain of resentment for now, but the thought still very clearly loomed in the back of her head. Finally being able to escape her mind the girl opened the first scroll that had been passed to her. Inside were the details that instructed her to pick up trash around the village. Once again she fell into negativity. Her skills were not being used in a manner that'd constructively allow her to grow. She was instead instructed to run around and pick up shit that people litteraly just didn't feel like throwing away. She could never truly grow from this task alone, but she decided it was a time for change. She'd incorporate something into her missions that allowed her to train her abilities. She'd begin to do things in different manners that accomplished the same goal.

Firstly she started off by making her way to an isolated alley way. During her travel she jumped into the air and shot a leg forward. This was training for one of her taijutsu techniques she'd recently picked up. Doing this action allowed her to close the distance between herself and the alley in a slightly quicker manner while also presenting her with an opportunity to practice what she had been tought without any risk of being hurt by an opponent. She eventually slid to a stop after landing from the kick and turned to face the vacant alley that was piled full of trash.

The girl then began to form a string of handseals with her focus wholely set upon the entire alley. Chakra began to manifest and build within the core of her body. After a while the chakra began to flow up her throat and into her mouth. Her cheeks puffed up in response to the large amount of chakra that was actively being manifested within her body before she was finally prepared to fire off the technique,

"Water Style: Raging Waves!"

The girl chanted before expelling a large wave of water before her. The water quickly cascaded forward and filled up the entire alleyway. As it made it's way down the alley it swept up and trash that previously littered the ground. The water eventually came crashing into the ocean that was directly at the end of the alley. All of the trash was swept away by the water and the alley was left spotless for the most part after the stream that was created eventually drained into the ocean. The girl smiled; step one was complete.

Next she needed to find a way to train two more abilities. She drew the second scroll and saw that she was instructed to sweep the steps fo the kage mansion. Something that she loathed and seemed to be getting assigned to every day since the first time she was given it. She decided it'd be in her own best interest to find a method of completing the jutsu in a more constructive way other than how she'd preivously been doing it while still completing the task in such a manner to appease the mizukage. This actually required a decent amount of thought before she'd actually have a plan that she could actually act upon.

The girl finally set off toward the mansion armed with the plan she had formulated. Once she made it across the village she stopped before the large amount of steps that led to the entrance of the mansion. They sure did look daunting from the bottom, but she couldn't give up here. She never had before and never would. In the back of her mind she was a little worried about the chance of her plan not actually working. About the small chance of failrue her tactic left up in the air. It'd all be about execution and she'd succeed as long as she could execute, but unlike regular sweeping it wasn't something that she could simply do. It did require a rather peculiar amount of actions to go just as they needed to in order for things to pan out.

After taking a deep breath the girl made her way to the very top of the stairs. From there she gazed down to the ground, and over every single step. She once again began to form handseals in preparation of what was yet to come. She once again began to form the handseals neccesary to complete the same technique she had previously utilized for the trash mission. It seemed that this jutsu's use outside of combat was far greater to her than in combat, which was quite hilarious ironic she had to admit.

Once again her chakra began to manifest and grow within her chest before making it's way up her throat and into her mouth. Once again she stated the name of the jutsu, "Water Style: Raging Waves!" before a large amount of water was expelled from her mouth and went cascading down the steps of the mansion. The steps were left spotless in the wave of the large wave she had completed, and the mission drew to an end in what was merely a single attempt for the female. Her chakra; however, was left pretty devastated from using that jutsu twice. It was clear she either had to grow a better mastery of it, or expand her chakra pool via training. Either was probably far upon the horizon.

She now drew the final of the three scrolls she had been given. Within this one was another mission she'd familiarized herself with over the span of the past few weeks she had been completing missions. This one instructed her to locate a cat that had gone missing within the village. It came from the same contact as it had the last few times just as the girl had expected. The cat seemed to be an escape artist, or the crazy lady simply didn't watch it all the time. Maybe she just wanted it back on a whim, and it was otherwise left to roam. Maybe she had the shinobi go and find it simply because she was too lazy to do so and had more money than she knew what to do with. This made the girl wonder if she should start her own cat collecting business. It'd cut out the village as a middle man and earn her far more pay for the same task.

She could even recruit other lower ranking shinobi into her forces. She'd offer them a small cut of the pay she recieved, but it'd still be more than the village offered them for the same task. That'd bring them to her and she'd eventually be able to make bank off of the crazy cat ladies. This was a great scheme, but it'd probably never be actually acted on. It was just another pigment of the girl's overly active imagination and ultimately suffered the same fate as everything else she thought of in times like this. It was to be forgotten and never brought up again. Next time she'd think of something else to benefit from the large amount of crazy cat ladies that constantly requested to have their cats returned to their possession by the younger generation shinobi. Of which she was a part of herself.

The girl made her way over to a log. She had to take a quick break from the dumb tasks she'd been subjected to and practice another technique. Her gaze remained locked upon the nearest tree to her after trailing from the beaten path that once she followed through the village. The girl looked up in the tree monetarily, hoping she could luck out again as she did before and chose a tree that the cat already resided within as a training target, but it wasn't that way for her unfortunately.

That didn't deter her from her original plan of action. Piercing white eyes stared through the tree. She mentally prepared to carry out her technique for several moments before finally bending her knees slightly. All at once she lept into the air allowing her body to transition into a spinning motion while using the forward momentum granted by the way she jumped to form a spinning kick in the air.

This kick was directed toward the upper portion of the tree. It didn't carry much force in it's wake, but it served it's purpose. Against an opponent the first kick was the most important part of the technique; so she focused on it the most. She had to get it perfect. Only through getting it perfect could the second part of the technique be carried out at it's maximum power. 

As soon as the first kick landed she utilized all of her strength along with the force exterted upon her foot by the tree in reaction to the kick to reverse the motion in which her body was spinning. Doing so allowed her to enter another kick that was lower this time. It carried much more force than the first and struck at the base of the tree. The sound of her leg making impact created a largely audible, "BANG!" 

The girl slid backwards following the technique and quickly regained her composure. Her body slightly ached from the impact she'd made, but it wasn't enough damage to persist any longer than the span in which it had been created. The girl didn't really care about the pain anyways; it simply allowed her to know that she was gaining. The old saying, "No pain no gain" came to her mind following the action. The technique within itself was much cleaner than before in terms of execution, and the small details were all beginning to come together. It was quite clear that she was mastering it at a considerable pace through repition rather than through being a genius.

She now realligned herself with her original objective. She needed to find that damn cat. She'd already checked the spots she previously found it within, but it wasn't there. She'd have to continue her search for it in places she hadn't spent much time within. This led to her being considerably slowed down due to her unfamiliarity with the enviroment. She'd grown up in Kirigakure, but the village was large enough for her to not be completely familiar with all of the terrain within it. 

She searched for what seemed to be a small eternity before she finally picked up on a hint. There was a completely obliterated ball of yarn in the middle of a trail. It was strung out which was a clear indication that it had been dragged by it's aggressor. This allowed the girl to trace back to the origin of the ball of yarn. Whatever had attacked such a thing was careless in their execution and that gave the entire trick away right of the bat to the girl. She'd make quick work of her investigation and find that the yarn had came from a nearby house.

It was most certainly possible that the perpetrator had entered the house once again in search of more victoms to it's reign of terror. The girl silently made her own entrance. She quickly found that the house had been torn asunder. Something had scoured through it in search of something; and that something was still present within. It rested in the corner of the house and seemed to be content in running away from the girl this time around. This became obvious when it pounced out the front door the second the girl began to make her way over to it. The girl's own speed was nothing to match that of her target's and thus it was able to create a large amount of distance between itself and her before she exited the house.

The girl understood that she'd never be able to catch the cat if it saw her coming unless it wanted her to catch it. This put her in a troublesome situation; honestly, and required her to think about her next actions. She had to get close to it somehow without it's knowledge of her being there. A certain technique she'd been taught came to mind, but she'd have to get the cat to exit the pavement in order for such to become possible. That was carried out quite easily via the girl simply making a scarey face toward the cat which then caused it to jump ten feet and land on the grass.

The girl quickly reacted by forming her own set of handseals and created a veil of chakra around her body. The veil then allowed her to quickly sink under the ground and freely motion through the dirt from beneath. She went to such a depth that the cat would be rendered completey uinable to hear, or feel her movements. 

Once she was able to make her way over to being directly below the cat she rose as quickly as she could and snatched the cat up from below. It frantically tried to escape via utilizing it's claws and teeth, but even it's best attempts were rendered uneffective against the girl's hardened frame. She could honestly barely feel them, and no blood was drawn by the cat's attempts at freedom. It eventually settled down when it realized the futility of it's attempts and accepted it's fate to return to it's owner: the crazy cat lady.

With the cat in tow and all of her missions complete the girl made her way back to the mizuakge to announce her success and to accept her small reward in exchange for the tedious tasks she had once again been subjected to at her own request. They were really beinning to grow old, but they were the only thing that kept her busy on a daily basis. She'd have to deal with it for the time being, or find somewhere else to call home.

After she turned in the scrolls that detailed her completion of the missions and accepted her rewards the girl made her exit from the location in which the mizukage remained and found a secluded area to read a new scroll she had been given in order to gain a new technique. When she finished reading the scroll she'd shut it and place it back into her jacket. Once it was safely secured within her jacket the girl made her way back toward where she'd last saw people in order to proceed on with her normal life.* - Thu Oct 29 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way to the waterfall that most of the shinobi within her village seemed to favor as a gathering spot. The girl had different movies on her mind; however, as she made her way onto the water and toward the waterfall. She knew in her current state she'd be made sport of by the vast majoriy of shinobi out there that sought to cause harm to people such as herself. If she was to ever lose her dependence on those around her for protection; she'd have to get stronger herself. She'd have to put in the work so that one day she could becoem someone capable of defending those she loved. She could be to the next generation what the elder shinobi of the village were to her. She perhaps even had greater goals before her eyes; the ability to lead and be privotal in protecting a village was something she didn't scare away from. It was very rare for a shinobi to obtain such a position, but it was possible as long as she tried her best. If she ended up failing she'd at least have peace in knowing the fact that she tried.

There were honestly two lights before her eyes. The former being another goal that had been brought to her attention in the days preceding the current and the later being obtaining the title that the current mizukage held. The former overshadowed the later, and both could not co-exist ultimately. This left her in a bit of inner turmoil, but she made the decision to do her best to excel in both goals. She'd leave everything else up to fate itself. It'd be the decision maker, but she'd put in the work to make sure either goal was obtainable. Ultimately; however, acceptance of the fact that it wasn't all in her own control. 

When she felt prepared to begin her training session the girl removed her jacket to reveal the sports bra that rested beneath along with medium length shorts. They were not revealing, but allowed more air to flow across her skin while she moved. This increased her overall comfort by a large margin and allowed her to continue past what she'd normally consider her limit when wearing her jacket and such.

The pressurized force of the waterfall now fell upon her head where the stood. This made it harder to stand, but the girl remained unwavering. From within the waterfall she began to kick the air before her in a sweeping manner. It was significantly harder to get the action right due to the constant abuse being placed upon her body by the waterfall, but she didn't relent from her excercise. 

After several moments her leg began to burn so she alternated to the left. This time instead of going for a high sweeping kick; she opted for a lower sweeping motion with the left. These two actions together made up the first taijutsu technique she'd ever learned. The one she was most certainly closest to matching. Sweat began to be excreted across her body, but was quickly washed away from the water. Her hair was eventually tied up into a pony tail to prevent it from falling into her face with every motion due to the newgained weight it found after being soaked.

After a while both of her feet were completely tired, but she'd managed to train two jutsu via practicing the art of kicking. Next she began to punch the air directly before her. In her mind she visualized a person standing right before her and aimed her punches right for where their throat would be. This was a simple technique, but she needed to perfect it regardless. It was situational, but was still something that could give her the upper hand some day. If it was utilized correctly she could easily see herself catching someone off guard with it.

She continued this until both of her arms began to feel limp. The water continued to cascade down upon her, causing her entire body to feel heavier. Her feet were still recovering from the kicking training and having to stand within the waterfall was most certainly not helping. 

If the girl had one thing going for her; however, it was her amazing stamina. Even when faced with such a daunting self challenge she never relented. She continued to train after the throat punching session was over. Next she'd take off running through the waterfall before sprining into a kick that'd bring her several feet forward.

She repeated this action one hundred times before she felt fully content with her proficiency in carrying out the action. Her enitre body was beginning to go numb. It was a struggle to move, and everything burned. Her heart felt like it was going to beat out of her chest. Her lungs began to hurt due to the struggle it was to breathe while being pounded by the water. The taste of blood became present in the back of her throat, but this didn't stop her.

Next she went to more primal methods of exercise. The girl dropped to her hands and knees before spreading her hands to be even with the rest of her body. Both of her feet were positioned together and she began to lift her body within the waterfall, "One..." she counted aloud before repeating the motion, "Two..."

The girl continued this for several moments at a steady pace. She was aiming to work on her stamina now. The best way to complete a large amount of anything was to simply pace yourself and not burn yourself out quickly. The girl knew this and thus remained in place doing push ups for what seemed like a small eternity. After completing five hundred push ups she finally rose back to her feat, albeit strugglingly.

Her eyes slowly scanned the area to make sure nobody could be caught in the crossfire of her jutsu before she proceeded with her next task. She swiftly performed a set of handseals and began to manifest chakra within her chest. This chakra continued to grow until it eventually made it's way up her throat and began to fill her mouth. At this point the girl chanted the name of her jutsu, 
"Water Style: Raging Waves!" 

then expelled all of the built up chakra forwards. This caused a large wave of water to rush forward from her body. This effectively made a small tidal wave that grew and covered the entire pond. Anyone standing on, or around the pond would most likely be effected by the wave that was created, but it would prove no real threat. It'd only be a slight annoyance at the most.

The girl didn't stop there; however, she once again began to perform handseals. Once again she allowed her chakra to manifest and grow within her chest before it eventually snaked it's way up her throat in into her mouth. Once again she was prepared to fire, but this jutsu was basically the opposite of her first and in a completely different chakra nature, 

"Earth Style; Mud Silhouette!"

the girl chanted, before expelling a decent amount of mud before her. As soon as the mud made contact with the water it spread, creating a flow southward and causing the water to be slightly tinted in the colour brown. Once again those sitting upon the water may notice a slight change in it, but it wouldn't prove to have any negative effects on anyone overall. 

The girl once again began to form handseals following the success of the earth jutsu. She wasn't sure how much chakra she had used, but she pressed on anyways. She knew she'd know when she reached her limit. She was almost there physically, but spiritually she could most certainly keep going. For now at least.

When the girl finished her handseals she focused a large amount of chakra into her arm before placing it on the water before her. The water reacted to her chakra and allowed her to manipulate it to her liking. Using this she was able to cause the water to rise and form a pressurized sphere that utilized her arm as the main magnetic force, 

"Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu!" 

she chanted, before releasing the jutsu as quickly as it was put up. She was now truly near her limit, and could probably only manage one more jutsu. She decided to finish it with something she hadn't really had a true chance to practice. Something that would probably put her out like a light for the rest of the day. 

Once again she formed a seal and began to exert chakra into her own body. Doing this allowed her to temporarily increase her metabolic rate and cover the distance between herself and the mizukage in a -very- short amount of time. Of course due to her lack of mastery in the jutsu it carried a huge strain on her body and left her barely able to move. She was also extremely disoriented as a result of the jutsu,

"I think that's enough for today..."

the girl stated breathlessly.* - Fri Oct 30 03:20:06 2015
