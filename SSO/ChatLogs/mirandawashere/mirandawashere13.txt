<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) quietly observed the female before her. She'd observed the techniques of people who possessed such eyes before and knew her work was cut out for her right away. The young red head's golden gaze found it's way to meet that of her opposite number's. The young senju had previously announced that she'd allow her opponent the opportunity to take the first strike in the spar, but maybe that was a bad idea.

The girl intended to use a rather simple technique that she'd managed to master through repitition. As the Hyuuga drew nearer to the girl; her entire focus rested upon her angle of attack. If she was able to she'd do her best to act at the last moment and redirect the strike of the hyuuga. This attempt; however, would most likely fail due to the sheer speed her opponent possessed.

If it did succeed; however, the girl'd do her best to act upon the opening her strike would create after knocking the female off balance to attempt a quick jab toward the hyuuga's throat in order to stun her before retreating backwards and allowing the spar to progress.

<SO fast...>* - Mon Nov 16 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: My body is still weak from earlier... - Mon Nov 16 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: I'm slippin' and she's really quick...what can I do? - Mon Nov 16 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *whistles* - Mon Nov 16 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'll be baaack. - Mon Nov 16 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) considering the difference in skill between the two combatants, and the fact that the girl's body was still considerably weakened from the events that took place before; she was simply unable to contend with the Hyuuga whom she faced. She had managed to parry the original strike, and get a blow in somewhere, but that was all she could do.

She found herself lying victom to a series of blows toward her tenketsu. When it came to this she was at the complete mercy of her aggressor. Her body went limp as she stumbled backwards from the recoil of the strikes. It was more than clear that the girl had never been any where near one hundred percent since the get go, but even if she was the outcome wouldn't of been much different.

If the damage wasn't too severe the girl attempted to remain standing, but bowed graciously in defeat. She simply wasn't on the level of most shinobi at this point and knew she needed to continue to work hard day in and day out in pursuit of the hope that one day she could match them. 

She figured she had at least made the first step in the right direction by finding a skilled shinobi that was willing to teach her. She was gracious for such an effort even if it led to her having her ass kicked multiple times in a single day. In the end all that really mattered was that she was learning -something-.

"Is the weakness...physical durability? Fast strikes and reactions, but if you break the guard there isn't much behind it?"

the girl asked, aiming to answer the question she'd been prompted to find out. The girl didn't have much evidence to support her claim, but was acting out of blind assumption. She didn't see anything else that could be a flaw, but she also never landed a hit. That was honestly the only true question mark to Mana; however, even as her speed was almost the same as that of the young red head,

"My body hates me right now..."* - Mon Nov 16 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || Apparently the girl's opponent had no idea when to stop a spar. The red head's body all but gave out on her. She could no longer move, or complete any action that'd allow her safety from the onslaught of moves to follow from her opponent. She was struck several more times in her tenketsu which both shut off her chakra, and caused internal damage.

She coughed up blood at this point. All feeling was now gone as the girl began to drift from conciousness. It became a struggle to even keep her eyes open as she continued to be assaulted. She had been grasped by the females hair and thrown into the air before another combination of strikes were sent her way.

The young red head had absolutely no way of weathering through the onslaught. By this point it was a fight to stay concious, but that was also a fight she was losing. The girl's entire body shut down on her; her physical frame had not been anywhere near one hundred percent from the start and she was at her honest limit before the girl started attacking her again. Anything now was into the danger zone.

Her life was now flashing before her eyes as a weakened frame offered no protection from the strikes that sought to bypass any sign of durability. Yes; her oppoennt didn't intend for her strikes to do very much damage, but she was still striking at tenketsu which was no laughing matter. By now most of the girl's circulatory system had been cut off which prevented chakra from circulating to aid the spots in her body it was needed most.

If the young redhead wasn't offered any sort of help in a hurry she'd be struggling to keep from crossing the line that seperates the physical and spiritual world. She was unconcious and the light rested right before her vision. It neither grew nor shrunk as the girl remained in complete limbo for the time being. Her condition was deteriorating to be sure,

<It's too much...Is this the end? Violet...Elon...even you...madam...I don't want it to end this way, but will I finally see you again?>* - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || By this point the girl's body lied limp within the hyuuga's arms. Her breathing was laboured and unstable. It was clear the red head needed medical attention as quickly as was possible. Within her mind all she saw around her was darkness...or was it light? In the absense of darkness light loomed, but darkness couldn't exist without light.

Off in the distance the girl saw the light, but the darkness in it's shadow was greater than ever before. She knew not to approach the light, and intead optedo to turn away from it. It was only then that she realised she was bound mentally within the place she so presided in. 

Exteriorally her facial expression shifted through various forms of cringes. It was clear that she was going through some sort of struggle on the inside, and only hanging onto life by a small limb. She needed medical stablization quickly; otherwise she would most likely fade into the light that cast the darkness she now found herself within,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) paused in a moment of confusion. She'd been set back, but this time Paine said to return to attack each other. That meant that Mana was to take the offensive this time as well in her head. With that in mind the girl charged forward toward the approaching Momura and directed her right fist straight for her opposite number's face.

If the situation went normally they'd trade blows to each other's face. Mana shook off the damage of her opponent's blow, but could her opponent do the same?

<Did I mess up?>* - Mon Nov 16 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || There was simply too much momentum behind the girl's motion for her to stop upon hearing the words chanted by her instructor. Her feet drug against the sand below her, but she still continued to slide for a few moments. The girl closed her eyes in anticipation of the impact that never came. When she slowly reopened them she noticed that Paine had positioned herself between her and her sparring partner.

"Oh...my bad. I misunderstood."

The girl stated in a rather embarassed tone. She couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of Paine basically resetting Momura as if she were some type of android. 

When things were finally prepared once again the girl's golden gaze never left the other red head. She was as prepared as she'd ever be to take the hit that was soon to be directed toward her by Momura.* - Mon Nov 16 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || Seeing as the female was more than prepared for the obvious strike to come; she was easily able to avoid it. If she had been told to freeze before acting upon her impulse; the girl'd simply take the strike if her partner failed to do so.* - Mon Nov 16 21:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: What do you mean, make it stop soon? - Mon Nov 16 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? So I get the first step, huh..? - Mon Nov 16 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right, then... - Mon Nov 16 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl all but came to life this time around. It was clear they weren't doing something right which the girl could only deduce as being the fact that they were kind of just drifting through the session. The girl's face expressed the feeling she began to gain in the bottom of her stomache for battle. She was ready for a battle; not a simple trade of blows. 

It took everything for the girl to simply dodge her opposite number's stirke, but she didn't stray from her orders. If one observed closely they'd notice that her fists were clenched tightly enough for her nails to dig into the soft skin of her palm and draw a miniscule amount of blood,

<Let me at'er!>* - Mon Nov 16 22:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Who is that? - Mon Nov 16 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: You may take the first strike. - Mon Nov 16 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Mon Nov 16 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || As the stuttering red head approached Mana; she had already locked in a form of counter attack to what her opponent had planned. The female wouldn't be allowed the time to drop into what would lead into a sweeping kick, no. The girl stepped foward into  Momura's approach and aimed to grasp her opponent's clothing around her right shoulder tightly.

Following the grasp the girl directed her other hand toward the right sleeve of the opponent around where her triceps were. If she was sucessful in these two things the girl'd proceed to pulled the small red head over her body before slamming her into the ground on her back. 

On the way down Mana positioned her elbow to slam directly into the young red head's right shoulder. This would prove to make it temporarily ineffective if the girl succeeded.* - Mon Nov 16 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) given the way her opponet had approached and the reflex coupled with anticipation required to pull off the misdirection that'd be required to save her from being thrown; she failed to avoid. Immediately after slamming her oppponent into the ground the girl didn't relent in her striking pattern.

She'd give her opponent enough time to rise, but nothing more. Instantly the girl closed the distance seperating the two once again and proceeded to aim for her own sweeping strike aimed toward the base of her opponent's form.

The girl continued the combo with a second kick toward her opponent's mid section. As the combo continued the girl gained buoyancy and litteraly seemed to be floating through the air as she executed another kick toward the upper part of her opponent's body in rapid succession.

The combo was landed with a brutal heel drop to the top of the girl's head. If all went as planned the girl landed a few feet away from her opponent following the combo ready to examine the effects her technique and strikes had upon poor Momura,

<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mm.. - Mon Nov 16 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl rushed over to the downed red head. This was the first time she'd ever actually managed to land that technique as a whole. She'd voice her apology before digging her opponent out from the sand and taking her back over toward Paine.

Just as she had observed Paine doing before; she'd set her back up straight at roughly the same distance as Paine had done. The power of the kicks was restrained considerably after the girl realised her opponent had no chance of avoiding them. This meant she'd most likely only experience a moderate amount of pain for a few moments before recovering.

"Oops..."* - Mon Nov 16 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: T-That hurt.. - Mon Nov 16 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: A-Alot.. - Mon Nov 16 22:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: I should end this, though.. - Mon Nov 16 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) responded to Paine's question with an affirmative nod. During the time she had been turned away she was caught off guard by the strike of her opponent. She found herself being pulled into a kick aimed directly at her face by the girl. It was a nice attempt, but it'd ultimately prove in effective against the girl's stronger frame.

"Rude..." the girl stated in a low tone. She proceeded to attempt to punch her opponent straight in the throat after her strike had landed and her hands were free. After such was completed the girl waited to see how Momura would respond. She slowed the pace of the spar considerably this time around,

<Come on...>* - Mon Nov 16 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Kyubishu.You busy? - Mon Nov 16 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl took yet another strike. It didn't really phase her, but she acted like it did. She staggered backwards a small ways while her opponent fell onto the ground at the same moment. The girl's golden gaze found itself fixiated upon her opponent now. She decided that the spar honestly wouldn't go anywhere even if the pace was lowered. Even when she allowed her opponent's attacks to find their mark; her opponent still had neither the confidence, or motivation to be passionate about the fight.

The girl once again took off toward her opponent. She instantly accelerated to max speed and closed the distance between the two in roughtly a second. As soon as the distance was closed the girl threw her entire body into the air and extended her right foot toward the red head's face.

Her attack came at the same time as her opponent's speech; which would probably leave her turning only to see the bottom of Mana's shoe. If this was the case the sound of the bottom of her foot meeting the solid flesh of Momura's face resounded through the area along with Mana's chant,

"Dynamic Entry!"* - Mon Nov 16 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl proceeded to approach Momura and set her back up in place opposite her just as Paine had done prior.* - Mon Nov 16 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way back over to Momura and did her best to set her up again. If she was unable to stand on her own the girl found a nearby rock to prop her up against in as straight a manner as she could manage.* - Mon Nov 16 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) pulled out her trusty roll of duct tape and raped Momura to a large rock so that she'd remain standing.* - Mon Nov 16 23:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl braced for the strike to be sent her way. Rather than deflecting, or dodging she crossed her arms in an "X" shape and aimed to allow the girl to stroll right up in make her strike. Mana didn't expect the strike to stand any chance against her guard, but that was soon to be left up in the air. The first strike sent a shockwave throughout her body. Perhaps it worked against itself; however, as the girl's strong frame was able to reduce the damage sustained to a point that it only stung slightly.

The second; more focused punch met more of the same fate although there was no spreading. The girl's guard remained true and it was held off, but a look of complete shock was now plastered upon the girl's face. She had no idea that such an ability existed, or that the girl before her would possess such a thing. She figured that just further proved the statement that stated to always be on your guard and to not judge a book by it's cover.

"I doubt you want me to show you what I did."

the girl stated in a whispering tone after taking a second or two to recover from the strike. Only now did she notice the fact that the girl had grown some sort of antennae that seemed to resemble that of an ant's. Maybe the jutsu had something to do with them...it'd make sense if she gained a large amount of strength in response,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl entered the arena with Momura trailing only slightly behind her mentor. For some reason the girl couldn't help but feel a sort of sadness in her heart. She felt like she had failed her mentor, but wasn't exactly sure how. She'd honestly tried her best to answer as best she could and did her best to study up on her appointed partner. The girl's golden gaze found it's way to the red head beside her, before trailing off to the others and the area and eventually stabilizing upon Paine once again.

The girl sighed, but eventually managed to push the feeling of sadness down. She'd simply have to do her best now to prove that she wasn't a loss. Maybe she was simply mis interpreting her mentor's drowsiness for dissappointment. She didn't neccesarily possess good social skills after all. Whatever it was; however, it was definitely bothering Mana. This much was apparent through her overall demanor, and attitude.

She continued to speak in a soft tone,

"I guess we're ready."* - Tue Nov 17 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Oi? Paine is teaching Momura and the Fodder girl? - Tue Nov 17 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: We should. - Tue Nov 17 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The young redhead glanced to at the other redhead to the left of her. The girl wasn't exactly sure how she felt about Momura. She wasn't sure if things really mattered if she'd be there for her, but she wouldn't deny her mentor her wishes. The girl closed her eyes before nodding affirmatively before turning to adress something someone had so rudely stated behind her in a stern tone,

"Excuse me? Fodder girl?"* - Tue Nov 17 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Right Ivel? - Tue Nov 17 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Right. - Tue Nov 17 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I think he means you aren't relevant. - Tue Nov 17 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: But we're all comrades. - Tue Nov 17 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's quite...rude of him to say. I'd like to think i'm relevant to someone at least. - Tue Nov 17 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh well. He's entitled to his own style of thinking. - Tue Nov 17 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Momura it looks like we're going to be together for a while. - Tue Nov 17 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Tue Nov 17 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Everything? - Tue Nov 17 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: e-everything... - Tue Nov 17 04:16:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Tue Nov 17 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) pounced at her target in unison with Momura. It seemed they have some sort of chemistry going on from their start, but such became more apparent by the way they coordinated their attacks. Each possesed roughly the same base speed and found their way to their mentor at roughly the same time. Momura branched off to the left in her approach while Mana kept to the right.

When they were within range Momura aimed to use a high light, while Mana did exactly the opposite. She aimed to utilize her signature skill at this point which began with a low kick directed toward her opponent's base. She hoped that by the two of them striking from two different sides, two different angels, and two different levels of elevation; they'd be able to find an oppening in their mentor's defense.

<Let's goo!>* - Tue Nov 17 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl was unable to react to the speed of her opponent's moves. She basically turned into a tornado in the young red head's eyes before she was soon sent tumbling northwards. Once again her and Momura had been seperated, but they gained an advantage through this. The elder shinobi didn't have eyes in the back of her head, at least Mana assumed so.

She instantly accelerated to max speed once again before flinging her body into the air from her opponent's blind side. Her attack came in the form of a kick toward the back of her head, 

<Dyanmic Entry!>* - Tue Nov 17 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl realised the error in her move when it occured to her that both her and her partner were on completely opposite sides of their opponent and flying at full speed toward her. This was further proven when she found herself being attacked and forcifully flung toward her partner.

If they crashed into the girl it'd be follow by a loud thud as they made contact with the ground. The girl'd watch as smoke erupted throughout the combat field along with her partner vansihing into it along with her opponent. The girl reacted by forming a series of handsigns. In reaction to the signs the girl's charka formed a veil around her body which allowed her to sink under the sand of the arena. From there she was able to sense what was happening on the surface via magnetic forces.

She'd simply wait and watch for an opening from below, staying in close proximity.* - Tue Nov 17 05:22:08 2015
