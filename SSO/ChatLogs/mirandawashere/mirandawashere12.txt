She saw nobody upon arrival, but after searching for several moments she came across a large amount of familiar faces. It seemed she was too late to see the conflict; however, as everything seemed to be at a stale-mate and the action of the moment seemed to be useless bickering. She'd state in a soft, almost sarcastic tone,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) assumed the stuttering red head took the lead leaving the square. If such was true the girl'd silently follow her to the arena.* - Sun Nov 15 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) quietly stared down the ever elusive red head. Finally they'd meet in a spar after planning to do so for the past few days. They both shared the same teacher as far as the girl knew which only served to make the terms of the combat more interesting for the girl. She'd rolled even with her die and thus was rewarded the first strike in the round. 

The girl decided to go all out from the start of the fight and thus accelerated to her max speed all at once. Her speed was -far- above what would be considered average for a shinobi of her level and would most likely prove to catch her opponent off guard if they had not witness such before.

About half way into her approach of her opponent the girl sprung off of her feet and took to the air. A single foot was then directed forward and aimed directly in a manner that'd have it land against the head of her opponent. If the attack wasn't utilized by pretty much and tom, dick, or harry it'd probably serve to catch her opponent off guard due to the suddeness of such a strike, but since everyone used it; it'd probably prove pretty easy to avoid,

"Dynamic Entry!!!!"* - Sun Nov 15 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) whispers: w-why not? - Sun Nov 15 03:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) took the punch head on, but wasn't particularly effected by it. She actually just shrugged it off altogether and continued with her own planned course of attack. Seeing as her opponent was fully extended into a punch the chance of her reacting to her next strike was quite low; it came in the form of a swift punch toward her throat. The strike was likely to force her opponent into grasping her throat and leave her stunned for a few moments.

During this time the girl acted to capitalize on the opening lieft from her strike. She closed the distance her fumbling opponent had made between the two before attempting to strike the stunned girl with a low kick. Acting upon the momentum the girl followed up her strike with a mid kick. As the combination went on she gained power and buoyancy to land a third kick toward her oppoennt's upper body and finishing it off with a hill drop toward the top of her head.

The girl wasn't use to sparring people below her level and such a combination would most likely seem pretty harsh. Following the combination the girl gracefully landed and slid back several feet to assess the outcome of her strikes.* - Sun Nov 15 04:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) directed her golden gaze toward the gourd weilding super-man. Honestly the girl doubted if having two did anything to even the odds between both her and her partner and the gourd weilding fellow opposite of them, but practice was practice. She'd take every challenge at full speed and do her best to create an opening with the first move. Perhaps they could catch him off guard.

In a burst of speed well above what was to be expected of someone at her level; the girl aimed to clear the distance between herself and her opponent. A trail of dust was left in her wake that may spread enough to conceal the presense of her partner if the girl was quick enough(which she probably wasn't).

As soon as the distance was cleared the girl wasted no time in carrying out her intended manner of attack. She left herself completely open, but aimed to go for a punch right to her opponent's throat. If this punch found it's mark; however, it'd probably stun the man for a few moments and allow her partner to follow up on the strike,

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sweet - Sun Nov 15 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) experienced a short-lived smile that formed when she'd know she had successfully made an opening for her partner, but died when the elder shinobi proved to be too much of a match for such an attack to prove successful against them. The girl knew a counter attack was to come as soon as the man parried her partner's strike and did her best to act before the storm.

The girl lacked much talent with ninjutsu, but there was one she knew to match the situation that she may be able to pull off. It was one that her cousin, Elon, had taught her before his death. One she held close to her heart. A seires of handseals were formed rather slowly. Upon completion the girl allowed her chakra to form a veil around her body. Once in place the charka acted to soften the already soft sand below her feet which then enabled her to sink into the ground below. 

Once below the girl did her best to act upon the magnetic forces that were now available to her in order to figure out where both her ally and opponent were. It seemed that things happened just as she had feared; however, when her ally was clearly knocked to the ground by -something-. The young redhead knew that act within itself was quite a feat after fighting the purple haired kenjutsuist herself. Needless to say she was thankful that she hadn't been subjected to such a hit.

As she made her way toward the gourd bearing prodegy the girl did her best to formulate some sort of means of attack. A straight on hit proved ineffective, and she honestly wasn't even sure if a sneak attack would work given the fact that the sand reacted regardless of Tetsumi's will. 

The moment when her partner attacked the girl arose from the ground and instantly accelerated to her stop speed from the back side of the shukaku host. Her entire body was thrown into the air with a single foot directed toward the back of her opponent's head aiming to strike him from behind in a hope that the both he and the sand forgot about her after she sank underground and tunnel visioned on her partner,

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: If I can just get one hand on him... - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl's kick had been blocked once again. This caused a frown to quickly take form across her face. Things were made worse when her opponent was nice enough to give her a new jacket that consisted of cold, hard iron sand. Seeing as there was litteraly no way for her to manuever away from the strike; she was rendered completely immobile within what could only be described as a coffin. If the monster man was unable to escape this then the girl knew there was no point in her trying.

She'd simply remain idle and wait to be release. It seemed the boy had only wanted a short spar and that was most likely going to be the outcome. The girl was only glad that she wasn't injured any furhter, or that the sand wasn't condencing any tighter upon her body. She continued to ask in a humble tone,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) stared past jiki for a few moments toward the man of the hour. She wasn't really interested in the fight taking place between the female and the kage east of her. She'd been around Ortho too much to really be surprised by what -some- shinboi were capable of. She didn't really see what was so special about the man whom approached now and was quite content with staying hidden away in her coffin.

The young gourd weilder had asked if she cared for another spar. After the results of the first she really felt like her efforts were better spent elsewhere, but her partner had already spoken for her. The girl sighed lowly, but continued to question the boy in a inquisitive tone,

"Does that mean no sand shield?"

She wasn't quite sure if he could just...turn it off. If it acted upon it's own will. All of a sudden the girl found herself falling to the sand below with a loud thud. Her entire body ached slightly, but she was able to shrug off the pain for the most part. She quickly rose back to her feet in an attempt to save what little face she hadn't lost.

<Still not where I want to be with my training...i'll have to double my own work out again.>

the girl thought to herself. She'd remain vigilant within a shroud of silence until her partner decided whether they'd go for round two or not with her personally holding no bias towards either side,

<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: a-actually...i-im not s-sure... - Sun Nov 15 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) blankly stared at the female before her. The young red head had been informed that the female that now stood opposite her was a great master of taijutsu; so the fact that she had no knowledge of the eight gates proved to be a curve ball for the girl. Still; she carried a vast amount of respect for the elder shinobi whom was now her instructor and would thus give it her all for the sake of finding out just how strong her new mentor was.

The girl crossed her arms in a shield like manner. Her facial expression began to shift and cringe in anticipation for the large burst of chakra soon to be flowing through her body following the opening of one of the eight inner gates, "Gate of opening..." She struggled with her words, but managed to painfully pronounce each letter. "Open!" She exploded in tandem of the release of her chakra.  The flow of chakra through her body now became significantly more dense, but she wasn't quite finished yet. She knew the opponent she faced was one of a high calibre and that she'd need more for things to even seem close.

Keeping her arms crossed the girl cringed even greater. Her muscles flexed and her entire body had already begun to ache. She fought through the pain and continued to pronounce in the same manner as the gate prior, "Gate of Healing..." At this point the girl's body began to revitalize itself due to the nature of the second gate, "Release!" Even more chakra exploded throughout her body. The sensation was truly remarkable, but it quickly began to take it's toll upon her. 

Now was the time for her to attack. She was able to fully utilize her muscles without any restriction. She exploded forwards toward Paine in a flurry of speed that probably wasn't to be expected if Paine had been paying attention to her spar against Momura the day prior. 

The distance between the two was closed almost instantaneously and the girl carried out her attack swiftly. Just before reaching the elder female the girl sprung into the air off of her right foot and threw her body into a spinning motion. The attack being carried out was a high spinning kick, but it was only a feint for the true strike to follow which was in the form of a brutal low sweep. A small, but effective combo,

"Kirigakure Twister!"* - Sun Nov 15 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) had her attack rendered ineffective following a simple counter by her opponent. A slight frown now took place upon the girl's face. She resigned to the fact that she'd spend the next few days in pain following what she planned on doing next. She once again crossed her arms in the all too familiar shielded positioning. 

Her entire body ached, but she'd give it all she had. She wouldn't allow any order from her new instructor to go without notice and aimed to leave nothing to chance. If the fight was to end; it'd end with the young red head knowing that she left nothing in the tank. That she was completely at peace and content with the effort she put fourth to do so much as to land a strike upon the elder female.

As the girl focused on opening the next gate; a new type of pain began to form across her body. Her muscles strained, but remained in tact, "Third gate...of life..." the girl slowly enunciated through gritted teeth, "Release!" All of a sudden a considerably larger amount of chakra shot out around her figure. Both her chakra and blood flow increased significantly throughout her body. Due to the increased flow of blood through her body the tint of her skin changed to match that of her hair which was now slowly lifting into the air due to excess chakra escaping her body,

<Not finished yet...>

the girl thought to herself. She'd truly give it her all here. No restraint. No holding back; her mentor had assured her that she could take it. Now was the time for the girl to figure out her true limit. Now was her chance to fight without the worry of either injuring her sparring partner, or losing and forfeiting her life as a result to a true enemy.

Her arms remained locked in the cross pattern and she now began to focus upon the fourth tenketsu point which was located on the spinal chord just like the third. Her entire body shriveled in anticipation of the -huge- amount of chakra mixed with pain that was to follow the opening of such a gate,

"F-fourth g-gate of p-p-ain..."

the girl truly staggered with each letter, but eventually managed to get the words out. By now her entire body felt like it was on fire. Every fiber of her being was in truly agonizing pain, but through training she had built up her own mental endurance to the point that she could fight past such a thing,

"Release!"

With her shout an even larger amount of chakra was released from the girl's being. Veins began to bulge across her body and her muscles were put under an unreal amount of strain. If she was unlucky they may even tear in the fight to ensue, but she hoped her endurance training would prove true in such an event to prevent that from happening.

With the fourth gate open the girl shot forward once again, but this -everything- about her was one hundred percent different. Her speed, attack speed, strength, and even the efficiency of her movements were on a level that previously seemed impossible for the girl to pull off. Her dash left a huge amount of dust in the air to conceal her presence.

The moment the distance was closed the girl aimed to land a low kick toward her opponent's legs, which was immediately followed up by an opposite sweeping kick to her opponent's mid section. As the girl progressed through the technique her body gained buoyancy and she litteraly seemed to be floating through the air as the third kick, which was directed toward the upper section of her opponent's body found home before being followed up by a finishing heel drop directed toward the part of Paine's head,

"Kirigakure Style Taijutsu: Raging Hurricane!"* - Sun Nov 15 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) once again found that her attacks met the same fate against her opponent. No matter how hard the young red head pushed her body she seemed to be a step behind her opponents. When she flew backwards and hit the ground this time; the girl struggled to rise back to a knee. The girl had amazing stamina to say the least so she wasn't as effected by the gates as normal, but she still lacked the ability to press on in the face of what she had taken.

The gates closed as soon as the girl realised she was near her limit and that her efforts were fruitless. This was indeed the end of the spar and it became clear the girl was finished when her skin reverted back to it's original pigment. 

She remained silent on the ground completely out of breath.  A golden gaze nothing short of amazement was directed toward her opposite number,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl awakened in a different spot than where she had previously been when she lost conciousness. The effects of her recent battle weighing in heavily upon her frame. Every part of her body ached heavily, and she winced at the slightest amount of contact between her body and anything else in the surrounding area. 

After a moment was taken to scan the area the girl noticed that someone was looking down upon her. This someone was easily recongiseable to her as Marcus whom seemed to have a moderate amount of concern for her well being. That was pretty sweet of him she supposed, but she wasn't sure if she should be appreciative of such a gesture, or if she should be angered by the fact that he thought she couldn't handle herself.

Neither really mattered at the moment; however, and she couldn't be bothered to bring the thought past what it had already progressed to. Her eyes made their way over to Paine. Their agreement rested freshly upon her mind. The girl really wasn't sure what she'd basically signed her life away to, but she couldn't deny that the elder shinobi was at a level that was nearly inconcievable for the young redhead.

After taking everything in the girl placed a singular arm on the ground beside her. This caused a moderate amount of pain to shoot through her body which led to the girl wincing. Her arm shook furiously as more tension was placed upon it before she was eventually able to fully extend it. Next she progressed to extending to her knees before becoming fully erect atop the carpet albeit with trembling knees,

"I-i'm ready...t-to train...somemore.." the girl said strugglingly.* - Mon Nov 16 01:31:18 2015
