<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl began to walk forward at a modest pace. Her attention was primarily directed toward the figure who had previously spoken to her. This was the same figure that seemed to be content with showing off their powers after observing their previous encounter with that Sunagakure shinobi.

She didn't stay locked upon that focal point long; however, as she turned to face who she assumed was the kage. Maybe she was wrong, but this was here thinking at the given moment. 

Not paying much mind to the conversation that took place between the kage and the man; the girl simply waited for them to finish in deafening silence. When that threshold was met she proceeded to voice her question in a low tone:

"Are there any missions I can complete?"

All the while that same piercing yellow gaze rested upon that of her opposite's.* - Sat Oct 24 22:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl had a slightly puzzled look on her face while she was being handed three scrolls in almost immediate response to her question. It seemed that the kage most certainly did have a couple missions that needed to be completed. She was just the person for the job. Almost as quickly as she was dealt the scrolls, she was gone.

The first one was a simple janitorial mission. The energetic female briskly made her way around the village. Any trash that managed to register in her sight was quickly dealt away with. Over time bags began to accumulate of trash; it was quite shocking just how much both the shinobi and civilians of the village littered.

In almost no time at all the girl had accumulated ten bags of trash. With her objective completed she made her way back to the kage mansion to announce her completion of the task,

"The trash is done. I'll go find your kitty now!"

the energetic girl yelled out before leaving once more.* - Sat Oct 24 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: What is your name kid? - Sat Oct 24 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's Heiwa. - Sat Oct 24 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Well Heiwa. - Sat Oct 24 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Approach me to receive your missions. - Sat Oct 24 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Mizukage. - Sat Oct 24 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: I'd like permission to leave the village for Konohagakure no Sato. - Sat Oct 24 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: I would like to go there and sell various items that I have to them, and in return use that profit and put it's use for Kirigakure. - Sat Oct 24 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: You have two days to return. - Sat Oct 24 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl hastily read the second scroll offered to her. It was another simple mission, but she knew it was more about how she carried it out than whether it actually had impact on the village, or really anyone for that matter. Unless one of those crazy cat ladies owned the cat; then it became as simple as causing one pain(the cat) while helping the other(the crazy cat lady). Her thoughts loomed for several moments, clouding her vision. THUMP! She'd ran straight into a wall. Almost as immediately as it happened a bruise began to appear on her head where she'd made contact, "Oww..." the girl moaned before raising back to her feet and rubbing the area of impact. That's what she got for allowing herself to be distracted. If it were a real mission and she were actually dealing with enemies than meant to draw her blood; that action could have very well spelt the end of her life as it stood. 

She arose to her feet, albeit slowly, and began to run again. Curious eyes surveyed every open shop, house, alleyway, and even trash cans in search for her prey. The village was quite large and the cat was quite small; so it took her a considerable amount of time. House after house, shop after shop, garbage can after garbage can she searched. When this method proved fruitless she decided to start asking around. Unfortunately for her; however, most people didn't really keep their eyes open for a small cat. Just when she was about to give up and take a break from the task she was given a tip that may very well ultimately lead to the apprehension of the damned cat.

She had been informed that the cat loomed in the very origin of her search--it loomed in the area that surrounded the academy. The girl traveled there as quickly as her legs were willing to take her. She never semed to tire, which really worked to her advantage. She knew every second passed was a second that the cat was actively moving. A second that it was making it's grand escape from her acquisition. She hadn't been given a time limit, but there was always the overbearing limit of her patience. 

Finally arriving back at the kage academy; the girl quickly observed the immediate scene. The kage was still in vision along with the younger child who's identity was lost to her. There was no immediate sign of the cat being there which caused the girl to allow a long, drawn out sigh to escape her lips. Maybe she'd been given false information...maybe the man she'd asked was actually harboring the cat. Maybe he was beginning a rebellion against the crazy cat ladies of Kirigakure. This must of been his grand scheme to to liberate all of the poor kitties that were being abducted from the usual garbage filled ally on a daily basis. The ones that were being forced into a life of constantly being pampered. A life of never having to go farther than a few steps for a meal. A horrible life for them indeed. 

THUMP! She'd been distracted again and mindlessly ran into another object. THis time it was a random passerby who'd been carrying a cart that seemed full of cabages. The cart broke and all of the cabages spilt out only to meet their demise at the feet of several passerbys whom mindlessly squashed them. This completely obliterated the spirit of the cabage man and caused him to yell out at ths top of his lungs while slamming both of his palms onto each side of his head,

"MY CABBAGES!!!"

The girl rose back to her feet before taking off. She wasn't going to stick around only to be scolded by the man. She had bigger...or perhaps smaller things to take care of. In what was honestly a last ditch survey her eyes finally landed on the item that she'd been searching for. The very item that she had scowered the whole village for, and searched nearly every nook and cranny that existed. It laid there...sleeping on the porch of the academy.

Blending in with the sound of the other passerbys that constantly passed through the academy; the girl was able to casually walk up to the cat without waking it up. In one swoop the cat was scooped up and placed into her caring arms. With her objective in hand the girl made her way back to the kage with her head still noticeably red,

"Here's your cat, sir."* - Sat Oct 24 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || After delivering the cat; the girl rubbed the spot on her head that was now pretty bruised due busted blood vessesls and such. The nerves were starting to send messages of pain to her brain, but she was able push the pain back and focus on her task at hand. After grabbing a broom from the janitor's closet in the academy the girl made her way outside and toward the kage mansion. 

Once there she decided it'd be most logical to start at the bottom and make her way down. That way she didn't dirty the steps by standing on what she had just swept while she cleaned. That would happen if she had started at the bottom and made her way up. It was always a warp in logic that seemed to bug her when she saw other people sweeping. She was no expert in the matter, but she didn't agree with the expert's methods. If you're gonna sweep you should at least do it right. Yup.

As she made her way down the steps she completely eradicated any of the dust that once laid at rest upon the surface of the steps with each fell swoop. She didn't tire, but she did grow bored as she worked. She began to sing aloud to entertain herself while at the same time making a spectacle of herself for passerbys that better not fucking plan on going up the steps of the kage mansion. 

"Carry on my wayward son...." she sung, "Don't stop beleving!" and continued to sweep. It seemed like with each swipe she switched songs, "It's more than a feeling!" This carried on for several moments until she had finally finished the task at hand. She'd write down details of her success before making her way back to the academy courtyard where she assumed the mizukage still remained. Her assumption was correct and the scroll was handed over in a swift manner,

"Done!'* - Sat Oct 24 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: What was that request. - Mon Oct 26 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl made her way back to the area in which her kage rested. Once within a suitable range she'd request the three missions she was granted on a daily basis. In response to her request she was given three scrolls which all contained information on the mission that she was intended to follow. Making her way out of the academy courtyard the girl waited until she was a suitable distance away to open the first scroll. When she was comfortably away from most of the turns and knew she carried no threat of crashing into anything while she read like she did the day prior, she withdrew the first scroll from her back pouch. Within it were the details of the first mission she'd complete.

After taking a few moments to closely examin the details contained within the scroll it was once again closed. She had to dig a hole for a local construction company. That didn't seem like it would be too bad of a task; though she really felt like one of the interns of the company would be more suited to do such. It kind of seemed like something that one of them would do...if they're being paid to work. Then again she was being paid to, but she thought she was paid to do ninja stuff. She didn't sign up to be a construction worker, but she really couldn't complain. She didn't really specialize in anything outside of manual labor and never getting tired...if that's a talent. 

Without any more forethought the girl made her way to the marked off area. A shovel was convieniently placed for her near the hole and was ready to go. The girl took the shovel into her hand and placed just the tip of the shovel against the grass. It rained quite often in Kirigakure which led to the surface of the dirt being quite soft. Something that people in other countries didn't have the luxary of. Some people who do this actually break shovels because they live in a hot enviroment and the ground is harder than fuck. She didn't know how she knew this, but perhaps some outside force did (-cough cough-).

She began by driving her right foot into the right step of the shovel. The almost rewarding sound of it sliding through the dirt sounded throughout the area and alerted most of the construction workers whom were all taking their lunch breaks early. They devoured food while she basically did their job with them. This led her to wonder if they were even legitmate workers. They did nothing and just watched...almost like they weren't even allowed to be digging in the location and didn't want to be a part of it as to not risk criminal prosecution when the hole is found. 

She gave them the benfit of the doubt; however, considering that the contract was given to her by the mizukage herself. She continued to dig for several minutes until she was eventually standing within a hole that was as tall as her shovel, and wide enough to lay it flat in. That meant the hole was perfectly six foot wide by six foot deep. The standard size for a hole of it's nature and most certainly good enough for the job.

After finishing the job the girl lifted herself out of the hole and attempted to wipe most of the semi-muddy soil from her clothing; an attempt that proved to be mostly futile. She wasn't covered in sweat, or even really breathing heavily, but she was annoyed by the fact that the contruction workers were almost being paid just to set the stage. It was almost like she was given this task just as a forms of manual labour. She decided as soon as she finished reading the second scroll she'd walk over and ask them just what they -were being paid to do.

As quickly as the first she opened the second and began to examine it's contents. WHACK! The girl slammed her right palm into her face almost as hard as she could. This caused a red hand print to become visible for a few moments before subsiding. She was now informed to fill the hole that she had -just- dug back in because the construction company did not have permission to dig on the land of which she had dug the hole. This meant she now had to turn around and fill the hole back in. 

At the same moment she came to a realization...she'd been given both scrolls at the same time. Which means that they were written before the first hole was even dug. A figurative light bulb was now clearly visible above her head. She'd been set up! They just wanted her to dig a hole to keep her busy! Those weren't even real construction workers! They faked them! Oh my goodness she was a fool! She'd been played by her kage and a bunch of smelly ass fat guys got to watch her work hard digging a hole that'd ultimately serve -no- purpose.

After releasing a sigh and allowing herself to calm down emotionally for a few moments she once again grasped the shovel. She felt no type of soreness from the endeavor, but knew she had to be gaining something from this much physical strain. Every time she contracted her muscles they became stronger if even by just a little bit. They were basically like two straws sliding inside of one another. That's why when she flexed they bulged. It was fairly logical to be honest. 

During her state of thought she was mindlessly throwing dirt back into the hole one shovel full at a time. Something that was working to her advantage was the fact that she had thrown all of the dirt into one large pile. Once she had lessed the pile to a more suitable size she left the sight only to return a few moments later with a rake. This made the task of filling the hole back in much more simple. It took maybe five minutes with the rake to even out the dirt and make sure the only thing different was the lack of grass in the area where the hole once loomed.

When she was ready the girl withdrew the third and final scroll she had been given. She prepared herself mentally for the living embodyment of stupid to be sealed within, but upon inspection she came across the knowledge that this scroll actually contained a logical mission. She had been assigned to build a house in an area of her choosing. This was a house she figured she could actually live in herself. She made her way to the beloved waterfall that overlooked the pond her kage favored standing around. It was quite a grand view; and the land around the water was rich and easy to dig in. Perhaps it was too soft and shifty in an expert's eyes, but the girl figured she could make a modest house in it's place so long as she built the proper support and distributed the weight of the building as evenly as possible.

The first step was her foundation. She started off by making sure the ground upon which her house would be built was solid. Luckily for her it was; this meant that she could indeed build a house atop it. The first step was to remove any and all rocks in the area, and make sure that there would be nothing to dilute the contact between the cement that was soon to be poured as the first step of her house. Next she moved on to the actual pouring of the cement. She had to hire the same construction crew that had previously observed her digging the hole. The difference was they actually worked this time. Within a day or two the entire foundation was complete and she'd be able to move onto the next step of the house building process.

Next she gathered a hefty amount of wood and began to lay out the basic floor, roof, and wall systems for the house. This took several moments as she create what was basically the skeleton, or bones of her house. It'd later be covered by other materials that may even act as the skin of the house. Once she finished working on the skeleton she moved on to doing basic plumbing work, but didn't know shit about hvac, or anything of that manner. It wasn't like she really needed it either given that the climate in Kirigakure remained comfortable basically year around.

Next she moved on to hanging and tapping the drywall within the house.  Following that she applied to primer coat of paint to the dry wall. Exteriorly she finished up the skin that covered the skeleton of the house she'd been working on. For this she chose to use stone. It was pretty unique and she really liked the look of it.

When that was finally out of the way she focused on the trim of the interior. This included most of the inner workings of the house such as window sills, interior doors, and moldings. She also took the time to create a modest walk way using excess stone from the interior. It basically led to the edge of the cliff then stopped there. She was a ninja and didn't need stairs considering she could simply use her chakra to climb the mountain. It also meant she wouldn't be bothered by any of those civilians that go door to door trying to sell special weapons, or scrolls. They were the worse.

For the floor she opted to go with a hard wood finish. It was easy and meant she didn't have to measure out/cut carpet. She was able to finish it in a modest amount of time. Next she finished up most of the inner workings of her kitchen such as her counter tops, and the areas where her sink, stove, and fridge would go.

After the flooring and counter tops were done she moved on to installing light fixtures, and most of the inner workings of her bathroom. She opted to use a shower rather than a bath tub, and obviously placed a toilet as well. She made sure to use a wax seal so the toilet wouldn't leak later in it's life after it was set. Most people didn't and that was why the toilets around the village were begining to leak and generally rot out.

Finally she tied up all the loose ends and did her best at decorating her new home. She'd built her dream house and laid it out exactly how she had wanted it. After a few hours of cleaning and moving things around until they were just perfect she officially marked her final mission as complete and sought out the mizukage in order to announce her success.

If they were in their usual spot at the base of the water fall she'd even invite them up to witness the results of her hard work. She was most certianly proud of it.
