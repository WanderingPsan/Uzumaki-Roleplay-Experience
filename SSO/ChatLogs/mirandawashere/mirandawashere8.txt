<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) (*Mana || The girl made her way back to the area in which her kage rested. Once within a suitable range she'd request the three missions she was granted on a daily basis. In response to her request she was given three scrolls which all contained information on the mission that she was intended to follow. Making her way out of the academy courtyard the girl waited until she was a suitable distance away to open the first scroll. When she was comfortably away from most of the turns and knew she carried no threat of crashing into anything while she read like she did the day prior, she withdrew the first scroll from her back pouch. Within it were the details of the first mission she'd complete.
 
After taking a few moments to closely examin the details contained within the scroll it was once again closed. She had to dig a hole for a local construction company. That didn't seem like it would be too bad of a task; though she really felt like one of the interns of the company would be more suited to do such. It kind of seemed like something that one of them would do...if they're being paid to work. Then again she was being paid to, but she thought she was paid to do ninja stuff. She didn't sign up to be a construction worker, but she really couldn't complain. She didn't really specialize in anything outside of manual labor and never getting tired...if that's a talent.
 
Without any more forethought the girl made her way to the marked off area. A shovel was convieniently placed for her near the hole and was ready to go. The girl took the shovel into her hand and placed just the tip of the shovel against the grass. It rained quite often in Kirigakure which led to the surface of the dirt being quite soft. Something that people in other countries didn't have the luxary of. Some people who do this actually break shovels because they live in a hot enviroment and the ground is harder than fuck. She didn't know how she knew this, but perhaps some outside force did (-cough cough-).
 
She began by driving her right foot into the right step of the shovel. The almost rewarding sound of it sliding through the dirt sounded throughout the area and alerted most of the construction workers whom were all taking their lunch breaks early. They devoured food while she basically did their job with them. This led her to wonder if they were even legitmate workers. They did nothing and just watched...almost like they weren't even allowed to be digging in the location and didn't want to be a part of it as to not risk criminal prosecution when the hole is found.
 
She gave them the benfit of the doubt; however, considering that the contract was given to her by the mizukage herself. She continued to dig for several minutes until she was eventually standing within a hole that was as tall as her shovel, and wide enough to lay it flat in. That meant the hole was perfectly six foot wide by six foot deep. The standard size for a hole of it's nature and most certainly good enough for the job.
 
After finishing the job the girl lifted herself out of the hole and attempted to wipe most of the semi-muddy soil from her clothing; an attempt that proved to be mostly futile. She wasn't covered in sweat, or even really breathing heavily, but she was annoyed by the fact that the contruction workers were almost being paid just to set the stage. It was almost like she was given this task just as a forms of manual labour. She decided as soon as she finished reading the second scroll she'd walk over and ask them just what they -were being paid to do.
 
As quickly as the first she opened the second and began to examine it's contents. WHACK! The girl slammed her right palm into her face almost as hard as she could. This caused a red hand print to become visible for a few moments before subsiding. She was now informed to fill the hole that she had -just- dug back in because the construction company did not have permission to dig on the land of which she had dug the hole. This meant she now had to turn around and fill the hole back in.
 
*Mana turned to look at the man with a confused look on her face. She wasn't entirely sure why he'd make such a request and she felt the need to reject him harder than a puerto rican trying to get a loan, but she also had a sense of curiosity as to what this massage was. She was assuming what he was trying to do now was also what he'd done to Chi before she originally arrived. That may explain why he was trying to hide something.
 
She'd humor him for now; she never really saw what the big deal in hiding everything was about anyways. It only took a few moments for the girl to remove what remained of her already stripped down clothing. Her features remained completely hidden by the water they resided in, but her panties remained intact.
 
"What do you want now?"
 
she asked in a rather low tone as the feeling sat in for her. All the while she was physically standing against the flow of the water to keep from drifting back to shore. This was a physical task that taxed her stamina ever so slightly as time moved on.*)
 
 
At the same moment she came to a realization...she'd been given both scrolls at the same time. Which means that they were written before the first hole was even dug. A figurative light bulb was now clearly visible above her head. She'd been set up! They just wanted her to dig a hole to keep her busy! Those weren't even real construction workers! They faked them! Oh my goodness she was a fool! She'd been played by her kage and a bunch of smelly ass fat guys got to watch her work hard digging a hole that'd ultimately serve -no- purpose.
 
After releasing a sigh and allowing herself to calm down emotionally for a few moments she once again grasped the shovel. She felt no type of soreness from the endeavor, but knew she had to be gaining something from this much physical strain. Every time she contracted her muscles they became stronger if even by just a little bit. They were basically like two straws sliding inside of one another. That's why when she flexed they bulged. It was fairly logical to be honest.
 
During her state of thought she was mindlessly throwing dirt back into the hole one shovel full at a time. Something that was working to her advantage was the fact that she had thrown all of the dirt into one large pile. Once she had lessed the pile to a more suitable size she left the sight only to return a few moments later with a rake. This made the task of filling the hole back in much more simple. It took maybe five minutes with the rake to even out the dirt and make sure the only thing different was the lack of grass in the area where the hole once loomed.
 
When she was ready the girl withdrew the third and final scroll she had been given. She prepared herself mentally for the living embodyment of stupid to be sealed within, but upon inspection she came across the knowledge that this scroll actually contained a logical mission. She had been assigned to build a house in an area of her choosing. This was a house she figured she could actually live in herself. She made her way to the beloved waterfall that overlooked the pond her kage favored standing around. It was quite a grand view; and the land around the water was rich and easy to dig in. Perhaps it was too soft and shifty in an expert's eyes, but the girl figured she could make a modest house in it's place so long as she built the proper support and distributed the weight of the building as evenly as possible.
 
The first step was her foundation. She started off by making sure the ground upon which her house would be built was solid. Luckily for her it was; this meant that she could indeed build a house atop it. The first step was to remove any and all rocks in the area, and make sure that there would be nothing to dilute the contact between the cement that was soon to be poured as the first step of her house. Next she moved on to the actual pouring of the cement. She had to hire the same construction crew that had previously observed her digging the hole. The difference was they actually worked this time. Within a day or two the entire foundation was complete and she'd be able to move onto the next step of the house building process.
 
Next she gathered a hefty amount of wood and began to lay out the basic floor, roof, and wall systems for the house. This took several moments as she create what was basically the skeleton, or bones of her house. It'd later be covered by other materials that may even act as the skin of the house. Once she finished working on the skeleton she moved on to doing basic plumbing work, but didn't know shit about hvac, or anything of that manner. It wasn't like she really needed it either given that the climate in Kirigakure remained comfortable basically year around.
 
Next she moved on to hanging and tapping the drywall within the house.  Following that she applied to primer coat of paint to the dry wall. Exteriorly she finished up the skin that covered the skeleton of the house she'd been working on. For this she chose to use stone. It was pretty unique and she really liked the look of it.
 
When that was finally out of the way she focused on the trim of the interior. This included most of the inner workings of the house such as window sills, interior doors, and moldings. She also took the time to create a modest walk way using excess stone from the interior. It basically led to the edge of the cliff then stopped there. She was a ninja and didn't need stairs considering she could simply use her chakra to climb the mountain. It also meant she wouldn't be bothered by any of those civilians that go door to door trying to sell special weapons, or scrolls. They were the worse.
 
For the floor she opted to go with a hard wood finish. It was easy and meant she didn't have to measure out/cut carpet. She was able to finish it in a modest amount of time. Next she finished up most of the inner workings of her kitchen such as her counter tops, and the areas where her sink, stove, and fridge would go.
 
After the flooring and counter tops were done she moved on to installing light fixtures, and most of the inner workings of her bathroom. She opted to use a shower rather than a bath tub, and obviously placed a toilet as well. She made sure to use a wax seal so the toilet wouldn't leak later in it's life after it was set. Most people didn't and that was why the toilets around the village were begining to leak and generally rot out.
 
Finally she tied up all the loose ends and did her best at decorating her new home. She'd built her dream house and laid it out exactly how she had wanted it. After a few hours of cleaning and moving things around until they were just perfect she officially marked her final mission as complete and sought out the mizukage in order to announce her success.
 
If they were in their usual spot at the base of the water fall she'd even invite them up to witness the results of her hard work. She was most certianly proud of it.
 
*)
(*Mana || The girl simply nodded to the elder shinobi before turning to face the tree she'd been instructed to try the technique on. If it was as simple as focusing chakra to her feet; she assumed she'd be able to ace the jutsu without putting forth much effort.
 
As a result of that thought she hastily set forth toward the tree. It was as if she were playing chicken with it at first, but she finally leaped into the air miliseconds before making contact with the tree. This allowed the base of her feet to make contact with the bark and she'd continue to run while focusing a large amount of chakra to her feet. She only realised she was focusing too much when her right foot litteraly stuck into the tree and caused her to trip up and fall back to the earth where she'd land harshly on her back followed by her head recoiling into the cold hard ground below.
 
"Damnet..."
 
she uttered under her breath. This didn't do much to deter her; however, as she swiftly rose back to her feet and set her gaze upon the tree once more. She had been close to success and only needed to make one minor adjustment to actually succeed. She began to run at the tree again, but this time formed a tiger seal as a means to help her focus her chakra. A moderate amount was redirected to her feet and she lept once again upwards. This time she found the happy medium in focus and made her way to the top of the tree before doing a backflip and floating back to the ground gracefully.
 
Upon her success she walked across the water without much effort to report her success to her teacher...she'd even ask,(*Mana || Once again; the girl observed closely as the elder shinobi explained the technique before demonstrating it. She automatically cut it into smaller pieces within her mind and formulated a plan for carrying out the technique. This one was going to be much more difficult for her...that much was certain. She had absolutely no practice in utilizing her doton element, but she'd do her best to mimic his motions.
 
Firstly she formed the seals and focused on enveloping herself in chakra...so that it'd form a veil. This was quick to fail; however, as she never actually started moving following that motion. Damn...the ground below her seemed pretty hard. She sighed quite loudly before redirecting her focus back to the task at hand. She wouldn't allow herself to be discouraged.
 
Once again she performed the string of seals, but unknowingly messed up on one of them. A simple finger being out of place, but it was enough to mess up the rest of the process of the technique. This time the veil was slightly more complete, but was out of whack due to the chakra being focused poorly as a result of the missed seal.
 
<Damnet...>
 
she cursed to herself. Once again she began to form the seals. Her chakra pool was actually quite low; unlike her stamina pool and she was starting to feel mental fatigue as a result. One or two more tries was all she had left in her, and this try was already messed up by her lack of focus on completing the technique. She had almost sank, but as soon as she started thinking about how much chakra she had left she stopped with her calves submerged into the ground.
 
<SO close....this time for sure.>
 
she told herself. It had to be this time, or she'd have to wait for another day to learn it. She'd be spent mentally after this attempt. After freeing herself from the ground she formed the seals once again while focusing on her chakra in order to create an enveloping veil as previously shown by the elder shinobi. Once it was formed she slowly began to sink into the ground.
 
She moved a short distance, but when she reemerged she grabbed one of the elder shinobi's feet and yelled out,
 
"Boo!"
 
in an attempt to scare him. A deivous laugh would surely follow her attempt regardless of success or failure.*)*Mana || The girl observed the demonstration the man performed as a means to teacher her the jutsu in quesiton. Moreso she took apart every piece of information that was offered before her and split them into smaller sections to tackle. It seemed like a lot of jutsu focused on simply pooling chakra. She could tie logic to that really, but it was still starting to grow kind of old to her as a concept.
 
<I'll do my best.>
 
she thought to herself before mimicing the string of sealts the man had demonstrated. While she mimic'd the seals she did her best to pool chakra within her gut before allowing it to flow upwards. This was similar to what she'd do with her other jutsu; so the whole process was not completely foreign to her. If anything it was a little easier. Unfortunately for her she just ended up spitting out a modest amount of water. SIlly her...she'd forgot to hold it in and let it build up.
 
The second time she performed the seals and allowed her chakra to pool once more. This time she slipped on a seal mid way through completion which instantly resulted in her failure of learning the technique,
 
<Damnet...one more time.>
 
the girl told herself before once again performing the set of seals. This time she went -very- slowly and began to pool her chakra once again. As the process of the hand seals came to an end the chakra reached her mouth and caused her cheaks to puff up,
 
"Suiton: Mizurappa!"
 
she chanted within her head before expelling a decent amount of water in the direction of her teacher. Damnet she'd forgotten she was facing him...good thing it wouldn't do much damage considering she had little to no ability in actually using ninjutsu. *)
(*Mana || The girl hastily read the second scroll offered to her. It was another simple mission, but she knew it was more about how she carried it out than whether it actually had impact on the village, or really anyone for that matter. Unless one of those crazy cat ladies owned the cat; then it became as simple as causing one pain(the cat) while helping the other(the crazy cat lady). Her thoughts loomed for several moments, clouding her vision. THUMP! She'd ran straight into a wall. Almost as immediately as it happened a bruise began to appear on her head where she'd made contact, "Oww..." the girl moaned before raising back to her feet and rubbing the area of impact. That's what she got for allowing herself to be distracted. If it were a real mission and she were actually dealing with enemies than meant to draw her blood; that action could have very well spelt the end of her life as it stood.
 
She arose to her feet, albeit slowly, and began to run again. Curious eyes surveyed every open shop, house, alleyway, and even trash cans in search for her prey. The village was quite large and the cat was quite small; so it took her a considerable amount of time. House after house, shop after shop, garbage can after garbage can she searched. When this method proved fruitless she decided to start asking around. Unfortunately for her; however, most people didn't really keep their eyes open for a small cat. Just when she was about to give up and take a break from the task she was given a tip that may very well ultimately lead to the apprehension of the damned cat.
 
She had been informed that the cat loomed in the very origin of her search--it loomed in the area that surrounded the academy. The girl traveled there as quickly as her legs were willing to take her. She never semed to tire, which really worked to her advantage. She knew every second passed was a second that the cat was actively moving. A second that it was making it's grand escape from her acquisition. She hadn't been given a time limit, but there was always the overbearing limit of her patience.
 
Finally arriving back at the kage academy; the girl quickly observed the immediate scene. The kage was still in vision along with the younger child who's identity was lost to her. There was no immediate sign of the cat being there which caused the girl to allow a long, drawn out sigh to escape her lips. Maybe she'd been given false information...maybe the man she'd asked was actually harboring the cat. Maybe he was beginning a rebellion against the crazy cat ladies of Kirigakure. This must of been his grand scheme to to liberate all of the poor kitties that were being abducted from the usual garbage filled ally on a daily basis. The ones that were being forced into a life of constantly being pampered. A life of never having to go farther than a few steps for a meal. A horrible life for them indeed.
 
THUMP! She'd been distracted again and mindlessly ran into another object. THis time it was a random passerby who'd been carrying a cart that seemed full of cabages. The cart broke and all of the cabages spilt out only to meet their demise at the feet of several passerbys whom mindlessly squashed them. This completely obliterated the spirit of the cabage man and caused him to yell out at ths top of his lungs while slamming both of his palms onto each side of his head,
 
"MY CABBAGES!!!"
 
The girl rose back to her feet before taking off. She wasn't going to stick around only to be scolded by the man. She had bigger...or perhaps smaller things to take care of. In what was honestly a last ditch survey her eyes finally landed on the item that she'd been searching for. The very item that she had scowered the whole village for, and searched nearly every nook and cranny that existed. It laid there...sleeping on the porch of the academy.
 
Blending in with the sound of the other passerbys that constantly passed through the academy; the girl was able to casually walk up to the cat without waking it up. In one swoop the cat was scooped up and placed into her caring arms. With her objective in hand the girl made her way back to the kage with her head still noticeably red,
 
"Here's your cat, sir."*)
 
(*Mana || After delivering the cat; the girl rubbed the spot on her head that was now pretty bruised due busted blood vessesls and such. The nerves were starting to send messages of pain to her brain, but she was able push the pain back and focus on her task at hand.
 After grabbing a broom from the janitor's closet in the academy the girl made her way outside and toward the kage mansion. Once there she decided it'd be most logical to start at the bottom and make her way down. That way she didn't dirty the steps by standing on what she had just swept while she cleaned. That would happen if she had started at the bottom and made her way up. It was always a warp in logic that seemed to bug her when she saw other people sweeping. She was no expert in the matter, but she didn't agree with the expert's methods. If you're gonna sweep you should at least do it right. Yup.
 As she made her way down the steps she completely eradicated any of the dust that once laid at rest upon the surface of the steps with each fell swoop. She didn't tire, but she did grow bored as she worked. She began to sing aloud to entertain herself while at the same time making a spectacle of herself for passerbys that better not fucking plan on going up the steps of the kage mansion.
"Carry on my wayward son...." she sung, "Don't stop beleving!" and continued to sweep. It seemed like with each swipe she switched songs, "It's more than a feeling!" This carried on for several moments until she had finally finished the task at hand. She'd write down details of her success before making her way back to the academy courtyard where she assumed the mizukage still remained. Her assumption was correct and the scroll was handed over in a swift manner, "Done!'*)
 
(*Mana || Once again the girl made her way over to the base of the waterfall where her beloved mizukage was generally to be found standing. Instead of swimming as she normally did; the girl this time simply walked atop the water via employing the aid of her chakra via redirecting a small amount of it to her feet. It slightly drained her, but not enough to realistically make much of a difference in the long run. She didn't intend on using any techniques in the near future anyhow. She'd been taught a few, but that wasn't where her heart rested at the moment. She wanted to mainly focus on honing her skills in taijutsu. She wanted it to be her main form of engagement...and the jutsu to be her crutch in case she faced someone whom the taijutsu would not work against. She also had one final trump card in mind, but that didn't matter for now.
 
After being lost within her own thoughts momentarily the girl managed to recenter her focus upon the objective at hand. She drew a single scroll from her back pouch which contained the details of her first mission. After a few momnets of reading she came to the conclusion that she needed to run and pick up a scroll before returning it to their contact. That was pretty easy, but also boring. It was also a workout; so the girl couldn't really be too upset about it overall.
 
The scroll was placed in a secured box at the entrance to the village. The girl was pretty much starting on the complete opposite side which made the task a little bit more daunting, but nothing compared to building a house, or even really digging a hole. As soon as she was off her pace never fell below what was a jog when moving around civilians that also occupied the inner walkways of the village. She wasn't going to be rude and run through them, but that also slowed her down slightly.
 
Before long she had made it across the village and proceeded to secure the letter before turning on the return trip. This time she focused on maintaining a constant, stubstainable pace that'd allow her to not tire herself out before she started the next two missions. Once again she ran for a few momnets before making it back to her starting point.
 
"Here ya go sir!"
 
she stated in a cheerful voice before tossing the letter over to her contact. She waved him off and waited for him to fade out of sight before moving onto the next scroll she'd been given previously by the kage. This one contained details of another escaped cat in the village. It seemed the crazy cat lady was at it again. The girl felt sorrow for the poor cat deep down, but knew that the village pretty much -had- to take any funds they could get and that the crazy cat lady was more than likely paying a decent sum of cash to have said cat returned to her possession.
 
The girl set off once again; firstly checking the academy to see if it had returned to it's slumbeirng spot. Unfortunately for her she came to the realization that it wasn't going to be that easy again upon seeing that the spot the cat occupied before was empty. This meant it was most likely up and about in the village which broaded her search to pretty much anywhere and everywhere. She sighed audibly before turning on her heels and taking off toward the exit of the academy courtyard,
 
"Now if I was a cat...where would I be?"
 
she asked herself under her breath. She spent the next several moments checking through most of the general stores. She figured it was possible for the cat to make it inside of them due to their doors remaining open for a large portion of the time within the village when it wasn't raining. Originally her search showed promise when she was able to locate what seemed like shedding in one of the stores. It was a match to the colour of fur the cat possessed, but the cat was nowhere to be found after extensive searching within the store,
 
"Just missed him..."
 
the girl thought to herself as she made her way out of the front door and back into the main passageway throughout the village. Next she decided to check around the allies and garbage cans. Perhaps the cat had grown hungry and went to search for itself some food. If that was the case the alleys were perfect since it'd be able to devour both mice and old food that had been thrown out.
 
Unfortunately she hadn't managed to find anything, but was given another tip by a passerby that had taken note of her extensive searching. Upon asking her what she was doing and her explaining her mission to the man he informed her that he'd saw a cat of a similar description sleeping on the top of the steps to the academy a few minutes prior to his encounter with her. The girl slammed her palm into her face then made her way toward the academy. He must of eaten then went to take a nap.
 
When she made it back her target was clearly in sight before her. It was just as the man had said. The cat laid at the top of the steps comfortably asleep. Once again the girl inched her way toward it, before pouncing on it at the final second of her approach. Success! She'd once again captured the cat. Now she made her way back to the owner to complete her second mission. She gave the cat three or so days before it escaped again and she'd have to go and hunt it down just as before,
 
"Damn crazy cat ladies and their cats..."
 
she thought to herself, cursing the trivial task that she found herself subjective to multiple times. Finally she drew the third scroll and examined the inner writing. Now she found that she had to hunt down a dog that was reported to have been attacking children and the such within the village. This meant that it was vicious and she'd most likely find herself putting it down after contact.
 
It was a gruesome task, but someone had to do it. She wasn't strong, but she was in the happy medium if not being too weak and not being too strong to waste her time with such a manner. After a few moments she found herself standing in the location where the dog had been reported to doing it's dirty deeds. It didn't take her long to find the dog considering it came running -at- her right off the bat. This would be bad if she was a civilian, but it played to her favor as a shinobi. She'd taken a few classes in the academy about how to effectively kill a dog in the least painful way for it without using a weapon. The manner she intended to use wouldn't even require blood being drawn from the target.
 
When it finally pounced upwards at the girl she allowed it to bite into her arm. She didn't even flinch in response to the pain inflicted in the area due to her stronger than normal frame, and used the opening to grasp the dog's head. In a singular motion she twisted it tightly which in turn instantly broke it's neck and rendered it lifeless. She grasped the now dead dog and drug it across the village back to the kage as proof of her completion of the mission,
 
"The deed is done; though I honestly wish there would have been an alternate way of handling it."
 
her words came in a rather sad tone, it was clear that she was mentally troubled by the action she had completed, but it was for the sake of the village so she forced herself to move past it. Now she made her way across the village and found herself witnessing her best friend interacting with a male she did not know,

"Probably not going to like every moment of this."* - Mon Nov  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued eastward. The terrain had yet to shift to the desert she so despised. She honestly hated every moment she had to spend within the place known as Sunagakure, but she had her first mission and intended on doing her best to complete it.

The mission was unlike any other she'd been given before. The details were fresh on her mind, but she honestly wondered how she'd go about completing it. The girl was usually an introvert, but it seemed that'd all have to change if she was to do her part,

On the outside the girl appeared to be fully attentive and to be taking in every detail that was spoken.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) stepped forward albeit hesitantly. She wasn't exactly sure why the man knew her name, or why he wanted her to step forward.* - Mon Nov  9 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You wanted a mission, right Mana? - Mon Nov  9 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That'd be correct. - Mon Nov  9 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll be off. - Mon Nov  9 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) approached the kazekage for her first mission in her new home. The man was much more intimidating to her than the previous Mizukage had been. He gave off a certain vibe that simply put her on edge. When she entered his office she took notice of another individual whom currently seemed to be engaged in conversation with the kage. Before the girl could leave out of respect and return at a later time she was asked to step forward which she did. After voicing her reasoning for coming the kage tossed her a singular mission scroll and sent her on her marry way.

The girl was still bugged by the overall climate of her new home. She favored grass over sand, coolness over heat, and parcipitation over not. There wasn't much she could do; however, and she'd simply have to put up with things in their current state. When she finally made her way out of the kage's building; she turned to face eastward. From there she began to walk at a brisk pace.

While she walked she took the time to examine the scroll that had been given to her. It seemed that she needed to deliver a few items to the samurai settlement. The girl was kind of shocked at what the mission had instructed her to do. She'd never seen anything greater than an e rank before, and those usually just had her pick up trash, sweep steps, dig holes, chase cats, chase dogs, or build houses. Actually leaving the village and making a delivery was something completely alien to the girl to say the least, but she liked it. It made her feel like her actions actually mattered.

After following the path toward the east side of the village for a fair amount of time the girl found herself at the main gate. Several guards remained idle at the gate. After showing proof of her mission the girl was allowed through the gate and out into the vast unknown. Before her lied a large amount of desert that she'd have to traverse in order to complete her mission as it had been given. She'd passed by the settlement at an earlier time and thus had a vague idea of where it was and how she needed to get there.

The girl assumed that the mission itself wouldn't be that difficult. It'd just be time consuming and take her a while to get to where she was going. The desert climate was definitely harsh, but she was able to weather the storm despite her lack of eagerness to do so. Doing her journey she commonly found succumbing to the harsh elements and overall dryness of the terrain. This forced her to make an occasional stop here and there to take a drink before contuing her trek eastward.

As she ran the san filled her shoes from time to time. This within itself presented an annoyance for the girl even if she could simply ignore it. She wanted to complete the mission as quickly as possible so she did her best to not stop despite her own discomfort. Physically she never really grew tired, but mentally the vast blankness that was the desert weighed in on her conciousness.

The dry air scraped away at the back of her throat. This caused a burning sensation to take root and grow within her throat. Eventually she began to taste blood in the back of her mouth, but this was pretty normal for someone who had been running for an extended period of time. She constantly found herself flicking her tounge around her mouth in a futile attempt to keep it moist. 

The further east the girl made it, the more the terrain shifted to her favour. The large amount of sand eventually began to shift back into the grass that she'd come to know and love. The bottom of her feet were growing sore with every step taken, and by now her entire body was covered in a coat of sweat in an unconcious attempt to cool herself down. This was overall healthy for her because it allowed her body to clense itself of excess salt and such. It also burned some of the energy than her body had stored as excess from food she'd eaten.

The girl decided to stop every now and then to practice a few techniques she'd learned. The first being the taijutsu move she'd previously been shown by Marissa. It involed a large amount of quick sweeping kicks that ended in a hill drop. It was a pretty dangerous move the girl decided and it could easily be one of her most dangerous. She wished to gain a mastery for it that'd be comparable to that of her other taijutsu skills. She found more difficulty in doing so because of the fact that the jutsu she was now working on was considered a c-rank unlike her other taijutsu moves which were d and e ranks respectively.

The girl formed a single handseal and focused her chakra. The result of this gesture was a burst of white smoke appearing next to her before ultimately dispersing to reveal an identicle clone of the female beside her. This clone possessed a shadow and was much more real than a clone created using the illusionary clone jutsu. It actually had mass and proved useful to the girl during her practice sessions.

Immediately the girl charged toward her clone. Once within the proper distance for her technique to be carried out she directed a swift kick toward the base of her opponent. The lower kick was linked into a middle kick which ultimately led into a kicker toward the upper portion of her opponent's body. She wasn't finished yet; however, as a final attack was directed toward the top of her opponent's head in the form of a heel drop. The final strike landed with much more force than one may expect and caused the clone to disperse upon impact.

The girl thereafter landed back to the ground and immediately dropped into the push up position. She was not happy with the outcome of her strike and decided she'd have to punish herself. She was still in the middle of nowhere and on a mission, but she figured she was making great time already and it wouldn't really matter if she stopped to better herself. 

She spread her hands to disperse the amount of weight that was focused in one spot of the sand below her. If she didn't do this she'd simply sink when she opted to continue. In a single motion she lifted her entire body using her arms while her legs were fully extended. Her feet were placed toe down into the soil while touching eachother. 

The girl continued to repeat this motion methodically. Each time she fully extended her arms she counted a number in her head. After several minutes of constant physical exertion the girl landed on the number she'd given herself as a punishment. That number being one thousand. She briskly rose to her feet once again and set off eastward at a little more than a jogging pace to make up for the time she spent stopped.

By now her body was beginning to burn. She had amazing stamina, but she'd already exterted more upon herself physically than she assumed any normal person her level could take. All of it was starting to take it's toll on the girl's physical and mental fortitude. This was the perfect workout for her, and she loved every second of it. It was just a d rank mission, but she felt like she was gaining much more simply delivering this item than she ever did on any other mission she'd been given. 

The girl decided to take drastic measures in increasing her own physical ability. The heat was starting to get to her, and she decided it'd be best to update her outfit. The scarf and coat she normally wore simply didn't mesh with the climate of Sunagakure. She drew a folded up item from the seemingly infinite abyss that most ninja seemed to have access to for storage of their items. 

It ultimately became clear that the girl had drawn a green jump suit from that place. It was flat out ugly, and any normal person wouldn't be caught dead in such a thing. The poor girl was clueless; however, as she hadn't saw many people in Sunagakure, but was informed by the man that gave her the suit that it was the pinnacle of fashion within the village. That person also wore one so she assumed he wasn't lying. 

After changing the girl instantly noted that it was indeed easier to move. It also allowed better airflow to her skin which made things cooler. Functionality was definitely something the suit had going for it, but she still wondered how anyone could find it fashionable. She decided it'd be best to simply not think about it and continue her trek eastward. 

The more the girl ran, the more she took a liking to her new outfit. She couldn't lie and say that it wasn't comfortable. She couldn't say she didn't like the way it clung to her skin. The way it just felt...right. It was far less restrictive than what she had previously wore as well. This all added up to her decision to keep wearing it despite it's look. It just felt...right.

After several more moments of running the desert climate had been completely replaced by the grassland that she completely loved. It was like being reunited with an old friend. She stopped immediately and allowed herself to fall into the grass. If she'd been wearing her jacket and scraf then they'd be in threat of aquiring grass stains, but since her jump suit was green she didn't have to worry about it. Just another plus to the jump suit.

She began to make grass angels and loss sight of her objective for several moments. She laughed, and even shed a few happy tears. The temperature was perfect and the smell of rain flooded her nostrils. This was something she hadn't experience in over a month since she left her homeland to seek out the village hidden in the desert. She called that place home, and was now a shinobi of it, but her heart could never be at home in such a harsh enviroment regardless of how kind the inhabitants were, or however many friends she made there.

After being lost in her own delight for several moments the girl decided it'd be best to set up camp and continue her trek after the rain had passed. It was also growing dark. Hastily the girl searched for supplies that'd allow her to create a makeshift shelter. Her thoughts loomed back to her family member who had been slain at the hands of one whom she now followed. The man who existed in and solely loved the forest. He'd taught her most of what she now knew about survival. Without him she'd be utterly lost.

After a small amount of searching the girl managed to gather a couple pieces of dry wood, and some johnson grass. She fished out a nearby lake and caught a few fish as well. She set up the wood in a tee-pee like style then laid the johnson grass in the center. The grass was dry and was easy for the girl to set ablaze. Once ablaze the fire eventually made it's way to the surrounding wood. This resulted in a decent sized campfire being formed. 

Next the girl drew the fish from her pouch and placed them atop the fire that was now in full bloom. The fire offered her heat, and allowed her to cook the fish. Once she felt that the fish were fully cook she removed them from the fire and placed them upon a plate that she just so happened to be carrying. The girl proceeded to consume her meal before calling it a night and going to bed.

The girl was awakened in the earlier hours of the morning by the sound of movement near her small camp. By now the fire had consumed everything she'd gathered to fuel it and had left only smoke and ashes in it's wake. The warmth from it was gone and the coldness of night struck at the girls's skin relentlessly. She found herself shivering out of coldness. The jump suit offered no protection against the elements. This prompted her to swiftly change into her original suit before investigating upon what had made the sound.

After a few moments of searching the girl was able to isloate the origin of the sound. There was a stray dog that seemed to have been enjoying her fire after she had been fallen asleep. It shifted when the fire burned out and the warmth faded which in turn woke the girl up. She simply scratched his head before deciding it best to continue now that she was already awake again.

The girl found herself within the samurai settlement shortly after setting off. She'd actually set up camp only a stone's throw away. Once at the entrance she presented her mission scroll to the guards and was granted access to the inner compound. From there she found whom she had been instructed to deliver the item to and ultimately completed her task. Once said was done she stayed for breakfast before exiting the compound.

Once out of the compound the girl set off eastward and eventually made her way back to the village hidden in the desert. The way back was much more direct since the girl was no longer carrying what she could only assume was important items. 

As she continued westward the climate began to shift. The grass began to fade back to dirt, which eventually became nothing but sand. The moisture in the air began to fade and the girl's entire body fell victim to the harsh elements once again. She began to wonder if she'd ever get use to her new home like everyone else was. She wondered if she'd ever stop lying to herself and calling this place her home; because, it really wasn't her home. Home was where her heart rested and that was still within the place she'd been born into and grown up in. That was within kirigakure; the place that made her the shinobi she now was. 

The thoughts of her past were enough to draw tears from her eyes. Tears that eventually made their way down her face and to the sand below before dissipating into an infinite number of smaller particles that mixed with the sand below her before ultimately fading into the harsh dryness of the desert. 

She considered getting glasses, or something to protect her eyes that were constantly under attack by sand particles that were swept up by the wind and blown into her general direction. These caused her eyes to itch, and overall annoyed her, but she was able to mostly move past it with time.  

She found herself back at the gate over the course of a couple hours and was allowed back inside the village after showing the rather forgetful guards her sungakure headband. Once back inside the village the girl made her way straight back to the kage house to report her success to the kazekage. Once said was done she'd accept her award and move on.* - Mon Nov  9 21:32:22 2015
