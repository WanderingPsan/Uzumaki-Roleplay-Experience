<br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm back from the samurai settlement. The mission went without complications and is now complete. - Mon Nov  9 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) (*Mana approached the kazekage for her first mission in her new home. The man was much more intimidating to her than the previous Mizukage had been. He gave off a certain vibe that simply put her on edge. When she entered his office she took notice of another individual whom currently seemed to be engaged in conversation with the kage. Before the girl could leave out of respect and return at a later time she was asked to step forward which she did. After voicing her reasoning for coming the kage tossed her a singular mission scroll and sent her on her marry way.

The girl was still bugged by the overall climate of her new home. She favored grass over sand, coolness over heat, and parcipitation over not. There wasn't much she could do; however, and she'd simply have to put up with things in their current state. When she finally made her way out of the kage's building; she turned to face eastward. From there she began to walk at a brisk pace.

While she walked she took the time to examine the scroll that had been given to her. It seemed that she needed to deliver a few items to the samurai settlement. The girl was kind of shocked at what the mission had instructed her to do. She'd never seen anything greater than an e rank before, and those usually just had her pick up trash, sweep steps, dig holes, chase cats, chase dogs, or build houses. Actually leaving the village and making a delivery was something completely alien to the girl to say the least, but she liked it. It made her feel like her actions actually mattered.

After following the path toward the east side of the village for a fair amount of time the girl found herself at the main gate. Several guards remained idle at the gate. After showing proof of her mission the girl was allowed through the gate and out into the vast unknown. Before her lied a large amount of desert that she'd have to traverse in order to complete her mission as it had been given. She'd passed by the settlement at an earlier time and thus had a vague idea of where it was and how she needed to get there.

The girl assumed that the mission itself wouldn't be that difficult. It'd just be time consuming and take her a while to get to where she was going. The desert climate was definitely harsh, but she was able to weather the storm despite her lack of eagerness to do so. Doing her journey she commonly found succumbing to the harsh elements and overall dryness of the terrain. This forced her to make an occasional stop here and there to take a drink before contuing her trek eastward.

As she ran the san filled her shoes from time to time. This within itself presented an annoyance for the girl even if she could simply ignore it. She wanted to complete the mission as quickly as possible so she did her best to not stop despite her own discomfort. Physically she never really grew tired, but mentally the vast blankness that was the desert weighed in on her conciousness.

The dry air scraped away at the back of her throat. This caused a burning sensation to take root and grow within her throat. Eventually she began to taste blood in the back of her mouth, but this was pretty normal for someone who had been running for an extended period of time. She constantly found herself flicking her tounge around her mouth in a futile attempt to keep it moist. 

The further east the girl made it, the more the terrain shifted to her favour. The large amount of sand eventually began to shift back into the grass that she'd come to know and love. The bottom of her feet were growing sore with every step taken, and by now her entire body was covered in a coat of sweat in an unconcious attempt to cool herself down. This was overall healthy for her because it allowed her body to clense itself of excess salt and such. It also burned some of the energy than her body had stored as excess from food she'd eaten.

The girl decided to stop every now and then to practice a few techniques she'd learned. The first being the taijutsu move she'd previously been shown by Marissa. It involed a large amount of quick sweeping kicks that ended in a hill drop. It was a pretty dangerous move the girl decided and it could easily be one of her most dangerous. She wished to gain a mastery for it that'd be comparable to that of her other taijutsu skills. She found more difficulty in doing so because of the fact that the jutsu she was now working on was considered a c-rank unlike her other taijutsu moves which were d and e ranks respectively.

The girl formed a single handseal and focused her chakra. The result of this gesture was a burst of white smoke appearing next to her before ultimately dispersing to reveal an identicle clone of the female beside her. This clone possessed a shadow and was much more real than a clone created using the illusionary clone jutsu. It actually had mass and proved useful to the girl during her practice sessions.

Immediately the girl charged toward her clone. Once within the proper distance for her technique to be carried out she directed a swift kick toward the base of her opponent. The lower kick was linked into a middle kick which ultimately led into a kicker toward the upper portion of her opponent's body. She wasn't finished yet; however, as a final attack was directed toward the top of her opponent's head in the form of a heel drop. The final strike landed with much more force than one may expect and caused the clone to disperse upon impact.

The girl thereafter landed back to the ground and immediately dropped into the push up position. She was not happy with the outcome of her strike and decided she'd have to punish herself. She was still in the middle of nowhere and on a mission, but she figured she was making great time already and it wouldn't really matter if she stopped to better herself. 

She spread her hands to disperse the amount of weight that was focused in one spot of the sand below her. If she didn't do this she'd simply sink when she opted to continue. In a single motion she lifted her entire body using her arms while her legs were fully extended. Her feet were placed toe down into the soil while touching eachother. 

The girl continued to repeat this motion methodically. Each time she fully extended her arms she counted a number in her head. After several minutes of constant physical exertion the girl landed on the number she'd given herself as a punishment. That number being one thousand. She briskly rose to her feet once again and set off eastward at a little more than a jogging pace to make up for the time she spent stopped.

By now her body was beginning to burn. She had amazing stamina, but she'd already exterted more upon herself physically than she assumed any normal person her level could take. All of it was starting to take it's toll on the girl's physical and mental fortitude. This was the perfect workout for her, and she loved every second of it. It was just a d rank mission, but she felt like she was gaining much more simply delivering this item than she ever did on any other mission she'd been given. 

The girl decided to take drastic measures in increasing her own physical ability. The heat was starting to get to her, and she decided it'd be best to update her outfit. The scarf and coat she normally wore simply didn't mesh with the climate of Sunagakure. She drew a folded up item from the seemingly infinite abyss that most ninja seemed to have access to for storage of their items. 

It ultimately became clear that the girl had drawn a green jump suit from that place. It was flat out ugly, and any normal person wouldn't be caught dead in such a thing. The poor girl was clueless; however, as she hadn't saw many people in Sunagakure, but was informed by the man that gave her the suit that it was the pinnacle of fashion within the village. That person also wore one so she assumed he wasn't lying. 

After changing the girl instantly noted that it was indeed easier to move. It also allowed better airflow to her skin which made things cooler. Functionality was definitely something the suit had going for it, but she still wondered how anyone could find it fashionable. She decided it'd be best to simply not think about it and continue her trek eastward. 

The more the girl ran, the more she took a liking to her new outfit. She couldn't lie and say that it wasn't comfortable. She couldn't say she didn't like the way it clung to her skin. The way it just felt...right. It was far less restrictive than what she had previously wore as well. This all added up to her decision to keep wearing it despite it's look. It just felt...right.

After several more moments of running the desert climate had been completely replaced by the grassland that she completely loved. It was like being reunited with an old friend. She stopped immediately and allowed herself to fall into the grass. If she'd been wearing her jacket and scraf then they'd be in threat of aquiring grass stains, but since her jump suit was green she didn't have to worry about it. Just another plus to the jump suit.

She began to make grass angels and loss sight of her objective for several moments. She laughed, and even shed a few happy tears. The temperature was perfect and the smell of rain flooded her nostrils. This was something she hadn't experience in over a month since she left her homeland to seek out the village hidden in the desert. She called that place home, and was now a shinobi of it, but her heart could never be at home in such a harsh enviroment regardless of how kind the inhabitants were, or however many friends she made there.

After being lost in her own delight for several moments the girl decided it'd be best to set up camp and continue her trek after the rain had passed. It was also growing dark. Hastily the girl searched for supplies that'd allow her to create a makeshift shelter. Her thoughts loomed back to her family member who had been slain at the hands of one whom she now followed. The man who existed in and solely loved the forest. He'd taught her most of what she now knew about survival. Without him she'd be utterly lost.

After a small amount of searching the girl managed to gather a couple pieces of dry wood, and some johnson grass. She fished out a nearby lake and caught a few fish as well. She set up the wood in a tee-pee like style then laid the johnson grass in the center. The grass was dry and was easy for the girl to set ablaze. Once ablaze the fire eventually made it's way to the surrounding wood. This resulted in a decent sized campfire being formed. 

Next the girl drew the fish from her pouch and placed them atop the fire that was now in full bloom. The fire offered her heat, and allowed her to cook the fish. Once she felt that the fish were fully cook she removed them from the fire and placed them upon a plate that she just so happened to be carrying. The girl proceeded to consume her meal before calling it a night and going to bed.

The girl was awakened in the earlier hours of the morning by the sound of movement near her small camp. By now the fire had consumed everything she'd gathered to fuel it and had left only smoke and ashes in it's wake. The warmth from it was gone and the coldness of night struck at the girls's skin relentlessly. She found herself shivering out of coldness. The jump suit offered no protection against the elements. This prompted her to swiftly change into her original suit before investigating upon what had made the sound.

After a few moments of searching the girl was able to isloate the origin of the sound. There was a stray dog that seemed to have been enjoying her fire after she had been fallen asleep. It shifted when the fire burned out and the warmth faded which in turn woke the girl up. She simply scratched his head before deciding it best to continue now that she was already awake again.

The girl found herself within the samurai settlement shortly after setting off. She'd actually set up camp only a stone's throw away. Once at the entrance she presented her mission scroll to the guards and was granted access to the inner compound. From there she found whom she had been instructed to deliver the item to and ultimately completed her task. Once said was done she stayed for breakfast before exiting the compound.

Once out of the compound the girl set off eastward and eventually made her way back to the village hidden in the desert. The way back was much more direct since the girl was no longer carrying what she could only assume was important items. 

As she continued westward the climate began to shift. The grass began to fade back to dirt, which eventually became nothing but sand. The moisture in the air began to fade and the girl's entire body fell victim to the harsh elements once again. She began to wonder if she'd ever get use to her new home like everyone else was. She wondered if she'd ever stop lying to herself and calling this place her home; because, it really wasn't her home. Home was where her heart rested and that was still within the place she'd been born into and grown up in. That was within kirigakure; the place that made her the shinobi she now was. 

The thoughts of her past were enough to draw tears from her eyes. Tears that eventually made their way down her face and to the sand below before dissipating into an infinite number of smaller particles that mixed with the sand below her before ultimately fading into the harsh dryness of the desert. 

She considered getting glasses, or something to protect her eyes that were constantly under attack by sand particles that were swept up by the wind and blown into her general direction. These caused her eyes to itch, and overall annoyed her, but she was able to mostly move past it with time.  

She found herself back at the gate over the course of a couple hours and was allowed back inside the village after showing the rather forgetful guards her sungakure headband. Once back inside the village the girl made her way straight back to the kage house to report her success to the kazekage. Once said was done she'd accept her award and move on.*)* - Mon Nov  9 21:54:33 2015
