<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Just food for thought. - Mon Nov  2 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: That simple. - Mon Nov  2 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Do you believe material items take higher priority than social ties? - Mon Nov  2 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well wouldn't in theory. - Mon Nov  2 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Social ties be more important? - Mon Nov  2 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I really couldn't say what i'd do if I was presented a situation to choose. - Mon Nov  2 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Material things come and go. - Mon Nov  2 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I could say that and feel like it's the best answer, but if the actual situaiton presented itself.. - Mon Nov  2 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't think I could be sure in what i'd choose. - Mon Nov  2 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It would depend on the material item. - Mon Nov  2 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: If the material item was say, great enough to save the social tie. - Mon Nov  2 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You'd pick it. - Mon Nov  2 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: But if the social tie, could get you the material item, or better, you'd pick that. - Mon Nov  2 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I believe? - Mon Nov  2 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Hmm.. - Mon Nov  2 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The material item can take several forms I guess. - Mon Nov  2 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  2 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The problem is if you don't know exactly how great that item is. - Mon Nov  2 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess you'll never know until in the situation. - Mon Nov  2 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm sorry. - Mon Nov  2 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The fact I don't know how i'd act in the moment. - Mon Nov  2 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why not simply. - Mon Nov  2 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Block the thought. - Mon Nov  2 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And wait to find the answer once you're there. - Mon Nov  2 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Or, I have another solution for you. - Mon Nov  2 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you'd like? - Mon Nov  2 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Which is? - Mon Nov  2 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm indifferent toward the food, so obviously I don't need it. - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: If it was something I wanted; however, could I say the same? - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Well. - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Like perhaps a hidden taijutsu scroll or something? - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Money perhaps? - Mon Nov  2 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Mon Nov  2 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Never money. - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't see much value in it when I get it for little to nothing. - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: From what I'm hearing. - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You really don't even care about material objects. - Mon Nov  2 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Then there is your answer. - Mon Nov  2 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You'd likely pick social ties. - Mon Nov  2 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Unless training is material - Mon Nov  2 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) silently observed the events before her as they unfolded before her very eyes. The same people she had revered as excellent shinobi; even someone that she may of had other feelings for her proved to be completely incapable of defending themselves from the mericless onslaught set upon them by Ortho. 

The snake he summoned was something the girl couldn't take in. The sheer size, strength, and speed of it was mind boggling to the girl. She doubted in her own ability to even keep up with such a massive creature. The elder shinobi from their village were simply knocked down as they each stepped up. The girl didn't know how to act.

Everything within her wanted to simply charge in and try and save the day. She wanted to run, but before she could run she had to walk. She wanted to walk, but to walk she'd have to be able to will her body to move. This was simply undoable due to the state of fear she found herself in. In the back of her mind she acknowledged that even if she could move; she'd be too outmatched to even make a difference in what seemed like a battle between gods for her.

Tears began to cascade her face when she came to the realization that her beloved family member, Elon, had been rendered unable to move. Anger began to manifest within the center of her body and growed. She closed her eyes, but she couldn't block out the image of his impalement. She couldn't block out the image of the once soft and carring man bathed within his own blood. The image of someone that had assisted her in furthering her progression with the elements. The blood of a cousin.

"Why?" she asked beneath her breath. Her hands now formed into fists. She asked again, "Why...?" Her hands clenched more tightly. Finger nails dug into the smooth skin of her palm which caused a few droplets of blood to make their journey to the ground before splattering into millions of smaller particles. Once again she exclaimed; the question now reached a tone that'd be faintly audible to everyone else, "Why...?" Every part of her being wished to know the answer to her question, but it seemed to just go on. She witnessed the death of a second. The death of the flirtly drunk who'd almost had sexual intercourse with her over a few bottles of sake,

"WHY!?"

she finally exclaimed at the top of her voice. Her sanity temporarily slipped away and was replaced with emotions mixed of pure anger and a lust for revenge. She couldn't simply stand by and allow such to happen even if she agreed with the ultimate outcome of the man's plan. She'd have to do -something- in order to protect those who they had both sworn mutual protection to. She couldn't hold back anymore; she knew she stood little to no chance, but she couldn't allow the actions taken by Ortho to go without a reaciton. This much was now plainly apparent within her eyes.

She focused on the eight chakra points within her body. This was an ability she'd sworn to keep a secret, but now she'd have to use it if she was even to remotely stand a chance in this struggle. She had to try. She suddenly released the first two of the eight major chakra points within her body; otherwise known as the gates. 

Following this action she took off toward Ortho in a sudden burst of strength/speed that'd honestly probably not seem like much to such a seasoned shinobi. If the distance between them was appropriately closed she'd throw her entire body into the air before throwing her foot out before her aiming to land a technique that may catch even the most seasoned shinobi off guard,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) made her way toward the man who'd served as the source of the emotions the girl felt within. Her mentally restrictions were officially lifted. She'd succumed to instinct and acted without forethought. She wasn't about to walk away from this fight without knowing that she gave it her all. That she did everything and left nothing remaining in the tank. She'd prove her worth on the battlefield for her village even if she was just a mission bot. 

As the girl drew closer; the snake grew larger. It wasn't up until she was at the base of it that she realised the task she'd placed before herself. She had a long way to go to simply be on even ground with Ortho regardless of attacking him. Acting in her utmost haste the girl made her way up the snake, and eventually reached the top of it's head. By this point the girl knew that the uchiha was more than knowledgeable of her approach, and that her technique would most likely prove uneffective given the circumstances presented before her.

She clenched her fists tightly, still running. It was now or never, and she was chosing now. All she lusted for was to land one hit. One single hit and she'd be content in atleast knowing that he was human. Knowing that he was able to be struck...that he wasn't a god among men. She released the third major tenketsu located upon her spinal chord. 

Upon being released this caused her skin to adopt a light red colour due to the increased flow of blood through her body. This granted her once again another increase in speed and allowed her to clear the length of the head in a mere second. In that motion she carried through with her original plan of attack and threw her foot forward in a flying kick. 

If the man dodged her she was struck and continued flying through the air right past him. Streaks of crimson instantly became apparent upon the area in which she was struck and she'd proceed to fall back to the cold hard ground below. This along with the strain placed upon her body by gates was enough to force her into submission. Her skin regained it's original color, but she was not short of breath. This showed she possessed the stamina to continue, but not the endurance. (<---that's if I miss. If I hit i'll do something else.)* - Wed Nov  4 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) when she was side stepped the girl's leap of faith turned into a fall of shame. To add to it she was struck by the seasoned shinobi's scalpels. This allowed him to cut directly through the girl's skin and caused streaks of crimson to cover the areas of impact. The momentum behind her missed kick caused her to continue flying before eventually falling straight to the ground beneath the snake. Mixed with the shock of being struck; the girl was done in. She'd failed. She'd hit strike three without one or two.

Her skin returned back to it's original tint while she remained motionless on the ground. Every part of her body ached as a side effect of her method of gaining power. She could barely move at this point, but eventually managed to rise back to her feet. A cold, yellow glare met that of the elder shinobi as she finally asked her question once again in hope of some sort of explanation to be given in the attempt to reconsile with the man she once looked up to,

"Why?"* - Wed Nov  4 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) remained primarily motionless. The girl stood atop shaking legs, and her entire body begged her to simply fall to the ground, but she acted in complete defiance. She'd been offered no explanation and was only left in the dark. Her lust for the answer to her question was unsated, and this left within her a feeling of utter emptiness. Her entire world had been flipped upside down through the actions of one day. She simply couldn't make peace.

Her eyes found their way to the shinobi that had observed the scene that unfolded just as she did. She had no idea how to address them. They didn't even try to act. She couldn't decide whether they were cowards, or simply smarter than her. Maybe they knew they'd stand no chance, or maybe they didn't care enough for those who had fallen. Maybe she cared too much for people who kept themselves distanced from her. She just...didn't know. She was completely lost. The darkness around her began to blind her, and she entered a state of complete vulnerbility. The world around her began to spin as her vision began to fade.

Slowly she'd begin to fall backwards. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head before the entire world faded to black. THUMP! Her body made contact with the ground. It remained motionless to follow, but it was clearly apparent that her breathing remained. Her body had fallen to a mixture of mental and physical strain. Her time awake during this period had been concluded and she'd now rest with the final thought,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) left her home village for the first time upon recieving instruction to make her way to Suna. It was the day after most of the higher ranking shinobi in her village had met their end at the hands of someone she trusted. She didn't really know how she should proceed at this moment. All she knew was the path placed before her and the trail she must follow. The directions to Suna were quite simple and fresh upon her mind. 

She simply needed to run east. This was a task similar to most of the missions she'd been forced to do. With each step she knew she was moving closer to her goal. Her body was still extremely sore from Ortho the day before, but she continued. After several moments of running she'd stop to grab a water bottle from her pouch to drink. She knew it was important to stay hydrated when exterting herself physically.* - Wed Nov  4 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued her journey to Suna. She didn't look behind her in fear of being caught within memory. The sorrow of leaving her home was lessened by the fact that she'd already been thinking of leaving. She didn't like how she was treated by the higher ups. All she did was stupid missions that were meaningless with crappy pay and no respect. She'd actually been scolded for littering after doing several trash collecting missions in the same week.

That acted more to agravate her than anything else. This took away the pride she once felt for her actions. The merit of all she'd accomplished was stripped away like paint on a car being sanded off. Behind it left nothing but doubt; she didn't feel comfortable doing the missions past that point. She used them for physical training before, but was more than willing to find another way. For now she'd call Suna her new home if she was accepted.* - Wed Nov  4 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to run east. The all too familiar feeling of fatigue began to plague the girl. She began to damn herself for not giving her body more time to recover. Even a brief activation of her technique left behind severe reprocussions. If not for her strengthened body and monsterous stamina; the girl would most likely be unable to make the journey without stopping to sleep or something. 

The path seemed to go on forever. She felt like she'd been running for a few days already, and she had just begun. The sound of her feet making contact with the stone that remained constant upon the ground after the grass had faded caught the girl in a sort of trance. For now she'd simply continue to travel in hopes of finding more from her village. Most of them probably died, but there had to be a few left.* - Wed Nov  4 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) had been traveling for a few hours now. She had only stopped one time in her journey. That one time was for food, but nothing else. As soon as she had her fill she continued to make her way. The foresty area that she once resided in had turned into a harsh desert. The area was the complete opposite of what she had adapted to within Suna. She wasn't really sure how she felt about it other than the fact that it was for sure different.

As she continued sweat began to plague her body. Beads flowed down her face before being taken into the wind and ultimately dispersing. This didn't cause the girl to relent; however, she was also annoyed with how the sand somehow found it's way into her shoes. In the distance she was able to make out a mountain like structure. At first she assumed it was just a random mountain, but as she drew closer the more fine details came into focus.

She was able to make out what seemed to be a large gate. There were several shinobi posted as guards at the main entrance and the entire place seemed to be overall fortified. The girl instantly came to the conclusion that she'd arrived at her destination after a large amount of running. When she finally reached the gate the girl'd call out in a breathless tone,

"Hello! I'm Mana; a shinobi from Kirigakure. We recently had a vast amount of our higher ranking shinobi slain which included our kage. I was told to seek refuge here for the time being! If you'd please alert a higher up for me i'd be forever grateful!"

after finishing her speech the girl remained idle and simply waited for someone to come who'd be able to better handle the situation than the shinobi on guard. It seemed to her that they possessed little to no actual power and couldn't grant her access on their own.* - Wed Nov  4 21:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) failed to make direct eye contact with the shinobi. Given that the gourd the man was wearing had to weight a metric shit ton and the fact the he seemed to not struggle with the mass of it at all; the girl was able to tell that he was a pretty strong individual. She'd simply bow to show her respect for her superiors; even if previously they had all been dick bags.

After her bow she locked eyes with the man opposite after taking note of Kana's presence. This meant that some of her fellow shinobi had already arrived within the village and removed the moderate amount of fear she held within the back of her heart that was based upon the chance that the situation was a set up. The girl proceeded to explain,

"Kirigakure. A large amount of her higher ranking shinobi were killed in the recent past. Among them was our kage. I was instructed to evacuate and seek refuge here in Suna. The guy at the gate told me about some lady named Lera and that I should check in with her, but I have absolutely no idea who that is. Could you kindly point me in her direction?"* - Wed Nov  4 22:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) silently stared at Kana. The girl really didn't know about what events had taken place the day before. She questioned if it'd be best to tell her about the actions that had taken place. That her brother had met his own demise. Tears began to threaten the complexion of the girl's face. All of the emotions she'd previously been able to hold within came pouring out. She had to deliver the most painful news ever and she wasn't even sure if it was right. After several moments of silence she finally explained in a low, coarse tone,

"Elon, Violet, and the Mizukage were all slain by Ortho, a large snake, and about 2'500 bandits. Everyone from the village is being sent here.* - Wed Nov  4 22:19:44 2015
