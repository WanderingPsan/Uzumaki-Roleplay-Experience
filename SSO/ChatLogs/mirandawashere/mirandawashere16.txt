<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) observed the actions being carried out by her sensei. The girl simply lacked the reflex and thus took two balls directly to her chest. These sent her sprialing out of control before she slammed into the mountain behind them. She wasn't able to tank the damage of the balls and was thus left unable to fight,

"Ouch..."* - Fri Nov 20 22:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl remained on the ground quite injured. She'd been exposed to much more damage than her teammate who also found theirself injured. The girl scratched her head slightly before struggling back to trembling feet. Her golden gaze found it's way to meet that of Paine before she stated sharply,

"That was no fun."* - Fri Nov 20 23:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) managed to avoid the balls this time around. In response to her finally being able to move the girl aimed to strike a few of the balls out of the air in order to lower the overall threat level of the balls.* - Fri Nov 20 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) missed.* - Fri Nov 20 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Momura has a lot more experience handling balls...why did she get hit again? - Fri Nov 20 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) continued to do sit-ups until he made out the word, "Break". With that the boy stopped his actions and rose back up to a sititng position. By this point his entire body was in some sort of pain in reaction to the work out he'd already subjected himself to. Too bad the boy wasn't dumb enough to think that he was finished for the day.

As the elder cycled through each handseal; the boy did his best to copy it. He stored the image of each seal somewhere into the back of his mind using his nearly photographic memory along with the fact that he performed each one physically. They weren't very hard to remember anyways since they were tied to names already common to the boy.

After the demonstration was complete the boy recieved instruction that informed him of just what his next exercise would be. This resulted in the boy lying on his back once more. Next he bent his knees, placed his feet on the floor, and his hands behind his back.

He was careful to not clasp his fingers before pressing his lower back into the cold, hard floor below him. Next he lifted his head along with his shoulders and his upper back off of the floor. At the same time as performing the former action the boy motioned his right elbow and left knee toward eachother while extending his right leg.

Next he drew his right knee back up while moving his left elbow and right knee toward each other while extending his left leg this time. The boy continued to repeat this motion during the next course of instruction that was to be given by his sensei; his body was now truly beginning to come ablaze with the strain being placed upon it,

<Work through the pain!>* - Fri Nov 20 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mana(Mirandawashere) || The girl found herself being smacked by two balls once again, but this time they barely managed to graze her skin. Her strong frame granted her the resilience and ability to fight through the pain temporarily inflicted by the balls.

The red head immedaitely set off in motion and aimed to close the distance between herself and her sensei before extending her right hand forward aiming to strike her right in the face.

A direct attack which may be unexpected due to the female usually not directly striking out of respect of skill difference.* - Sat Nov 21 00:14:04 2015
