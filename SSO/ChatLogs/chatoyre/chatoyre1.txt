<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) stood in the cactus fields, training with his tanto, cutting down several cactus in the process. All of the sudden, his brother, Torio appeared, cutting down a cactus himself with his flame enhanced tanto. They exchanged words, Torio explaining to his younger brother that their father would be away on a mission for a few weeks so he was in charge at home. After their conversation a spar broke out between the two. 

Despite his skill and abilities that had become greater since the last time they spared, Torii was still a worm in comparison to Torio and failed miserably.* - Wed Sep 09 18:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) has been on his own now for months after finally becoming a genin. Nothing has changed for him though, his life has been just as boring and dull as it was in the past. He has still yet to leave the village, seeing nothing but sand since his promotion. They didn't care about him, or what he did. He was just there to be there.

     The pink haired boy roamed the village, looking for anything to do. He could train, but without anybody helping him or showing him any new techniques it would just be physical training which would benefit him only minimally.* - Wed Nov 25 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) smirks as he enters the village square. His eyes were closed and his headphones covered his ears. His music was on full blast, so even with the muffs somebody could probably make out what was playing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evqvefc4fqM) loudly in his ear but Torii was oblivious to this fact. The pink haired boy just free fell to the ground, right on the nice soft dirt. He looked up into the sky. Today was going to be a good day.* - Wed Nov 25 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) hands behind his head, shoulders up, and legs crossed one untop of the other. One could say Torii was extremely relaxed, as he gazed into the sky. His mind began to wander as the track had changed.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f00fgKzRtdo) He even began singing the lyrics softly to himself.* - Wed Nov 25 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) could feel his chest becoming warm as his music went from track to track. It was on shuffle mode, but somehow it was giving him an awesome playlist he was pretty happy. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ginx7WKq5GE) As the next track played, he got really excited, he just recently downloaded it into his mp3 player.* - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) stretched on the ground like a cat, he was starting to get a bit stiff just sitting there. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=git6DCXSqjE) A more upbeat song finally played which was a nice change of pace from the other song, but that same emotional feel was right there.* - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) saw the women walking past him, she was wearing some pretty cool clothes. He wondered if she had sewn them herself, that would be cool. If she did make em' he wondered if he could convince her to make some for him, and even if she didn't he figured he could ask her who did. 

     He lowered his headphones from his ears, and allowed them to rest around his neck. Ofcourse them being on his ears were the only thing muffling the sound, so now it was a little easier to hear what was playing in the background. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEiXjKKg6PE)

      "Hey. Miss Lady!"* - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) kind of yiked when he saw her eyes she looked tired, so he wouldn't hold her long. She probably hadn't slept in a few days or something like that. "Hey. Who made your clothes, they are super legit."* - Wed Nov 25 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Legit. - Wed Nov 25 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Torii(Chatoyre) nods to the women. It was safe to assume by her words that her mother was going to be making any new clothes anytime soon. Oh well he liked what he wore now anyway. (https://youtu.be/YQHsXMglC9A?t=1m15s) "Oh well. I won't hold you up, just wanted to let you know they looked nice on ya'" he commented, before prepairing to go back into his previous state.* - Wed Nov 25 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Torii(Chatoyre) thinks: She could hear it? Damn... I'm going to go deaf one day... - Wed Nov 25 15:33:58 2015
