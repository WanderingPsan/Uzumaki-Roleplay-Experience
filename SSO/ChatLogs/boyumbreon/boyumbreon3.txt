<br><br><font color=yellow>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) | If she gets out of this alive or not, she is going to find a way to kill both the sluttymae Zenaki and her pet dog Seisuke. Berith was obviously pissed off, there was nothing for her to do.. her movements were paralyzed. She felt as if her life was -- well it was going to be over. If this was all part of Zenaki's plan to get back Fujitora, then by all means but Berith didn't deserve this. And Zenaki isn't going to deserve the ass whooping that Berith will provide to her soon enough.

Her neck being rabbed by the guy, staring into his eyes with her own cold stare. Suddenly a punch was sent to her stomach, thus making her scream enough for anyone to hear her. * - Fri Oct  2 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) was slapped on the face, turning her head to look at Seisuke, gasping for her trying to catch herself back to what she was because this pain wasn't really cutting it for her. "No.. I don't have a boyfriend.... " * - Fri Oct  2 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) looked up at Zenaki, staring at her with her cold eyes. "He was never your love... he was mine... and always will be mine.... " she said coughing lightly to hear Zenaki's voice about her calling her husband 'master' it was really annoying and something that Berith didn't really care. She loves her husband dearly and will do anything to protect him. Feeling the dagger down on her throat, staring at the weapon before her eyes going to meet Zenaki's. "You may kill me... but you will never... feel the love of Fujitora. He's my husban---"

Her eyes widened to feel the dagger piercing right into her throat, blood spurting all over Zenaki. In this moment Berith's eyes started to water as she was thinking about her kids, the adventures she wanted to have with him. With her husband Fujitora by their side. Laughing while the family walked down the green grass, feeling the smooth grass with their feet. It was sunny, beautiful and her dream as a family. But it was all ruined... 

"Fujitora...."

Berith was holding on-to her husband's lucky pick. Thinking of him while all of this was happening, her eyes suddenly closed as the lucky pick that belonged to her husband slowly fell down on the ground like in those movies where someone dies and they held something very dearly of their loved ones. * - Fri Oct  2 22:56:00 2015
