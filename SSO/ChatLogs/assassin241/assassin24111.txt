"Sure, we'll have to make it quick, though." scales grew on his body, there color being maroon, as his eyes form slits, his forked tongue flickered out of his mouth and back in.

".....Your eyes..." he stopped himself, he'll have to wait before telling him, he doesn't want anyone else to know of the bounty, or maybe they already know? Fuck should Hideki know.* - Fri Sep 25 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped, and brang his wrist up to chest level, as he tapped his wrist with his other hand.

"Hehe, sorry. But I have to get going. But I do want to tell you something very important." he stated as he deactivated his snake form.* - Fri Sep 25 01:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) formed handsigns, and bit down on his thumb, as blood trailed off of it. After completeing the handsigns he slammed his palm on the ground, as a plume of smoke appeared around him, and coiled around his forearm was a brownish-black snake. "Aedre, do me another favor will ya?"

The snake hissed at him. "....What now..." the snake seemed rather annoyed.

"Scout around for me." and with that, the snake was off. He went to a nearby tree, sat down next to it, leaning his back on it and started to take a nap.* - Fri Sep 25 01:43:15 2015

Looking at Misa's smile made him smile aswell, it's been awhile since he's actually been happy. With all the bounties on various doujutsu users, and speical trait individuals. Kind of made it hard to feel safe at a time like this. "Alright, Ushinawa knows more than me though. So it would be best to ask him for the techniques." he looked up in the sky, his facial expression was blank. <...One day, I'll avenge you Orakuru. Katsune will pay dearly for what she did to you...>* - Fri Sep 25 06:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Ushinawa as he made his choice. He glared at the individual infront of him.

".....Do you know of an individual by the name of Orakuru?.."* - Fri Sep 25 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Orakuru was allied with Sand during the war against Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What happened to him. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I fought alongside him in war but I don't know anything about the man himself. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He was killed and his body was taken by Zetsumo. - Fri Sep 25 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who killed him. - Fri Sep 25 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I couldn't tell you. - Fri Sep 25 06:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you know him yourself? - Fri Sep 25 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) gripped his gunbai, he slowly took it off of his back. A chain of sorts was obviously connected to the hilt of the gunbai.

"...No, I don't.. But I'm wanting answers on his death." he stated examining his gunbai once more. And looking at Yan.* - Fri Sep 25 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Interesting. - Fri Sep 25 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know anymore...Information? - Fri Sep 25 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't. One of Zetsumo's crew probably killed him. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I see... Katsune is on my hitlist then. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's also likely that that person is in The Hidden Leaf...if it wasn't Zetsumo himself. - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: Poor Hideki... - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed the gunbai back on his back. His hands once again were inside his cloak.

"That's all I needed to know." he started to walk off.

"I don't care if you stay in the village. But don't do anything reckless or e-."  he stopped himself there, as he smirked and said "I think you already know.." as he walked off.* - Fri Sep 25 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Understood. - Fri Sep 25 07:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I forgot Misa is sick. - Fri Sep 25 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped and waited for Misa.

<..This is a drag.> He grabbed Misa and ran off into the sunset like a majestic deer. You're welcome for the image.* - Fri Sep 25 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Did you want to become a snake lycan? - Fri Sep 25 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Well....It's too late to turn back now.... - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ..... - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: So...That doesn't matter. - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: It was a poor mistake, atleast she was given a choice. - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I wish you the best of luck, Misa. - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But there will be more hardships to come with this snake lycan. - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Why did you become a lycan? - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was forced... - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I only wanted to sign a summoning contract. - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . forced? - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She found me when I was training in the forest by myself, pinned me down. And forced the liquid in my syste. - Fri Sep 25 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: No...She couldn't have.... - Fri Sep 25 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You can believe whatever you want. But she's not as innocent as she sounds. - Fri Sep 25 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Don't get me wrong. The first couple days was horrific. My body was changing, I can't even eat certain types of foods anymore. Apparently I'm a 'pit viper'.  - Fri Sep 25 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But, it does come with great powers I will admit that. - Fri Sep 25 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I only wanted the snake summoning regardless, though.. - Fri Sep 25 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: You didn't answer me....Do you regret it? - Fri Sep 25 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...... - Fri Sep 25 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah..I do. - Fri Sep 25 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) wasn't really good with uh...this situation.

He patted her back gently. "I mean, if you -chose- to do it. Then that's on you, you wanted to become a snake lycan. I had no choice, I was forced to do so. But...It can be useful for a lot of things, it just depends what type of snake you transform into." he stated trying to reassure her. Damn, woman are so emotional.* - Fri Sep 25 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ....I can play this off as an act..Possibly. - Fri Sep 25 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to chuckle and nudge her shoulder.

"I was just kidding Misa. I wanted to see your reaction if I said I regretted it. Hehe! I hope you're not mad!" he smiled shortly after at Misa.* - Fri Sep 25 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) lied.

He wasn't normally a liar, but in this case he had to lie. She headbutted his upper body, as he patted her back once again gently, and rubbed it slowly up and down. "Hey, hey. I didn't think this would happen! It was just a joke to lighten the mood. Hehe!" * - Fri Sep 25 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: My cloak is probably going to get wet now.. - Fri Sep 25 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fuck my life.. - Fri Sep 25 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed his hand on Misa's chin, lifting it slightly to make eye contact with Hideki. "Listen, it was just a joke, okay? I didn't think you'd actually uh...Cry... Which I apologize for." he stated as he gave her a warm smile. Although, he kind of knew his cloak would probably get wet from her crying on it, or get snot on it. One of the two.* - Fri Sep 25 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: .... - Fri Sep 25 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
His gaze was kept on Misa, although if she was to continue to look deep into his eyes, there was definately hate fueling inside. He then said "I Promise." this was probably the first time he's actually made a promise to someone, he hopes he doesn't fuck it up. But then he also realized his cloak was wet, and snotty. Which was kind of nasty, but he could clean it later or something.* - Fri Sep 25 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly removed his cloak, that way she woudn't get her cloths snotty. But he accepted the hug. "Hey, I should be the one apologizing." he gave her another warm smile.* - Fri Sep 25 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed his cloak and said "Yeah, I'm going to do the same. We can do this again sometime, and I'll be easy on the jokes. Hehe!" he chuckled before leaving.* - Fri Sep 25 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yo~ - Fri Sep 25 19:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: huh? - Fri Sep 25 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) just got done eating at one of the ramen shops in Kumogakure. He was just about to go to the mansion until he spotted Hanabi, and Mariana. He waved at Mariana, but glared at Hanabi. He spoke toward Hanabi "I got a question to ask you, Hanabi."* - Fri Sep 25 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Misa and I talked last night, did you force her to take the.... substance? - Fri Sep 25 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay, how about a free for all, spar? - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: -- - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Is she trying to kill us? - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: I'm trying to get logs, nigga. - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Shit you right. - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: omit - Fri Sep 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Soooooo, are we sparring? - Fri Sep 25 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped glaring at Hanabi, and looked at Mariana. 

He took out his helmet and placed it on his head and said "Yeah, I'm ready."* - Fri Sep 25 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: LET'S DO THIS!!! - Fri Sep 25 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ..I regret. - Fri Sep 25 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Everything. - Fri Sep 25 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
"Right... I'll make the first move." and with that, he took out a single shuriken, and threw it toward Mariana's current position. Pretty lame to do on his first move, but it would prove effective later on.* - Fri Sep 25 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) omit* - Fri Sep 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ummm. - Fri Sep 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am not really made for sparing. - Fri Sep 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But I will consider it. - Fri Sep 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) gripped his gunbai, slowly taking it off of his back, he looking at Mariana as he thought to himself <....She has monsterous strength.... It wouldn't be wise to go close range, but instead long range tactics would do well..> he dub the top part of the gunbai into the dirt, as he started to form several handsigns, lightning electricity began to flicker between his finger tips, and once he finished the handsigns he slammed his palms on the ground as a trail of lightning went straight toward Mariana. 

He grabbed the gunbai, taking it out of the ground and charged forward.* - Fri Sep 25 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The ground beneith him started to shake, causing him to lose his balance and topple over, he used his gunbai and stuck it into the ground to keep him from falling down any further. Although he knew better than to move by this point, he sighed and said "Alright... you win..." the helmet he had on his head slowly fell off of his head, as it rolled toward Mariana's foot.* - Fri Sep 25 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Don't hurt me.. - Fri Sep 25 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) fell on his ass, his gunbai still stuck into the dirt. He rubbed his ass and said "...Right.." he grabbed his gunbai and placed it back on his back, as he leaned against the moutain and chilled there.* - Fri Sep 25 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: dodged a bullet there. - Fri Sep 25 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Only way I will hurt you, if you cheat on me or leave me for a chick. - Fri Sep 25 20:05:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
A brownish-black snake came to him, jumping toward his shoulder and laying on it, this snake of course was Aedre. "What all did you gather, Aedre?" the snake hissed at him, it seemed like his summon kept holding grudges against him, but Aedre none the less replied to him.

"Nothing unusual...Jusssst the same all thing..." the snake yawned and disappeared in a plume of smoke. He sighed, <...Why doesn't Aedre like me, I'm always nice to that bastard..>* - Fri Sep 25 20:09:10 2015
