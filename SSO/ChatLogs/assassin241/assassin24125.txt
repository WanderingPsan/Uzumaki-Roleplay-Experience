A large white snake came out of his arm, as it slammed itself against the large table, the drinks that were on the table however, probably fell off, however that saved him from being hammer fisted alll to fuck, he landed a distance away from Ambrocio.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly dodged the fists thrown at him, Hideki himself wasn't one for close range combat, he quickly started to form handsigns building up raiton chakra within his bodies system, molding the chakra for a short while within his body. And after competeing the handsigns, he held the last handsign, he needed to distance himself from Ambrocio, so he jumped back once again, as he slammed his palm's against the grounds surface. A trail of lightning electricity went forward toward Ambrocio. The lightning however, cracked the floorboards, leaving a small chasm in it's wake.* - Sat Oct 10 21:25:32 2015

".......Well then.." and with that, the genjutsu would've knocked Ambrocio out by this point, and if he was to fall, Hideki would grab him and place him over his shoulders.

And if he was to get knocked out by his genjutsu, he'd catch him if he was to fall, and of course put him over his shoulder. * - Sun Oct 11 00:44:22 2015
