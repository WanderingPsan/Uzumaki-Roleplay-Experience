<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat back down on his couch. Burying his face on his hands. Tears began to flood his face for a short while. ".....I try making friends...And they die. Kilm..I didn't know you for that long..But I'm glad you atleast taught me something before you went off and died.." he stated this to himself. He was in an isolated room, his own voice seemed to echo through-out the house. He continued to cry. <...Why am I crying for someone that I didn't even know for more than a couple of days?> he thought to himself. 

He placed his hands against the couches cushion. Clenching the couch. Clenching his teeth. "Why did he have to die..I planned on making new friends. Kilm was going to become my friend....I was going to ask him to become my teacher...He was the only one to actually talk to me.. Despite the name calling I got from people within my own class." he stated to himself. His face was turning a reddish color, just from pure rage. 

Tears falling down his face, and hitting against the wooden surface.* - Wed Nov  4 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) started to breath heavily. He was getting mad the more he thought about the death of Kilm. The man himself seemed like a good guy, he acknowledged him. When everyone else gave him the cold shoulder. Tetsumi, however was also one that acknowledged him aswell. He had two friends, and with on already gone. He planned on trying to protect his last friend. He was not going to let anything happen to him. 

"...Why...." he repeated this phrase within his mind, over, over, and over again. He wanted to know who this Katsune bitch was. And wanted to hear her reason for killing Kilm. His face was still red from pure rage. He just wanted to end this person's life for taking his friends life away. That was definately unforgiveable. And he planned on getting his revenge. However; if this person named Katsune did indeed kill Kilm. Then he would have to train to his very best ability. 

This ment, that she was no push-over.* - Wed Nov  4 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) stopped crying. 

Nigga Zeno took to long to reply. So he assumed he would be safe and not do something he would regret. He got up, and went out to the Sunagakure square.* - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat on the bench.* - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from the bench, and walked around.* - Wed Nov  4 04:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) went back into his house, and laid down on his couch. He was going to use this couch, as a bed for tonight. Staring up at the ceiling. His mind still clouded by rage. * - Wed Nov  4 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) dozed off to sleep. Sleeping on his couch, if anything, he was probably going to have to clear his mind. He had to focus on the positives. And not the negatives. However; Kilm's death will not go in vain. He will avenge his friend, but for the time being he had to focus on survival. That was his goal.* - Wed Nov  4 04:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat on the couch. Once again, another boring day.* - Thu Nov  5 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) went outside, noticed someone took his welcome mat. Went back inside. Cried in the inside.* - Thu Nov  5 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) pulled up to the scene on these nigga's.* - Thu Nov  5 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) left the scene on these nigga's.* - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) took a caravan to Kumogakure. Everyone ignored him in Sunagakure. So he decided to go elsewhere.* - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) made it to the location via a caravan. Which just left.

Yuudai fixed his sights on the female. He was pretty depressed to begin with, since people of Sunagakure have been isolating him. Only two people even acknowledged him back at the village. Which was Kilm and Tetsumi. However, ever since he found out of Kilm's death, he got even more depressed. It seemed his last and only friend for now was Tetsumi. Maybe he could make friends with this new individual? He answered her question at last. "I came in search for new friends...Sunagakure kept ignoring me, and isolating me..." he stated.

He stared at the ground shortly after. * - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: If you do not mind the dead then they can be your friends. - Thu Nov  5 01:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) followed directly behind her. Taking note of the rather large weapon that was on her back.* - Thu Nov  5 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) noticed the bone fragments.

Yuudai sat on the wooden surface. He stared at the female. "...My name is Yuudai. I come from Sunagakure...." he stated this and watched as she took off the large blade, placing it beside her. The blade looked rather large, and heavy. He shifted his gaze back toward the woman. "And you are?"* - Thu Nov  5 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Revenant. - Thu Nov  5 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Why? - Thu Nov  5 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: At the academy, when I graduated. They just...Ignored me...Called me mean names. Like monster, freak. A nobody.. - Thu Nov  5 01:38:33 2015

"Yes ma'am.."* - Thu Nov  5 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: No need to be formal. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) looked at the scroll. Eyeing it carefully, he placed it in his pocket. He then turned on his heels and headed further up north. "I'll start practicing right away.." he stated.* - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I did not say you could leave. - Thu Nov  5 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Start working on your seal. - Thu Nov  5 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) didn't really start on the fuuinjutsu practice just yet. He was staring off into the distance. Admiring the water infront of him.

"Hm....I'm fifteen. I didn't do anything in Sunagakure. No one bothered to talk to me. I was an out cast. I don't really know why they ignored me...Probably because they think I'm a freak or a monster of the sorts. I'm not really an unpleasant person to be around either." he stated, staring off into the distance.* - Thu Nov  5 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I see. - Thu Nov  5 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Well. - Thu Nov  5 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Here in Kumogakure the dead do not judge. - Thu Nov  5 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So you do not have to worry about that. - Thu Nov  5 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yeah... - Thu Nov  5 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Get started. - Thu Nov  5 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Wasting time is something that I do not like. - Thu Nov  5 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Everything must have a purpose. - Thu Nov  5 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You can watch it and work on your sealing. - Thu Nov  5 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sighed.

He took out the scroll from his pocket, carefully he took out a pencil. Yes, he had a pencil with him. And slowly started to write some sealing formula's within the jutsu scroll. At first, when he wrote in it. He messed up. So he had to erase whatever he messed up on within the scroll. "...Time passes like a wave huh.." that was a pretty good quote. He might stick to it.* - Thu Nov  5 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Indeed. - Thu Nov  5 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Just like a wave. - Thu Nov  5 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: There is no way of stopping it. - Thu Nov  5 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I see. - Thu Nov  5 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Come on. - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: No mistakes. - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: carve it into your memory. - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Just like I am carving this skull out. - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) took out the scroll that was given to him last night, by the mysterious female. Whose name was rather-- odd. But, he took out his pencil and slowly started to scribble in some fuuinjutsu formula's. Atleast, he hoped they were fuuinjutsu formula's. Considering he didn't have that much knowledge on them in the first place. But, he wished to learn a thing or two. And that's exactly what he was going to do. 

However; while he was writing, his hand started to crap up. To where he decided that he should probably get a break. So he carefully placed his pencil in his pocket. And then, after he did that, he rolled up the scroll and gently placed it by his side. He stared out into the waters infront of him. He stared for a good couple minutes. But then, picked up the scroll and decided to start writing in it again.

"..Damn.." he said to himself, continuing to write in the scroll. He diverted his gaze from the scroll, toward the many bone fragments around the area they were in. Jeez, this place looked like it got fucked up. It -definately- got fucked up, from the looks of things atleast. But none the less, he continued to get to work on forming fuuinjutsu seals. And other shit that was important. He wondered where that mysterious woman went off to.

Scratching his head, he returned his gaze back to the scroll. Continuing to write the many formula's within the scroll's contents. He sighed to himself. "....I came to a different village to make new friends..But instead...I make one new one, and a bunch of bone fragments around me...Nice.." he said to himself. This place seemed dangerous to begin with.

Matter of fact, a lady with a bone type mask on her face, carving skulls---- Jesus, what if he was next? What if she planned on killing Yuudai? Yuudai's heart started to beat rapidly. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. "..Quit being a pussy..." he continued to write on the scroll, fuuinjutsu formula's of course. His hand started to shake slightly when he wrote on the scroll.* - Thu Nov  5 20:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Is it worth? - Thu Nov  5 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) went over and hugged Konami. I live on the edge.* - Thu Nov  5 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) let go.

Looked at Index, extending his hand out.

"Can I have?"* - Thu Nov  5 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Elements? - Thu Nov  5 22:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sounds nice. - Thu Nov  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm going to call you.. - Thu Nov  5 22:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Suit yourself. - Thu Nov  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) placed his practice scroll in his pocket. 

He took out the gentai-no-jutsu scroll, unraveled that shit. And read the information that was on the scroll. "More reading. Fuck my life." Might as well get this reading shit out the way with. He sat down on the bridge. Shifted his gaze toward the waters of Kumogakure. They flowed smoothly, he shifted his gaze back at the scroll. From the look of things, it seems that this scroll requires a decent amount of chakra.

Chakra, that Yuudai didn't have much of. He yawned, he had to learn four other scrolls after this one. Which could also take a long while. But this jutsu could come in handy. It mentions that, you can create bandages out of any material, within your dispossal. Seemed legit enough. Yet, it required decent amount of chakra. Yuudai wished he had good enough chakra for this, but probably doesn't. Which sucks.* - Thu Nov  5 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to read the scrolls contents. If he could learn this jutsu already, then life would be a lot easier for him. His friend, Revenant said something about survival. So in this case, this jutsu could probably help him, in a way he guessed? Who knows. Maybe it will help him in the long run? Was Index a god sent? The world, may never know.* - Thu Nov  5 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) shifted his gaze toward Revenant. He rolled up the scroll.

"Yes?"* - Thu Nov  5 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) grabbed it.

He examined it carefully. He rubbed his fingers against the skull's structure. It was kind of smooth. He looked over toward Revenant. "..What do you want me to do with this? Wear it on my face?" he asked rather curious.* - Thu Nov  5 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Up to you. - Thu Nov  5 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) wore that shit.* - Thu Nov  5 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: I feel the power. - Thu Nov  5 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: omit - Thu Nov  5 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You might want to disinfect it first. - Thu Nov  5 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: -- - Thu Nov  5 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) took that shit off.

He went over toward the water. Carefully, he rubbed the inside of the bone piece. Scrubbing it here and there. Making sure to 'disinfect' it first. He flipped it over, and did the same thing on the other side. He didn't want to catch any infectious diseases from this shiet. He lifted it up in the air, examining it carefully once again. The sun shined ontop of the bone piece, having it glisten in the sunlight. He nodded his head, and placed the bone piece on his face. "...Done." he stated.

He took out another scroll that was given to him by Cypher, and unraveled the scroll. He carefully, started to read from it. Trying to memorize the scrolls contents. He would have to do the same method with all the other scrolls that he had in his inventory. This would definately take a long while to do. But, he had time on his hands. So this was a good thing it seemed.* - Thu Nov  5 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You might want to boil it to be sure. - Thu Nov  5 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to read the scrolls contents. The technique seemed useful, but it also seemed like you'd need a fair amount of chakra for it. Chakra, that Yuudai once again, did not have at all. Man, this was kind of a bummer. He needs to work on his chakra capacity. He sighed, after hearing Revenant say this. He shook his head. "..I'm lazy.." he stated.

He shifted his gaze from her figure, back toward his scroll. Wanting to read this scroll and get it done and over with already, like the other scroll he got done reading. But this one, seemed like it may take a little while longer than expected. He just wanted to learn as many jutsu as he possibly could, so he could survive for future events. He felt like he'd need this jutsu. It would definately be useful.

He inhaled and exhaled slowly. Gosh, learning jutsu from scrolls definately took a long time. He had plenty of time to learn these scrolls. But he wanted to get it out of the way, maybe he could make a profit from these scrolls? Sell to other people, that kind of deal. Yuudai nodded his head, the image of money falling on his person was in his head.* - Thu Nov  5 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Thu Nov  5 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: What to do now. - Thu Nov  5 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) stopped imagining money falling on him.

Yuudai took out the practice scroll from earlier. He then slowly took out the pencil aswell, as he started to scribble into the practice scroll some fuuinjutsu formula's. He messed up on one of them, to where he erased where he messed up at. He sighed to himself. "....Damn man....This takes forever.." he stated to himself. But he continued to write in the scroll, he needed to get it finished.

Considering he still had a long way to go. He readjusted his bone piece that was on his face, felt kind of wierd where it was placed. So once he fixed it, he continued to write within the scroll. Making sure he was perfect with it, he didn't want to mess up again like last time. Perfection, was key for learning how to utilize fuuinjutsu. He wanted it to be spot on.

However; he also shifted his gaze from the scroll, onto the ocean's waves. "...I wonder how it is..To be water. It flows so smoothly, and freely.." Yuudai fixated his eyes back to his scroll. Continuing to write fuuinjutsu formula's within the scroll's contents. He inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was a part of the Akimichi clan. He wondered if there was anyone else a part of his clan. He scratched his chin. 

"..Am I the only one.." he said to himself. Shaking his head slowly, maybe there was more people with the same unique ability as his. But he had to throw that out the window. He needed to stay focus on the task at hand. And that task was survival. Revenant wanted Yuudai to learn how to survive, and so, he was going to do just that. He continued to scribble more and more fuuinjutsu formula's within the practice scroll that he was given.

His hand was starting to cramp, so he roled up the scroll and placed it back in his pocket. He intended on taking a small break for now. Considering this was a lot of work he had to do. Sheesh, why was learning Basic Sealing so difficult to do? Maybe it would be worth it in the long run. Who knows, not Yuudai that's for sure. * - Thu Nov  5 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to write within the practice scroll. Writing in fuuinjutsu formula's of the sort. Ya know, the good stuff. He casually looked up, shifting his gaze toward Revenant. "....What was that weapon you had, when we first met, Revenant.." he asked rather curious of the weapon she had earlier, it looked rather large, and it seemed like it would be a heavy weapon.* - Fri Nov  6 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A blade. - Fri Nov  6 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Very specific. What kind of blade? - Fri Nov  6 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Think of a Zanbatou - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: That's bigger than a Zanbatou. - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: And it looks like it has some sort of, wrapping around it. - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Was it damaged? - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: There are different types of Zanbatous, Shounen.  - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: This one is smaller than you think. - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Unique.. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm? - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: The bandages?  - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: They are just for decoration. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Oh, cool. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: But it also keeps the blade clean. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) nudged Konami.

"Think I could try giving it a shot? Huh? Huh?" he asked jokingly.* - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You wont be able to lift it up so sure go ahead. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: --- - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Yo...I'm not one for big blades. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Tanto's, sure. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from sitting down. Rolling up the scroll in his hand, and placing it in his pocket. He rubbed his hands together, squatted, clutched the blade's hilt. He tried lifting it up, but it didn't even budge. Yuudai was starting to pant by this point. Literally, sweat dripping from his face. And it has only been like five seconds. He shifted his gaze toward Konami. "....How the hell do you even lift this thing.."* - Fri Nov  6 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: . . .  - Fri Nov  6 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: This weapon is heavy. - Fri Nov  6 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You are sixteen years old correct? - Fri Nov  6 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I'm fifteen. - Fri Nov  6 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So young and full of life still, Shounen. - Fri Nov  6 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: As you grow older you will develop your own style. - Fri Nov  6 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) placed his hands in his pockets.

He looked up at the sky. "My own style huh.." * - Fri Nov  6 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Fri Nov  6 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Your own fighting style. - Fri Nov  6 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: That gives me an idea. - Fri Nov  6 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You will know what style favors you the most when it presents itself to you - Fri Nov  6 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat down on the ground's surface. Once again he took out his practice scroll, taking out his pencil from within his pocket. He started to write some fuuinjutsu formula's one more within the scroll's contents. Although, when he was writing within the scroll, he messed up. So, he turned the pencil over and erased his mistake. He blew on the scroll, blowing away the eraser marks. Then, he started writing again in the scroll. He inhaled, then exhaled slowly. This fuuinjutsu thing is taking longer than expected.

And to make matters worse, Revenant wants Yuudai to have this done and learned with, by the end of the week. His hand started to cramp up a little bit, so he placed the pencil down near his leg. He rotated his right hand wrist. Shifting his gaze from the scroll, toward Revenant, then back at the scroll. He wonder's where she was from, was she from Kumogakure no Sato? Or was she a missing ninja? He doesn't really see a headband anywhere around her either.

This caused a bunch of questions to arise from within Yuudai's head. But, he stopped rotating his rigth hand's wrist, grabbed the pencil, and once again started to write within the scroll's contents. "God..This is so boring.." he said to himself. He didn't mind Kumogakure's destructive land. And to be honest, it was rather quiet and peaceful. Just like in Sunagakure--- Excluding the ocean currents, and the sound of the waves crashing into the side of the moutain they were on. 

Other than that, this place wasn't all that bad. And no sand storms either, which was always awesome. He hated those sand storms---- And not to mention Sunagakure had way to much sand, guess that's why it was called Sunagakure. Come to think of it, not even the Kazekage acknowledged him. Which kind of upset him just a tad bit. He sighed, as he continued to write fuuinjutsu formula's on the scroll's surface.

He looked over toward Revenant once more. "...Where do you really come from, Revenant? Were you born in Kumogakure? Are you a missing ninja?" he asked rather curious. If he was to stay here for a while, then he might as well try and get to know his new friend at least. Maybe he can try and form a bond with Revenant? If that was even possible. However; he did wonder how Tetsumi was doing. He hasn't seen that man in a long while.* - Fri Nov  6 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I have history with this village. - Fri Nov  6 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And yes it can be boring but it is something that you must do - Fri Nov  6 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: What kind of history? - Fri Nov  6 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A history that I would much rather forget, Shounen. - Fri Nov  6 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: So it was bad history then. - Fri Nov  6 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Fri Nov  6 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Then it's safe to assume you're a missing ninja. - Fri Nov  6 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm? - Fri Nov  6 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I would not call myself missing. - Fri Nov  6 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I am merely how should I put this. - Fri Nov  6 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Taking a brake. - Fri Nov  6 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: A break? - Fri Nov  6 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Fri Nov  6 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A brake. - Fri Nov  6 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You know - Fri Nov  6 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Have a little time to myself. - Fri Nov  6 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
"Right, Right.." he stated, as he started to get back to work, grabbing the pencil he placed by his leg, he started to write some fuuinjutsu formula's once more. Throwing a sigh here and there for effect of how gruesome it was doing this, day by day. However, Yuudai wondered when he'd ever get strong. He was fairly weak in all honest. He didn't like being weak, but that's just how it is sometimes. He stopped writing in the scroll, reaching into his pocket and took out his Sunagakure headband.

He examined it slowly, whispering to himself "...I wonder what Tetsumi is doing.." he placed the headband back in his pocket. And once again, started to write in the scroll's contents. Adding more and more fuuinjutsu formula's within it. If he was to get this done and over with, he couldn't waste anymore time then he's already wasted. He wondered why Revenant kept calling him 'Shounen', he wasn't really used to being called that. But, it was whatever. He didn't mind it at all.

He dropped the pencil on the ground, rubbing his right hand wrist, slowly rotating it. Yuudai looked out into the distance. Watching the waves once again, flow smoothly, they crash into the cliff side. "..........." he wondered when they would finally leave this place. It looked like a wasteland from the time Yuudai came here. If anything, the ocean that's near Kumogakure, was really the only thing Yuudai liked here.

He shifted his gaze back toward his ally. <..Time to yourself huh....I had to much of that back in Sunagakure..> he thought to himself. But instead, he picked up the pencil that he dropped earlier, and started to write once again onto the scroll's surface. Scribbling the fuuinjutsu formula's here and there, the scroll itself was almost filled. He had very little room left. If anything, he was just about done with it.

Which in return, this caused a smile to appear on Yuudai's face. With a nod, he placed the pencil in his pocket, rolled up the scroll and placed that shit in his pocket aswell. He was somewhat done with it for now. He did enough writing for one day, he wanted to take a break. And a break is what he was going to have. He continued to sit down on the ground's surface. But then, he decided to lay down, and looked up at the clouds as they passed by.

"So this is Kumogakure no Sato huh..."* - Fri Nov  6 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Fri Nov  6 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) slept on the ground for tonight. 

He took off his jacket, and used that as a pillow.* - Fri Nov  6 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) woke up, looked at the man infront of him. Pushed this nigga off the cliff. "There can only be one Shounen.."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So I would not know how to answer your question Shounen. - Fri Nov  6 20:27:56 2015

He read it carefully, reading more into the scroll, it states that one must have good chakra reserves to use it. To which in Yuudai's case, his chakra wasn't really the best. In all honesty, he's lucky if he can even perform the Earth Flash technique, that was given to him by Kilm, before he passed away. He scratched his head.

"...Sheesh..I've been reading all day yesterday..And now today.." he said to himself. He inhaled and exhaled slowly, shifting his gaze from the scroll, toward the ocean's current. He diverted his gaze back toward the scroll infront of him. The faster he learned this scroll, the faster he could move on to the other ones in his inventory. He could probably make a profit out of selling scrolls. But, he'd have to wait before going on the move.* - Fri Nov  6 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: It is something some people expect. - Sun Nov  8 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very few dont. - Sun Nov  8 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You might change your mind later on. - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Or you wont. - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: That is up to you to decide. - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yea. - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Just remember, time will pass you by like a wave. - Sun Nov  8 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Never lose sight of your objective. - Sun Nov  8 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Stay true to your convictions. - Sun Nov  8 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Follow your own Shinobi way. - Sun Nov  8 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I plan on doing that. - Sun Nov  8 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very good. - Sun Nov  8 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I hope to see good results. - Sun Nov  8 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) unrolled a scroll infront of Yuudai. It read on the side 'Lightning Ball.', he inhaled and exhaled slowly. Another scroll he had to read again. He read so many scrolls a couple days prior, this was just going to be a repeat of last time pretty much. And so, he glued his eyes onto the scrolls contents. Reading it throughly, making sure he got as much information as possible from the scroll. It seemed that one would also need good amounts of chakra in order to even use this jutsu. To where Yuudai's chakra, wasn't the best either.

Regardless of his terrible chakra reserves. He continued to read the scroll. Wondering how he would use this technique in combat. He'd probably need to have someone distract his opponet before he could even fire the technique off. However; he could possibly get a certain distance away from his opponet, and use it. There were endless possibilities on how he could possibly pull it off. But until that day was to come, he wouldn't use it.* - Sun Nov  8 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) finished reading the scroll on the jutsu he was going to learn. When he finished reading it, he rolled it up, and placed it in his pocket. He sat down on the grounds surface. Watching the ocean's waves once again. His face mask, and bone mask, was on at the time. So if anyone was to come in the area, they wouldn't really know who he was.* - Sun Nov  8 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat down on the ground. Looking out at the ocean infront of him. "..This kind of life style is boring..", he picked up a small pebble, throwing it toward the ocean's water. The pebble, hit the water's surface, breaking the water's surface tension, having it bounce a coupe times, before it went inside the water. Yuudai, placed an elbow on his thigh, and rested his head, on the palm of his hand. Sighing, he spoke to himself again. 

"...What else is there to do... It's so boring here...No one is even talking to me anymore..I feel even more alone now.." Yuudai, diverted his gaze toward the ground. * - Sun Nov  8 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to watch the waters. But, he grew bored of it now. He laid down, staring up at the sky. Watching the clouds move over their position.* - Sun Nov  8 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: How has your training been Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I haven't trained at all today. I've just been watching the ocean's waves.  - Sun Nov  8 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I've been bored all day. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No one has spoken to me, all day. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I am sure that watching the ocean waves did not really entertain you. - Sun Nov  8 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: It wasn't entertaining. - Sun Nov  8 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: But I felt peaceful watching the waves move. - Sun Nov  8 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Finding inner peace? - Sun Nov  8 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Mmm.. - Sun Nov  8 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No. - Sun Nov  8 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Perhaps you might want to get started with your training, Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I don't know what to train. - Sun Nov  8 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Anything you want - Sun Nov  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) took off his jacket, placed it underneith his head, using it as a pillow. Yuudai, shortly after doing this, went to sleep.* - Sun Nov  8 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) woke up from sleeping. Grabbing his jacket, and putting it back on.* - Sun Nov  8 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Sleep well? - Sun Nov  8 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Hm? Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Good. - Sun Nov  8 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Good. - Sun Nov  8 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: i mean its a c rank right? - Sun Nov  8 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: When the others wake up I shall teach you Suimen Hokou no Waza and Shunshin no Jutsu. - Sun Nov  8 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  8 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  8 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to sit on the ground. Looking out in the distance. Nothing's changed, still the same view. However; Yuudai looked behind him, staring at Revenant. "...Why do they call you Revenant?"* - Sun Nov  8 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sun Nov  8 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: That will be revealed over time, Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) turned back around, to watch the ocean.

"I see.."* - Sun Nov  8 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Her name literally means "Returning.". - Sun Nov  8 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: What an odd name.. - Sun Nov  8 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sun Nov  8 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sun Nov  8 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Do you know Kai? - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No. - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I shall teach it to you then. - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Oh, alright. - Sun Nov  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You cannot go through life without Kai. - Sun Nov  8 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: In order for you to learn Kai you must first be placed under a genjutsu. - Sun Nov  8 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: It's that imp- - Sun Nov  8 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Under a genjutsu? - Sun Nov  8 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  8 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Kai is used for breaking out of a genjutsu. - Sun Nov  8 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: My skills with genjutsu isn't the best. - Sun Nov  8 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Doesn't matter. - Sun Nov  8 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You will still learn Kai. - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: There are several things about genjutsu that you should know. - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: There are two ways of breaking out of it. - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: One. To use Kai. - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Two. To cause pain to yourself. - Sun Nov  8 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sun Nov  8 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: All genjutsu does is disrupt your opponents chakra so by causing pain it somehow brings you back to 'normal' - Sun Nov  8 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A genjutsu also loses its effectiveness if you know you are under a genjutsu. - Sun Nov  8 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Seem's legit enough. - Sun Nov  8 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very well look at me. - Sun Nov  8 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from sitting on the ground, he turned around and looked at Revenant.* - Sun Nov  8 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And I apologize for what you will see. - Sun Nov  8 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
"..What d-" before he could finish his sentence, infront of him was a circle of leaves. He rose an eyebrow at this, "..A circle of leaves.." he thought to himself. At first, he thought the leaves were going to attack him, but, when he looked away from the leaves-- There it was, the very thing he feared most in the whole world. It was an image of one of his close friends dying infront of him. That close friend, was Tetsumi.

He placed his hands over his head. "No way...." he was grabbing at his own hair. But, he had to remember this was a genjutsu, even Revenant told him this before he got captured in it. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. He held the tiger hand seal, he started to gather up chakra within his bodies system, molding the chakra within his system for a short while, before he was going to release it. He closed his eyes, he was focusing.

After he got done gathering up the chakra needed, he quickly sent a burst of chakra through-out his body, and with this, he hoped he got out of the genjutsu nightmare he was in. He slowly opened his eyes, looking around to see if the nightmare was done and over with. And if it was, then he'd look at Revenant, seeing if he performed the technique correctly.* - Sun Nov  8 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Good job. - Sun Nov  8 18:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  8 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A strong mind will also help you against Genjutsu users - Sun Nov  8 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Why is it that you want to end the Gezo? - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) turned back around, sat down on the ground, and looked back at the ocean once again.* - Sun Nov  8 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Does it affect or effect you? - Sun Nov  8 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Effect. - Sun Nov  8 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: In what way? - Sun Nov  8 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Well, from what I know to my knowledge. - Sun Nov  8 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: They reaked lots of havoc on the villages---Espeically Sunagakure. - Sun Nov  8 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: So, it effected me in a way, to where I want to show them that our villages are not to be messed with. - Sun Nov  8 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I don't want the Gezo to look down on the three villages. - Sun Nov  8 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Sunagakure is the strongest village out there. - Sun Nov  8 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Now they are. - Sun Nov  8 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Everything that happens to the village is because of the choices that Shinobi make. - Sun Nov  8 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: During the first Ages yes, the villages were mainly runned by the Gezo. - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: But now it is all about shinobi. - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: They are the ones who are running the show. - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: ...Still.. - Sun Nov  8 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I told you before and I will tell you now. - Sun Nov  8 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Going after the Gezo is a foolish choice. - Sun Nov  8 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: ...Maybe. - Sun Nov  8 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: But in the end is your choice. - Sun Nov  8 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Anyway. - Sun Nov  8 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Do you know any taijutsu moves? - Sun Nov  8 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No sadly. - Sun Nov  8 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Sun Nov  8 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Then we will have to change that Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You can't go on about life without having a wide set of skills. - Sun Nov  8 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I guess. - Sun Nov  8 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) looked at the technique that Revenant performed. He nodded his head, he quickly decided to charge the water clone. His first attempt, it was to send a right hand hook toward it's jaw region.* - Sun Nov  8 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) looked at the clone as it bursted into a puddle of water, hearing Revenant's comment, he looked over toward her. "..Sorry." Once she created the second clone, he prepared himself for whatever attack was coming for him. Seeing the clone jump into the air, and sending a kick to his face. It of course, landed having Yuudai fall back on the ground. Rubbing his face, looking back at her. "..It's just a flying kick.." he stated.* - Sun Nov  8 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  8 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: But it is. - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Its* a basic Taijutsu move - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Which can or cannot come in handy. - Sun Nov  8 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I see.. - Sun Nov  8 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: It might seem simple - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: but it is ticky. - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: SPecailly when you first start out. - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So get to it. - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Target the clone - Sun Nov  8 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Alright - Sun Nov  8 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got into the particular taijutsu stance. Bending his knees, quickly, he sprinted forth. While sprinting, he jumped into the air, extending his leg out, his foot, was aimed directly toward the clone's chest region. However, considering how slow at the time he was, theres a chance that the attack could've missed.* - Sun Nov  8 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) nodded his head.

"Yes ma'am.."he stated this, and once again, got into his taijutsu stance, bending his knees once more. He concentrated on the clone's face, that was his target. And he intended to atleast land a hit on it. Quickly, he ran toward the clone. And once getting close, he jumped into the air, extending his leg out, his foot was now aimed straight toward the clone's jawline.* - Sun Nov  8 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yes ma'am. - Sun Nov  8 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Always make sure to master your jutsus, Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You will see that by doing this the usage of your chakra for the jutsu will be lowered. - Sun Nov  8 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Do you know the shunshin technique? - Sun Nov  8 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No I don't. - Sun Nov  8 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Watch closely Shounen. - Sun Nov  8 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) nodded his head at Revenant's comment.

He took note of the hand seal, and so, he formed the Tiger hand seal. At first, he didn't do a single thing, he had to mold chakra within his bodies system. He didnt' want to release it just yet, considering this is a new technique he was going to learn. Heck, he even learned Kai a couple of minutes ago.

He closed his eyes, he was going to have to have good concentration. He inhaled and exhaled slowly. He slowly opened his eyes, he then, used the chakra to accelerate his metabolic rate. However, he didn't get far. If anything, it seemed like he did it wrong, a plume of white smoke was around his very being. He diverted his gaze toward Revenant.

He didn't even perform the technique all that well, and the technique itself seemed easy enough to learn. By now, he's molded the chakra well enough. He then, used the chakra to accelerate his metabolism. He shunshined about, two, too five feet away from Revenant.
