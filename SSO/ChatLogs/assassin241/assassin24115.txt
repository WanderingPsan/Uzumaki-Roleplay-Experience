<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) opened the scroll that read 'Tethys will.' and upon opening the scroll, he read the information inside the scroll. Reading it carefully and throughly. There were three things in this scroll that interested him greatly. Mizumi has ten million in his pockets, which could be an easy grab. A woman named Violet will be handed the Kiba Blades, which he'd have to investigate on. And Seisuke had a sword called Samehada.

All these weapons sounded interesting, It also seems Jin Karuzo, has the Black Blade. He could possibly try and kill him for the blade, and next on the list was no one other than Fujitora. It seems he might have some sort of masery in fuuinjutsu based techniques. The information he was given in this scroll definately came in hand. But at what costs? He just killed an innocent man, a man that really ment no harm toward him. But he was out for revenge. He should've listened to Ushinawa.

He will probably give him a long lecture, or worse. Probably have him on twenty four seven surveillance. He couldn't shake the feeling, though.* - Mon Sep 28 23:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed the man's wrist, as he started to move to the northwestern part of Kumogakure. He buried Hanabi's body there himself. As he then said "Come with me."* - Mon Sep 28 23:04:32 2015

Notes he is wearing her cloak, and katana.* - Mon Sep 28 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared blankly at Seisuke.

"I will not tell you, because I made a deal with the man who did this to Hanabi. I asked him to do me a favor, since he killed my most valuable mentor. And he said he would do it, so once he does this. The debt will be paid." he stated rather blankly, it seems after Hanabi's death, Hideki's demeanor has changed quiet a bit. He wasn't the type of guy that went out to conversate with friends anymore-- No he was something different now. He isolated himself from his close friends, and family.

He of course had his reasons for doing this.* - Mon Sep 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared blankly out in the distance, then casted his eyes toward Hanabi's gravestone. "Good luck, Seisuke. I plan to avenge her death too one day...Don't you worry.." he took out Hanabi's red and white mask, and placed it on his face. Hideki then slowly closed his eyes, inhaling and then exhaling slowly. He slowly reopened his eyes, forming his sharingan that has developed into two tomoe now, instead of one. As their was also a faint red glow coming from deep within the mask.* - Mon Sep 28 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) waved hello back at Kuro.* - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) unsheathed the katana that used to be his mentors, and started to hack and slash the air infront of him, he kept thinking to himself, as to why he couldn't have saved Hanabi, as to why he didn't risk himself and let Hanabi live to see another day. What made matters worse, is that he even made a deal with Erebus to get what he needed done and out of the way. It's a shame really, that he stooped that low. Low enough to ask his -own- enemy for a favor. The enemy that killed his mentor.

He swung the katana in a down-ward motion, and froze there for a couple seconds. Staring at the blade as the sunlight hit it perfectly, having it gleam in the sunlight. He was panting of course after doing all that hacking and slashing. He stabbed the katana into the dirt. He got on his hands and knees, staring blankly at the ground underneith him. As tears started to fall from his face and hit the grounds surface.

He balled his hands into a fist, and punched the ground, he continued to punch the ground, as small amounts of dust began to form. He stopped punching the dirt surface, and looked at his knuckles. They were bleeding from how hard he was punching the grounds surface. He took out some bandages, and bandages the top part of his knuckles. And took the katana out of the ground.

He sheathed the katana, and went to travel around Kumogakure no Sato. He wiped his eyes from the tears he let out, he just broke rule number one in the shinobi hand book, and that was to show no emotion. In the end, he was going to isolate himself from his close friends and family members. He of course had his sharingan develop since Hanabi's death.

He couldn't bare seeing anyone else die infront of him. He wouldn't allow it, he has a new objective now, and once Erebus fullfills his favor. Hideki will be sure to end Erebus's life.* - Tue Sep 29 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed his hands ontop of the table, and stared blankly at the other side of the wall. Thoughts of how he let Hanabi die in order to save his own hide kept circling in his head. He inhaled and then exhaled slowly. Trying to regain his composure. He needed to think positive, but it was all negative thoughts regardless.* - Tue Sep 29 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got up from sitting on the pillow, he placed his hands in his pockets, which was covered by the cloak he had on, including the katana he had straped to the left side of his hip. He exited the room.* - Tue Sep 29 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's Hanabi's. - Tue Sep 29 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head. "Yeah, she had one..." he sighed, he held back a lot of his emotions he was bottling up. He placed his right hand over his face, covering his right eye, although his left eye wasn't covered. But it was still closed however.* - Tue Sep 29 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) moved his right hand slowly back down from his face, as he reopened his eyes, his onyx orbs staring at Misa. He inhaled and exhaled slowly, as he was about to tell Misa what -truly- happened the day Hanabi was killed. As it was definately a day he would never forget. He cleared his throat, ready to speak.

"This is what happened, Misa. I went to Konohagakure no Sato to visit Suitengu, to see how he was doing. And right when we were about to leave, Erebus attacked Hanabi, out of no where man.... Not even much time to react..." he paused for a moment, and inhaled to continue the story.

"But Hanabi didn't go out like no chump, she opened her mouth and like... snakes man, not just a couple, hundreds of snakes came out of her mouth with blades, trying to impale Erebus... He was barely even damaged, and he -still- killed her..I ran Misa...I fucking ran like a coward....I just...I just couldn't help her, I tried really, I did...I went to Kumogakure to get Niza, but by the time we got there...." he paused staring into Misa's eyes for a moment.

"She was already dead. Suitengu though, grabbed her heart for some reason.. And he also stitched up her body, so I grabbed it and went back to Kumogakure to give her a proper burial.. And I also grabbed her stuff, since it's the only memnto I have left of her." he stated. Yes this was the true story of what happened to Hanabi, and how Hideki himself was not able to save her at all. It was still bottled up inside his system.

Although, the day he buried her, his demeanor definately changed. He looked at life differently, and he also isolated himself from his comrades, and his family.* - Tue Sep 29 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to stare at Misa. "The thing is, I requested a favor from Erebus, to take care of something for me. Until he does it... That's when I'll strike." he stated rather blankly. Misa was right though, United one can truely dominate an opponet.* - Tue Sep 29 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) slides across the table, grabbing Hanabi's katana and stabbed the man right in the head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Misa, who moved to the other side of the table, which was next to Hideki. He then diverted his gaze toward Bernadotte. "Nothing, nothing at all." he stated, obviously lying.* - Tue Sep 29 02:41:16 2015
