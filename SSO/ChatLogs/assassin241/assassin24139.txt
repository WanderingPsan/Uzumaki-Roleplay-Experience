<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to follow intently behind Revenant.

Hearing what she told him, he replied. "I have enough, I should be good.." he stated, awaiting to follow her out of the isolated village of Kumogakure.* - Mon Nov  9 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to follow behind Revenant. Occasionally, Yuudai would look behind him, incase they were to be followed by someone. He diverted his gaze, from looking behind him, to looking up at the skys. Revenant was right, Cypher did use an areial jutsu. But then, they made it to the Konohagakure-Kumogakure border. 

To where he halted in his tracks, he took a seat on the grounds surface. He took out a bottle of water, removing the cap, he took a drink out of the bottled water. After he was finished drinking from it, he placed the cap back on it. And then, placing the water bottle back in his inventory. He continued to just, chill, taking a glimpse of the area around him.* - Mon Nov  9 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) sat down on the ground, he diverted his gaze toward the waterfall. "..What else can the people with red eyes do...Revenant?"* - Mon Nov  9 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Unknown. - Mon Nov  9 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: ...But you said not to look at their eyes right? Can they do some spooky stuff with them? - Mon Nov  9 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I told you. - Mon Nov  9 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: They can place you under a genjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Oh. - Mon Nov  9 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov  9 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) formed a single hand sign. Upon forming this single hand sign however, he started to mold raiton chakra within his bodies system. He closed his eyes, he had to focus. He needed complete concentration when doing this, considering his chakra reserves weren't the greatest. Yuudai slowly opened his eyes, he molded enough chakra within his system.

And then, he released the raiton related technique. <..Raiton Flash..>, a small surge of electricity, flickered around him. It then, spread across the air streams. Traveling only a short distance, before it soon vanished. Yuudai, was obviously sweating, even though it seemed the jutsu didn't waste that much chakra, but to Yuudai. This jutsu took it's toll on him. It was a D rank, yes. But, it still costed a good amount of chakra.

Yuudai, shortly after, sat down on the grounds surface. Meditating, he was going to recollect the amount of chakra he just lost earlier. Sweat, continued to drop from his face. After awhile of meditating, and restoring some of his chakra back, Yuudai slowly got back up, and looked around the area. "...Hm...I should probably still take a break.." he stated to himself.

And that was exactly what he did, he sat back down on the ground's surface, and looked at the waterfall, hearing it crash down below. <..If I was to jump off of here, I wonder how bad I'd break my bones..I'd probably die..Why am I thinking this?> he thought to himself. Yuudai, inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was still in complete isolation. No one really talked to him, even with people within his own little group now.

"...I wonder if I should just leave this group..They rarely chat with me, half the time their just sleeping, or doing their own thing." he placed his elbow on his right thigh, and rested his chin ontop of his palm. He diverted his gaze from the waterfall, and looked out into the distance. There were tons of tree's around the area they were currently in. It was definately something he had to get used to, after all, Revenant did say, we had to learn how to survive.* - Mon Nov  9 22:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: It is good to have options yes. - Tue Nov 10 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I suggest that you being training your hearing. - Tue Nov 10 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: It will help you out. - Tue Nov 10 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: It might not seem like it but it will. - Tue Nov 10 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yes ma'am. - Tue Nov 10 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: What do you think that developing your hearing would be good for? - Tue Nov 10 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: People that are good at sneaking up behind you. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Or if people are good at concealing weapons, if your hears are tuned enough, you could hear them draw the weapon. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Correct. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And also what will you do if you cant see? - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Use hearing... - Tue Nov 10 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) readjusted his bone mask, suddenly, a thick mist appeared around the area infront of him. Revenant, was completely cloaked in it. However; he did hear her voice, to where he replied. "I see what you mean.." he stated, rather concerned for his well being by this point. Yuudai, was kind of weak right now, and he couldn't really defend himself that well. So, he reached into his holister, and took out a kunai, spinning it by it's hilt for a quick second, then firmly grasping it.

<..That chakra flow technique Cypher offered..I should've took it when I had the chance..> he thought to himself. Carefully, he moved through the very thick mist, his visibility was zero by this point. He had to rely on his sense of hearing for this one. And considering Yuudai's hearing for right now was poop, it would be very difficult, to spot Revenant.* - Tue Nov 10 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
<...I have no idea, what to do in this situation..> he thought to himself. But then, an idea rang in his head. He decided to take this nice and slow, considering he did hear Revenant earlier, once again, he tried moving toward where her voice was at the moment. But to no avail, she was already on the move, and gone from the area. Instead, Yuudai took out several explosive tags, and while he was on the move, he placed one down below him.

He continued to do this, after he walked a couple feet.* - Tue Nov 10 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) really didn't think this through at all, he thought it was a solid proof plan. But I guess it wasn't. His explosive tag, got washed up by the stream of water that Revenant conjured up, Yuudai, also got swept away by the water. His cloths by now, were soaking wet. He placed the kunai back in his holister, and looked over toward Revenant. "...Sorry.." he said this, as he looked at the ground.* - Tue Nov 10 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Do not drop your head, Shounen. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I told you thiw was a learning experience. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Yeah.. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You know know what not to do. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: So keep your head up. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You did, decent. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: You thought of something. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: And followed through with it. - Tue Nov 10 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: But, what if this was a life or death situation though, I would've already died.. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Which is why we are doing this, Shounen. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: To prepare you for what is to come. - Tue Nov 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Get some rest. - Tue Nov 10 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: I will keep watch. - Tue Nov 10 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from resting on the ground, he placed his hands in his pockets. He turned on his heels and looked at Revenant. "...I'm going to go back to Sunagakure...I don't think this kind of life style is fit for me just yet, Revenant.", he stated this, as he continued to walk down south.* - Tue Nov 10 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Very well. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Safe travels, Shouenen. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Thanks, Revenant. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: May our paths cross again. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Indeed. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) took a caravan to sunagakure.* - Tue Nov 10 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) appeared at the Sunagakure enterance. A bone mask was covering his face, to where he took it off, and placed it in his pocket. He then, looked at the gaurds. "...I'd like enterance into your village please." he asked, hoping they'd allow him in.* - Tue Nov 10 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
Once the gaurds responded, Yuudai would nod his head. "Alright, I'll just wait here.." he stated, as he walked over toward the cliff, and leaned against it.* - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
The gaurds, apparently let him in for now. And so, Yuudai went ahead and waltzed into the village. * - Wed Nov 11 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Thank you... I'll be off, then... - Wed Nov 11 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mhm.. - Wed Nov 11 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
Upon walking back into the village, the gaurds seemingly capture Yuudai. "Yo, what the shit?" Quickly and effectively, the gaurds place Yuudai in some cuffs or whatever the usual stuff is, and send him off into the prison, probably for questioning, or something of that sort. <...I knew I shouldn't have come back, this was a stupid idea to begin with..>* - Wed Nov 11 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
The gaurds, instead of taking Yuudai into the maximum prison, instead, they took Yuudai to Yan's establishment. And once they arrived to their destination, the gaurds placed Yuudai, into Koji/Yan's home. Having him basically stay there, until Yan came through.* - Wed Nov 11 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) entered the room, gaurds were behind Yuudai, he was in fact, detained. By this point, Yuudai just scanned the very room he was in.* - Wed Nov 11 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
The gaurds, brought Yuudai closer toward Yan. "...Yeah..." was all he responded with, unless, he was asked any further questions by this point.* - Wed Nov 11 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: Isolation, sir. - Wed Nov 11 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) shifted a little bit.

"...Someone by the name of, Revenant." he'd state. Upon closer inspection, it could be shown that Yuudai, had a few mud marks all around his cloths and face. A bone mask, was sticking out of his back pocket. He shifted his gaze from Yan, toward Mitsunara, watching them share a blunt. * - Wed Nov 11 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, that's interesting information, but I am trying to make a point....*continues on* - Wed Nov 11 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: You asked, and I answered.  - Wed Nov 11 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You joined our academy, recieved our training free of charge, and then you up and leave as though you have no obligation to serve this village...The people who invested in you. - Wed Nov 11 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: How does that sound to you? - Wed Nov 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: The same people, who called me a freak, monster, a weirdo. I wasn't even noticed by the higher ups... - Wed Nov 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And why did they do that? - Wed Nov 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: I don't know.. - Wed Nov 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: Wait..I've seen this guy before... - Wed Nov 11 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) thinks: But where.. - Wed Nov 11 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) ||
The gaurds gave a rather more, solid grasp upon Yuudai. <..What the fuck?!>. But, Yan's jutsu, would definately hit home if he was to ask the boy any questions. * - Wed Nov 11 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where were you during the time awya from Sand? - Wed Nov 11 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: At first, I was in Kumogakure, the place was isolated, considering the village itself was pretty much destroyed. So I chilled by the ocean. But then, I made my way into the forest of Konohagakure. - Wed Nov 11 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Andd thennn? - Wed Nov 11 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Have you come across a woman named Katsune/ - Wed Nov 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuudai(Assassin241) says: No, I've only heard that name once, and that was when you were near the academy. - Wed Nov 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Mitsunara, get him out of here. - Wed Nov 11 00:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: From Mist, obviously. Uses a bandaged sword.... - Wed Nov 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Tell me how thick the blade of the sword was. Was it thick, almost round in nature? - Wed Nov 11 00:42:14 2015

There was no resistance, the gaurds of course, took Yuudai to the jail. "..Tell Tetsumi, I said hi then.." he stated this, as he left the house shortly after.* - Wed Nov 11 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got taken to his cell, and with that, the gaurds left the room. Yuudai scanned the room, it was a rather nice room, considering this was a prison. Yuudai, sat on the chair in the corner. Staring at the opposite wall, bowing his head down, staring at the hard wooden floor infront if him. <...Isolation, never fails to reach me..> And thus, begins the steady consumption of Isolation.* - Wed Nov 11 00:50:46 2015

From his constant shaking, the bone mask that was given to him by Revenant, fell from his pocket, hitting against the wooden flooring. "...My last words are this..I did nothing wrong here, all I did was come back to the village, I was still loyal to Sunagakure, I never talked back about ths village.

Before, the sword came to slash at his neck. A red chakra cloak, appeared around his entire body, a single tail, was formed. And with a single swipe from the tail, it knocked the sword right out of Mitsunara's hand, sending it flying across the floor. Yuudai clenched his teeth. He wasn't going to die here, not today. The chakra coated tail, swayed back and forth. 

Quickly and effectively, he punched a large gaping hole behind him, utilizing this to his best ability, he leaped into the hole he left for himself, he of course, would start dashing in zig-zag patterns, to avoid a clear line shot. This, would lead to the outside. * - Wed Nov 11 01:56:28 2015

To where, Hachirou, sat next to his rather large blade. He looked at his blade for a solid two seconds, then stared at the door.

"......Holy shit....I'm fucking bored.." he stated to himself. Inhaling, and exhaling rather slowly. His voice, echoed in the rather small room.* - Wed Nov 11 04:14:43 2015

"..Time to get some practice going.." he said to himself. He gripped his Zanbatou rather tightly, and then, he reared it in the air, causing Hachirou to jump into the air. And with this, he spun in the air, in a rather vertical manner. And with this, Hachirou utilized the gravity, which forced him downward a lot faster, which resulted in a corkscrew-like slice from above. 

To where, he slammed his Zanbatou into the ground's surface. Causing the ground to crack, right after he slammed the Zanbatou into the grassy surface. Causing dust to collect around him. Hachirou started to pant, this drained him greatly. "..I need to get better.." He placed the Zanbatou back on his back, he sat down on the ground.

"Welcome, to my home."* - Thu Nov 12 00:54:36 2015

"Yeah, it's an alright place..Kind of uh.....Yeah.. It's a nice place.." he stated, as he took out a small napkin, and brought his blade infront of him. Slowly, he started to clean the top part of the blade. Once he was done, he got up, dragged his blade through the wood flooring, probably tearing it up a little. And threw the napkin away. Hachirou then, placed the blade back on his back, and sat on the couch. "..Kirigakure is a pretty calm place though.. I'd suggest, once we get our money up. We head somewhere to sell these scrolls I have for profit..." he'd state, awaiting Eiyu's reply.* - Thu Nov 12 00:58:52 2015

Until, he saw someone wearing the traditional Mizukage robes, however, it also seems someone else was fighting aswell, someone who was able to utilize, a strange ability.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) tightened his grip on his Zanbatou, he rotated his neck slighty, before he looked over toward Jehan. "..Do you need help taking care of this individual.." he'd ask curious to what the current Mizukage would say to him. However, he took note of the individual's speed, to where Hachirou took off the Zanbatou from his back. Having the blade hit against the concrete surface, a small crack formed. Hachirou inhaled, then exhaled slowly.* - Thu Nov 12 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) quickly moved behind Jehan. He raised his Zanbatou up high, his next attack, was to slice off Jehan's head. With a quick and efficent horizontal swipe. And if it was a successful chop, he wouldn't stop there, he would continue to try and cut the rest of the male's body in half. He had no problems with killing people, people that he didn't even know. If anything, what Liu said earlier, was starting to make sense. However; Hachirou attacked the current Mizukage out of his own free will.* - Thu Nov 12 07:11:47 2015

After he killed Jehan, he placed his Zanbatou back on his back, blood obviously spilt itself all across his body. He shifted his gaze from the dead Mizukage, toward Liu, then back at the Mizukage. He decided, to loot the male's body anyway, never know what you could find. And after he looted the male's body, Hachirou's breathing started to accelerate slightly.* - Thu Nov 12 07:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) stopped chopping, considering he cut the males body in half, he only chopped up majority of the male's left half. The males right half, was completely fine. He placed the Zanbatou back on his back. And shifted his gaze toward Liu. "....Then study it...Was there even a bounty on this guy?" he'd ask, as he kicked the right half of the male's body.* - Thu Nov 12 07:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) decided it's about that time to start training their technique. And so, he grabbed his Zanbatou, and reared it into the air, quickly, Hachirou jumped into the air, spinning the blade, and twisted his body. Hachirou then, adapeted the gravity, having it force his body downward faster, this resulted in a corkscrew-like slice. To which, slammed against the concrete surface, with such destructive force, that it cracked the very concrete. Sweat was dripping from his face, as thought the technique itself, was rather drainful on him.

After he got done using the technique, he placed the Zanbatou back on his back, placing his hands in his pockets, turning on his heels, and walking back toward his house. Indeed, he did kill the Mizukage last night, but at what cost? If anything, this new Mizukage that took the thrown, was he really worthy enough to take the thrown? Hachirou shook his head. "That little boy...Heiwa...Is dying.... And so is that worthless, Mizukage..." he stated to himself.

Yes, things were going to change.* - Thu Nov 12 14:19:18 2015
