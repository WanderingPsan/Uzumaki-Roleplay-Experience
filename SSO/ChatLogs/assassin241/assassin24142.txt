The Sandworm erupted out of the sandy surface. It let out a mighty roar, out of it's maw, oozed acid, it dripped from it's maw and landed on the sandy surface. Which, burned right through. It was even oozing acid out of it's pores. It's first target, was Koji. It quickly made it's way toward the male, in an attempt to litereally destroy him.*)

She'd suddenly release around ten kunai, each with an explosive tag towards the group, of course..Having knowledge of koji's air palm, she appeared more south-east to ai, so she didn't face koji's air palm technique. 

She'd attempt to have four of the kunai lodge into ai's back before she could comprehend what was happening, letting off a sudden explosion to destroy the clone, or dissipate the technique. The others were set off towards koji, aiming to explode around his feet.*)

The worm, paid no attention to the paper shurikens that slashed at it's body. If anything, the acid that it oozed out of it's pores, could probably get rid of it soon enough. As for Koji's clone, it seemed the damage it created, was indeed great. This didn't stop the worm from opening it's mouth however.

Upon opening it's maw, it once again spewed forth acid at the male. It was more acid than anticipated however, thanks to Koji's Air Palm technique, it seemed to have made the worm puke up acid.* - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015

Burrowed itself back into the sandy surface. The attacks, of course did do it's trick, however, this was the worms way of 'retreating.' so to speak. It could travel at a pretty far distance underground, it was able to shake the very soil they were on, being able to cause unbalance.

The hole, was rather large of course, but when it made this hole, the acid continued to come out of it's pores. So if anyone was to travel, by foot into the tunnel it made, they too, would be hurt by  the acid it created.* - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015

The sandworm, was to far underground for Koji's attack to even have done anything. In all honesty. So, if anything, the damage that was caused, was little to not much at all. The sandworm continued it's route.* - Mon Nov 30 04:15:08 2015

The Sandworm erupted from the sandy surface, the very ground shook as it erupted, this caused Izanami, Hiroshi, and anyone else in the area to get off balance. 

The Sandworm however, when it erupted out of the ground's surface, it used its momentum and jumped into the air, to -literally- smack Izanami back hurrdeling to the ground's surface, basically bounce the side nigga and the thot hoe toward the scorpion.* - Mon Nov 30 04:30:30 2015

The Worm spewed forth acid from his maw, it went straight toward the scorpion that tried to attack. However, when Kinami tried grabbing, the worms pores opened up, releasing once again, acid.

The sandworm was bombared by the attacks, so when he got attacked. It literally -exploded- It's bodily functions, was majorly effected with acid. So whe he exploded, you could expect a lot of acid being sent out toward the region. It was the size of a house after all. So ya'll going to have some burns fam.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jiki, Hayate(Assassin241) continued to lay on the bed. Slowly getting up and rubbing his eyes. Hayate let out a yawn. ". . . . ." he was silent. He turned his head to face the door way. The maid walked through the door, asking if Hayate would need anything. To which, he only shook his head. The maid shortly after, walked out of the room. Leaving Hayate alone for now.

Hayate, laid his head on the pillow. He was waiting for something to happen. He stared up at the ceiling, just waiting.* - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jiki, Hayate(Assassin241) continued to sit on the bed. He was about four or five years old by now. (I have no idea right now.) He scratched his chin. Wondering where his father and mother were. ". . . . . ." there was lack of social interaction right about now. He was wanting to learn how to become a ninja like his parents. But he hasn't seen any of them anywhere. So he just continued to stare at the wall.

One of the maids walked in asking how Hayate was. To where he commented. "Fine. . ." he was four years old, so he only knew little words, not yet able to complete, complete sentences. Once the maid heard Hayate's comment, she left the scene. Leaving Hayate in the room, to be yet again, alone.* - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
