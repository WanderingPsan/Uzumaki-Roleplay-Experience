The young uchiha closed his eyes, and slowly reopened them, suddenly his eye turned red, followed by three tomoe's swirling around his iris violently. "Let's enjoy ourselves, Erebus."

He started to form several handsigns, katon chakra started to boil within his bodies system, he mixed it with the oxygen having the two natures fuse together, as his chest expanded, he opened his mouth as a large fireball went straight toward Erebus' being, Hideki was confident in Erebus's ability to dodge the attack, however if he wasn't to dodge the attack, he'd keep his eyes on his opponet. <You were right, Ushinawa...I do see a lot more clearly with these eyes..>* - Sat Oct  3 17:30:27 2015

He quickly wielded a single handsign, utilizing his shunshin ability, and shunshined away, appearing a couple of feet behind Erebus, however even at mastery level, there was still a delay in using the shunshin ability.* - Sat Oct  3 17:57:45 2015

But if this match was to continue on, I have a feeling you would be the victor." he stated, showing no shame in quitting this sparring match, as he bowed respectfully toward Erebus. "I appreciate the fact you wanted to spar me, but if you wait a little while longer, until I'm stronger, we can have another match." he stated as he looked at Erebus, his eyes now being a regular black color.* - Sat Oct  3 18:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) extended his hand outward, in attempt to shake Kilm's hand. "First and formost... A promise needs to be made." he stated.* - Sat Oct  3 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: You do know i'm slightly familiar with fuuinjutsu. - Sat Oct  3 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm not a fuuinjutsu speicalist. - Sat Oct  3 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: For some reason, I doubt that. - Sat Oct  3 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You can believe what you want Kilm. But I see where your we stand then. - Sat Oct  3 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Fine. - Sat Oct  3 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: I'll shake. - Sat Oct  3 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed Kilm's hand and shook it slowly, although a large white snake instantly came out of his back and traveled through his arm sleeve and wrapped around Kilm's body, however this was instantaneous action. This would've captured Kilm in a bind, and considering Hideki was grabbing his hand, he couldn't do an handsigns. He stared at Kilm. "Who killed Orakuru."* - Sat Oct  3 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Katsune. - Sat Oct  3 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see.. - Sat Oct  3 19:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: I wasn't in the battle of Sunagakure. - Sat Oct  3 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) unsheathed his katana that was on his waist and sliced Kilm's head off, He now knows the truth of what happened to his clansmen, and will be in search for who killed Ushinawa and Mariana next. But for now, his next target would be Katsune.* - Sat Oct  3 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) frowned at the fact that his sword indeed sliced at Kilm's cheek bone, having it tear through his flesh. However, he coudn't stay to get ganked or anything else for that matter, his body quickly changed into his snake lycan state, having him make a quick getta way by shunshining out of the area, however, Kilm was foolish enough to catch himself in mere flames, but then again there was always a chance of attacking Kilm another time, Kilm won't be so lucky next time, that's for sure.* - Sat Oct  3 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took a caravan to konoha* - Sat Oct  3 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) turned the corner, noticing Lyala, however Hideki was actually breaking a sweat, he failed his misson on trying to assassinate Kilm, and he used his snake lycan state in a desert terrain, which wasn't the smartest thing he's ever done. Hideki however got bumped into Lyala. "Huh? Oh, it's no biggy, really.. I also got your scroll, sorry I didn't reply back."* - Sat Oct  3 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: What's wrong? - Sat Oct  3 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nothing at all. - Sat Oct  3 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Tell me, you don't look so good. - Sat Oct  3 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, I have your cloak. - Sat Oct  3 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: We can talk about it later? - Sat Oct  3 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, alright... yeah. Pft. You are probably busy. - Sat Oct  3 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's no- - Sat Oct  3 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ....We can discuss it I guess... - Sat Oct  3 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: No no, it is fin-- Oh. Are you hungry? - Sat Oct  3 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No, I'm not. Thank you though. - Sat Oct  3 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Alrighty, well I uhh... Mmmm. So, where were you going? - Sat Oct  3 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was going to the mansion, but if you would like to discuss what's on my mind. We can go somewhere private, if you'd like. - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Sure, hey perhaps you can help me on this mission? - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: -- - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What's the misson? - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I'm going to need some heavy lifting, and it is just delivering something. - Sat Oct  3 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, that won't be as bad. - Sat Oct  3 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Where are you deliverying it to? - Sat Oct  3 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Samurai...Settelement, south of Kono. - Sat Oct  3 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, I see. - Sat Oct  3 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Wanna go? It'll be fun! - Sat Oct  3 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright, I'll tag along. - Sat Oct  3 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yay. - Sat Oct  3 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ---- - Sat Oct  3 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Lead the way. - Sat Oct  3 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) followed behind Lyala, at first he was looking at the trees that were around the area, they were indeed beautiful, although he took a quick glimpse of Lyala's ass, and then looked straight ahead, his face turned a bit red for a second, but slowly fading away. <..Did I really just do that.. What the fuck..> he activated his sharingan however, he didn't want them to get ganked by an unknown force, matter of fact, he didn't want Lyala dying either. He did miss his cloak though, it was his only memento he had from Ushinawa, that and the gunbai he gave him before he passed away.

He had to focus on other things though, he couldn't let the past effect the present, he had to learn from it and move on, like Ushinawa said, he'd have to be patient and plan things ahead of time, was Kuro right though? Was revenge the right path to take? Was it worth killing Himura? He kept thinking to himself if it really was worth it.* - Sat Oct  3 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow, as he placed his hand over his head. "Oh...Uh... It's something unique I can do, but uh...Promise not to tell anyone? Only a select few know of this ability." he stated as she got closer toward him, taking a good look at his sharingan, which had three tomoe this time around. Although he looked into Lyala's eyes, and noticed hers, they were really beautiful. He shook his head. "We should uh...Get to delivering that package.."* - Sat Oct  3 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) followed closely behind Lyala, as they made there way toward the samurai camp. The place looked rather bland.* - Sat Oct  3 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) paid no attention at the samurai winking at Lyala, once they were done with that, he scooped Lyala off her feet and shunshined away from the area, back into Konohagakure no Sato. It would definately be quicker this way no less.* - Sat Oct  3 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nah. - Sat Oct  3 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) arrived, with his sharingan still activated.* - Sat Oct  3 20:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) was actually going to exit the village and go back to Kumogakure, but suddenly a massive fucking demon appeared at the gate that seemingly with one sweep of it's tail destroied a bunch of houses nearby. His eyes widened, he quickly activated his 3 tomoe sharingan, getting a read on the beasts chakra levels--- It seems as if the beasts chakra levels were indeed of high caliber. He had no time to waste, considering there was a huge fucking iron demon thing in Konohagakure. Strange events were definately happening today, and Hideki wanted no part of it to be honest.

Although, he noticed maloth grabbed Lyala, quickly and effectively Hideki grabs Maloth's arm, jerking him forth as he utilized his Shunshin ability and started to shunshin while grabbing Maloth's arm, who in return had a grasp of Lyala, however considering how big the brute was it would take a while for Hideki to reach the other side of Konohagakure to get them to safety.* - Sat Oct  3 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly and effectively, Hideki made it near one of the side gates, he then once again shunshined with the trio, having it so they make their way to Kumogakure no Sato. He wanted to save atleast two lives today, it's the least he could do, considering his other attempts got one of his friends killed, which was Hanabi. The -least- he could do was get them to safety, and he was going to do just that.* - Sat Oct  3 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
They finally made it back to Kumogakure, Hideki was dragging Maloth and placed him on the ground. Hideki was sweating by this point and panting very badly. "I ... Can't believe... We got away.." his hands were on his knees as they barely escaped the monster.* - Sun Oct  4 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got his hand grabbed, as he was brething very heavily, his sharingan however was still active as he looked at Lyala.* - Sun Oct  4 00:05:32 2015
