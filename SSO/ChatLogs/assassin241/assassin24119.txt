<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You may begin. - Sun Oct  4 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head.

His three tomoe sharingan examined Niza's figure, however Hideki wasn't as skilled as Ushinawa when using this stage of sharingan. But he did his best to prove himself. Quickly he started to form several handsigns, having chakra manifest within his bodies system for a short while, and after he completed the handsigns he ran forward toward Niza's current location.* - Sun Oct  4 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) held the last handsign for his technique, however Niza's jutsu took it's effect on him, his approach was slowed down, having his balance go to shit, as he fell on his ass for a second, and then quickly getting back up, he thrusted his hand forward, as five hidden snakes came out of his sleeve toward Niza's current position, there goal? It was to immobolize him, if it was a success the snakes would wrap around Niza's figure.* - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Niza was fast, that's for a fact, but thanks to his sharingan he gained some precognitive skills, seeing the clothesline coming toward him at a very fast pace, he used the technique Niza showed him a month ago, and that was the Misdirect technique, quickly and effectively Hideki raised his right arm up to knock Niza's arm away, assuming that's what he used for the clothesline, and if it was successful he would send a knee attack toward Niza's gut region.* - Sun Oct  4 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got grabbed by Niza, having Niza grab Hideki and throw him over his standing form, which caused Hideki to slam his body against the cobble floor, he quickly wielded a single handsign as raiton chakra manifested within his bodies system, having the chakra mold, and once it was done molding, he executed the technique, having raiton chakra lash out from his body and onto Niza, this however would not shock Niza, but it would probably numb him, that's what Hideki was looking for.* - Sun Oct  4 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Noticed Niza's change as Niza underwent a lycanthropic state, however in a quick motion, Hideki created a series of kicking attacks, first and foremost he started off with a low kick, attempting to knock Niza off balance. This technique that he has is still pretty new, so he won't know if it's successful or not.* - Sun Oct  4 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Niza was no push over, however Hideki had plenty of tricks up his sleeve, the technique he was going to use required no handsigns whatsoever, As a large white snake came out of his back, traveling through his arm sleeve, in an attempt to wrap around his figure and keep him immobolized. However, this was a fast motion, and if it was successful he would plan on doing one thing, and one thing in general. He planned to send two punches toward Niza's face, one toward his jaw, the other toward his cheek.

Hideki held back on the punches of course, this was a spar after all.* - Sun Oct  4 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) saw that he trapped Niza, and while Niza was figuring out how to get out of the technique, Hideki released it, as the large snake disappeared in a puff of smoke. He looked at Niza and bowed respectfully. "Thank you, for allowing me to spar you. I have one question though, how can I get promoted."* - Sun Oct  4 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 19:32:54 2015

As Hideki then says "Simple." he stated, rather going against his own word about training with Misa.* - Mon Oct  5 04:12:35 2015

He looked at Heiwa. "...I said the fireball jutsu.." he stated rather annoyed that his nephew played a trick on him this whole time. However Heiwa's genjutsu prowess was indeed good, better than his or Ushinwa's for that matter. Which was a good thing.* - Mon Oct  5 05:08:54 2015
