The true OG's left, we outchea.* - Tue Oct 13 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to travel along side Fujitora, his three tomoe was still activated all through this time. This is probably the first time he'd actually gone on a mission with a close relative of his. He got pretty excited, considering the last person he went on a mission with was Ushinawa. Damn he really missed his Cousin. He missed a lot of people, his best friend, his mentor Hanabi. He even missed Erebus. What a shameful day this was. However, he couldn't let sorrow and despair keep him from doing what he had to do.

He looked over toward Fujitora. Thinking to himself. <...If I have to risk my life to save Fujitora, I would do it in a heartbeat..I've seen to many people die, -no- one else is dying on my watch..No one..> he thought to himself. As they continued to travel.* - Tue Oct 13 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to jump from tree line to tree line, ya know. The Orginal Ninja shit. But however they had to camp out. He jumped down next to Fujitora, panting. As he looked at Fuji. "...I need to tell you about these eyes some day, Fuji. In case you are to ever fight someone who had similar eyes like mine.." he stated, fearing the worst. That probably Kohaku's eyes got implanted on one of Edge's members, or Edge himself. He didn't know, but that's the only thing he could assume for now.* - Tue Oct 13 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head.

"Ushinawa taught me all I know....To be honest man, I miss him..I really do.." Hideki shed all his tears three months ago when he found out Ushinawa died. Now he sheds no tears. However Hideki continued to chill next to Fujitora, as he slowly stood up, looking up at the sky. "We should head out soon.." he stated, as he started to walk off with Fujitora. He looked back. "It is funny though that you mention playing as shinobi at a festival. I was born and raised in Sunagakure no sato, and yet... They won't even accept me back. But then again, I like to travel... Hunting bijuu however, will be interesting.."* - Tue Oct 13 23:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) touched Fujitora's shoulder.

"I need you...To trust me on this, Fujitora....Look into my eyes."* - Wed Oct 14 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm?..Alright then. - Wed Oct 14 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eyes connected with Fujitora, as his eyes widened using his sharingan genjutsu, however it was not to get information off of him, nor knock him out. This however, was to relay a memory from Hideki's own. In this memory, Fujitora would find himself in Konohagakure, when the beast Shukaku attacked. If Fujitora was to look around the genjutsu replayed memory, he could see Hideki next to two Konohagakure Shinobi.

Upon closer inspection, Fujitora could see that all three shinobi were in awe, witnessing the beast itself releasing a mighty roar, and smacking its iron sand made tail ontop of the Konohagakure Gate. However, there was still more memories to be replayed.* - Wed Oct 14 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Upon further into the genjutsu relayed memory, Hideki was seen grabbing the two Konohagakure shinobi, fear in Hideki's eyes as he did this action. The two shinobi were Lyala, and Maloth. Although, Shukaku was also seen charging a large ball, that also seemed to decrease in size, and the beast itself ate the ball. And then, firing it at the Kage Mansion. Literally causing a large explotion to take place. Hideki himself took the two shinobi he grabbed and took them to safety in Kumogakure.

However, the memory itself once again, changed places. Now, it could be seen that Fujitora was in the Kumogakure mansion, Hideki was seen in a wheelchair, and on his lap, was the body of Ushinawa's dead body. Next to Hideki was Seisuke, Heiwa, and Reguel. Upon closer inspection, it could be seen that Hideki was sobbing, until he turned away....And when he turned away, it was revealed that his eyes drastically changed from two tomoe sharingan, into the new form, the new formed sharingan itself was mangekyo.* - Wed Oct 14 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The genjutsu continued, it didn't stop there. It showed Seisuke grabbing the lifeless body of Ushinawa from Hideki's lap. Hideki himself from the looks of things in this replayed genjutsu he seemed to have been laughing evily at the sight of getting the new eyes. Now however, the genjutsu changed to a different area. Now they were inside the Ramen Shop at Kumogakure, Fujitora was next to Hideki in this illusion as it replayed. Seisuke's dead body was at Hideki's feet.

The known killer, was Suitengu. Hideki looked at Seisuke's body, his arms shaking, upon closer inspection, Seisuke had a three tomoe sharingan in his eye. That sharingan, was Ushinawa's. However, the genjutsu, once again changed twice in one setting. Hideki was seen stabbing the sharingan eye that was within Seisuke's eye. And then throwing Seisuke's body into the dug up grave. Hideki was seen on his knee's, tears falling off of his face, he lost a best friend that day.* - Wed Oct 14 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The genjutsu, for the last time, changed once more. A new setting, Hideki was seen in Sunagakure, in his attempt to of course find Kilm. Fujitora however, would've been pretty close to Hideki as he did this. In the genjutsu, it could be seen that Kilm had a new face, to where Kilm unhenged himself, as Hideki took Kilm to an isolated area, capturing Kilm in a snake bind, his attempt in this however, was to kill Kilm. But alas it was stopped as he saw people coming to his location. 

Kilm was seen to break out of the jutsu by using Flame shot, causing the snake to get blazed, and Kilm's cloths to even catch flame itself. Hideki on the other hand could be seen undergoing a lycanthropic state, his skin changing to scales that were maroon in color, his eyes were black slits. Seeing that Hideki infact did not have sharingan activated at that time. As Hideki made his escape from the village of Suna. And thus, Hideki stopped the genjutsu.

Now in the real world, Hideki collapsed on the grounds surface, heavy breathing could be heard from his person. Sweat dripping down his face. However, he still had three tomoe sharingan activated, he took off his mask and placed it in his cloak. He slowly got up, went to the river that they were near and splashed his face with water. He showed Fujitora what needed to be seen.* - Wed Oct 14 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Now...You've seen only half... - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yo---You've been through so much.. - Wed Oct 14 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed his hands in the water, closing his fists.

"Half the pain I've taken.." clenching his teeth.* - Wed Oct 14 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) untensed himself. As he got up, he dried his hands on his cloak. He turned around to face Fujitora.* - Wed Oct 14 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Now you know the Sharingan can also relay memories. - Wed Oct 14 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: They can also, tell if you're in a genjutsu or not. - Wed Oct 14 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I see they are very powerful. - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So no matter how strong, it can still notify the user...However, if you're in a genjutsu bind for that matter....It's useless.. - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I was caught by that one girl in a Genjutsu Bind...My sharingan let me know it was a genjutsu, but I couldn't move my hands to Kai out of it... - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) set his gaze on Marrisa.

He then started to form the handsigns for the technique, he made sure to go slow, that way she'd see his handsigns. He began to mold katon chakra into his bodies system, mixing the oxygen together with the katon chakra, having the two elements fuse with one another. Then, he finished his handsigns, opening his mouth, as a flammable gas oozed out of his maw. This created a gasy mist in a way. Hideki took out a match, and lit it. He made sure he didn't release the technique near Marrisa.

Hideki then threw the lit match into the gas, and once the flame connected with the gas, it exploded in large amounts of flame. Hideki then turned toward Marrisa. "It's a pretty cool katon technique...You try." he stated as he crossed his arms and watched.* - Wed Oct 14 21:38:20 2015
