<br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) hands were in his pockets as he made eye contact with Zetsumo.

Osamu nodded his head and said "Yeah, I've been practicing, I'm one step closer to getting a new fuuinjutsu ability. Just need to practice a little more." he stated. * - Sun Aug 30 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) nodded his head.

He continued to make eye contact and said "I've been doing countless research on the sealings that I saw on Katsune. Not to mention the same seal was on Tethys himself. I'm trying to see if I can mimic that same technique." he stated.* - Sun Aug 30 14:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked around the area to see if there was any one else here. Seemed pretty empty.* - Sun Aug 30 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) raised and eyebrow, his hands remained in his pockets. 

Osamu knew well enough what was going to happen, he was there in the interogation room after all with Zetsumo, but he did was he was told and made his way to the front desk, standing beside Kilm.* - Sun Aug 30 15:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) made his way toward Beth. Majority of the people in the group already knew of Osamu's origin. It probably explains a lot to why everyone is so distanced from him from time to time. * - Sun Aug 30 16:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) falled back.

He went toward one of the walls and leaned against it, his hands remained in his coat pockets  as he stared at Kitora, then at Kilm.* - Sun Aug 30 16:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked out of the building aswell.* - Sun Aug 30 16:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) nodded his head.

He quickly took the scroll and read through its contents, after reading the scroll throughly he placed it back into his backpouch. Quickly stretching and looking over toward Kilm. Seemed like he didn't get a misson but Osamu did. Osamu thought to himself <Lazy asshole..>. But he waisted enough time and headed out.

Osamu ran down the white path that seemingy led down from the Kage Mansion. He reached for his tanto and readjusted it, it felt kind of off on his back, he didn't want it dropping on him while he was going on this misson. Osamu sighed loudly and said to himself "This is a drag." He quickly scanned the surrounding area he was in, which by now he was near the Ichiraku Ramen shop.

Osamu squinted his eyes until he saw the paranoid woman that he had to gaurd for the day. Osamu ran up to her and bowed respectively and said "Hello, my name is Uzumaki, Osamu. I'm here on a misson to gaurd you for the day?" he asked wondering if she was the paranoid lady. He quickly unraveled the scroll and examined it once more, he nodded. This must be the chick.

The lady looked at Osamu and nodded her head pretty fast and said "Y-Yes! I'm the one that needs protecting! Can you please protect me!" Osamu raised an eyebrow, it seemed like this lady was desprate for protection, but for what? Osamu didn't know, nor did he care. He just wanted to get this misson done and over with right now.

Osamu's hands remained in his coat pockets, occasionally he tried to make conversation with the woman, but it seemed that she didn't want conversation, more so she only wanted silence and protection. Which in this case seemed pretty boring at the time. No action, not much adventure, just Osamu traveling around Konohagakure No Sato. He scratched the top of his head though, he wondered where Katsune went.

Osamu was assigned a misson to protect her aswell, but she seemingly vanished. He shrugged and continued onward. Following the paranoid lady through-out Konoahagakure no Sato. Osamu actually wanted to learn a new technique today, well that was if he could. If he couldn't then he'd make due with what time he had left after the misson.

One thing is for sure though, the lights came on through-out Konohagakure, seemed like it just hit Night fall. Which could prove for enemies to sneak up on him while on this crucial misson. Osamu spoke up and said "Hold on, let me get a lantern quick." he stated. The paranoid woman nodded and sounded shaky when she spoke "J-Just hurry okay!" Osamu nodded, he quickly made his way to a nearby shop and purchased an oil lantern.

Osamu then bought oil, along with a match and lit the lantern. Giving them some light as they traveled through the darkness. Osamu then said "Alright, let's go." The woman nodded and continued onward. Osamu thought to himself for a split second <I wonder if that sealing jutsu could seal chakra? Or movements? Man..the curiosity is killing me.> he thought. He shook his head, he had to stay focused.

Osamu then finally made it to the woman's house, they carefully went up the steps, Osamu placed the oil lantern on her porch and said "Well, have a nice da- Night..Have a nice night." he stated with a nervous smile. The paranoid woman said "Mhm." she quickly opened the door and closed it, locking it quickly. 

Osamu shook his head and said "That lady needs to be more laid back.." He quickly picked up the oil lantern and blew it out, and placed it back on the porch. He then jumped over the porch and landed on the concrete surface. Kind of hurt his feet a little since he didn't brace himself for impact. But none the less he made his way toward the Ichiraku Ramen Shop.

After awhile of traveling through the path, Osamu made his way to Ichiraku Ramen shop and shouted "One bowl of Miso Ramen please!" he Ramen chef nodded his head and started to make his food.

Osamu scanned the area around him though.* - Sun Aug 30 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow.

No one was able to get in or out without Zetsumo's knowledge. And so he always did what any member of his group would do. And that was to capture and detain the target. By no means was he going to kill the individual, but if anything they were going to ask Yadanaru questions.

Osamu continued to place his hands in his coat pockets, he walked over toward Yadanaru and said "You're going to be coming with me pal."* - Sun Aug 30 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
By the time he made his way toward the young lad, he placed his hand on his shoulder and said "C'mon. I can't keep him waiting." he stated as he dragged the boy into the mansion. His grip was firm.* - Sun Aug 30 21:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) appeared to the scene with a child in his grasp, he looked over toward the boy and said "Shh." as they finally made there way toward Zetsumo's location. Osamu also noticed that he was busy with something, so he decided not to barge in, but instead wait on them to finish what they were doing before speaking.* - Sun Aug 30 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) grabbed the boy and put him over his shoulder, Osamu ran toward Kitora's location and dropped the boy on the sandy surface. Osamu quickly formed handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns, he held the last one. Keeping the fuuton chakra manifested inside his body.* - Sun Aug 30 21:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Used his Kaze Bakuhatsu ability, and maneuvored around the mutated beasts, and around the marble balls for that matter, his new position now would be near Zetsumo. * - Sun Aug 30 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) took out a black scroll, and unraveled it across the sandy surface. Once the scroll was unraveled, lotus flowers were marked across the scroll. Osamu quickly slammed his palm against it, white smoke was seen across his general area. A giant shuriken was gripped firmly in his right hand, followed by atleast 50 explosive tags. He quickly eye'd the beasts, and seemingly he raised an eyebrow.

He talked to himself for just a couple seconds "Seems like when they explode they don't stink.. Could this be the same as what happened to Kirigakure?" this was oddly strange. He wasted enough time just gazing at the beasts, he quickly threw the Giant Shuriken toward one of the mutated beasts, and once it made contact or attempted to, Osamu weilded a single handsign and said "Explode."

An explotion took place in that general area. If anything he hoped he did some damage, if not well, he formed handsigns.* - Sun Aug 30 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) gently grabbed the duck and gently placed it inside his coat. He placed his hands in his coat pockets and said "Should we be wearing any masks or anything like that? He does know what we look like afterall." he stated looking at Zetsumo.* - Tue Sep 01 01:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) followed behind her.* - Tue Sep 01 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) arrived at the front gates of Sunagakure alongside Kitora, his hands in his coat pockets. A black facemask was covering a portion of his face, seemingly he bore a blank expression as he arrived.* - Tue Sep 01 10:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) sighed, he looked at Kitora then back at the gaurds and said "Alright."* - Tue Sep 01 11:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked over, took out his tanto, and backpouch and gave it to the gaurd.* - Tue Sep 01 11:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
While being patted down, they could feel a small duck in his coat, that he seemingly tried to conceal. But to no avail, the gaurds probably grabbed it by this point.* - Tue Sep 01 11:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) had his hands in his coat pockets as he points back with his thumb at the gaurds behind them, he then states "I don't think I can. But even if I was allowed to, I really wouldn't." he states, his eyes glaring at Kitora.* - Tue Sep 01 11:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Was led to another room* - Tue Sep 01 11:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The gaurds led Osamu back into the room that Orakuru and Kitora were in. But seemingly he continued to hold a blank expression on his face. He took out a single die and rolled it across his palm. Seeing what it landed on.* - Tue Sep 01 12:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at his die, then back at Orakuru, he glared at Kitora, then back at Orakuru once more. He placed the die back in his coat pocket and stared at him. He seemingly didn't really care what happened by this point, after all he lost all emotion when he saw his dead friends body 4 years ago.* - Tue Sep 01 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked around the village of Sunagakure, while looking around he stroked his chin as he then says "I've been to almost every village, but Sunagakure seems to be the village with the most heat." he looked behind him and noticed sunagakure gaurds. Osamu sighed slightly as he took out a pair of dice and threw them against the sandy surface. He then said under his breath "This was more fun with Smith and Tethys.."* - Tue Sep 01 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) picked up the red dice and placed it back in his coat pocket. He looked at Yan, as he scans the boy up and down and says "Weren't you in Konohagakure before?" he stated raising an eyebrow. He only saw the boy once, and doesn't really recall his name, but his facial and physical features he does recall. But considering Osamu had his weapons tooken away, he really couldn't do much.

He continued to stare at Yan waiting for a reply.* - Tue Sep 01 12:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) continued to stare at Yan with a blank expression, his facemask continued to cover most of his face as he then says "Was sent on a misson, got captured as you can tell from the Sunagakure gaurds behind me." he states as he points with his thumb pointing behind him. * - Tue Sep 01 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at Yan once more and said "What elements do you specilize in?" he asked curious.* - Tue Sep 01 13:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) continued to bare a blank expression as he shrugged and went to sit on the bench. Seemingly the two sunagakure gaurds continued to follow him.* - Tue Sep 01 13:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) got off of the bench and looked at Orakuru and said "Give me a couple seconds.." he stated looking at Orakuru, then back at Yan as he forms three handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns, his mouth buldged with water, as some water leaked from the side of his lips. He spewed forth a large amount of water, washed forward like crashing waves. After he executed the technique he wiped his mouth and looked at Yan.

He then said "That's the technique, but it's up to you if you want to learn it." he stated.* - Tue Sep 01 13:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) watched and stroked his chin, he nodded slowly as he then says "Almost. Keep trying, I'm sure you'll get it." he stated.* - Tue Sep 01 13:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) went back and sat down next to Orakuru as he then said "Now...Where was I..Oh...Right.." he cleared his throat and spoke "Well, I lived a full year in Kirigakure no Sato. And at the time I had three brothers, and one cousin. Which my cousin is Noriko. My three brothers were; Raijin-Maru, Arashiyama, and Midorikawa. But also at the time when I was in Kirigakure no Sato, black rain, rained down on the village. Forming these weird monsters, I came to the scene right when the monster exploded. Erupting and releasing a weird gas. It smelt really bad." he stated.

The same thing kind of happened in Konoahagakure, except they didn't stink when they exploded. But he continued his story "But anyway, I went on a journey to find my friend Smith, I went to Kumogakure, the Tea village, and then made my way to Konohagakure. That's when I got captured and found out my friend Smith got tortured and died." he stated as a look of saddness washed over his face.* - Tue Sep 01 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) diverted his eyes toward Orakuru's leg, as he then nods his head and says "You should probably get that treated." he stated looking at Orakuru, Osamu was already given information on Orakuru's current state from Mukade. There was no use in hiding any injuries infront of Osamu.* - Tue Sep 01 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: You got some burns and were bit, weren't you? - Tue Sep 01 14:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) got up from the bench and placed his hands in his coat pockets and said "I'm going to walk around." he stated as he started to walk down south, of course he still had two sunagakure gaurds behind him watching his every move.* - Tue Sep 01 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) felt a shake in the ground, but continued to sit and chill on the bench like a boss.* - Tue Sep 01 18:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked over toward Dravae, he bent his knee's going down to basically his level. He took out a pair of dice, and rolled it. If it was a high number he'd help Drave, if it was a low number. He wasn't. Osamu then said "I'm terrible at dice." as the dice rolled across the sandy surface.* - Tue Sep 01 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked back to the bench and sat on it again.* - Tue Sep 01 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) placed his hands behind the back of his head and sighed loudly, he looked behind him and saw the two sunagakure gaurds still gaurding him. He then murmured under his breath "...You'd think these guys would go take a break or something."* - Tue Sep 01 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) glared at Dravae, he placed his hands in his coat pockets, and grinded his teeth. He then spoke up "Smith is dead." he stated.* - Tue Sep 01 20:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at Dravae, it was more like an angry glare as he then says "Don't get shit twisted. The bounty was placed by Zetsumo." he stated looking at Dravae, damn Zetsumo's attitude was getting to him.* - Tue Sep 01 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) takes out a wad of ryo. As he waves it around and says "I have enough to pay you handsomely." he stated.* - Tue Sep 01 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) shruged, he placed the ryo in his pocket and said "No deal." he had one billion ryo to offer, but one billion ryo for information on zetsumo's weakness was to high of a bargain. He just continued to stand in his same position, a blank expression on his face.* - Tue Sep 01 21:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) took out a pair of dice, they seemed to be a bright red color. He then says "Best two out of three decides your fate." he stated. He then rolled the dice twice.* - Tue Sep 01 21:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) picked up the dice and placed it in his coat pocket. He continued to stare blankly in the distance.* - Tue Sep 01 21:22:20 2015

Remained le quiet* - Tue Sep 01 21:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) scanned the area around him. And then stared blankly back out into the distance. It was really boring here in Sunagakure. Konohagakure was less boring.* - Tue Sep 01 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) sprinted toward Maya's position, attempted to grab her by the back of her throat and say "What about a bomb?". He moved pretty quick, but eventually the gaurds caught up to him.* - Tue Sep 01 22:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The two suna gaurds grabbed Osamu and shunshined him away from the current area. One of the sunagakure gaurds scowled him and said "Idiot.." Osamu got himself up and dusted himself off, he's usually calm and collected, well sometimes atleast. He crossed his arms a blank expression still appeared on his face.* - Tue Sep 01 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) coughs and looked toward Orakuru and pointed to the sunagakure gaurds behind him as he then says "Can I uh.. Get my weapons back yet?"* - Tue Sep 01 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) made his way toward Orakuru and evenly distrbuted chakra to his index finger, he then poked Orakuru in the neck. If the poke was successful, he would feel a burning sensation, and a small dot like scar would appear there.* - Tue Sep 01 23:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) squinted and said "Oi.." the facial expression he bore was the type that said NOTICE ME NIGGA* - Tue Sep 01 23:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) leaned against Orakuru, placing his elbow on his shoulder. Osamu was about 6'2, so he kind of in a way towered over him. He looked at Orakuru and said "You didn't answer my question yet, yo."* - Wed Sep 02 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) had his hands in his coat pockets and continued to just stand there, with sunagakure gaurds watching his every movement. He pondered something for awhile. If Orakuru said they were basically family now, why did he have gaurds watching him 24/7? That's kind of weird.* - Thu Sep 03 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The fire creature came down on Osamu's position. Osamu knew better, and he obviously knew that this creature belonged to Zetsumo himself. Osamu quickly formed a single handsign and pushed his palm forth, as he shifted the air currents with his chakra and sent him propelled backwards. The Fire Masked creature opened it's mouth with a creaking noise. It then sent forth a wave of flames toward the Sunagakure gaurds gaurding him. 

Seemingly thanks to the propelling force of his futon technique that he used, it probably increased the flames radius. Causing it to burn the gaurds to a crisp. Osamu, after he propelled himself away, he quickly ran to the beast and jumped onto it's upper back. He then said to the beast, that's -if- it understood Osamu "Let's get the fuck out of here.." he stated.

And with that, the beast flew away like a majestic eagle.* - Thu Sep 03 01:53:16 2015

The Fire Masked creature landed Osamu at the center of Konohagakure, Osamu hopped off of the creature and sighed. He kind of wished he could've helped in fighting the people there, but safety was more of a better priority. Osamu then said "Thanks for the ride." he stated looking at the creature as he went back and flew majestically back to Zetsumo.* - Thu Sep 03 01:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked over toward Katsune, he made eye contact with her for a brief moment, and then looked at her tongue.

He examined it very closely, and continued to stroke his chin. He nodded his head and said "Alright, that's all I wanted to see. Thanks." he stated as he started to walk off, but stoped in his steps once more and said "Want to go get something to eat? I'm buying." he asked curious once more.* - Fri Sep 04 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) walked into the tea shop, with Katsune behind him. He took a seat and asked for a waiter, to which arrived very quickly as he then said "I just want water if that's cool." he asked.

Osamu took out a red dice, with white dots on its surface. He slowly rolled it across the table, and sighed.* - Fri Sep 04 21:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) picked up the dice and rolled it again across the table slowly. He looked at Katsune after seeing what he rolled as he then says "Do you know anything else about Orakuru?" he asked. A blank expression visable on his face.* - Fri Sep 04 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) stared blankly at her, as he then says "That's funny, considering you sang like a chanari in the interrogation room." he stated looking at her. He shrugged and said "But if you don't want to give me more information on him, then that's completely understandable." he said. Taking a sip from his water, and gently putting it back on the table.* - Fri Sep 04 21:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) grabbed his dice and shook it and gently tossed it against the tabe. He sighed once more and murmured something under his breath. "I miss my brothers.."* - Fri Sep 04 21:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) examined her, and realized her cheeks turned pink. He picked up his dice and placed it back in his pocket as he then says "Nothing is complicated about that, seems a little bit of romance was in there." he stated.* - Fri Sep 04 21:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) scratched the side of his head and said "...How old are you two exactly?" Osamu asked curious.* - Fri Sep 04 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) stretched, and yawned as he then said "Well, I'm going to go out and find Zetsumo. Catch ya around." he said, as he placed down money for Katsune's food, and his drink. He walked off unless stoped.* - Fri Sep 04 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) le stares at Maya.* - Fri Sep 04 22:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) scratched his head, he was never really punished before, this was his first time.

Osamu spoke up and said "...This is by no means a joke when I ask this. But this punishment I assume involves physical pain?" he asked curious.* - Fri Sep 04 22:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Before he was escorted away, he looked at Zetsumo and said "Do I get a say, before I get escorted outside?" he asked, staring at Zetsumo.* - Fri Sep 04 22:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) le moved to Zetsumo's side.* - Fri Sep 04 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Le walked outside the mansion, toward a hill.* - Fri Sep 04 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) began to search for a large boulder, persumablely a decent sized one, or bigger. Really didn't matter to Osamu, if he was to push this boulder up the hill, he of course would gain strength from pushing it, and a good work out. But to no avail did he find the boulder he was looking for. He asked around looking for an Amegakure shinobi that was decent in the art of Doton. And after awhile of asking, he finally found one that was good at Doton. Osamu quickly asked him to create a boulder, not a small one of course, but a big one. 

After the Amegakure shinobi created the boulder, Osamu started to push it up the Hill, it of course was a very, very, very slow process. He dug his right foot into the soil, basically as a base to maintain his balance. While his left foot was dug in the soil infront of him. Osamu started to grunt, and pant none the less as he started to push the boulder. Osamu murmured something to himself "This is the kind of punishment he gives out... Holy shit.." he stated to himself.

Osamu continued to push the boulder up the Hill, if anything he was starting to get blisters on his hands, followed by red marks on the palm of his hands. The boulder itself was heavy, and proved to be a pain in the ass while he tried pushing it up the Hill. Osamu himself didn't even make it up that far. But he didn't complain, and continued on-ward.

Osamu's arms started to shake, if he was to fail now, and let the boulder roll down the Hill. He for sure was going to get an even greater punishment. He had sweat coming out of every ounce of his body, this was some tough work no doubt in his mind. But he had to endure it, for now anyways. Another thing rang in his mind while he was pushing the boulder. Why did Orakuru say that Osamu, was considered family to him? His whole time there in Sunagakure was pitiful.

Gaurds were on him 24/7, he was allowed to roam freely, which was a cool thing for Orakuru to do, but he was on constant surveillance. If you were to treat someone like family, you really shouldn't be doing that. But that's the past, and he shouldn't be thinking about the past, but instead should be thinking about the future, and what it holds. One thing is also for sure though, this punishment was in the way of his training.

Osamu continued to struggle when he was pushing the boulder, by this point he was half-way up the Hill, sweat continued to drip down his face, his whole body was pretty much drenched in sweat. There was one mistake he made though, Osamu's hands slipped while pushing the boulder, causing him to get off balance and having to roll out the way of the boulder. Osamu panted hard as he watched the boulder quickly go down the Hill. Once it reached the bottom of the Hill, the Amegakure ninja who created the boulder stopped it by summoning a mud wall to halt it's progression.

Osamu sighed, this was going to take longer than expected.* - Sat Sep 05 13:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) began to push the boulder once more up the large Hill. His hands got blistered before hand, so it was getting a lot more painful, but he had to push through it and endure it once more. He looked behind him to see if anyone was there to notice. Looks like the ghost was clear, he stepped his right foot back once more, digging into the soil. His left foot also dug into the soil, to maintain balance as he continued to push the boulder up the hill.

Seemingly while he was doing this, he was rather parched and forgot about getting a drink when the boulder fell down the hill. Looks like he's going to have to postpone getting a drink of water until he finishes pushing the boulder all the way up the hill itself. Osamu sighed heavily, this was starting to become a drag. But atleast he'll be finishing it sooner than later. Considering now he was moving at a faster pace, the reason for this being that his muscles were still getting sore, and he needed to get this done and over with.

Sweat was dripping from Osamu's face, his shirt was drenched in sweat, he wasn't really wearing his coat anymore considering he didn't want to die of a heatstroke or somethin like that. Osamu was once again, ,half way there and almost at the top. This was definately a harsh punishment, how come Kitora got the easier one? But then Osamu remembered that he was the one that got captured, and not Kitora. But oddly enough Kitora told Osamu to go to a different room when she conversated with Orakuru in another room.

This was definately unfair to a whole nother level. But he sucked it up and continued to push the boulder up the hill. After a couple of hours of pushing, he finally had the boulder reach the top of the hill. Osamu had his hands, at his knees as he started to pant and say "....I'm finally... done.." he stated as he slid down the hill, and took out a bottle of water that was in his back pouch. 

Opening it and taking a drink from it. And then returning back to the mansion to report his progress.* - Sat Sep 05 15:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looks at hands* - Sat Sep 05 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) le takes.* - Sat Sep 05 17:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) quickly went to the weapons store and bought himself 400 explosive tags. From there he hustled back to his last known position which was near Kilm was.

He scattered the explosive tags across the area and took out a Giant shuriken. Osamu formed several handsigns, and once completeing them he placed his palm ontop of the weapon. A bright light emited from where he touched the giant shuriken, as tendrils would launch forth and connect with the 400 explosive tags. Osamu successfully sealed 400 of those tags into his giant shuriken. Once it was sealed, a Lotus Flower could be seen on the top part of the shuriken.

Osamu then said "..I'll use this to get out of a pinch more than likely."* - Sat Sep 05 18:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) took out a total of 6 kunai, and 6 explosive tags. He quickly formed the handsigns for the technique he was going to perform, and upon completeing it, he placed his palm ontop of the kunais hilt. It emitted a bright white color, as tendrils came out of it and attached itself to one of the explosive tags. Sealing it completely into the hilt of the kunai. The same process was done with the rest of the kunai, and once he finished doing that, he picked them up and placed them into his back pouch.

He then stretched and said to himself "Looks like I'm ready to go."* - Sat Sep 05 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) holds breath and went toward Kilm's position. Once there he stopped holding his breath.

Troll Zeno, is Troll.* - Sat Sep 05 18:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) nodded his head, and awaited to follow Kitora.* - Sat Sep 05 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at Kitora, a blank expression on his face as he then says "I kind of figured that already, Kitora." he stated looking at her and back at the eastern wall. Osamu started to form several handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns, he held the last one. Holding his fuuton chakra into his bodies system, and waiting to release it.* - Sat Sep 05 18:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at Kitora, then looked at the soil. He sighed and released his handsign and quickly started to dig into the soil, forming a big enough hole to where it could fit scrolls, this would've took a pretty long while, but none the less he got it down. The amount of holes he made was about 6.* - Sat Sep 05 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) continued to make more holes as he was told to do so, the Katon Creature also followed behind Osamu, he wasn't trying to get bodied while making these holes for Kitora.* - Sat Sep 05 18:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
This took another long process, but when he was finished, he made exactly 4 more holes for Kitora to place his scrolls in. He looked at his hands and they were still blistered from the boulder hill thing.* - Sat Sep 05 18:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) sighed and diverted his gaze toward the skys, while doing this though, the Katon creature also flew up into the air like a majestic eagle, doing a fly by sweep of the area around Kitora, and Osamu.* - Sat Sep 05 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) got ontop of the fire creature as it flew down, and road on its back like a majestic eagle once more and said "On Ward!" as it flew to the square.* - Sat Sep 05 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) made it the squre with the katon monster.* - Sat Sep 05 19:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) takes out a red pair of dice, that seemingly had white dots on its surface. He then says "It's whatever you want the game to be, weather it be personal questions, drinking, getting hit, or getting money." he stated looking at Zetsumo with a blank expression on his face. This was a game he played with his brothers before he went in search for his friend Smith.* - Sat Sep 05 21:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ran to the front gate, his Gaint Shuriken still on his back as he looked around to see who was all here. He saw Beth, Zetsumo's creatures, Zetsumo himself, Sabo, and Kitora. Osamu saw Shin earlier and told him most of the situation, he wonders where he would be. But shortly, Osamu appeared at the front gate seemingly behind the group. He looked out infront of him and thought to himself <Well..That's a lot of people.> Osamu couldn't waste any time, he quickly grabbed his Giant Shuriken that was on his back, and held it in his right hand.

Osamu then quickly ran off into the battlefiled, he threw his Giant Shuriken toward the enemy ninja, and once it either impaled or clashed against another weapon. Osamu wielded a single handsign, at the very tip of the blade glowed a faint white lotus flower seal. Osamu then said "Explode." Soon as he said this, 400 explosive tags that were sealed into the Giant Shuriken came out and spread across the many enemy soliders on the field, and of course exploded. 

A large explotion probably took place, unless someone on the other side could prevent it that is. Osamu stood back and watched for just a moment, to see if it worked.* - Sun Sep 06 21:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (honestly shin) - Sun Sep 06 21:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked at the explotions that were seemingly set off by the group and himself. He felt bad for the soliders that were caught in it. But time for grieving comes later, he ran back, and went past the gate, he then said "I'll be going to the west gate as well." as he darted past the group of ninja before him.* - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
By the time Osamu got to the scene, Zetsumo decimated a lot of the landscape, shit looking like theres about to be a forest fire up in this bitch. But seemingly Osamu formed handsigns, fuuton chakra was building up in Osamu's chakra systems, upon completeing the handsigns, he sent forth a gust of wind toward the enemy group.

Osamu then took out a single kunai that was firmly gripped in his right hand.* - Sun Sep 06 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) quickly formed a single handsign, he pushed his palm forward, having wind chakra burst from his palm, propelling himself back-ward and away from the group. He got a message from Shin and needed to go see what was going on. 

Ya boy Osamu was out of this cluster fuck.* - Sun Sep 06 22:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) made his way to the front gate, running past Shin, and having his feet skid across the concrete surface. Sliding all the way toward Sabo. Osamu still had the pigeon on his right shoulder, and a black scroll in his right hand. Osamu then said "Zetsumo is busy." he stated, but Osamu was still pretty good on chakra usage, so that was a plus. Osamu looked at Sabo, and then at the shinobi infront of them.

Osamu then said "Who's this guy?"* - Sun Sep 06 23:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Note there is still 200 soliders here* - Sun Sep 06 23:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The Kumogakure shinobi that were retreating past the Amegakure forces would've gotten bombarded by the Suiton Unit of amegakure, as they sent forth raging water waves toward the kumogakure group, since it was all used at the same time. This caused for a large wave of water to wash over the opponets. There would also be a Fuuton Unit to Amegakure's forces, as they all also conjured up a fuuton jutsu known as great breakthough, as they sent it forward creating a large gust of wind that would be capable of taking the enemies off balance.

Osamu himself started to form handsigns and upon completeing them, he also sent forth his own great breakthrough with the fuuton unit. If Shin was to use his fire style technique, this would cause for a large destruction. Osamu paid no mind to Nigen's question, he was in the middle of a war, and if he didn't move, he too would be caught in the cross fire.* - Sun Sep 06 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The Amegkure shinobi used this to there advantage, considering the enemy used doton walls, they completely blocked there vision. The Raiton Unit of Amegakure formed handsigns, and upon completion they slammed there palms on the ground, sending forth a raiton jibashi that traveled through the very water itself. Causing it to reach the doton walls, and considering Doton is weak to Raiton, this caused for it to weaken greatly. But before it reached the walls Osamu shouted toward Keiji and Sabo "JUMP!" he stated this for a specific reason, he didn't want his allies getting electricuted by the technique.

Osamu also hoped that Shin heived close attention to the technique that was also sent out, considering he was also seemingly close to Osamu. But he didn't stop the attacks there Osamu quickly used his speed to get closer, or try to get closer to the ground of Kumogakure shinobi, Osamu of course did this by scaling the wall after the raiton technique took it's toll on it. Osamu after quickly running up one of the doton walls, stayed ontop of it. 

He looked over toward them and simplely took out a red pair of dice, as he then shouted "Who's leading you at this very moment. I wish to speak with him, and now." he stated, this was Osamu's way of making bets, with dice of course.* - Mon Sep 07 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
The amegakure shinobi ceased fire.

Osamu looked out toward Kyushiki as he then spoke up "..Are -you- the leader of this mass army?" he stated curious. He held up his hand, noting for his allies to stop the there assault for now.* - Mon Sep 07 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Some of the Amegakure shinobi in the back, started to form handsigns. But they were in the back, so they too weren't noticed. Osamu looked at Kyushiki, as he rolled the pair of red dice across his palm and said "I'm not like Zetsumo, I'll actually give you a chance to live. By betting, now choose good sir. High or Low?" he stated, Osamu was very serious.* - Mon Sep 07 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) whispers: They're not standing down. They're building up their chakra. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: I see, thank you, Keiji. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm getting tired, I've been fighting for far too long. I've got plenty of chakra, but I don't know if my body can keep up. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: (I got like 5 turns left of combat as far as the stamina rule goes) - Mon Sep 07 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) looked toward Kyushiki and said "If you win, I'll allow you and your army to retreat back peacefully. But I recon you tell your shinobi over there way in the back to stop prepping there handsigns. I'd hate for this to turn into a blood bath, and considering we're still in pretty good shape, I don't think you'd want that." this was the sad truth, the moral for the Amegakure shinobi was high, and as for Kumogakure, and Sunagakure. It was at an all time low. 

Osamu then said "Now choose fool, High or low." he stated, he grew impaient. Could it be that he hung around the Tyrant Zetsumo for far to long and that it rubbed off on him?* - Mon Sep 07 00:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm ready when you guys are - Mon Sep 07 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: If it comes down two it you two, charge after our main attack, it should distract them. - Mon Sep 07 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) grew impaient, he looked at Kyushiki and smirked and said "Tell them to seize there handsigns, or else this will get bloody. This is your last and -final- warning." Osamu stated. He placed the dice back in his coat pocket, if anything the number that was just rolled was high. Osamu sighed and shook his head, he spoke up and said "Sorry to say, but the number was high." he stated.

The amegakure shinobi in the back, continued to form handsigns as well. There was a total of 10, one from the suiton unit, and one from the raiton unit.* - Mon Sep 07 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
Osamu didn't expect this shit to happen, it was mainly his fault for being so careless, and this would bite him in the ass. Osamu murmured to himself "Son of bitch." Osamu quickly formed handsigns, building up fuuton related chakra as he sent forth a breakthrough after he finished the handsigns toward the water dragons, taking out atleast 2 of them in the process. But the third one took a direct hit toward Osamu as he tried to dodge it. He fell off of the doton wall, his back hitting the ground with full force. Osamu said one word "Oof!"

The amegakure from the suiton unit used a the water style raging waves techinque  to block the other water dragons coming toward them. As for the Raiton unit, they released there technique, and that was it being the raiton jibashi, having the raging waves go forth toward Kyushiki's kumogakure army, yes it was true, the water+electric move would've came toward Osamu's current position.* - Mon Sep 07 01:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
This led to tons of casualties on the Amegakure side, 105 Amegakure shinobi were found dead by the jibashi, alongside Osamu who also died being fried inside out by the Jibashi attack, and considering he had broken legs and ribs. He couldn't defend himself from what was happening. 

The injury toll on this would be 50, leaving only another 15 Amegakure shinobi still up and ready, but considering they just got ganked. They probably surrendered. But Osamu was pretty much dead by this point, along side with amegakure corpses.* - Mon Sep 07 02:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Osamu(Assassin241) ||
is ded* - Mon Sep 07 02:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went out to an isolated area, and decided that now was the perfect time to practice his raiton jutsu, Hideki quickly formed his handsigns, as lightning flickered between his finger tips, upon completeing the handsigns, he slammed his palms onto the sandy surface. Lightning crackled as the jibashi cracked through the grounds surface. Leaving a rather long trail ahead of Hideki's current position, he inhaled and exhaled slowly. This took a toll on Hideki, considering he didn't get to much practice in on it.

But the more you practiced the better it made you, but something was wrong with his eyes, he placed his hand over his head, as he felt a surge of chakra go through-out his body. But he shook his head and said "Maybe I need to rest for a bit..." he went to a nearby tree, and leaned against it. He thought heavily on what he was going to do now, continue training his raiton ability? Or do something else more productive.

But then he thought why not do more training with his raiton ability, Hideki stopped leaning against the tree and started to form handsigns once more, and upon completeing them raiton chakra flickered across his finger tips as he slammed his palms on the ground, but once he did this, it failed to release. Hideki got up and looked at the palms of his hands.

Upon trying to release another raiton technique, he burned his hands a tad bit, and this ment he had to rest, -again-. And so wasting no time in doing so, he rested against the tree, and seemingly started to doze off to sleep.* - Mon Sep 07 03:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got up from the tree, and Hideki stretched and yawned. He was still pretty tired, even though he was sleeping all last night on the tree. But once he got up, he started to form handsigns again, once more his hands flickered with raiton chakra as he slammed them on the grounds surface, lightning crackled against the sandy surface as it trailed toward the western area. Seemingly Hideki was kind of proud of the technique in a way, seemed efficent.

But he tried to use the same technique twice in one go, he formed handsigns again, lightning electricity flickering across his hands, as he finished forming the handsigns, Hideki slammed his palms on the floor. Seemingly nothing else happened, he saw smoke coming from his hands. Hideki turned his hands to face him and he saw that he got burn marks once again on his hands. It didn't really hurt him much, since the raiton technique numbed his hands.

Afterall he was still pretty new with it, and needed to perform better with the technique at hand anyway. But Hideki was a Pacifist, and didn't enjoy fighting at all, Hideki tried to avoid fighting as much as possible, but if he encountered any, he of course would have to fight. He just hopes it doesn't happen.

But after that, he went back to the tree, and laid down on it. Closing his eyes to drift to sleep once more, he then said to himself "Wonder what it's like, to be a peace. Seems everyone is at war....Everyone.." he stated to himself.* - Mon Sep 07 10:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form handsigns once more, but this time he made it to the outskirts of sunagakure, he was wanting to practice his raiton affinity. And if he was at an isolated area, he really couldn't hurt anyone. Atleast he hoped no one was around. But upon completeing the handsigns, his hands flickered with lightning electricity, he slammed his palms on the ground as he then says "Earth Flash.." the sandy surface crackled as his raiton trialed down south.

After Hideki used that technique, he looked at his hands, but this time they looked perfectly fine. Maybe he shouldn't try using the same technique twice in one session? Or maybe he should and hope for the best? He shook his head, that seemed like a bad idea. Espeically during times like now, wars everywhere. Sunagakure in particular is really isolated, which bothered him greatly.

He quickly grabbed a cloak, and placed it around his body. He also needed one last thing, and that was a face-mask. He didn't want people knowing who he was just yet, espeically since he's  pacifist, he would be no help in fights. Considering he didn't like fighting to begin with, and if a fight did break out, then he'd probably not be of any help.

He needed to find a place to go, a place where he wouldn't be in anyones way. But where would that be? He thought.* - Mon Sep 07 14:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Somehow made it to some village, he thinks it was Kumogakure, considering he could see lots and lots of clouds in the horizon. Traveling back to Sunagakure could possibly be a bad idea, considering the obstacles he's going to have to take, this will definately be a pain in the ass. But Hideki couldn't waste any time bickering with himself, that was just a weird thing to do if anything.

He started his travels, running across the landscape, and jumping into a small river, to which he swam across, he caught a fish in his mouth though, which was pretty cool. He took it and threw it back into the water. Hideki made it out of the river and continued his journey into the forest, but this would possibly take a long while. Considering he wasn't prepped all that well for the wilderness.* - Mon Sep 07 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
This of course was a bad idea altogether, Hideki knew better, but then again he was raised by himself, and was really stupid at times. This was probaby one of the stupidest things he's actually done in his entire life. Curiosity killed the cat I guess?* - Mon Sep 07 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to travel once again, through the dense forest, he hoped he didn't run into anybody, because if he did. He'd probably get fucked up. Considering he's in no condition to get into a fight right now, and if he did. He'd just go as a prisoner. Considering he didn't like to fight.* - Mon Sep 07 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out a bottle of water and drank from it, and after he drank from the water bottle. He put the cap back on it, closing it and placed it back in  his cloak pocket. Keeping it concealed for now, he didn't want people taking his shit, he liked having his shit. Hideki scratched his head though, he thought there would be more people in sunagakure to begin with, but it seems he might've been wrong.* - Mon Sep 07 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued his travels, he went and jumped into a small river that was in his way, and swam across it. Soon as he got passed it though, a fish jumped out of the water and used it's tail to slap him in the face. Shit was pretty intense, soon as he got out of the water he rubbed his face and said to himself "..Son of a bitch..." as he continued venturing off into the wild.

This was still a bad idea to the maximum, anything could be out here. And Hideki for a fact wasn't all that prepared. He really should've been, but he wasn't.* - Mon Sep 07 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to travel across the vast landscape, this venture took all day, and all night. By the time he got close to the tea village, atleast he assumed it was the tea village, he wondered one thing. What would he do once he got into another villages territory? Would he be given a warning, or would they just kill him and not give a damn?* - Mon Sep 07 18:06:56 2015

Just chilled here. Looking at the random people.* - Tue Sep 08 00:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked over toward Suitengu, his eyes turned blood red, followed by a black tome as he looked at the boy, noticing the different chakra that it gave off, it was slight but he noticed it thanks to his doujutsu. But quickly after that he deactivated it.* - Tue Sep 08 00:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) omit that last rp* - Tue Sep 08 00:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) scratched the top of his head.* - Tue Sep 08 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) turned his heels to face the group, his hands were in his pockets, and his cloak was covering majority of his body. He then says "Uh...Excuse me sir....I probably don't have much of a right to ask you this, but could you train me by chance?" this was probably an odd question to ask a mercenary group. But what else could he do? He was ignored in sunagakure, and hell he even went to Konohagakure and was ignored there. It seemed like no one paid attention to him.* - Tue Sep 08 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) bowed his head down.

Rejection at it's finest, he was used to this by now. He sighed and asked another question "Then you don't mind if I train my jutsu do you?" he asked curious. If he got rejected this time, then he wouldn't try anymore questions. * - Tue Sep 08 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went down south.* - Tue Sep 08 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form several handsigns, and upon forming the handsigns lightning electricity flickered in his hands. Hideki slammed his palms on the grounds surface, lightning crackled as it trialed down south, breaking off some of the soil in the ground. Hideki looked up after he used the jutsu to see the amount of damage that he's done. Seemingly it was decent, not the best, but decent. Hideki sighed after seeing this of course, why was he always neglected?

Hideki had a flash back at the time he spent with his only parent, his father. He was a great man, but loved to do bets. And even if he'd lose his bets, he'd continue betting using dice. It became a bad habbit for his father, which essentially caused his death. But at the timing of his demise, Hideki grabbed his fathers dice. Which seemingly was blue with white dots on its surface. Hideki took it out and examined it, it was still quiet old.

Hideki then placed it back in his pocket and went to a nearby house, and leaned against it. He slid his body down until his butt hit the ground floor. He leaned his head back and slowly closed his eyes to drift to sleep, that is unless he was interrupted. If not, then he'd make sure his cloak was zipped up nicely and he drifted to sleep.* - Tue Sep 08 01:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) woke up from his slumber and rubbed his eyes, he looked around and said to himself "Damn..It's daylight already.." he got up by placing his right hand on the house, slowly getting up and pushing off of it. Hideki stretched slowly and carefully as he then said to himself "Time to train my jutsu..." he stated. He looked around, no body was really around him at this point and time. He still felt alone though, no one even noticed him in Sunagakure, or even Konohagakure when he went there.

Same thing was happening in Amegakure. But Hideki shook his head, he needed to focus, he quickly formed several handsigns for the technique he was going to perform, and upon completeing the handsigns, lightning electricity flickered between his finger tips, Hideki slammed his palms on the grounds surface, lightning crackled against the ground as it trialed down south, cracking the surface. After that was done Hideki looked at his hands once more, they weren't burnt anymore, which was a good thing.

But one question still remained. Would the people of Sunagakure know he was missing? Probably not.* - Wed Sep 09 05:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form handsigns, and upon forming the handsigns raiton chakra flickered between his finger tips, through his palms. And upon completeing the handsigns he slammed his palms on the ground, lightning crackled on the grounds surface as it trailed down south, cracking the grounds surface. After Hideki did that, he looked at his hands, and back up north and sighed, he then talked to himself for a breif moment.

"When will I get noticed? When will I ever find a person to call a friend? So many questions that stay unanswered." he stated to himself. He went back near one of the houses and leaned against it. Dozing off to sleep once more.* - Wed Sep 09 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form several handsigns, and upon forming the handsigns, raiton chakra flickered through-out his palms as he started to finish up the handsigns, he slammed his palms on the ground. Lightning electricity flickered across the grounds surface he was around. Upon using the technique, it seemed to also once again, trail down south. Being able to closely reach atleast 2 ft in height, and 3 feet in length. After using the technique, Hideki got up and strectched and once more looked at his hands. He sighed.

It seemed like he wasn't putting enough chakra into it. He needed to get the hang of the jutsu, and he needed to get the hang of it now.* - Thu Sep 10 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to shape the chakra of his raiton, he started to form several handsigns once more, having the lightning chakra flicker through-out his palms. And upon completeing them, he once more slammed his palms on the ground, he spoke to himself "Again!" as the lightning crackled against the grounds surface and got sent toward the east side this time, as he once again tried shaping the lightning jutsu to be 2 ft in height, and 3 feet in length. Although, it would seem that he needed a lot more training in shape training in order to get it to work out well.

It hit against a house , having lightning surge through-out it's general area. Hideki scratched the top of his head and sighed once more "I'm going to go take a break, this shit to intense for me." he went back over toward one of the houses and sat down next to it, dozing off to sleep once more.* - Thu Sep 10 00:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) leaned against said fence.* - Thu Sep 10 18:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked over toward the group of people on the other side, Hideki had questions.

"What's a summoning." he looked at Zetsumo, then at Misa, then back at Zetsumo.* - Thu Sep 10 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at it, and raised an eyebrow.

He scratched his chin and said "Hmm... That's pretty cool." he stated uninterested in ducks itself. Zetsumo seemed to be irritated and have his hands full, Hideki went back down south.* - Thu Sep 10 19:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form several handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns lightning flickered within his hands as he slammed his palms on the grounds surface. The lightning crackled against the ground as it trailed south-ward. Hideki tried to shape it's chakra, trying to make it a certain length and height. And that being 2 ft in height and 3 ft in length. 

He tried that is, didn't mean it would be successful.* - Thu Sep 10 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) squinted and looked at Zetsumo and sighed.

He kicked the ground as some dirt flew up and murmured to himself "Unnoticed as fuck." as he started to walk toward a gate and lean against it. Although he looked at a sleeping child, it looks like he's going to need to watch his language.* - Thu Sep 10 20:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) throws explosive tags everywhere and ignites them and looks at Zetsumo and says 

"NOTICE ME NIGGUH"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ran and did a slide toward Zetsumo and poked his shoulder.

Hideki then said "Hey, can someone have more than one summoning?" he asked curious.* - Thu Sep 10 20:44:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form some handsigns, and upon forming the handsigns, lightning chakra flickered bewteen his palms and finger tips. As Hideki completed his handsigns he slammed his palms on the ground. The lightning crackled as it trailed south-ward, cracking the grounds surface. Hideki tried shaping the lightnings chakra by having it be a certain height and certain length. But of course that still takes a lot of practice and time.

And it seems time and practice was all he had to offer.* - Fri Sep 11 07:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) kept his hands in his pockets as he sighed and said "Guess I can train my raiton ability.." he stated.

He walked south, unless he was stopped of course.* - Fri Sep 11 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) activated his sharingan, as he scanned the area for anything in particular.* - Fri Sep 11 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) deactivated his sharingan, as he placed his right hand over his right eye. He then spoke to himself "I still have no clue how I gained this power...I shoudn't use it recklessly.." he stated to himself. He wondered if anyone knew of this ability. He'd better not ask.

Hideki quickly started to perform handsigns, and upon performing the handsigns lightning electrcity flickered between his hands, he slammed his palms on the ground. The lightning crackled as it traveled south-ward, breaking the grounds surface from the sheer amount of power he put into it. But seemingly it didn't travel all that far. Hideki sighed, as sweat dripped from his face.* - Fri Sep 11 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked around the area, and once it was clear. He went to a nearby building, and leaned against it.* - Sat Sep 12 00:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at his hands, and clenched his fists. Why was he always ignored by others? It was the same way in Sunagakure, even in Konohagakure he was ignored. Hideki hated it, more than anything else. Hideki inhaled then exhaled slowly, his eyes forming his sharingan once more. As he stared blankly at the other house ahead of him.

He spoke to himself once again.

"What's the point in fighting...When it just breeds hatred.." his fists unclenched as he placed them back in his pockets. He spoke to himself once more "There's got to be another way to acheive peace.." he stated once more. His sharingan deactivating shortly after.* - Sat Sep 12 00:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to travel north bound, crossing a body of water that of course, he tried jumping over but faily miserably in doing. But once he got over that body of water, he quickly activated his sharingan in search of anyone in the natural area, and once he found out he was in the clear. He jumped from tree-line to tree-line. Trying to avoid as many people as possible, if he was to encounter anyone. 

His sharingan would let him know since he can detect chakra levels.* - Sat Sep 12 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) appeared in Konohagakure once more, as he looks at the man infront of him. Hideki quickly deactivated his sharingan as he made his approach toward the man. He cleared his throat and said "Hello."* - Sat Sep 12 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who are you? - Sat Sep 12 00:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) turned back around and looked at Seisuke, his black eyes scanning the man up and down as he then said "No thanks. I have to head back to Sunagakure, that's where my home is after all." he stated.* - Sat Sep 12 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I guess I could go to Kirigakure though, sounds interesting. - Sat Sep 12 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) bowed respectfully.

Hideki then spoke up "Lead the way, and we should probably get going now if anything." he stated in a more of a worried tone than before. He had bad feeling about this, and he could feel it in his stomach.* - Sat Sep 12 00:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked around once more, and then looked at Tethys and said.

"So uh...What exactly do you do here?" if anything this place seemed kind of, peaceful in a way, Hideki liked peaceful areas.* - Sat Sep 12 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Well. Seeing as though I'm the Mizukage, I do paper work. - Sat Sep 12 01:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know anyone with the raiton affinity? - Sat Sep 12 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I do. One of the two Genin you saw sparring back in the courtyard has Raiton affinity. However, merely knows the basics for the time being. - Sat Sep 12 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 12 01:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you have any scrolls within your possession that can teach me Raiton techniques? I know I just got here, and I'm in no position to ask for such a request. So if it's a no, I'll be fine with that. - Sat Sep 12 01:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I actually don't. I would've given it to you if I did. - Sat Sep 12 01:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Your best bet is hanging around for a bit and see if the Genin I spoke of has any techniques you don't have. - Sat Sep 12 01:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) made eye contact with Tethys.

He then spoke up "I see.......Could you teach me anything by any chance?" Hideki wasn't all about violence, he hated it if anything. But if he was to get into a fight with someone in this village, he'd need to defend himself. The more techniques the merrier.* - Sat Sep 12 01:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Depends on what you want to learn.. - Sat Sep 12 01:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Anything. Be it walking on water, manipulating shurikens with wires. Anything that can help me defend myself. - Sat Sep 12 01:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I mean, I'm more of a elemental person when it comes to jutsu's. - Sat Sep 12 01:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Most I can teach you is Shadow Shuriken. - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see... Nothing else?  - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: No, sir. - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Damn. - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Everything else is Fuuinjutsu, Wind, Water and Earth. - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ..... - Sat Sep 12 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: None of my affinities. - Sat Sep 12 01:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Sat Sep 12 01:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Guess I should state why I'm here. Considering he's the Mizukage, doesn't seem like I can hide anything. - Sat Sep 12 01:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well, guess I should tell you why I'm here huh?  - Sat Sep 12 01:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: That'd be best. - Sat Sep 12 01:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I belong to Sunagakure no Sato. I traveled from there, to Konohagakure, and from Konohagakure I traveled to Genjigakure, where I got captured by Amegakure shinobi, I then escaped and made it back to Konohagakure to meet Seisuke. - Sat Sep 12 01:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Esentially, I'm a Pacifist. I don't really like fighting. - Sat Sep 12 02:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But a lot of things happened lately, and changed my perspective on a lot of things. - Sat Sep 12 02:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And Seisuke recommended coming here for training, said it was a good place to train and meet peope. That's my story. - Sat Sep 12 02:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I see, I see. - Sat Sep 12 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Tethys unphased.

He spoke up "I was a prisoner, I know nothing of the group, maybe three people's names. Maybe four? That's probably it. I'm not snake, that's for a fact. I've always been ignored in Sunagakure, Amegakure, Genjigakure, and Konohagakure. I appreciate the hospitality you're giving me here." he stated looking at Tethys. He then scratched his chin and spoke up once more "Do you have any summonings?" he asked curious.

He remembered someone in the mercenary group that could summon ducks. And ducks weren't really his style.* - Sat Sep 12 02:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Anyone here got raiton? - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know one technique. - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, could you teach it to me? - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cool. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well uh. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats the only one I know as well... - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...This is awkward.. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean. I could teach you another elements jutsu - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you have the affinity - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I only have the raiton affinity sorry... - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know any non elemental techniques? - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kai? Suimen? - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I know some genjutsu as well - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, can you teach me suimen? - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at how Lera walked on the water so effortlessly.

Hideki scratched the top of his head and said "This looks a bit challenging.." he stated to himself. He then wielded a handsign and started to focus chakra to the soles of his feet, he slowly started to walk closer to the water, but upon his feet making contact with the water, Hideki fell right into it. Hideki slowly got out of the water and back to land, his cloths were drenched. He decided to take off his cloak and throw it down on the grassy surface.

After taking off his cloak, it could be revealed that he had a black shirt, greyish pants, light green shoes, and a sunagakure headband around his waist. Hideki started to do the same process once more, he wielded a single handsign and began to focus chakra to the soles of his feet, trying to evenly distribute the chakra. Hideki then ever so slowly started to walk closer to the water. He moved his left foot onto the water, only for it to seep right through.

Hideki sighed, this was getting annoying. He removed his foot from the water and once again held another handsign. Concentrating chakra to the soles of his feet once more, he slowly began walking closer to the water -again-. But this time he was confident enough to where he thought he could walk on the water. He placed both feet on the water's surface and looked at Lera and said "Uh..This is how you do it... Right?" he asked curious.* - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: More or less~ - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You just gotta practice at it. - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its good for chakra control too~ - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, that's good to know. - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh and by the way. Theres a boy called Ken, he's skilled with Raiton. You can ask him for help~ - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Thanks. I'll look for him. - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed his cloak and put it back on.* - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ....Welp, time to go then. - Sat Sep 12 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh! - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: By the way, my name is Lera. - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It was nice you meet you. - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Lera and gave a friendly smile, Hideki hasn't smiled in a long while as he then bowed respectfully and said "My names Hideki, pleasure to meet you." he stated as he walked back near the Kage Mansion maybe?* - Sat Sep 12 14:00:44 2015
