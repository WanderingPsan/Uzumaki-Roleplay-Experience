<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: If you see a smith of some sort give it to them. - Sun Oct 25 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) placed it in his back pocket. 

"I'll be finishing my missions then----Will do." as he turned on his heels and went off to finish his missions.* - Sun Oct 25 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) appeared near the shores of Kirigakure, he had somewhat a construction crew with him. Arata turned toward them and tossed them the details of his mission. "Alright, I'm going to need your guy's help on building this house, I'm not the greatest at construction....So yeah...Let's get to work." if the construction people complied, they'd get to work right away. One worker brought nails, wood planks, hammers, mallets, ect.

Quickly they set down the wooden planks on the grassy surface as started to do the normal construction things that construction workers usually do, ya know placing the nails down on the wooden planks and hammering them in, the usual jazz. However; Arata himself wanted to give this a try, he took a wooden plank and placed it ontop of one of them-- Carefully he grabbed a single nail and hovered it above the wooden plank.

And with the hammer, Arata hit the end of the nail, as it pierced the wooden plank very easily. He scratched his head. <...This doesn't seem to difficult..> he stated this as he continued to hammer down the nail into the wooden plank. And once it was in the wooden plank. He pondered something, could he use his technique One Art Body Blow to forcefully place the nails into the wooden plank without a hammer?

Arata shrugged, he grabbed a single nail, and threw the hammer to the side of him, he hovered his palm above the nail, as he released a blast of chakra from his palm as the nail went straight through the wooden plank-- it pierced it and literally cut it in half from the sheer force he released from the technique. Arata's eyes widened. This technique really was powerful.

He shouldn't use this technique so carelessly. He yawned as he stepped to the side and watched some of the workers build the house, he leaned against the tree, and looked up at it's leaves as they danced in the air while the wind blew them away. Arata smiled, he wondered what Koji and Ai are doing by now, even Daisuke. They were the first friends he's every made. In fact Daisuke became Arata's best friend; However, Arata stopped leaning against the tree.

He looked around the surrounding area, something was fishy--- Something didn't feel right and he wondered what it was. His body was tense, he had to shake it off. He had to focus on completing the mission at hand, and that's exactly what he was going to go do. He looked at one of the workers, seeing them working pretty hard.

Arata tossed the man his water bottle. "Here..Take this.." the worker caught it and took a drink from his water bottle, literally finishing the whole bottle. Arata stared at the man. "Uh...Go ahead and throw that away since you're done with it.." he told the man, as the worker complied and threw the water bottle away in the trash bin, not litering of course.

Arata then clapped his hands as he saw the house was finally built. "Great work, I'll be sure to tell Kirie of the work you guys have completed here today." he stated with a smile on his face, he waved good bye at the workers, as the workers also waved good bye toward Arata. He sighed, he looked at the other mission scroll.

He had to go find a fucking cat now..* - Sun Oct 25 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) sighed.

He hated trying to find animals. It was just a pain in the ass, espeically if they were quick as fuck. But he shook his head, he had to finish this mission, then he could get to training for what was really important. However; Arata made this easier on himself, he activated his Byakugan. Veins buldged toward his eyes; this gave him three hundred sixty degree vision around the general area. With his sensing range being 99 blocks.

Quickly Arata ran through out Kirigakure no Sato, even passing by some waters by converting chakra to the soles of his feet. After traveling across the waters for a short while, he made it back on land, still trying to find this god damn cat that has ran away from it's owner. What a terrible animal to have-- a damn cat, why not a dog? Dog's were cool.

And then, he spotted the cat through his three hundred and sixty degree vision. He ran toward it-- To which the cat was fast, it's reflexes were superb. But not as good as Arata's. Quickly he manevoured around the tree's, the cat seemed to use the trees as blockades. But that wouldn't work for Arata, he had to finish this mission.

Pesky cats. Finally Arata made it and grabbed the cat, slowly picking it up and scratching the cat's forehead. "You thought you were quick.." he stated this as he made his way back toward the Kirigakure square to return the cat; that he of course captured back to it's original owner. And after handing it to the owner, he went back to the waterfall.

It was rather tiresome trying to capture animals that were quick as fuck. That shit just wasn't fair. Arata was tired, sweat was dripping from his whole body. It was a rather tiresome day, but Kirigakure gave off a cool; yet gentle breeze of wind. So that was always nice to have, a lot better than Sunagakure. He doesn't even miss that place at all.* - Sun Oct 25 19:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) squinted at the man. Veins buldged toward his eyes; Arata got into his gentle fist stance, He extened an open palm toward Ambrocio's right shoulder, he expelled chakra out of his palm with great force toward the man's shoulder. If this was successful, it would jolt the man's shoulder forward.* - Sun Oct 25 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) smirked.

"I just want to have a spar. I'm bored, and you look like someone that's easy to rile up." he stated as he awaited the man's reply.* - Sun Oct 25 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I tell you I'm a traveling gourmet.. And you immediatly want to punch my face? - Sun Oct 25 20:01:29 2015

The veins that buldged toward his eyes slowly faded away; Arata placed his hands in his pockets. "Meh.." was all he said.* - Sun Oct 25 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: That. That isn't an answer. - Sun Oct 25 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You should work on that. - Sun Oct 25 20:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) unraveled the scroll, reading it's contents as it explained how one could use the water and create a water clone. He raised his eyebrow after reading that, he knew he could make earth clones. But water clones sound pretty cool. Clones made out of water, dang that sounds cool. He continued to read the scroll's contents, he had to focus and get this scroll out of the way; he wanted to learn some different things later on.

He took out an orange juice from his back pouch, and drank the hole bottle. He tossed it on the ground and continued to read the scroll. He yawned; not that reading the scroll was boring or anything like that, but that he was tired from doing all the other activies he's done today. God damn he was really busy today, more busy than he's ever been.

Still soon as he was done reading the scroll, he placed it in his back pocket and walked back to the village square after learning the technique. He was pretty excited no lie, learning new things ment that he was getting stronger-- And that's exactly what he needed to be, was stronger.* - Sun Oct 25 20:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) was no fool, quickly Arata grabbed Vessul, and threw him to the side. Quickly and effectively, he ran -around- Minimasa, seeing this as a threat for his life, he quickly hit her chakra points. However, each were on her back, atleast 10 strikes were made around her spinal column. This would definately paralyze her for the moment. Rendering her useless of doing anything. 

He looked over toward Vessul. "I apologzie for attacking you Vessul. It was Minimasa who disrespected, not you.." he stated this as he was already behind Minimasa when he released his attacks.* - Sun Oct 25 22:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) hovered two fingers over the young female's cranium. The amount of disrespect that was given toward Arata was unbelieveable. 

"You know, I was going to undo what I did....But you can suffer.." he stated this as he tapped Minimasa's right shoulder, expeling chakra forth from his fingers, a jolt would be given toward her right shoulder---dislocating it. * - Sun Oct 25 23:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) sighed.

He tapped the same chakra points he tapped earlier on Minimasa, meaning she could move properly now. He also popped her shoulder joint back in place. His veins that buldged toward his eyes seemingly vanished as he walked back toward Daisuke.* - Sun Oct 25 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) charged forward, utilizing his speed and went around Daisuke, he unsheathed his katana. Doton chakra manifested his blade as he attempted to clash the doton covered blade; against Daisuke's side. It didn't really have cutting power, considering it was covered in rock material.* - Tue Oct 27 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly moved toward Daisuke's current location.

He moved swiftly, he used his katana to collide with Daisuke's, Arata unsheathed his tanto which was on his back, as he aimed to cut at Daisuke's shoulder----- It wasn't a large cut, if anything it was very minor. He wasn't intent on trying to hurt his friend or severely injure him. It was a spar after all.* - Tue Oct 27 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow.

<...My attacks missed.> He was rather confused on the whole situation, however; his inner ear began to pulsate from an unknown reason. Arata sheathed his tanto. But continued to grip his katana which was within his grasp. Veins buldged toward Arata's eyes, as he activated his byakugan. He was getting a three hundred and sixty degree view on the whole situation. Arata could see Daisuke's chakra pathway system.* - Tue Oct 27 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly jumped into the air, he stabbed his doton covered katana against the concrete's surface. It would've collided with Daisuke's blade--- Arata while he was in mid-air and decending, he placed his right foot ontop of the blade's hilt. Arata was trying to balance himself. Arata quickly formed several handsigns, as he was molding suiton chakra within his bodies system for a short while. And after he finished his hand signs, Arata sent forth a stream of water toward Daisuke.

His intended goal when he did this? It was to wash Daisuke away, and gain distance from the two individual's. He was intent on trying to find out what Daisuke used to have his inner ear pulsate like it did earlier.* - Tue Oct 27 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) stepped off the Katana that he was balancing himself on, as the doton covering the katana crumbled off of it. He sheathed his blade and looked at the individual that made his presense known to them. His byakugan however; was still activated.

Arata had veins buldging toward Arata's eyes, activating his byakugan. Quickly he made his way toward Ortho's current position. And utilizing his gentle fist ability, he used two fingers and pressed both of his fingers ontop of Ortho's shoulder. When Arata did this, he expelled chakra from the tenketsu in his bodies system, releasing a strong force to jolt Ortho's shoulder down-ward. If it was not avoiding however-- There could be some bad damage to his shoulder.* - Wed Oct 28 00:26:52 2015

Before Arata even made it toward Ortho; it seemed he had fired off a water related technique toward him. Quickly, Arata spun in a circle, creating a shield of chakra infront of him; this was used to basically in a way parry the attack that was sent toward him. And if it was successful. He would continue his assault toward Ortho.* - Wed Oct 28 00:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) stopped spinning, causing the sphere of chakra to dissappear. Quickly and effectively, Arata ran -away- from the large gust of wind that was coming toward him; or atleast he tried to that is. If he was successful or not was up to the user. And if it was -unsuccessful- then of course he would be hit by the gust of wind and sent gliding across the concrete.* - Wed Oct 28 01:12:06 2015

Ya boy ended this spar though, he deactivated his byakugan and stopped being in his gentle fist stance. He placed his hands in his pockets and started to walk off. "Nice spar."* - Wed Oct 28 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly got to work on his mission that he didn't do. They were going to be due soon as he needed to get them done. He didn't really care what kind of punishment he got, the Mizukage didn't really scare him in all honestly. But he had to get to work, he got himself  a trash bag and started collecting useless trash, all that good jazz. 

He went and picked up some trash near the Kirigakure shores; and god damn did people litter here in the shores. There were pop cans, food wrappers everywhere. People needed to clean up more and to quit littering. Shit was unhealthy for this planet yo. Arata's no ones boss though, he just did what the mission told him to do. So that's what he was doing, he just needed to get this money.

But he quickly filled up his first trash bag, to where he threw to the side. Arata magically took out another trash bag and started to clean up some more of that trash that was scattered across the ground. People obviously didn't know how to use the trash bins that were around the village. The fuck is wrong with people, the trash bins aren't even that far away. He shook his head.

Arata had filled up his trash bag once again. So he grabbed the other trash bag that he filled earlier and started to go near one of the trash bins that were close by around the village. He was basically dragging the trash bags across the ground, but it stunk pretty bad. He was never going to do this kind of mission ever again.

Finally he reached the trash bins and threw both of the trash bags into the trash bins; he then wiped his hands on his pants and walked away. He was done with mission number one. Next up, was mission number two, and that didn't seem like it would be that difficult either.* - Wed Oct 28 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) next's mission was to locate once again another run away dog. 

He shook his head, what is up with people and losing animals all of a sudden. Can't people keep their animals in check? It's not that hard to just put a leash on your animal, and literally tie that leash around a tree or something; was it really that difficult? He didn't want to think about it, he continued to shake his head and walked further south.

He quickly activated his byakugan, veins buldging toward his eyes; This gave Arata three hundred sixty degree vision across the area, followed by a sensing block of 99. He couldn't waste anymore time, he quickly ran across the vast land in search of the dog. After awhile of running and searching, Arata found the dog.

The dog had white foam coming out of it's mouth, to were Arata raised an eyebrow. He snapped his fingers at the dog, telling it to come near Arata. However; this dog was not there to listen, it was there to attack and try to kill him. To where Arata was not going to play that kind of game. The dog was fast no doubt.

The dog quickly sprinted toward Arata, to where Arata used his gentle fist ability and striked at the dog' cranium, he was careful not to get bit by the canine's teeth. He didn't want to catch some sort of disease from this damn thing. That was the last thing he wanted to worry about--- A disease. There was one thing that he pondered in his head.

Who was that man Kirie was talking to that went by the name of 'Father'. What an odd code name to have. Arata knew better; that probably wasn't the man's name. But Arata grabbed the dead dog and walked near the Kirigakure waters;  he threw the dog into the water.

The dog's body slowly got consumed by the Kirigakure Ocean. And with that, Arata went to finish his last mission--- which was to deliver flowers.* - Wed Oct 28 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) walked to the flower shop, entering it and asking the lady at the desk a question. "I'm here to um...Deliver flowers to someone?" he asked rather curious. The lady at the desk nodded her head and took out a bunch of flowers and handed it to Arata. He raised an eyebrow, "This is a lot of flowers...But uh, thank's miss." he stated this, turning on his heels, and walked out of the door.

There was a note on the flowers, that said where the person's house was and all that good jazz. And so, he had to make his way there---- which wasn't all that far, it was rather close by. Thank god for that, Arata has had enough running for one day, espeically after he had to chase that god damn dog, Arata was fast, but that dog was just a little faster than Arata. God damn animals.

By now he made it to the house. He knocked on the door, placed the flowers on the 'welcome' floor pat, turned on his heels and left the area. He did his job, he delivered the flowers to the person. He got this done and out of the way, and now he can continue training for other things. He was curious on one thing, and that was if anyone in Kirigakure no Sato had the shunshin no jutsu technique.* - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
