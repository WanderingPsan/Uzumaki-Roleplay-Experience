Hideki stared at it for a long while, his red eyes scanning the structure, or what's left of it anyway. He sighed, and turned around, he took out a bottle of sake and drank from it. As he looked over the horizon. "..Konohagakure needs a new leader, someone to take charge..Someone to make a difference." he placed the sake bottle down on the ground. He chuckled. 

He looked up to the sky. "What would you do Ushinawa?" * - Sat Oct 10 01:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shrugged as he charged forth, attempting to collide his katana onto Hana's katana, and if they collided sparks would've definately been flying. However Hideki came to Konoha for two reasons, one reason was to see if his girlfriend Lyala was alive, and the second reason was to try and lead the village. However, he'd have to do so after this match.* - Sat Oct 10 03:14:59 2015

She was fast, however, Hideki had quick reflexes, quickly he manevoured around Hana, a large white snake came out of his back, and traveled through his arm sleeve, wrapping around Hana's frame. If this was successful, he would connect his eyes with her own.* - Sat Oct 10 03:21:48 2015

Did not cheat, he used his resources.

"Well, since I win. Your name." he asked rather curious, before he looked over and saw Ambrocio, he's glad he ended this spar before Ambrocio got here, the man rages over everything. However he was a good ally.

Hideki waited for her reply.* - Sat Oct 10 03:26:56 2015

The snakes poofed into white smoke as he released Hana. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Hana." after they were done introducing one another, he motioned for Ambrocio to follow him, and Cypher if he wanted to come along. He was going to try and become the Hokage.* - Sat Oct 10 03:30:20 2015

However he quickly formed some handsigns having chakra mold within his body for a short while, however, after he finished doing the handsigns, he thrusted his arm forward, as five snakes came out of his sleeve, aiming toward the man cloaked in black, basically the one Ambrocio was attacking. The snakes however opened their mouths as kusanagi like blades came out of them, they were aimed at specific locations, his arms and legs.* - Sat Oct 10 04:05:20 2015

This nigga Ambrocio ain't calmed yet, he legit tried making eye contact with this man and tried to put him into a sharingan genjutsu, and if he did put him in a sharingan genjutsu, he'd say to Ambrocio.
