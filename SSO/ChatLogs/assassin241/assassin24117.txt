When he got hugged, it hurt like a mother fucker. He clenched his teeth, holding back the pain. And once she released, He exhaled slowly. "It just... Happened, he just charged at me, barely any time to react. But it's my ribs and my femurs. They're both broken." even with Misa's medical ninjutsu, it would nearly be impossible to heal broken limbs.* - Thu Oct  1 01:32:09 2015

"Hmm...I do have one in mind, but in order for me to teach this to you, I need to see how far you've progressed in your summoning technique." he stated rather blankly, this is how Hanabi did Hideki's training, and he in return will do the same to Misa.* - Thu Oct  1 02:30:11 2015

The snake scurried it's way toward Hideki's chest, to where he looked at Misa and frowned. "Practice it a little more, and I'll teach you how to summon snakes out of your sleeves, and use them effectively in battle." he stated as he stared at the snake that was on his chest. He then looked at Misa. "Why did you turn around when I asked you that question, Misa?"* - Thu Oct  1 02:36:09 2015

Considering Hideki's current situation, he couldn't have stopped the snake even if he tried too, but it slipped under his clothing, and when it did, he winced in pain. Considering his ribcage was broken and having a snake scurry in his clothing just made the pain hella worse. "Why are you on the defensive though?" he asked as she raised her fist up toward him, although Misa had yet to put the senbon back into her hair. When he looked at Misa, who had her hair down, she looked rather beautiful. * - Thu Oct  1 02:39:34 2015

Reached into his cloths, and grabbed the snake that was hiding in his cloths. Or atleast attempted to, if he couldn't have grabbed it, a large white snake came out of his back and went in search for the snake that was in his cloths, and if it found the snake, it would constrict it, attempting to send it back to the Ryuchi cave.* - Thu Oct  1 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The large white snake constricted the snake that was in his cloths, constricting it to the point where it got unconcious. And sending the snake back to Ryuchi cave, both snakes disappeared in a plume of smoke as he looked at Misa. "Usually you wield a single handsign, and with that you can disperse them upon command. Or, if they get bored of you, they'll just disperese themselves." he stated looking at Misa.* - Thu Oct  1 03:06:01 2015

The tea spilled all over his thighs, as the plate also seemed to fall over on the floor. The tea was still rather hot regardless of their previous conversation. Hideki clenched his teeth, not trying to yell or scream in pain. Considering this -really- fucking hurt. He closed his eyes shut, trying to hold the pain in. He definately didn't deserve this, but in Misa's eyes, it seems he did.* - Thu Oct  1 03:16:16 2015

Got his crotch dabbed with a towel, Hideki however, formed several handsigns, as he extened his sleeve outward, his hand of course was behind Misa, as 4 snakes came out of his sleeve going toward Bernadotte.

The snakes that impaled him, disappeared in a plume of smoke. However his wounds were still there, Hideki himself had bandages around his ribcage area, the same was to be said about his femurs. Considering those limbs were broken from previous events. His hand however was still behind Misa, he slowly retracted his hand away from behind her, and gently rested it on his lap. As he glared at Bernadotte. It was one of those death glares in a way. Hideki then spoke toward him. "I apologize for my actions."* - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015

It was obviously a bad idea to begin with. And he regretted doing so, he let himself down, but not just that, he also worried his friends. Which he tried preventing to do by isolating himself from them. But no matter what he did, they always came into his life. I guess it couldn't be helped regardless.

He continued to stare at the ceiling, sighing.* - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow as he saw Misa smile widely. He nodded his head. "Alright, I trust you.." to be honest, Hideki was more paranoid than Ushinawa in all honesty, but who could really blame him? The snake slithered its way toward his ribcage, as it bit and released it's medical power. He started to feel a slight soothing sensation, the pain started to go away as he looked at Misa. "You....You did this for me?"* - Thu Oct  1 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) saw Misa's face turn a soft shade of pink. "I see....Thank you, and the pain is gone now... Thanks.." the snake finally dispersed from his muscular frame, as he continued to lay there, looking at Misa. Amazed by her snake ability. It truely was unique. He grabbed her hand, and looked into her eyes. "Thank you Misa. I really do appreciate it." after saying that, he released his hand from hers, and gently placed it back on his lap.* - Thu Oct  1 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head. "No, it's okay. I'm fine now..Tha-" he noticed Misa's eyes, and they were magnificent. He cleared his throat. "Thanks, Misa." he stated as his eyes fixated onto Misa's.* - Thu Oct  1 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) a large white snake, once again wrapped around Misa, stopping her from forming the handsigns, considering the technique itself was instanteous and required no handseals. Hideki stared at Misa. "I told you, one is perfectly fine. Why do you persist on giving me two...." he stated, rather annoyed that Misa tried giving Hideki another dosage, when he was perfectly fine with one.* - Thu Oct  1 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The large white snake unwrapped itself from her grasp. As it disappeared in a plume of smoke once more. Hideki stared blankly for a second toward Misa. His cold heartless eyes making contact with hers. He then laid on the pillow, staring at the ceiling. Hideki usually wouldn't have done that, but after what happened a couple of weeks ago. He had very little people he could trust.* - Thu Oct  1 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow, rather paranoid of what was about to happen to him. Yes indeed he was very vulnerable. But he scooted over and patted the bed next to him. "Come Heiwa, what is it?" he could tell the child was scared. And he would do anything to help his nephew. He winced in pain slightly though, considering his ribcage injury was a pain in the ass.* - Thu Oct  1 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) reached for the dresser, which was next to him, opening it slowly and taking out a container that had water inside, he opened it and looked at Heiwa. "Put it....In here...quickly.." he stated, hoping he would follow his orders. Hideki however, started to shed tears. He lost his best friend, no not just his best friend, but someone who's been there for him, through thick and thin. Someone that was there for him and protected him from those that dared to harm Hideki. He was in shock no less. He closed his eyes slowly, as tears continued to rush his face.

He started to rub his face, as he could only assume what happened to Ushinawa, he probably gave his son his eyes so no one else can take his eyes. No, -no one- was to have the sharingan power. No one was to even wield the eyes unless they were a part of the clan. Hideki started to speak toward Heiwa. "These....eyes, possess ocular powers. There visual prowess so far is unmatched by any doujutsu. They are extremely powerful, and if caught in the wrong hands, could lead to.......Yeah... I think you can plug two and two together, Heiwa." 

After he was done explaining a bit of information on the eyes, he patted Heiwa's head. As tears continued to fall from his face and land on the bed sheet. He spoke toward his nephew "What about....Mariana?" he asked rather curious. He barely had any family members left, if anything his only remaining family was Kush, Misa, Niza, and Heiwa. He clenched his fists and teeth, he slowly reopened his eyes as his eyes forming the sharingan, two tomoe.

"Whoever did this.....To Ushinawa......will pay dearly...."* - Thu Oct  1 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) patted the boys head, he slowly got on his wheel chair, his sharingan still active as he started to stroll out of the room. But before he did so, he closed the cap on the container and placed it in his cloak. "Let's go see your mother, Heiwa." he deactivated his sharingan and started to go toward the hospital.* - Thu Oct  1 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Thu Oct  1 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Hanabi died...Ushinawa died...I just hope Mariana is okay.. - Thu Oct  1 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ... - Thu Oct  1 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Anyways, where's this medic I've been hereing about? - Thu Oct  1 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to stare at his, his emotions just bottling up inside. He looked oever toward Heiwa, his life no depended on Hideki. Tears began to fall from his face, and land onto his lap. He clenched his fists, he couldn't believe this was happening. First it was Hanabi, and at that time he even tried his best to grab her and retreat. But instead Erebus had to ruin it for him, Erebus -killed- Hanabi, for no fucking reason. He was frustrated, he wanted revenge. He wanted to avenge Ushinawa's death, he didn't even know what happened to his cousin.

Hideki slowly closed his eyes, as he inhaled slowly, and exhaled slowly. He gribbed the katana that was on his lap, he gripped it tightly. His veins buldging on his hand. Tears continued to fall. It was at this point in time that Hideki himelf made up his mind on what he was going to do, and that was to avenge his two mentors. Ushinawa and Hanabi. They were the only two to actually take notice of Hideki. To actually train him, to take him in and get him stronger.

Hideki slowly reopened his eyes, his cornea however was a red color, followed by two tomoe's rotating around his iris. As tears continued to fall from his face, it was not stopping anytime soon. He blamed himself for being weak, he blamed himself for letting his friends get hurt infront of him. Looking back at it, Mamoru also got himself hurt from trying to protect Hideki, Mariana herself tried protecting Hideki, and also got injured. Everyone that was near him got injured.

He continued to clench his teeth. "Why...Why can't I protect those that I love...Why..."he placed his hands on his head, gripping his hair, it was like Hideki was losing his sanity. He was losing everyone, everyone he ever loved kept dying. Who would be next he wondered? Would it be Niza? Misa? Hiewa? he had no idea what was going to happen next.

He ungripped his hair, gently placing his hands on his lap. He murmured to himself. "...I've made up my mind....Erebus is next on the list...Katsune and Kilm can wait.." He looked at Heiwa. "I have something to teach you, Heiwa." yes he was going to teach Heiwa something useful this time, he was in a wheel chair. But this would not prevent him from teaching his nephew how to defend himself.* - Thu Oct  1 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
In an instant, a large white snake came out of his back, traveling through his arm sleeve and wrapped around Reguel, it was immobolizing him for the moment. He looked at Reguel, his eyes filled with sorrow, and hate. He unsheathed his katana with his free hand, and placed the tip of it on Reguel's jugular, not applying pressure to it just yet. As he spoke toward him "Next time you try that...It will be your head..Understand..." The large white snake however, tightened it's bind on the male.* - Thu Oct  1 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Sheathed the katana, as the snake poofed into a plume of smoke. Although, it was just brought to his attention, that Ushinawa's body was infront of him, he once again sent forth another large white snake that came out of his back, and wrapped it around Ushinawa's corpse. Securing it safely within the snakes grasp. The snake brought Ushinawa's corpse closer toward him, as he took out a single kunai, and looked at Ushinawa's eyes. No one was to wield the sharingan power, it belonged to the faithful Uchiha clan, and if there was any non uchiha who possessed such a power. They too will feel Hideki's wrath, wielders of the sharingan and byakugan were always hunted.

So it made it hard to trust anyone, he looked at Reguel, and then back at Ushinawa's eyes, as the kunai itched closer toward Ushinawa's right eye.* - Thu Oct  1 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mamoru got injured because of me, Mariana got injured because of me, fucking Hanabi died because I wasn't strong enough to grab her and run. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then tell me Hideki, I won't say I understand. - Thu Oct  1 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) spoke toward Seisuke, his two tomoe was obviously in view of Seisuke as he spoke. "I am going to fulfill what he wanted me to do, Seisuke. And you are interferring with just that.." he stated as he struggled trying to stab the kunai into's Ushinawa's eye, he tried to destroy it completely, -no one- was to have it's visual prowess. But none the less Seisuke's grip on Hideki's wrist was strong, which causing his hand to struggle.* - Thu Oct  1 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Trust no one.. - Thu Oct  1 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The words Seisuke told Hideki hit him deep, it hurt knowing the truth, and what Hideki was doing was destroying his memories of Ushinawa, he sighed inhaling slowly and then exhaling slowly. He stopped struggling, as he looked at Seisuke. "What do you plan on doing....." he stated, rather curious. It was rather odd that once a strong person dies, people flood the room curious, wondering what happened, but in this case, it seemed Seisuke wanted something more, something else. Could it be Ushinawa's eyes?* - Thu Oct  1 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: If I wasn't hurt right now.. - Thu Oct  1 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I would've took Ushinawa's body and ran. - Thu Oct  1 23:35:40 2015

Suddenly however he looked away from Seisuke and the others for a brief moment, as his tomoe's disappeared as three spikes form along his iris, quickly they transcend into the cornea's layers, the iris however is center around a dome-like strucut where spikes protrude. He let go of the kunai, his white snake that wrapped around Ushinawa's body poofed into a plume of smoke, as his corpse lay flat on the ground. He placed his hands onto his face, as he started to laugh rather evily, as he slowly dropped his hands to his lap.

"I see....What you ment now Ushinawa....When you said I'd one day unlock the eyes true power..." However, he deactivated his newly formed sharingan, he was going to save it for someone speical. As he inhaled slowly, and exhaled slowly. * - Thu Oct  1 23:46:46 2015

"You can believe what you want, but these eye's that I have now...Don't tell lies.." he closed his eyes and reopened them slowly, as this time, Hideki has three tomoe swirl around his iris. As he stared across the room.* - Fri Oct  2 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) he continued to stare blankly at the wall. "These eyes of mine Misa, they've seen a lot of things. They've seen sorrow, pain, hate. They've seen it all...Even death..." he stated rather blankly, now not caring who knew of his sharingan, considering it was only a matter of time before someone comes and tries to kill him for his eyes, or worse, come to destroy the rest of his lineage.* - Fri Oct  2 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) allowed her head to touch his shoulder. "I guess.... It's time for no more secrets, Misa. I've hid a lot of things from you, but it's time I finally open up to you. The reason people are after eyes such as mine, or any one else with a doujutsu, is mainly because of their visual prowess their capable of performing. They even used to have bounties against eyes such as mine. But they took it down, but now they have a bounty against those with one ring around their iris. And a lavander color to there eyes. It's a shame really... That their being hunted down, innocent people." he stated rather depressed, his only family now is Kush Misa, Niza, and Hiewa. And his only close friends he had now are Kuro, Misa, and Mamoru. 

Yes, Hideki is slowly losing his sanity, but his motive were definately clear none the less. He wanted revenge, and no one was to stop him from acheive this goal.* - Fri Oct  2 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) received a half hug from Misa. "It's not your fault, it's mainly my fault... Everyone around me dies....Everyone." he stated as he close his eyes, and slowly reopened them, his eyes reverting from his sharingan state.* - Fri Oct  2 06:40:38 2015

Tightening his grip on the katana in his hand, his veins buldging from his hand. He knew what he had to do, and that was to avenge those that have died around him, but was Kuro right about Hideki? Was he really going down the wrong path? Was going down this path even worth it?* - Fri Oct  2 06:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed her wrist, as she continued to squeeze on his leg, which was one of his femurs that were broken. He clenched his teeth holding back the pain she was giving him. "It's to late, for the old me, but the new me is a lot better, Misa." he stated rather blankly.* - Fri Oct  2 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) slowly turned his head to look at Misa's emerald eyes, his eyes however, showing sorrow, hate, pain. He was hurting from the inside out, he didn't know what else to do, his mind was racing on what he could do to avenge those that have died near him, to those that got injured near him. He didn't know what to do.* - Fri Oct  2 06:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) saw that Misa pulled away, stating she took advantage of him, he was slightly confused as he stared at her while she went for the exit. "I see....." however his heart rate starting to go back to a steady pace. He was being used it would seem, he continued to stare blankly at the wall ahead of him. Not seeming to care that Misa left the room.* - Fri Oct  2 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got a bird from Fujitora, after grabbing it and reading the information on it, he quickly wrote into the scroll, and after he was done doing that, he attached the scroll onto the birds leg, and had it fly off into the distance. Hoping no one would intercept the bird that he was sending to Fujitora on news of not only Tetsujin's abilities, but also news about his cousin's death.* - Fri Oct  2 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared blankly at the wall while on his wheel chair, he was unable to do anything, and a factor still remained, he kept thinking in his mind, was Misa a spy? Why was she trying to toy with Hideki's feelings. Hideki was slowly losing his sanity, if it came down to it, he would kill Misa on the spot, but all in due time for that matter. He was thinking on what to do for right now, what did Seisuke want with Ushinawa's body? Was he also going to take Ushinawa's eye and implant it in himself? No, he can't allow that, no one is to wield the Sharingan unless they were of Uchiha blood-line.

Hideki couldn't allow this, or could he? What if he was to partner up with Erebus? And esentially take over the shinobi world, would peace be established then? Would there even be a need for wars anymore if he did? Erebus always preached about gods, and how Ushinawa and Erebus were gods of the sort. And yet, if they both were gods, why would Ushinawa have died so early in his life time. And a factor still remained, could Erebus also be killed? After what he witnessed when he took damage from Hanabi's snakes, they barely even seemed to scratch the surface on Erebus' body.

He placed his hands on his head, gripping his hair, his eyes widening, he has no idea on what to do. Fujitora, Hiewa, Niza, and Kush Misa were his only family members left, he wondered what the fuck Ushinawa and Mariana did to have themselves killed, Mariana though, was injured due to the fight against Tetsujin. Could it have been those injuries that could have killed her? Hideki started to inhale deeply and exhaled slowly soon after, as he moved his hands from the top of his head, and covered his face with both of his hands.

Slowly, he dropped his hands to his lap, so many decisions needed to be made, what was he to do? Kuro also preached about non violence acts, and yet we live in a world full of violence, we live in a world full of hate, we live in a world of betrayal. His hate just now started to fuel, rage building over his body, as he actually -finally- made his decision on who is actual target was. And that target was to remain the same, he was going to Kill Katsune and Kilm. But in order to do this successfully, he would need to get them both out of the same area.

He would need to isolate them, and if Erebus holds his end of the deal, then this shouldn't even be a problem. But however, what would Hideki do with his new fond power? What could it do, what could it mean? Could losing people have awakened his eyes? If this was the fact, then he would need to isolate himself from everyone, he would need to stop sharing feelings, stop sharing friendly bonds. He would have to cut them all off in general, his body started to shake all of a sudden, could it have been the fact that Hideki was getting excited? Or was it based off of fear?

By this point, Hideki didn't even know himsef, but he stopped shaking, and continued to sit in his wheel chair, staring at the wall ahead of him, thinking about why Mariana and Ushinawa got themselves killed, thinking about why they would leave their only son in this cruel world. In fact their son could barely defend himself, it was a sad yet true fact. Seisuke however, tried comforting Hiewa which was always a plus. Hideki wasn't good at those kind of things, and conisdering he was losing his sanity, he wasn't fit for the role of role model. * - Fri Oct  2 09:55:12 2015
