When Tesumi charged at Hideki, it was probably one of the most foolish things Tetsumi has probably ever done in his lfie, however he utilized the technique Niza taught him, and used the technique misdirect, basically slapped Tetsumi's attack away, and using his reflexes he quickly unsheathed a kunai, and aimed it toward Tetsumi's jugular, he aimed to end this as quickly as possible.* - Thu Oct  8 22:49:10 2015

And just like that, Hideki placed Sabo into a genjutsu with his sharingans visual prowess. And once he was caught in the genjutsu, he looked at Genesis.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked back at Sabo, he disabled the genjutsu, however, when he did so, it caused Sabo to go unconcious. He looked back at Genesis as he stood up. "We're done with this conversation, Genesis." a rather blank expression continued to stay on his face as he started to walk out of the room, he tapped Ambrocio's shoulder. "Let's get going.....Oh.......When Sabo wakes up, Tell him I said sorry." as he continued to walk out.* - Fri Oct  9 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared at Sabo, as if his threat about removing his head from his shoulders had seemed to not effect him. He then looked at Genesis as she slammed her fist against the table. He continued to bore a blank expression on his face. "...You threaten me now, Sabo. But you're the one that's vulnerable right now.." He wielded several handsigns, as he molded chakra within his bodies system, holding the last handsign, as he lifted his arm up, his palm however faced Sabo.

A rather cold and emotionless look was on his face by this point, he's already lost everyone he's always loved and known, first it started with Hanabi, then Ushinawa, Mariana, Suitengu, and now Seisuke...His best fucking friend Seisuke was also lost, all over something stupid. Something he couldn't have prevented because he was weak, because he couldn't do a single thing to protect them at all.

Will he let that happen again?---Nay, he won't let that happen ever again, howeer he wanted to experiement on something, something that's been on his mind for a long time. But for now, 5 snakes came out of his sleeve, going toward Sabo. Out of the snakes mouths emerged kusanagi's like blades, all -aimed- for lethal areas. One snake aimed to fully stab Sabo in the brain, two aimed to stab into Sabo's left arm. The last remaining two stabbed into Sabo's right arm.

There was -no- emotion in Hideki's face by this point, he's made up his mind by this point, and he had his next target in his sights.* - Fri Oct  9 18:47:15 2015

The snake retracted there blades, and wrapped around Sabo's frame, retracting within his sleeves, as they brang Sabo's body forward toward Hideki. The held Sabo in place. Quickly Hideki took both of Sabo's lavender eyes. Hideki placed the eyes in his pockets. He didn't have shit to put them in, so he placed them there. However, he also looted Sabo's body for any money and such like that, and after he was done with that. He let Sabo's body fall flat on the wooden floor. He looked over toward Ambrocio.

Hideki made his escape. "Ortho, watch my back." he stated as they started to take there leave. * - Fri Oct  9 19:46:08 2015

He knew better. By now however, they made their escape through the doors. He took out two smoke bombs and threw them down on the ground, covering there escape.* - Fri Oct  9 20:04:03 2015

He finished the handsigns, as the area around Ortho however, didn't change much, that was until four eerie black ninja appeared around him. Hideki then spoke toward him. "This is a rather simple genjutsu, however, it can tire out your enemies if you were persay in the forest and hiding somewhere. It's a good way to distract your enemies, also there illusions, so whe they throw kunais at the opponet, it will phase through them, however if you throw a kunai while they throw a kunai at the same time. They won't know whats real or fake." he stated nodding his head.

He then crossed his arms as the eerie back ninja faded away from the natural area. "However, if anyone was to attack them or slice them, they multiple into more ninja. Which makes it even more of a challenge for the enemy. It's a great jutsu to use if you're going to try and get away."* - Fri Oct  9 21:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) turned around upon hearing his name. His katana rested on the side of his waist, his three tomoe sharingan, glanced at Kush, Misa's face. He stood there, a blank expression on his face. "What"* - Fri Oct  9 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

"Why.......I ask myself that question every single freaking day. I ask myself, why did Ushinawa have to die, why did Mariana have to die, Why did Hanabi have to die, Why did Suitengu die, and why the hell did Seisuke die? I've lost, so much Misa, I really have.....However, Genesis was pushing my buttons, and Sabo was there and I knew if he was there he'd just get in my way, believe me I didn't want to do it, I really didn't want to. But however, I wanted to kill Genesis, and I knew with Sabo there I couldn't have gotten the chance to. So I killed him." he stated as he continued to look at Misa.* - Fri Oct  9 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) gaze met Misa's gaze. "Here. Take these." he took out Sabo's eyes out of his pockets. He was going to toss them to her, but he'd wait to see her response before doing so, these eyes were probably loose change.* - Fri Oct  9 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) closed his hand, keeping the rinnegan in his hand. Before placing them back in his pocket once more. "What other information can you give me about these eyes." as he stepped back further from Misa. He was being completely serious by this point.* - Fri Oct  9 23:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went into a house, started to clean the jar, and with that he placed in some sort of liquid to keep the eyes all good and shit. He plopped the two rinnegan eyes in the jar, and closed it shut. And with that, he placed it back into his coat.* - Fri Oct  9 23:32:16 2015
