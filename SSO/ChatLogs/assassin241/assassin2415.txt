Tethys countered the fire technique with a suiton ability, as the techniques clashed seemingly there would be large amounts of steam  in the general area they were in.

His hands remained in his pockets though, as he was impaiently waiting for the letter he sent to Ushinawa to be sent back to Hideki.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out an extra helmet and placed it on his head.

Hideki took out two shuriken, and threw it toward Ushinawa's position. The shurikens seemingly had some great aim. But figuring that Ushinawa had some good speed and reflex abilities, he could probably dodge it easily if he tried to.* - Sat Sep 19 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) let go of the wires he was trying to hide from Ushinawa. Hideki unsheathed his tanto, and did a down-ward slash on the windmill shuriken. If successful, it would cause the windmill shuriken to dig into the grounds surface. As Hideki sheathed his tanto, and formed handsigns. Once Hideki finished forming these handsigns, the area around Ushinawa changed, suddenly eerie black ninja illusions started to appear.

Some coming out of the ground around Ushi, others slowly emerging out of the buildings. This was a simple genjutsu that was given to him by Shin. Of course, knowing Ushinawa's abilities, this jutsu could possibly be broken easily.* - Sat Sep 19 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) wielded a single handsign, as he built up chakra within his bodies system, and exerted said chakra, increasing his bodies metabolic rate. Hideki shunshined toward Ushinawa, as he unsheathed his tanto, the eerie black ninja seemingly disappeared from the natural vasinity. Hideki smirked and said "We can make this interesting." he stated. 

He backed up a bit from Ushinawa as he then said "Grab Mariana, we'll go somewhere isolated."* - Sat Sep 19 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed, he closed his eyes.

"I guess..." he reopened his eyes, his eyes widening as he activated his sharingan, that seemingly only had one tomoe. Hideki then said "I wanted to practice using these eyes. Which is why I wanted to go somewhere isolated." he stated. Although, black scales formed on his arms. Hideki then said "Go!" as he slashed in a down-ward motion.* - Sat Sep 19 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) reflexes were shit, so none the less he got slashed on his shoulder. To which blood seeped out and was visable on his black kimono that he had on. Hideki winced in pain for a second, but he sheathed his tanto, jumped back and formed handsigns. Upon completing the handsigns, a stream of fire is then conjured up, forming a ring of fire around Ushinawa's initial area. Hideki's sharingan for right now, was only useful for one thing, and that was to see chakra signitures.* - Sat Sep 19 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) <He's trying to kill me.> he thought to himself. Hideki formed several handsigns, and upon completing the handsigns he legitly -walked- into the fireball jutsu that was conjured up. As it made impact on his body, it of course caused a firey explostion from the impact.* - Sat Sep 19 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
A log appeared in Hideki's place. As he once again made himself known, but yet again Ushinawa's speed proved to be once again, far greater than Hideki's. He frowned as he started to form handsigns, lightning chakra flickered between his finger tips, he slammed his palms on the grounds surface, as the lightning crackled and went straight toward Ushinawa. Hideki then took out 5 shuriken, and threw them at Ushi.* - Sat Sep 19 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got rocketed in the back, sending him flying into the small chasm he created in the ground. Hideki deactivated his sharingan as he slowly started to get back up, sweat dripping from his face. Seemingly his black eyes were no longer slits. And the black scales that were on his arms, disappeared. Hideki scratched the back of his head, smiling at Ushinawa as he then says "Hehe! Looks like you win this time cuzzo!" 

Hideki's stamina wasn't all that great, so he wouldn't have lasted much longer in this sparring match. Hideki also remembered the wound he got on his shoulder, to which he paid no mind to considering it didn't hurt all that much anymore.* - Sat Sep 19 01:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) takes out a scroll from his back pouch, and hands it to Ushinawa. Hideki then said "I don't require any trades. We're basically family, so whenever you want to learn a technique from me, just ask." he stated looking at Ushinawa. But Hideki wielded a single handsign, as he started to build up chakra. Hideki spoke "Shunshin no jutsu isn't really a hard technique to learn, it's a technique where the user exerts chakra into their body, increasing their metabolic rate and allowing them to cover a distance in a short period of time." he stated, but Ushinawa probably already knew this.

Hideki exerted the chakra he had, and increased his metabolic rate, appearing a short distance away from his Uchiha-relative. Hideki then said "But, if you don't have the jutsu down. You'll get kind of dizzy. So it's essential that you get it down as quick as possible." he stated continuing to make eye contact.* - Sat Sep 19 01:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) unraveled that shadow shuriken scroll, and read the contents hella quick. Seeing that the technique can literally mess someones day up. Could prove useful in a sticky situation, which for Hideki could be at any moment, considering Hanabi always trying to feel his ass. Which was weird.* - Sat Sep 19 02:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Use that shit with explosive tags, dawg. - Sat Sep 19 02:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) read the chakra flow fire scroll, analyzing the scrolls contents, as it told information about sending katon chakra through-out a certain weapon, or wiring. Having it so the jutsu used can be used against the enemy. It could possibly even give decent burns if hit against an enemy. Which caused Hideki to grin, if he was to hit Hanabi with this technique, she'd definately be pissed. But then again, last time he used a jutsu on her and succeeded. She was really psychoatic, and was into some weird ass kinky shit.

Hideki shivered. He thought otherwise.* - Sat Sep 19 02:12:54 2015

It was a good thing the dice was returned to him, considering it was a memento he had of his father before he died.

All in swift motions, to which in Hideki's case looked swift enough. The Katon infused tanto died out, as the blade itself still looked completely fine. Hideki thought to himself <Katsune doesn't have a crush on Kilm, but there always seen together. Could be possible that she lied. Who knows.>

Hideki then sheathed his tanto.* - Sat Sep 19 10:15:02 2015
