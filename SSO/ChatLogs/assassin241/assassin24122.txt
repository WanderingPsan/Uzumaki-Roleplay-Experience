<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stood there, watching the two with his three tomoe sharingan.* - Wed Oct  7 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) liked the combintion that was going on here, but however he jumped back, avoiding the attacks that were sent to him, however he quickly formed some handsigns, molding chakra within his bodies system, once he finished molding the chakra, he finished the handsigns. Suddenly four eerie black ninja started to emerge out of the ground. Two were around Cypher, and Two were around Nina. They were slow of course, so doding them would be fairly easy, however they were also genjutsu, so if they were to be attacked they would just multiple into more eerie black ninja.

Hideki decided to take this easy, he wasn't planning on going to hard on the recently graduated genin, but the eerie black ninja took out kunais and threw them at Cypher, and Nina. However these kunai were -not- real.* - Wed Oct  7 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The duo moved fluently, however he noticed chakra building up in Nina, and in Cypher, thanks to his sharingan's ability to few a users chakra, but not just that, he also gained precognitive abilities, he quickly and effectively, continued to dodge the attacks sent at him. <...They do well as a duo, however one of them lack the chakra reserves for techniques..>. He stopped in his tracks. "We must stop this spar." he stated, looking at Nina, noticing that her chakra by now was at an all time low.* - Wed Oct  7 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head.

When he saw Cypher coming at him, he noticed the build up of chakra coming through the males hand and leg, quickly and effectively, he dodged. That's all Hideki was good for in all honesty, just dodging. He was a pro at it, however, after he dodged, a large white snake erupted from his back, traveling through his arm sleeve in an attempt to bind Cypher, as the large white snake circled around the young male's frame. "I said to stop, Cypher."* - Wed Oct  7 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The large white snake puffed into white smoke. As he placed his hand ontop of Cypher's head and ruffled his hair slightly. "It's okay, I made mistakes before. I won't hold it against you." he stated with rather a blank expression on his face. "Both of you continue to train, however Nina. Don't overdo yourself...I'd hate to see you die from chakra exhaustion.." and with that, he motioned for Heiwa. "Come along, Heiwa. We have to go see Lyala."* - Wed Oct  7 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out two scrolls, he threw one over to Cypher, and one over to Nina. "Read those, and master the techniques, once you have mastered them, I'll give you more." he stated, as he looked at Heiwa now. "She probably misses me, the least I can do is drop by and say hi." he stated.* - Wed Oct  7 23:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) had his sharingan scan this mans very being, not knowing why he was breathing so slowly. However, he was curious to why the unknown man was breathing so slowly. "Are you uh, having an asthma attack there buddy? You alright?" he asked rather curious, his breathing was intensifing greatly, which kind of worried him.* - Thu Oct  8 20:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) has never seen anything like this in his whole entire life. His eyes widened as the man tried to swing on him, quickly he jumped back. "A fight is what you want huh? Then let's go." Hideki hasn't had a good fight in awhile, and so he decided to let this fight continue onward. He wanted to see what this man was capable of doing in this state, however if things were to get to dangerous, he would definately step in and stop the man.* - Thu Oct  8 20:48:00 2015

This was definately interesting, he's never seen anyone's arm physically transform into something different, and the mans skin tone also changed aswell. Which caused Hideki to think that this man could possibly be stronger in the near future. However, quickly he dodged the attack coming toward him, this time being side by side toward Ambrocio. He sent a punch toward the man's jaw.* - Thu Oct  8 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: How does one start a fight so easily.. - Thu Oct  8 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eye's widened as the mans appearance once again changed, but this time his whole body changed, it was more of a black skin tone now. But quickly and effectively, Hideki entered his snake lycan state, this man however was definately fast, faster than most people he's seen. However when he entered his snake lycan state, he formed scales all across his body, which were a maroon color. He quickly made his way toward Takeda's position, a large white snake came out of his body, traveling through his arm sleeve, as it wrapped around Ambrocio's frame.

However, he also took a glance at the male's face, his sharingan was trying to make direct eye contact with the male. Ambrocio seemed to hold a lot of rage, and a lot of power for that matter, he could prove useful for later plans that Hideki had, infact he would probably recruit him later on after this whole predicament was all over of course.* - Thu Oct  8 21:12:44 2015

If eye contact was established between the two of them, his eyes would widen greatly as he attempted to place this man in his genjutsu that was acheived through his eyes ocular powers. And if it was to land, he'd say in a low tone, low enough for only Ambrocio to hear. "....Calm down...." if this attempt didn't work, he'd just have the genjutsu knock him out.* - Thu Oct  8 21:29:48 2015

The snake that wrapped around his frame poofed into white smoke, he quickly grabbed Ambrocio and slung him over his shoulder, he was going to make a run for it, ya boy ain't takin L's nigguh, fuck this man's dynamic entry, lookin like Lee faceass.* - Thu Oct  8 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed the man down on the ground slowly. His eyes looking at the male. "Who are you, and what was that transformation of yours?"* - Thu Oct  8 21:41:45 2015
