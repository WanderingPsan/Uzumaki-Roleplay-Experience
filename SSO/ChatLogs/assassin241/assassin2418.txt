"No, I hate it."* - Sun Sep 20 21:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

Hideki's skin started to form scales, that seemingly was maroon in color. Although, these scales allowed him to be light on his feet, even allow him to swim through waters quicker than most people. The white of his eyes turned brown, followed by a black slit.* - Sun Sep 20 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: God I hate this.. - Sun Sep 20 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) glared at this woman.

"Tch, I hate this.", he opened his mouth, revealing that his fangs were indeed in. To be honest, Hideki hated this, he hated being in this form. Espeically if there were other people around seeing him in this state.* - Sun Sep 20 21:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) bit his thumb, drawing blood as he wrote his name on the scroll. He wiped the blood on his cloths, as Hideki deactivates his lycanthropic state. He continued to glare at Hanabi, he spoke up "This is stupid. Why didn't you do that in the first place." he stated, a hint of aggression in his voice.* - Sun Sep 20 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tch. - Sun Sep 20 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Training? - Sun Sep 20 22:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 20 22:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) facial expression was blank when she performed the technique.

Hideki formed the handsigns for the technique, as he extended his arm outward, as snakes came out of his arm and coiled around Hanabi, Hideki then said "Already know it." he stated, as the snakes disappeared in a puff of smoke.* - Sun Sep 20 22:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: These snakes carry poison in them. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And they carry blades. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So I'm assuming, once I get the technique down, I can inflict the poison and blade damage to them.. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to lean against the building.

"What other techniques can you teach me."* - Sun Sep 20 22:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I should be asking you that. - Sun Sep 20 22:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) crossed his arms as he diverted his gaze from Ushinawa to the young boy.

"So, you actually speak."* - Sun Sep 20 22:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) crossed his arms and looked at the boy, then at Ushinawa as Hideki spoke toward him "Think we should head back to Kumogakure." he asked curious, considering Zetsumo was gone, including his army now would be a great time to head back to Kumogakure to see how things were over there. Although, Hideki diverted his eyes back at Suitengu, the boy seemed to always be a silent type, he'd always see the boy by himself reading his scrolls.

Although, Hideki knows how it is to be ignored, and forgotten. But in Suitengu's case, he might've been noticed a lot more than Hideki though.* - Sun Sep 20 23:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sat his butt down on the grassy surface, having his back lean against the tree. Hideki looked over toward Mariana, and then at Hanabi. He sighed slowly, and looked back out in the distance, he activated his Sharingan for a quick second, scanning the area for any unknown chakra signitures within there area. He didn't want them getting ganked or anything like that. After he was done scanning the area with his sharingan, he deactivated them by closing his eyes.

<...So this is the power of the Uchiha...I see...> Hideki took out one of the scrolls that was given to him by Shin. He wonders what happened to that kind man, If anything he actually noticed Hideki and didn't throw him off to the side like everyone else, that was until Ushinawa, Mariana and Aiyana actually came into his life. Which he was greatful for.* - Sun Sep 20 23:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Hm..If someone was to ask, we could probably lie and say we were prisoners captured by Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 20 23:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at his hands, they started to shake slightly. Hideki was a pacifist at heart, he never really engaged many fights, unless spars of course. He sighed slowly, trying to calm himself down.* - Mon Sep 21 00:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out a fish that he captured while they were swimming, and ate that shit whole. He blames Hanabi for his bodily chemistry changing.* - Mon Sep 21 00:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) thought to himself.

<....What else can the Sharinga do....?> Hideki contemplated this, and kept thinking about it for a long while. When would Ushinawa tell him the visual prowess their eyes held. Would Hideki ever be able to reach Ushinawa's level of visual prowess? I guess that will remain unknown for a long while. Hideki was only just scratching the surface on his Uchiha Blood-Line.* - Mon Sep 21 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Are there others like Ushinawa and I? - Mon Sep 21 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...If it is true that Zetsumo's group killed Orakuru, another member of our clan... - Mon Sep 21 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Why have we yet to attack them in the first place while they are occupied in the war.. Why... - Mon Sep 21 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Where is Mariana? - Mon Sep 21 01:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why? - Mon Sep 21 01:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Something about wanting to learn techniques from someone over there. - Mon Sep 21 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) leaned his head back, having it rest against the tree's bark. His eyes still remained closed.* - Mon Sep 21 01:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I got a fwe. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: few* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Where are we anyway? - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You two might want to stand back a bit. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And by stand back a bit I mean be careful of the snake. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) backed up.* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hold my hand. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Okay baby. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eyes widened as Hanabi summoned forth such a large summon.

Hideki didn't want to waste anymore time, Hideki decided to use his shunshin ability, and shunshined on the Manda's tail, and then using his suimen ability, he quickly ran up the snakes tail and made it to the top of Manda's head. He had his hands to his knees, as he was bent over gasping for breath. <Never doing that again..> He looked at Hanabi, and then looked at her summoning, this was definately impressive.* - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Once they arrived into the Ryuchi Cave, Hideki looked around the vast cave. <I see, so this is where you probably got converted, Hanabi.> He continued to observe the area, as he saw plenty other snakes. But Hideki himself didn't like knowing he was part snake now, which upsetted him greatly that he was forced into becoming one. But he laid eyes on the White Snake Sage. The White Snake Sage himself looked pretty tall.

Hideki looked at Ushinawa, then back at Hanabi.* - Mon Sep 21 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Fam we're gonna have to roll - Mon Sep 21 17:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: This place is strange. - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Will they turn on us? - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Nope~ - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: At least Hideki and I are fine. - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am not so sure about you though. - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You are able to summon snakes now. - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So I do not know - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm. - Mon Sep 21 17:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see... - Mon Sep 21 17:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You two need to start mastering your summoning technique. - Mon Sep 21 17:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: As you can see there are many snakes around these parts all waiting to be summoned. - Mon Sep 21 17:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Some are nice. - Mon Sep 21 17:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Some are mean. - Mon Sep 21 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I'll get on that right away then. - Mon Sep 21 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hn... - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
While in the Ryuchi cave, Hideki decided to get some work done with his summoning jutsu, considering that's the only thing they could do for the time being anyway to begin with. Hideki quickly started to form the handsigns for the technique, bringing his thumb up toward his mouth, and biting down on it. Blood trailed down his thumb as he finished the handsigns and slammed his palm on the ground. "Summoning Jutsu.."

As a plume of white smoke appeared in the vast area, only for it to subside shortly after, a small snake appeared before him. Hideki sighed as he wielded a handsign and dispelled the technique. And considering they were already in the cave itself, he would probably see that snake sooner than later if anything.* - Mon Sep 21 19:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) leaned against one of the cave's walls. He continued to examine the place, seeing how well structured it was. Seemed to be holding up pretty well, occasionally Hideki had a small snake slither past his body, to which he didn't care for. His body's chemistry changed drastically after what Hanabi did to him, hell he even started eating differently now. He sighed slowly, as he looked up, to see the cave itself was also dripping water.

Hideki looked down toward his palms, they weren't shaking anymore. Which was a good thing, he still had questions about his Sharingan, and not to mention to find out if there was anyone else still alive in the Uchiha-Bloodline, besides Hideki and Ushinawa. He also wondered who this Orakuru fellow was, and to think that Orakuru was killed by someone in Zetsumo's group. It most definately changed Hideki's views no less.

He had his sights set for new targets, and those targets were Kilm and Katsune.* - Mon Sep 21 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I wonder what Mariana is doing.. And Aiyana. - Mon Sep 21 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hey, Ushi. - Mon Sep 21 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 21 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who was Orakuru? - Mon Sep 21 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: --- - Mon Sep 21 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Where did you hear that name from? - Mon Sep 21 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You told me... - Mon Sep 21 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I suppose my memory fails me. - Mon Sep 21 20:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He was like us. - Mon Sep 21 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He awakened his Sharingan. - Mon Sep 21 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The first tomoe. - Mon Sep 21 20:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Did Kilm assist in this? - Mon Sep 21 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That much I do not know. - Mon Sep 21 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I see. There both targets, regardless. - Mon Sep 21 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I know you, Hideki. - Mon Sep 21 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 21 20:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Tch. - Mon Sep 21 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: They kill a member of our clan, and we just sit around and do nothing about it. - Mon Sep 21 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There is more than one way. - Mon Sep 21 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: To go about it. - Mon Sep 21 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Killing isn't always an option, but, Hideki. - Mon Sep 21 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There are worse things than death. - Mon Sep 21 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Ushinawa.

"I know killing isn't an option. I've been a Pacifist my whole life... That was until my father died. Since then even when I get into spars, or fights. My whole body trembles.." He bowed his head down, looking at his hands, and then closing it making it into a fist.

"But soon enough....They'll see..."* - Mon Sep 21 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

As he make eye contact with Ushinawa once more, speaking toward him "I've already decided what my next move is, though I don't know if you'd like to hear it." he stated.* - Mon Sep 21 20:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Like I said. - Mon Sep 21 21:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) chuckled.

As he continued to lean against the caves walls. Random snakes slithering past him here and there. "I doubt it, but if I was to take a guess, I'd say about twenty. Give or take." he stated looking at Hanabi.* - Mon Sep 21 22:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stroked his chin.

"Dunno, I still need to get even with you first." he stated, as he stared blankly at the other side of the cave.* - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You got to come here. - Mon Sep 21 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And you are a Lycan. - Mon Sep 21 22:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
"You're right." he pinched her right ass cheek as he then said "We're even. Here you go." Hideki tossed Hanabi the Shunshin scroll.* - Mon Sep 21 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got his ass grabbed, and he stood there squinting at this woman.

He murmured under his breath "I never win, yo."* - Mon Sep 21 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What else can you give me?~ - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015

He grabbed Hanabi's breast as he then said "Stop it."* - Mon Sep 21 22:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: --- - Mon Sep 21 22:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) had no choice.

He activated his lycanthropic form, as scales formed through-out his body, the scales color of course being a maroon color. Followed by his eyes forming slits. So when she grabbed his dick and squeezed, it was nerfed to a certain extent. It of course still caused Hideki to yelp "Aye! Take it easy!" He was no bitch though, he moved his other hand to her other breast. No L's homie.* - Mon Sep 21 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) winced in pain.

He moved his right hand to her nipple, grabbed and tugged on it. Hideki couldn't pull this off for much longer though. Shit was getting to weird.* - Mon Sep 21 22:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Hanabi had no chill. Hideki reverted from his lycan state, as he released his grip. He threw his hands up in the air and said "You win, I lose." he stated, as his ass was clenched and so was his dick. Which was still in an uncomfortable situation.* - Mon Sep 21 23:03:53 2015
