<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I presume this is what Amai asked to be done to her. - Wed Sep 23 23:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And the reason why their relationship spat seemed to spark into a mystery of attempted murders... - Wed Sep 23 23:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No, it's not your fault for it's her own. It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. - Wed Sep 23 23:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) deactivated his lycanthropic transformation. His scales slowly fading away back into his skin, as his black slits formed back to it's original shape.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But, the process is simple. - Wed Sep 23 23:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That sounds like a terrifying experience. - Wed Sep 23 23:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: After you see your father murdered in cold blood, right infront of you. Kind of stops you from being a pacifist.. And going down another path... - Wed Sep 23 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you gave into your anger? - Wed Sep 23 23:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went on an adventure to sit on in a meeting with the village leader. Or whatever the misson told him to do. And upon sitting down in the meeting, he coughed to clear his throat, as he looked around and quickly grabbed a notebook and a pencil. Getting ready to jot down some notes. He kept getting stared at, as he noticed that he had his gunbai still on followed by his tan cloak, along with his facemask covering his face.

<Well this is awkward..> he thought to himself, but none the less the village leaders started to conversate, Hideki quickly wrote down the notes here and there there was some talk about taking care of the village garbage, there being a large amount of garbage within the village itself. To where Hideki giggled, but coughed once again. He needed to show he was no bitch, as he sat up straight and continued to jot down notes once more.

Hideki every now and then drank some water that he had next to him, that of course was sitting on the table. Quickly he took a sip from it, and gently placed it back on the table. As he forgot to jot down notes, he facepalmed and said "Uh... Can you guys...please repeat that..?" the members scowled him, as they repeated themselves for Hideki's sake.

Hideki then, continued to jot down notes. He was starting to sweat for some odd reason. Was it because he was nervous? Or was it because it was hot as fuck in this damn meeting room. He went with the second option, considering he always remained calm and collected. Well, at times that is, sometimes he wasn't as calm or collected. But for the sake of this misson he had to be.

Upon jotting down the notes, his pencil broke as he squinted and threw the pencil behind him. It landed inside the basket without him even looking at it. Buckets. He quickly looked for another writing utensil. To which he found a pen, he grabbed it and once again jotted down these damn notes. Writing down all these notes proved to be a pain for his hands.

His hand started to cramp up a bit, as he placed the pen down and said "Alright, give me a second.... I cramped up." the members didn't give in, they continued to talk, causing Hideki to get a little heated. So he grabbed the pen and continued to write down the notes. And fam when he was writing down these notes, they were looking pretty bad.

In one of the notes, it states that there should be less crimes within the village, and that they should advertise the village so they can get more villagers. Considering the population in Kumogakure has hit an all time low, since five years ago the village was prospering with villagers. Now it's isolated, looking like a damn ghost town.

Hideki noded his head, agreeing with this statement. As he continued to jot down some of the notes, although, he got side tracked when writing down these notes. As he quickly observed some of the members around the table. He's really never seen these people before in his entire life.

After jotting down the notes, Hideki got up and bowed respectfully. "Thank you for having me here." the members just shooshed this man away, to where Hideki frowned. He took he bottled water and exited the place, making his way back to the mansion to where seemingly there was still five hundred shinobi surrounding Hanabi. He sighed slowly as he made his way back in the mansion.

After walking back toward the mansion, he squeezed through the large crowd, as he then says "Excuse me, pardon me. Thanks." after squeezing through, he walked straight into the mansion, he ain't care what was happening though, he just wanted to go to bed by now, he was tired as fuck. And needed to catch some Z's for real though.* - Thu Sep 24 01:45:10 2015
