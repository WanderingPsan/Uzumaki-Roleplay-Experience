Arata then got into his gentle fist stance, quickly he sprinted forward and attempted to close two chakra points on Kyubishu's right shoulder. However; it didn't stop there. He also attempted to send his palm toward Kyubishu's sternum. If this was to land, it would temporarily paralyze his opponet.* - Sat Oct 31 19:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly side stepped Kyubishu's attack toward his stomach region. Quickly he tapped the male's shoulder, and if it was to have made contact, chakra would've expelled from his finger tips. Sending the male's shoulder to jolt in a down-ward fashion. This could possibly give the male a dislocated shoulder or worse if not evaded.* - Sat Oct 31 20:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) didn't see this coming at all. Seemingly a bone came out of Kyubishu's shoulder and stabbed right into his fingers. He bit his lip, wincing in pain. However, Arata was not completely out of options just yet. He used the same technique he used last time--- He expelled chakra from his tenketsu's. This was mainly used as a defense for now. Arata's body jolted away from Kyubishu, he also pulled his two fingers out of the bone that stuck out of his opponet's shoulder.

Blood dripped from his fingers, shifting his gaze toward Jirun, then back at Kyubishu.* - Sat Oct 31 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) ||
Arata quickly spun in a circle. A large chakra sphere appeared around him, acting as his defense. And considering Kyu just jumped into the air to try and slash at Arata. Chances are that he would've collided with his rotation. And probably would've flung Kyubishu across the field.* - Sat Oct 31 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) was outchea. Arata already ended this spar by sending Kyubishu flying away from his current position. But he had to go get some bandages and wrap it around his two fingers that got impaled by the bone user. This was definately a pain in the ass. However, Arata was being to careless in this spar, and that was his fault entirely. * - Sat Oct 31 21:26:49 2015

And so he took out more bandages and wrapped it around the bandages he placed on his fingers earlier. Double layered that shit. Arata used his suimen ability, climbing up the moutain. Once reaching the top he deactivated his suimen ability, he sat down on the ground and meditated. 

He was recovering his chakra and stamina from the sparring session.* - Sat Oct 31 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) yawned.

He was wasting enough time, doesn't seem like she was going to apologize about the past events she did. And so with that, Arata examined Minimasa's frame. "At first you looked like a reasonable person. But then you showed disrepect to me, and my friend. And you refused to apologize." he stated this as he stared directly into Minimasa's eyes. There would no mercy.

Shortly after this, Arata placed the katana's cold steel on the back of Minimasa's throat. And with one down-ward stroke, he'd attempt to chop off her head. And if the first attempt didn't work, he'd continue to chop at her throat. Trying to chop off her head. This is the first person Arata has killed in cold blood.* - Sun Nov  1 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) was really shocked that his katana just snapped. 

He examined his blade, then tossed it to the side. Arata decided to end this anyway. He was still going to kill her regardless of what had just happened. Arata decided to finish this once and for all. He was kind of upset that his blade just broke. And so utilizing his gentle fist ability, he did a total of three strikes toward Minimasa's chest---- Where her heart was located. Slowly, her heart beat was decreasing. To the point to where she would die here very soon.

After that, Arata started to form several handsigns, molding doton chakra within his bodies system. And after finishing his handsigns, a Doton clone was made. The doton clone would stand beside Minimasa, to make sure she was dead. And if she -wasn't- dead. The doton clone would give a few more strikes toward her chest region to make sure she was indeed dead. And once she does die, the doton clone would've looted her body.

As the real Arata went outside the room.* - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) ||
The doton clone searched the body for anything valuable. And if nothing was there--- Or if there was something it would be given to Arata. The doton clone also picked up the broken katana and placed that shit in the toilet....Yes...The toilet. The doton clone soon after turned into a pile of mud. Arata himself walked out of the room, seemingly no blood or anything was on his person.

Although, if a person has the sight perk they could see bandages wrapped around two of his fingers that were on his right hand. His katana, was also missing. But, he also knew there were other people in the room by this point. And so he was cautious, and knew what he had to do.

But for now he remained calm.* - Sun Nov  1 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) ||
The byakugan gave him the ability to see through objects and all that good jazz. So he saw most of Vessul's items. Arata smirked and looked at the young boy who was in the room with them. Vessul he could handle just fine. Quickly Arata utlized his speed and met with the young boy, who would probably try and escape the scene and more than likely, snitch on him. 

So he quickly disposed of the kid, not by killing him of course, none of that. He paralyzed the boy instead. He sent a palm strike toward the boys sternum. Temporarily paralyzing the boy. He did keep in mind that Vessul was behind him, granted that byakuga gave him three hundred and sixty degree vision.* - Sun Nov  1 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) ||
Byakugan comes in clutch.

He noted that Vessul was trying to swing on him, and he also took note that the boy was some sort of lycanthrope. Which was cool, but he had no intentions on trying to kill the boy, unless the boy was somehow trying to kill Arata in return. Then things would definately change.

However; Arata quickly utilized his reflexive ability, he grabbed the boy's wrist, and swung him around toward Vessul's attack--- Which was with a hachet. He basically used the young boy as a human shield in a way. And after he did that, he started to form more handsigns, molding doton chakra within his bodies system. And once he finished his handsigns, a single doton clone was formed by the door. It was blocking the enterance.* - Sun Nov  1 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) ||
The throw was seemingly unsuccessful. However; Hanai's grip was definately good. It broke his right hand wrist. To where Arata sceamed in pain. <...Holy fuck!!! This kid's grip is strong!>. He quickly had to evade the strike the kid was sending toward him, by of course swaying his body out of the attacks range. But, Arata himself sent four strikes toward the young kid's chest. 

He was going to do the same thing he did to Minimasa, he was going to stop the young child's heartbeat. He was done playing games. If this was to keep up, he would indeed die. And that was something he did not want happening, and if worse comes to worse. He could play his trump card.* - Sun Nov  1 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) was thrown about like a rag doll. 

He tried releasing chakra from his tenketsu to cushion the blows, but it was to no avail. He was taking the L this time. He was thrashed all about, sent against the walls----which probably were broken through, aswell as being slammed against the wooden surface. Craters and debris was being flung everywhere man. 

Bones were being broken, which could also be heard. The bones themselves were striking inside his bone, attacking Arata's vital organs. There was no way in hell he was going to survive this altercation. And to be honest, even if he was to use his trump card. There was still no way in hell he was going to survive. All in all, let it be known that if anyone was to fuck with Hanai. They will take L's, this man was not to be fucked with.* - Sun Nov  1 02:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from sitting on the bench, and walked over toward the one called 'Kilm'. After he got a somewhat close distance between the two, Yuudai spoke. "By chance could you teach me a raiton technique?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) entered his house.

He walked slowly toward the table. He sat down on the purple pillow, he took out the scroll that was given to him by Kilm, and then rolled the scroll across the table. Slowly and carefully Yuudai read the scrolls contents carefully and throughly. The technique was called Earth Flash. It was noted in the scroll that you'd need some good chakra to even use the technique. Something that Yuudai did not have at all. Shame, he kind of wished he was born with something speical.

But she shook his head, he had to focus. Continueing to read the scroll, he stopped his eyes widening shortly after. It was a C rank jutsu. Yuudai definately scored a good jutsu is what it looked like. However; Yuudai himself was getting kind of thirsty. He got up from sitting down on the pillow, walked over toward the refrigerator. Opening the fridge door and grabbed a small orange juice. Opening the orange juice slowly, and drinking from it. He finished with a few gulps, placed the cap back on it, and closed the fridge door. Yuudai shortly after threw away the orange juice in the trash can.

Yuudai walked back toward the table, and sat back down on the soft pillow. Yuuadi then continued to read from the scroll's contents. The technique seems to be able to shred through solid rock. Even shock opponets. This technique seemed very valuable to learn, and he intended on learning it of course. He rubbed his eyes, Yuudai was getting kind of sleepy. But, he slapped himself in the face. He needed to stay away and learn this technique. But it seemed like he was nearing the end.

He rolled up the scroll and placed it in his pocket. He was probably going to keep it, unless Kilm wanted it back. To which he hoped he didn't, he could make some money from selling these kind of scrolls to people. Unless people already had this technique that he has in his arsenal. Then that would kind of suck.* - Sun Nov  1 18:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) unraveled a blank scroll across the houses flooring. He started to form several handsigns, raiton chakra was flickering around his palms. He was also molding raiton chakra within his bodies system, and after awhile of molding the chakra to his needs. He finished his hand signs. Slamming his palm against the scrolls surface---- His attempt was to seal the raiton technique within the scroll. And if it was successful, it would stay sealed. But if it wasn't, the raiton technique would've been sent south-ward.

Seemingly, it wasn't successfully sealed within the scroll. It trailed south-ward, ripping up the flooring. He sighed, this was going to be a lot harder than he originally thought. He decided to meditate, he needed to regain the chakra he wasted from trying to seal the technique within the scroll. He was dripping with sweat. This was a lot harder than he thought.

But he regained enough chakra, he tried to seal the jutsu within the scroll once more. Forming the hand signs for the technique, gathering up chakra so he could perform it. Molding raiton chakra once more in his bodies system, after completeing the hand signs, he slammed his palm once more against the scrolls surface. Again, it was unsuccessful as the raiton technique once again trailed south-ward, continuing to rip up the flooring.

Yuudai sighed, this was really fucking hard to do. Sealing shit in scrolls was definately hard. He didn't understand how some people did it. Really, he doesn't. But he decided to recover once again. He sat on the couch, resting until he fet that he regained his chakra that he just wasted. The technique definately drained his body by a shit ton. He definately needed to work on his chakra consumption.

Yuudai slowly yawned, he got up from resting on the couch. He walked back toward the scroll, he tried this again. He started to form hand signs, raiton chakra flickered around his palms. He was molding raiton chakra within his bodies system. And after he finished molding the chakra, he finished his hand signs. Slamming his palm against the empty scroll.

Seemingly, it looked like he successfully sealed the raiton related chakra within the scroll. Satisfied by this, he placed it in his back pocket. Got up, and rested on the couch once again. Damn this really drained him.* - Sun Nov  1 21:18:43 2015

He could feel Zenaki's evil aura coming off of her, so he decided to back off. It seemed like no one wanted to speak toward him, or acknowledge him for that matter. The only person he's managed to talk to was Tetsumi. And that was even a stretch. He sighed, he walked back toward his home.* - Sun Nov  1 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) walked inside his home, and sat down on the couch once more. He stared blankly at the wooden flooring that was inside his house. "...Loneliness....It consumes me.." he stated to himself. No one was going to acknowledge him, no one. The only person that he's managed to atleast, -have- acknowledge him was Tetsumi, and possibly Kilm. He wondered what the two of them were doing. He sighed shortly after.* - Sun Nov  1 22:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) chilled on the couch, taking off the giant shuriken he had on his back. Carefully placing it underneith his couch. Yuudai examined the very household he was living in. He noted that it was pretty bland. "..I should probably start practicing my sealing..." he stated to himself. Realizing he did infact slack off. Yawning shortly after he stated this. * - Wed Nov  4 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) continued to slouch on the couch. Sighing slowly, taking out a single blank scroll. Rolling it across the wooden surface, and slowly starting to form hand signs. He of course, was in no rush. Considering the first scroll he successfully sealed raiton chakra into, was in his back pocket. However; even doing that was kind of difficult to begin with. After finsihing forming the hand signs, he molded raiton chakra within his bodies system. Letting it settle in his stomach for a short while.

Then, he slammed his palm against the blank scrolls surface. And then, nothing happened. Not even a plume of smoke appeared. A raiton trail was sent in a down-ward pattern, tearing through the wooden flooring, as it hit the wall infront of him. Cracking it slightly. Yuudai was begining to sweat, panting slightly as he stood up to go get himself something to drink. This definately drained him, he slowly opened the fridge, trying to find some food to eat.

Sadly, there really wasn't much food left in the fridge. But instead, he grabbed himself a water bottle. Slowly opening the cap and taking a few sips out of it. And once he was done, he placed the cap back onto the water bottle. "That was some good water." he stated to himself, he then walked back toward his couch, which had the blank scroll still lying on the grounds surface. He inhaled and exhaled slowly, looking at the blank scroll.

"...This is going to be difficult.." he stated to himself. Yuudai decided to stop complaining, slowly he formed the hand signs, raiton chakra flickered between his finger tips, and around his palms. He was also molding the raiton chakra within his bodies system, once again allowing it to settle for a short while, before he was to release it. Then he finished the handsigns, slamming his palms against the blank scroll. 

Then, in a plume of smoke, the technique was then sealed within the scroll's confinements. Yuudai continued to pant. This was indeed a difficult task, and had no idea how any other Fuuinjutsu specialist was able to do this, without over doing themselves. He had to hand it to them, they were indeed skillfull if they were able to seal jutsu within scrolls. But, after he finished doing that, he rolled up the scroll and placed it into his pocket. He now had two jutsu scrolls in his pocket. Ready to use if the situation called for it.

Then, he sat back down on the couch. Just being lazy for the rest of the day, it was rather boring doing the same thing, every single day. But what other choice did he have? He barely even made any friends. And his academy friends didn't even like him. His only friend now, well---- He thinks his only friend now is Tetsumi. 

Considering he hasn't heard from Kilm in a long while.* - Wed Nov  4 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuudai(Assassin241) got up from the couch. Slowly exiting his house, and walked toward the vending machine that was near the academy. Placing in a couple of dollars, he grabbed several chips from the machine. And walked back toward his house. On his way back however, he did see Tetsumi. But didn't bother to say anything to him. He looked like he needed some time alone. Yuudai wasn't going to bother him. 

Then, he entered into his house. Opening all the bags of chips and eating them altogether. He was one hungry boy, and needed his calories. His mouth was dry however; from eating all of those chips. And so he got up, threw away the chip bags into the trash can. Opened the Fridge, and grabbing the water bottle. Slowly opening it, and drinking from it. But, he finished his water bottle. Placing the cap back on the bottle, Yuudai threw it away in the trash can.

Yuudai walked toward his couch, to once again, take a seat on it. Leaning his head back, he stared at the ceiling. "............Holy shit that's a nice ceiling.." he stated to himself. It was painted a light blue color--- Come to think of it, majority of this house is painted light blue. Huh, not so colorful.* - Wed Nov  4 00:30:43 2015
