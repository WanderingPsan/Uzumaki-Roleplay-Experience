He placed his gunbai back on his back, as he looked at Niza and bowed respectfully. "I apologize for my actions, Niza-sama." he also took notice of what Hanabi was doing, as he sighed and looked toward Misa and try to get her out of the situation she was in. "Want to go get something to eat, Misa?"* - Fri Sep 25 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) noded his head, as the waiter came by, Hideki spoke. "Can I get the uh, Veggie ramen please and thanks." he gave the waiter the cash needed for the food, including the tip in it. After a couple minutes pass by, the veggie ramen is brought to Misa as he then says "I hope you enjoy." he stated with a warm smile toward her.* - Fri Sep 25 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head. "My body chemically changed, I can only eat certain things for now. I mean, I can -eat- ramen and stuff like that. But it wouldn't feel right. Ya know?" he sighed, he was starting to calm down from the situation that happened earlier. He was embaressed slightly from showing his snake lycan form, he really really hated it. * - Fri Sep 25 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) waved his hand slowly in the air infront of him. "No no, you can still eat ramen and stuff like that. But your food carvings start to change.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shrugged.

"She's usually like that, sometimes she'll be serious, and sometimes she'll just be a pervert. She kissed me twice before, and grabbed my dick. She has random tendencies to do stupid shit like that." he stated being completely serious.* - Fri Sep 25 21:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) brang his thumb near his mouth, as he bit down on it. Blood dripped from his thumb. He quicky formed several handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns he slammed his palm on the wooden flooring. As a plume of smoke appeared around his general area, as the smoke subsided a small brownish-black snake was coiled around his arm.

"....What do you want Hideki." the snake hissed at him.

"Chill out Aedre..I just want to see if you wanted to hang out for a bit." Aedre slithered up to his shoulder, and laid there just chillin.* - Sat Sep 26 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Misa, and examined her up and down. He then sprinted toward her, attempting to close the distance between the two. He also started to form several handsigns, and upon completeing the handsigns, he held the last handseal. He waited for the right moment in order to release the technique, if he released it to early it would be pointless.* - Sat Sep 26 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) noticed she closed her eyes, he quickly closed his own eyes and reopened them, as he activated his Sharingan only for a breif moment, he wanted to see how well her chakra levels were. And once he saw how well they were, he deactivated them. He closed the distance between the two, and unwielded the handsign. As he crouched down and poked her forehead. "Hey, how are you going to fight in a real fight closing your eyes and not noticing the enemy?" he smiled at her.* - Sat Sep 26 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) chuckled and placed his hand on her shoulder if allowed to.

"Listen, you don't have to be a fighter. If you're going to become a medic their usually not in the battlefield, unless the enemy tries to do a surprise attack. I have complete confidence in your capabilities, though." he stated as he gave her a warm smile.* - Sat Sep 26 01:00:09 2015

Kirigakure no Sato was now on his hitlist, considering Himura sent him here to 'talk' but instead it feels as if he was about to get ganked. His skin suddenly started to change, scales formed all around his body, followed by a maroon color. His eyes forming black slits. He removed the gunbai from his back, as he had it gripped in his hand now. A chain was obviously seen attached the the gunbai. He quickly scanned the area infront of him, as he jumped back a few.

"This is definately fishy... I see what you're trying to do here, Himura." he stated, obviously annoyed.* - Sat Sep 26 17:41:07 2015

Knowing their history, it would most likely be a trap, he continued to jump back forming several handsigns, as he started to mold katon chakra in his bodies system, aswell as mixing the oxygen, as his chest expanded. He opened his mouth as a large fireball was sent forth. He had no idea where the enemy was, so he was basically firing shots in the dark. But the fireball jutsu was aimed toward the grounds surface. And once it impacted the ground it would've caused an explotion.

Debris was flung up in the air, followed by a black smoke screen, and some trails of fire left over.* - Sat Sep 26 17:56:28 2015
