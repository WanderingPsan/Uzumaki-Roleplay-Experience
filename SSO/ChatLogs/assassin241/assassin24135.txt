<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) walked around the village in search of an elderly woman to take around the village. This was becoming a drag, there wasn't much action in Kirigakure; however Sunagakure there was always violence. Arata wanted to get away from that, not saying he doesn't like violence, but there was just to much there. Atleast in Kirigakure it was more calm, he will miss Koji, he seemed like he knew much about his eyes. But he was trying to force him into his clan, and he didn't like being forced.

Finally after walking a long while he found the elderly lady. He waved toward her. "Excuse me, miss. I'm here to show you around the village." he stated this with a smile on his face, he wanted the old lady to feel welcomed into the new established village of Kirigakure no Sato. Even though Arata's home village was Sunagakure no sato. The old lady smiled back at Arata and spoke toward him. "Well, let's get going then sunny boy!" Arata stood there for a second and sighed.

This was probably one of those 'hip' elderly ladies. He was going to hate doing this tour. However a mission was a mission, he walked around with the old lady and pointed to the Kirigakure Mansion. "It may look like crap now, but soon it will look beautiful and magnificent again! And our military is stronger than ever!" he stated this with a smile, not having any idea how well their military even was. But he had to convince the old lady to stay within the village.

Next stop they went toward the ninja academy, which was half way rebuilt, kind of. He pointed toward the building. "And this is the ninja academy. So far it's looking pretty good, but sooner or later it will look fantastic!" They went off to go toward the ramen shop in there village, which seemed to be very well structured. He liked ramen shops, they were a great place to make new friends and enjoy all sorts of food.

Arata pointed toward the ramen shop. "And this, is the Ramen shop in Kirigakure no Sato. It's a pretty nice place, I haven't eaten here yet...But uh...A lot of people go here for food. I recommend it!" he was blowing smoke, but however that was the end of his tour. He bowed respectfully toward the elderly lady and said "Well, you have a nice day now." he started to leave and waved back at the elderly lady. He was done with the second mission. He had one last one to do.

Damn, this was becoming a drag.* - Fri Oct 23 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) walked around the village once more, sighing slowly. This was becoming such a dragful day. He hated doing so many missions all at once. However; his intended goal for now was to become a Gezo Private, and strive for the Mizukage position. But that won't be for a long time. He continued to search for this new villager that came into the village, he wanted to get this mission done and over with.

He continued to examine the following area, still trying to find this fool. That was until he rested his gaze onto the sign that read 'New to Village' and so he went there and smacked the sign out the man's hands. "YO LET'S GO TAKE THIS TOUR HOMIE!" he grabbed the man's arm and placed him over his shoulder and full on sprinted into the village while the man was holding on for dear life on Arata's back.

He stopped suddenly and pointed to the ramen shop, yelling "THIS IS THE RAMENSHOP, IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO EAT! LET'S GO!" the visitor was going to ask a question, but ya boy didn't have time for questions, he was handed to many missions today and wanted to be done with today. Quickly they transversed into a different location. 

Arata pointed to the next building which was the Kirigakure Mansion, which seemingly was still being rebuilt. "THIS IS THE KIRIGAKURE MANSION, IT AIN'T SHIT YET, BUT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS NEXT AREA LES GO!" he once again went on a full sprint toward the next location, he wasn't going to let the man ask questions just yet. Arata wanted to be completely finished with this shit fam.

Next area they went to was the ninja academy in Kirigakure no Sato. Arata pointed to it while the man was still on his back, but ya boy was still breaking a sweat though. Mainly because he was carrying this foreigner while he was running just so he could get this mission done faster. He will probably never do this kind of strategy ever again. Shit was to tiresome, even if he had good stamina.

However Arata pointed to it. "This...Is the ninja academy....This is where shinobi are made..Next area." Arata sounded more calm when he said this, as they once again transversed into a different location, this was possibly the last location they were going to go to. However; Arata placed the man down and said "Alright, you were getting heavy, so just follow me." he said  this as he continued to walk up north.

Arata arrived to the waterfall location. "This is typically where most shinobi chill out at, or at the village's square. It's a pretty nifty place, and you can meditate here by the waterfall. Nature truely is wonderful." he finished his sentence and smiled at the foreigner that he showed around the village. He waved good bye to him and said "Welp, I hope you enjoy your stay in Kirikgaure no Sato." 

He said this and made his way to the village's square. Fucking Kirie always trying to overdo it with these missions man.* - Fri Oct 23 17:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) observed carefully. 

Daisuke moved fluently when he used the technique, it looked pretty cool to say the least. He looked over toward Daisuke. "You don't have to teach me the technique if you don't want to. Espeically if it's sacred or something like that." he stated this while watching Daisuke perform a horizontal slash. "...Yo...Did you finish those missions? You don't want a punishment do you?"* - Fri Oct 23 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Sacred? - Fri Oct 23 19:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Don't want to find out either. - Fri Oct 23 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) unsheathed his katana, he tried to perform the same action that Daisuke performed, however; it wasn't as successful. When Daisuke used the technique it seemed as if he swung 320 degree's around. Arata however, when he swung, it was moreso 120 degree's around. He stopped the swinging motion and looked at his blade then back at Daisuke. "..I'll get it down..Second.." Confidence was key.

Arata once again tried to do the same fluent motion, however to no avail, when he swung his sword, it slipped out of his hand and landed point first into the ground's surface. Arata stared blankly at his hands, then back at his Katana that slipped out of his hands. <...The amount of disgrace that I just showed...What the fuck man...> 

He grabbed the katana by the hilt and took it out of the ground. He sighed as he once again tried to perform the action; the same action that Daisuke performed. Arata once again swung horizontally, this time the first swing was atleast 300degree's, progress none the less. But then when he was to do the second swing, it flew out of his hand's once more. The katana stabbed itself into the tree toward their right flank's bark.

Arata stared once again at the disgrace he just showed. He walked over and took the Katana out of the tree's bark. He sighed, as he tried doing the technique one last time. He swung horrizontally once more; the first swing was 310 degrees, and the second swing, was about 300degree's. It was progress none the less. Arata sheathed his katana shortly after and looked over toward Daisuke.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) sighed as he opened up his mission scroll. He carefully read the mission scrolls contents, looking over what he  had to do, and it was pretty simple. It was to just fill a hole. And so, Arata walked over toward the constrution site. He observed the area, and found a shovel; once he grabbed it he quickly started to dig up some dirt and throw it into the hole that was made.

Sweat was starting to drip from his face. This was definately hard labor and he hated it, but a mission was a mission and he needed to get it done and over with. He stopped digging and took out a water bottle, slowly he opened it and drank from the water bottle. Once he was done, he put the cap back on the water bottle and placed it back in his pocket. Arata grabbed the shovel again and started to fill the hole.

He wondered why the construction workers built in the wrong damn spot, don't they have detailed maps on where their suppose to build at? The nerve of these guys. But enough pouting, he had to get to work--- Of course continuing to fill the hole that was made by the construction team, he blamed them for this. If they weren't such screw ups he wouldn't have to do this, he would definately talk to the boss.

Arata shook his head, he was a shinobi, there was no use for complaining. By this point Arata was done filling the hole and stabbed the shovel into the dirt. Arata turned on his heels and left the scene to return to the Mizukage to return this mission scroll, and to notify her of what he found on the road trip from Konohagakure back to Kirigakure. Maybe she'd like what he found?* - Sun Oct 25 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) appeared to the scene, he converted chakra to the soles of his feet as he started to walk toward the Mizukage. He tossed a -single- mission scroll toward Kirie. "I finished filling the hole. I'll be working on the other two next. But I came here to notify you on what I found from my trip in Konohagakure." he stated* - Sun Oct 25 18:44:41 2015
