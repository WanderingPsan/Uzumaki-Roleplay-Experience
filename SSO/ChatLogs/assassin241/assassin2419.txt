<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) threw a shuriken with his right hand, after the shuriken gained some distance and missed one of the huge rocks that sat in the middle of the cave, He pulled his arm back, he hoped Hanabi took notice of the elastic wiring on the shuriken, as it trailed back around wrapping around the rock several times before stopping and stabbing itself into the grounds surface.

Hideki then said "It was the same technique I used to immobolise you."* - Mon Sep 21 23:13:16 2015

"Can I help you?" Hideki scratched his head and said "Uh, nah not really." he wielded a handsign as the snake disappeared in a plume of smoke.* - Tue Sep 22 17:40:54 2015

"You said you didn't need my help." 

He scratched his head as the snake was now coiled around his ankle, He then said "Uh, I mean you can hang out for a bit if you want. Your call I guess." he snake went up Hideki's body, and rested ontop of his shoulder. As the snake replied "Well thanksss."* - Tue Sep 22 17:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) leaned against one of the fences, he slowly decended down, having his butt hit the grassy surface. He also laid his gunbai on the ground, his back leaning against the fence as he looked at the snake and said "So uh, what's your name?" The snake laid on Hideki's shoulder lazily as the snake replied "Aedre."

Hideki raised an eyebrow, as he then said "Your name means Stream. Just letting you know." the small snake whipped it tail toward Hideki's nose as the snake said "I know baka." Hideki wielded a single handsign and dispelled the snake.* - Tue Sep 22 17:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) brang his thumb to his mouth, and bit down. Causing blood to run down his thumb finger, as he performed several handsigns, he slammed his palm on the concrete floor. As a plume of smoke appeared in his area, after the smoke subsided a snake was coiled around his forearm. He spoke to the snake "Aedre, Think you could do me a favor buddy?", the snake of course scowlded Hideki, but in return nodded it's head, as it slid into his clothing.

Hideki then went to the mansion.* - Tue Sep 22 22:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) turned his heels, hands still remained covered by the tan cloak he had on. As he walked back, standing next to Ushinawa, the snake came out of his cloths and appeared on his shoulder, it apeared to be resting there for now.* - Tue Sep 22 22:25:55 2015

"I guess you're right." he quickly got out of the jutsu's range, by forming a single handsign. He exerted chakra from his body, increasing his body's metabolic rate as he appeared a couple feet away from him. He looked at Ushinawa, more specifically he took note that he deactivated his sharingan. <I see, so you won't use your sharingan this time.>* - Wed Sep 23 00:10:52 2015

This was definately problematic, the kick reached him and send him skidding across the grounds surface, hitting the rock formation behind him, but thanks to the gunbai on his back, it nulled a bit of the impact he took. He quickly formed handsigns, sending his right arm outward, as three snakes came out of his sleeve in hot pursuit toward Ushinawa's position. The goal of casting this jutsu you ask? It was to imobolise Ushinawa's movements, his speed was definately something he could not keep up with.* - Wed Sep 23 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The snakes of course collided with one another, but seemingly Ushi's snakes got rid of his, to which he had to think of something else, it was true the jutsu he had within his arsenal are basically the same as Ushinawa's. It was basically a mirror match, except Ushi excelled in combat far more better than Hideki. But he had to get out of the snakes range, he quickly manevour'd himself around the snakes.

He gripped the gunbai that was on his back, and attempted to swing on Ushi's left side, this was an attempt to send him sliding across the gravel.* - Wed Sep 23 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Ya boy had shitty reflexes, the gunbai was blocked in a successful parry, but alas he got striked in the abdomen, he wield a single handsign, as he used this to shunshin once again away from Ushinawa, but while he shunshined away, from within his cloak, fell forth several explosive tags. And while being away, he kept the handsign. Of course there was always the delay to the technique, which caused problematic things to occur.* - Wed Sep 23 00:33:55 2015

As the explostion rang out, it caused for a large enough black smoke screen to take it's place among the field of battle. He looked down his cloak, as he saw the cut that was seeping blood through his shirt. It wasn't bad, but it was a pretty decent cut on him. He quickly shunshined within the black smoke screen, as he took out two smoke bombs and threw them on the ground below him, causing more smoke to come forth onto the playing field. 

He took out a single windmill shuriken.* - Wed Sep 23 00:49:16 2015

The smoke subsided, as blood trickled from his bloody shirt, as it fell on the grounds surface. He raised an eyebrow. <...Where the hell did you go...>. He put away the windmill shuriken, as he walked forward, there was obviously no trace of where Ushinawa went. Which caused Hideki to be slightly confused.* - Wed Sep 23 00:54:24 2015

"......" he could challenge her again, but then again last time he did, he didn't win. So he leaned against the cliffs next to Mariana.  "Thanks for healing me."* - Wed Sep 23 01:14:52 2015

"Hey, Aedre. Can you go find someone for me?"

The snake scowled Hideki after what he did to him last time, but he sassed him and replied back "I don't know, are you just going to unsummon me like you did lassst time you prick?" Hideki squinted his eyes. "Oi! Just do it!" the snake hissed and said "What person am I finding?" Hideki whispered in the snakes ear, as the snake jumped off of his forearm.
