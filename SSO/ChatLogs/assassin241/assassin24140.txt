<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) turned on his heels and left.* - Thu Nov 12 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) grabbed the scrolls, placing them within his jacket. "Alright.."* - Thu Nov 12 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm here. What can I do? - Thu Nov 12 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: . . . . - Thu Nov 12 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I only know one technique. - Thu Nov 12 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Guess that means you need to learn a new technique huh? - Thu Nov 12 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: I guess, I got a scroll in here I can learn from. - Thu Nov 12 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) walked out of the area to finish his daily missions.* - Thu Nov 12 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) looked at the mission contents he was given. Carefully, he read them. "...I have to pick up a damn letter...Are you serious.." Hachirou sighed, this was becoming a pain in the ass. He doesn't like missions, he'd rather be training, or killing people. Both were fun to do. Placing his hands in his pockets, he started to walk to the post office, to pick up the letter. He casually, while walking there, looked around the area, taking note of the surroundings.

He was just about to his destination, and upon reaching there, he went inside the building, looking at the first employee there. "..Letter..Give.." he extended his arm out, opening his palm. This indicated that he wanted the Letter now. To where, the employee quickly went in the back, finding the letter, and giving it to Hachirou. "..Thanks.." he turned on his heels, and made his way back toward the square, to give the letter to the Mizukage.* - Thu Nov 12 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) took out the next mission scroll, reading the scrolls contents. "..UGGHHH!" he rolled up the scroll, and shoved it into his pocket. Again, he placed his hands in his pockets, making his way toward the academy. He looked around the area, his gaze shifting from tree to tree, watching intently, he didn't want to get blindsided. 

Afterall, he did kill the Ex-Mizukage, what if the Ex-Mizukage had hired assassin's before hand? After all, Hachirou did leave the village a lot. What if the Ex-Mizukage was suspious on Hachirou's actions?

Hachirou shood his head. "...Probably nothing.." he said to himself, looking back up, he was near the academy by now. Hachirou grumbled to himself. "..I hate my life.." he slowly opened the academy doors, traveling through the hall. "..Probably have to go though Room 1B.." he sighed, this shit, was going to be a pain in the ass.

Upon entering the room, Hachirou squinted at the childern, who of course, were causing a ruckus. Hachirou, took the Zanbatou off of his back, slamming the blade into the wooden flooring, causing the wood to split. His gaze, remained on the childern. To which, they stopped their ruckus.

"..Now...I'm going to teach you guys..How to defend yourself." He pointed toward two childern. One male, One female. "...Fight, fools." he grabbed the hilt of his blade, indicating, that he was very impaient, and wanted to get this damn lesson done and out of the way. After he told them to initiate, they of course, started their sparring session.

The male, of course showed to be superior, the male obviously took down the female, in a rather quick manner. To where Hachirou stopped the sparring session. "....Dick, you just hit a girl." he stated, looking at the boy, to where the boy frowned, and went to the back of the room. Hachirou helped the young girl up, "More practice." he stated, as he patted the girls head.

He shifted his gaze to the other childern in the room. ". . . .I want to see you guys perform the transformation jutsu, transform into me." he stated, looking at the childern, to where some backed a few feet away from Hachirou. <..Am I really this intimidating?> he thought to himself, no matter, he pointed to a male in the room.

"Step forward, boy." The young male of course, stepped closer toward Hachirou. "Perform the transformation jutsu, If it's not perfect, ten push-ups." he stated, giving a rather cold gaze at the chid. To where the child, starting to perform the hand signs for the technique, to where the boy, finally transformed himself into Hachirou.

Hachirou, looked on. He nodded his head in approval. "Nicely done..Now get out of the transformation." he stated, as the young boy did as he was told, he untransformed himself. The young boy, then moved to the back of the class room. Hachirou, scratched his chin.

". . . . . .Start reading in your text books, about the elements. And after you guys are done, I will quiz you. Understand?" the childern, nodded their heads, as they ran to take a seat in there desks. Quickly, the students opened their text books, and continued to read about the elements.

Hachirou, picked up his blade, and once again, placed it on his back. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. He went to take a seat at the teachers desk. Placing one foot ontop of the desk, the other foot, was planted on the ground, he started to lean back on the chair. "Peace...And quiet....Thank god..." he said to himself. 

He shifted his gaze, observing the very room he was in. "Alright, close your books...You come here." he pointed toward one of the students, and once the student noticed he was to be called upon, he walked toward Hachirou's current position. To where Hachirou, started to ask the boy various questions on the subject.

To where, the boy of course, answered about, 4/5 of the questions right. Hachirou, waved the boy to go away. ". . .Gather your things, class is about over. Matter of fact, you guys may leave class early. Good day everyone." he stated this, getting up from his chair, and leaving the area.

He made his way out of the academy, walking down the concrete path, he of course, still observed his surroundings around him. Making sure he wasn't going to get ganked walking back to turn in his assignments. ". . . Finally that shit is done and over with, holy fuck I hate kids.." he stated to himself. In actuallity, he did hate kids.

He would never have kids of his own, mainly because they need to much attention, and that was something that Hachirou himself, would never do. If he was to ever have a kid, he'd send his kid in the wild, to fend for himself. Make that kid become a man early. The better the kid learns how to survive in the wild, the better he would be in society.

Atleast, that's how Hachirou's logic went. But, he was almost back at the Kirigakure Square, However, he stopped in his tracks. Looking at the gravestone toward his right. He smirked. "Looks like you weren't that strong, Ex-Mizukage.." he chuckled to himself. Just staring at the tombstone, caused Hachirou to want to kill more.

But he had to control his impulses. By now, he reached the stone pillars that were near the square.* - Thu Nov 12 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) tossed the completed mission scrolls toward Liu, a letter was attached to one of the missions. "The letter is in the scroll. I didn't finish the last mission though, about improving my techniques. I'd rather do that, on my own time." he'd state. He took note of Eiyu's current position.* - Thu Nov 12 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) came into the room, Ziare following closely behind Hachirou.

"Searched every house in the village, no sign of the guy." he stated.* - Sat Nov 14 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Right. - Sat Nov 14 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) turned on his heels, and left the area. * - Sat Nov 14 11:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Are you from here man? - Sat Nov 14 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) took out a scroll within his jacket. Unraveling it on his lap. "Hnn.." his eyes, started to scan the scroll, gathering all the information he could on the technique he was reading about. Apparently it was called 'Phoenix Flower Jutsu.' Sounded like a pussy jutsu, who the fuck names a jutsu with flower in it? Hachirou shrugged, whatever, he needed to finish this last mission the Mizukage gave him, to which he took forever to complete. It wasn't a 'required' mission anyway.

So instead, Hachirou just put it off for a long while. He shook his head, he had to continue to focus and continue to read the scroll infront of him. It also seemed, that the technique can also burst upon impact. Which, in this case, could be good to use if there were explosives around the area. However, Hachirou wasn't much of an elementalist. But this could help him gain some experience later on. ". . . .Hng. . ." he hated reading scrolls. It was rather boring to just 'read'.

He wondered if he could sell these scrolls that he found. Scratching his head, he shifted his gaze from the scroll, and looked around the village square. Look's like it remained empty. That's all Kirigakure no Sato was though, mostly a ghost town. Not many people were around at this time, if ever in all honesty. He wondered when the village's population would increase. He hoped it would be soon, just so he could add to his kill count.

After killing Jehan-- The Ex-Mizukage, he was kind of blood thirsty, wanting to kill more and more people. But, he had to control his impulses. Just 'killing.' people for no reason, wasn't really any good. Unless, they were being annoying. Then they deserve to die.* - Sat Nov 14 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) was just about done reading the scroll's contents, his eyes shifting around the scroll. He was at his last sentence, finally finishing reading the scroll, he rolled it up, and placed it back into his jacket. Hachirou sighed. That took hella lot longer than expected. He got up from the bench, and started to walk south, passing the stone pillar's that were near the enterance. He stopped himself for a quick second. < . . .Still empty. . .>

He scratched the top of his head, then placed his hands back in his pockets. Shrugging and walking back to his home. He only had just a little bit of action, which was last night, he wondered what happened to that criminal. ". . .Why am I even thinking about it, he was stabbed. He couldn't have gone far. . " In all honesty, the guy was probably dead, so Hachirou didn't even worry about it.

Finally, reaching his desintation, he walked into his house. Gently placing his blade ontop of the couch, Hachirou sat next to his place, placing his hand ontop of the hilt. Then staring at the door. < . . . . .Boredom. . . It always hits. . .> he thought to himself. * - Sat Nov 14 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) was just chillen against the wall. Until, a sudden mist engulfed the whole area of Kirigakure no Sato. ". . .What is this. . . .There's more mist than usual in this village. . " he wondered what the problem was, and so he decided to search in on this, he didn't want to get fucked in this situation. If anything, he wondered if there was someone trying to attack the village. * - Sat Nov 14 19:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) took note of the males burnt face, he was able to see his teeth clearly. <. . .Damn he got fucked up. . .> he thought to himself. He grabbed his Zanbatou's hilt, grabbing it, taking it off of his back, and slamming it into the ground. A crack formed on the ground, as dust collected around his weapon for a short while, before it disappeared. Hachirou stared at Haku. "I'll let you get ready." he stated.* - Sun Nov 15 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Hand to hand combat then? - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: .... - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: Indeed. - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) let go of his blade, it seemed stuck into the ground's surface, it definately wasn't going anywhere. Hachirou chuckled at Haku's pseudo boxer stance. <. . . What kind of stance is that. . .> he thought to himself, Hachirou himself, got into an actual boxer stance, and ran forward, sending a volley of punches toward Haku. One punch was sent toward his left side rib, the second punch, was aimed toward his stomach.* - Sun Nov 15 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) ||
Didn't expect this at all, upon getting his punches deflected, there came forth an electric surge that went through-out his body. Literally shocking him for a quick second. This only enraged Hachirou, to where he backed up, grabbing his Zanbatou that was in the ground, and tearing it off, having small debris of rock's get flung in the air. Hachirou reared his Zanbatou into the air, and with this, he jumped into the air.

Now, he was above his opponet, getting an arieal view. He learned, not to get too close to his opponet.* - Sun Nov 15 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow, the technique seemed to be clocking in on his current position. However; He used gravity toward his advantage, having gravity try and push the lightning ball downward. Hachirou, thought this would work, but his aim wasn't the greatest. The ball of lightning, striked his hand, causing electricity to surge through his hand, toward his arm. Hachirou bit his lip. <Fuck!>, he of course, let go of his blade, which started to fall. However, he was still in mid-air, he utilized his gravity ability once again. 

This caused him gravity, to push himself down-ward faster, to where he grabbed the Zanbatou with his other hand, grasping the hilt of the blade, causing his body to also, spin. Taking gravity into consideration, this caused damage to increase-- If the attack landed. Which, if it was to land, it would not be good news for his sparring partner.* - Sun Nov 15 04:13:52 2015
