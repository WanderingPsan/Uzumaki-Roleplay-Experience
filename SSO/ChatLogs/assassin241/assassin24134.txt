<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) started to walk around the vast area, however he spotted some cows and chickens. He thought to himself for a few seconds. <..I need to be faster..If I become fast enough...No one will stop me...However, if people know I'm too fast they'll try and kill me...I can't risk that, I value my own life than anyone elses..> he started to jump up and down and shook his hands a bit. And then, he was off, he started to sprint around the area he was in, he was basically practicing on how he was going to run away if there was suppose to be a fight between him and an unknown opponet.

After running a certain distance away from the area, he stopped for a few seconds, hands on his knees as he was panting for breath, sweat was dripping from his face, to which he wiped it off with his shirt sleeve. He stood straight up, <..Not fast enough, again.> he thought. Quickly he once again started to sprint around the vast area once more, but this time he took out smoke bombs and threw them against the grounds surface, to act as cover for his escape, man if this was a real fight, this would've been a good strategy, unless someone had a doujutsu, then they could just see his chakra.

However he stopped running once he reached a certain distance, hands went back to his knee's as he once again started to pant. After awhie of regaining some oxygen back in his bodies system, he once again stood straight up, and started to walk back to the village square. He had enough practice of running away from someone if things go to serious and went down south. He didn't want to die or somethin like that, that would definately suck yo.* - Thu Oct 22 15:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) rotated his neck a bit. And then shifted his gaze back toward Lera. He got into his gentle fist stance and smirked. "No one's putting make up on me..Sorry to say.." he stated this as he ran toward the first clone, of course he couldn't tell which one was real and which one was fake. Quickly and effectively he used two fingers to strike, at the first clone, it's stomach and sternum, after he was done doing that, he went over to the next set of clones, utilizing his speed and attack speed to guide him through this.

He also took note of the chakra around the area aswell, since his Byakugan gave him 360 degree vision, he would notice any flare in chakra within there chakra pathway system.* - Thu Oct 22 16:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) took note of the earthen dome that took it's place around Arata's area. He smiled and nodded his head. <....She is very good at Doton...> he didn't have time to waste however, he noticed Violet on the move, and he also took note that Lera was still in the same spot. Arata quickly ran to the back of the earth dome, and used his gentle fist style to attack the chakra the jutsu possessed. He quickly did the set of hits, he continued to do this until it started to crumble into piles of rock.

And once that was done, he would quickly start to climb down the moutain, and once he reached the halfway mark of doing this, he'd slide down it and jump off of it, being beside Daisuke by this point.* - Thu Oct 22 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) took note of the female's position, Arata raised an eyebrow himself as he saw Daisuke cut off a branch. He wondered why a branch of all things. However he quickly made his way past Daisuke. <...Every man for himself, you said so..> as he turned around to see where his companion's current position was by this point. If he needed to help him, he would.* - Thu Oct 22 17:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) stood there and waited for Daisuke to run past him.

Arata placed his hands in his pocket as he looked at the two shinobi that were trying to scare them off. "Yo..Chick that has the fire around you, think you could teach me some Doton techniques?" he asked rather curious.* - Thu Oct 22 17:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) formed the single handseal, and started to gather up doton related chakra within his bodies system. However it was a long process when he did this, considering this was his first try in making elemental clones. He then stopped molding the doton related chakra for the technique. And then slowly but surely it looked like there was a mud clone slowly forming. However, it stopped at the halfway point, it then just crumbled back onto the ground. Arata frowned when this happened. <...This is kind of difficult.>* - Thu Oct 22 17:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) formed the single handsign once more, molding the doton chakra within his bodies system once more. He continued to hold the handsign, until he felt like he had enough chakra to create just one of them atleast. And after building up the chakra for long enough time, the mud that was around him started to form into that of a humanoid person. Taking the form of Arata once this process was done. The mud clone that was up soon turned back into mud as he looked over toward Lera. "Uh....Was that close enough by chance?" he stated this as he wiped off that lipstick he had on his face.* - Thu Oct 22 17:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 22 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) went around to try and find a shovel, and once he found one, he quickly got to work. He started to dig the hole that he had to make for one of the dead bodies that were around the area of Kirigakure no Sato. He quickly dug the hole in the ground, it was about 8 feet deep. He quickly made his way out of the large dug hole. He stabbed the shovel into the ground's surface. He sat down on the ground, sweat dropping down from his face as he was done with digging the hole for now.

However his resting was cut short, he grabbed the shovel and went back to one of the stores of Kirigakure no Sato, and gave them a shovel he found on the ground, maybe they'll have better use for it than Arata would have for right now anyway. He quickly made his way back to the dug hole he made, upon returning he saw a dog however near the hole. Arata squinted to see what that dog was actually doing near his hole.

Upon closer inspection the dog was pissing inside the dug hole he created, this angered Arata greatly as he took out a kunai and threw it at the dog, it wasn't to impale the dog, however it landed next to the dog, his whole purpose in this? It was to scare it away. He didn't want no dog peeing in the holes for dead people, that was just unrespectful.* - Thu Oct 22 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: Penis. - Thu Oct 22 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) whispers: I love you. - Thu Oct 22 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) whispers: omit - Thu Oct 22 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) sighed, as the dog finally ran off. Arata quickly formed a single handsign as he created two mud clones, he looked at both of them. "We need to find a dead body. Let's get going." he stated this as the clones and himself got to work and went after to go find some dead bodies to put in this hole--- After a couple of minutes of searching, they found a dead body. One of the mud clones dropped the dead body into the hole.

However the mud cone went back to the store that Arata gave the store his shovel, they quickly made a quick bargain and grabbed the shovel, and upon returning he had the mud clones do all of his labor work. And they quickly filled the hole, it was 8 feet deep after all, so it did take quiet a while, but after they were done, Arata stood there and nodded his head. The mud clones then disappeared.

Arata sighed, there was a lot of death in this village, a lot of dead bodies, a lot of rubble. The place here looked like a mess here, and that was something he didn't like. Sunagakure wasn't this messy, matter of fact Sunagakure was actually kept clean and nice and tidy. Here it was completely the opposite, Arata though, decided to sit on the grounds surface and look around the area for a quick second.

He enjoyed the waters that Kirigakure provided, it seemed like a cool village to be in. However, he slowly got up and placed his hands in his cloak pockets. Now his next task was to find a dog that's been feasting on some corpses. And that was rather disgusting if he actually had to think about it. However, a mission was a mission, and he planned on getting it done.* - Thu Oct 22 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) got up and started to go look for this dog, by of course activating his byakugan. He decided not to waste any time, he utilized his speed and quickly manevoured around the rubble and kirigakure no sato, he wanted to find this dog and get it done and over with already. However, with his byakugan he found himself the dog that was feasting on the dead corpses. He shook his head. <...Just a sad place...Dogs have to resort to eating corpses..>.

However he threw a single kunai toward the dog. As it landed next to it, the dog looked at Arata, with a rather crazed look in it's eyes, however the dog started to make a run for it, it quickly started to run away from Arata's precense. Arata quickly had to make his way toward the dog, he cursed under his breath, if only he had shushin he could reach the dog in a matter of minutes.

However, he was gaining rather quickly on the dog, he quickly formed several handsigns, as doton chakra started to mold within his bodies system, and after he was done finishing the handsigns, he opened his maw and out came out a mud flow of river toward the dog, however, this would've washed away at the dogs feet, causing it to get off balance.

And it was definately a sucess, the dog started to slip on the mud, as it lost it's balance and indeed fell on the mud. The dog of course barked rather harshly and loud toward Arata, he wasn't one to kill animals without reason, but this seemed like a good reason to kill the animal since it was feasting on the dead corpses of Kirigakure, he didn't blame the dog though.

Considering it was survival of the fittest, and the dog was only trying to survive, he utilized his gentle fist style, his byakugan of course was activated in order to do this process, he used an open palm strike on the dog's cranium, his attempt in this was to kill the dog. And after he killed it, he picked it up and threw it into the rivers of Kirigakure, the dog sunk into the water never to be seen again.

Arata then turned on his heels deactivated his byakugan and made his way back to Kirigakure's square to tell Kirie that he had completed his mission, he would probably need to get a break from this.* - Thu Oct 22 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) turned on his heels and walked over toward the tree that Kirie pointed to.

Arata then slowly converted chakra to the soles of his feet, he also took out a kunai to mark his progression, first he placed his right foot onto the tree's base. It was like a sucktion cup once he placed his foot against the tree's bark. Then Arata placed his other foot on it. Quickly he started to run up the tree, however he supplied to much chakra and got blasted off of the tree, he made a slash mark against the tree, he reached the half-way point.

He quickly decended down and landed on the grassy surface. Sweat was starting to form on his face, as he once again applied chakra to the soles of his feet and ran toward the tree. He then started to run up the tree, finally he passed his first slash mark, however he only made it three steps further from where his last slash mark was at. Before he once again got blasted away from the tree. He quickly before he got blasted away from the tree, placed a slash mark against it's bark.

He landed on the grounds surface, he was panting as beads of sweat continued to drip from his face. <...Come on...>. Arata walked toward the tree this time, he placed the kunai back in his holister, as he once again converted chakra to the soles of his feet, however when he tried climbing the tree, he started to slip and fall, he sighed shortly after this, scratching his head, sorta confused on this suimen technique. It seemed easier said than done, but it's either go hard or go home.* - Fri Oct 23 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) made his way toward the water.

Arata started to convert chakra to the soles of his feet, he slowly placed one foot onto the waters surface, however, when he did this his foot seeped right through the water. He sighed, he placed his hands in his pockets he looked at Kirie then back at the water, this suimen technique was definately hard, they make it look so easy. However, he continued to try, he didn't want to give up, yeah confidence.

He retracted his foot from the water, Arata once again started to focus, applying chakra to the soles of his feet, he stepped with both feet on the waters surface, at first it looked like he was doing good, but then he went straight into the water, getting everything and his cloths wet. Arata swam out of the water, going back on land, spitted out some water here and there. He slowly got back up, and decided to give this one last try.

Arata, converted chakra to the soles of his feet, he slowly started to walk on the waters surface, he waited for a short while to see if he would once again seep through the water, however he didn't this time. He looked over toward Kirie. "So uh...I'm doing it right......Right?" he asked rather curious.* - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) stretched first, and once he was done stretching, veins buldged toward his eyes, activating his byakugan, he first made sure there was no one around them, and made sure they weren't near any other traps, just incase Kirie gave them false information. And after everything was checked and cleared for, he would deactie his byakugan and looked toward Daisuke.

"Yep.."* - Fri Oct 23 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly ran into the water, his cloths of course getting wet and the cold waters touching his bodies skin. He looked over toward Daisuke. "Nah, I'll be good, Daisuke." he stated this as he started to swim across the kirigakure ocean, he occasionally looked side to side, incase there was a shark attack, ya boy ain't want to get ganked by sharks.* - Fri Oct 23 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) continued to swing his arms, as water splashed onto Arata's face. He was no bitch though, he fought against those waves, he was going to make the waves his bitch. However, he was going to prove to Daisuke, that he indeed had great stamina, he was no push over when doing this kind of excercise. Even though this was his first time doing so, he wanted to be the best at it. Let the competition begin.* - Fri Oct 23 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly did a turn about. He wanted to get out of the water, it was pointless to try and swim by this point. Once he reached land; which wasn't that far at all, he'd make his way back to the square.* - Fri Oct 23 06:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) walked toward the Kirigakure Mansion. He looked around to try and find a broom so he could sweep the steps to the mansion, this would possibly take awhile to find it. And so he started his search; quickly he went about searching through what little rubble they had left in the village and found a broom. He grabbed it and sighed, looks like it's time to get to work. He hated doing this weak ass D rank mission shit. Hassan on his first day gave ya boy a B rank mission fighting assassin's. The fuck is this shit.

Anywho, Arata started to sweep the steps, slowly and carefully of course. Sweeping up all sorts of trash, there were bottles everywhere----Even fish was on the floor. Who the fuck would do this? Arata dropped the broom on the ground and picked up the now dead fish and tossed it into the trash bin. Arata then went back over to grab the broom and once again started to sweep the steps to the Kirigakure mansion. He was aware of his surroundings however, making sure he wasn't about to get attacked from behind. You never know nowadays.

By now, the steps looked nice and clean--on his side anyway. He threw the broom to the side and placed his hands in his cloak pockets. Arata took out another scroll and unraveled it in his hands. He read the scrolls contents and sighed once more. "...Show an elderly lady around the village...Really...." he placed the scroll back in his pocket and continued down south.* - Fri Oct 23 17:15:56 2015
