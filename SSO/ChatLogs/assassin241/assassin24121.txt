"Lay down on the bed." he stated, and if Kojiro complied, he would cross his arms and continue to look at the male, asking yet again another question.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) upon walking forward his foot kicked a body, he didn't know whos body it was, he knelt down, his hands were patting down the body, and upon grasping the bodys shirt, he brang it close to him, trying to see who's face it was, and upon brining the dead males face closer toward Hideki's, he saw who it was, it was his close friend Seisuke, the one that was there for him since the begining, the only person who actually wanted to help him when he was in Konohagakure by his lonesome. His hands started to shake slowly, as he lifted Seisuke's body up and over his shoulder.

However, he went over toward the last spot he saw Heiwa, before the mist came. As he went and reached underneith the table. "Heiwa.. Are you here...." he said in a low tone, wondering if Heiwa was there or not, however, he also heard blood dripping from the dead body he was carrying, the blood of Seisuke's body was also getting on his tan cloak. He just wanted to find Heiwa, and bury his close friend.* - Wed Oct  7 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Only two things in this world.. loyalty, and honesty.. Loyalty to one another and loyalty to my cause.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed the scroll, placed it inside his cloak for safe keeping, he grabbed Heiwa aswell, and -ran- from the area. He had things to do, he didn't want anyone interrupting him at all.* - Wed Oct  7 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) gently placed Seisukes body down, he opened up his eye that contained the sharingan, he slowly took out a kunai and stabbed it. Destroying the eye in general as blood splattered across his tan cloak. However there was blood all over his body. After he destroied Seisuke's sharingan eye, he grabbed a shovel that he left around here over about two months ago when he buried Hanabi's body. He quickly dug a hole and once he got done digging the hole he placed Seisukes body in it.

He then placed the dirt back in there by shoveling it back ontop of the males dead body. He threw the shovel to the side. He got on his knees, as tears began to fall from his face. He just losted his best friend, the one that was there for him through the begining, even wanted to help him train. They both had big plans ahead of them, but instead looks like those plans were indeed ruined. He spoke in a low tone, low enough for Heiwa to hear. "That wasn't your dad... Heiwa.." he stated as tears continued to fall from his face.

Hideki broke rule number one in the shinobi handbook, and that was to never show emotion. No more deaths shall be made around his family, and close friends. There will be no more, he's had it with people close to him dying, first it was Hanabi, then Mariana, then Ushinawa, and now Seisuke? He just couldn't take it anymore. He got up, blood still covering majority of his tan cloak, but while he turned around he saw a figure that he's definately noticed around Kumogakure no Sato.

His three tomoe sharingan scanning the individual, Hideki's expression remained blank. He had no more words to say, however he took out the scroll that Heiwa had, and gave it to him. "Put it in your pocket or something.." he stated, and those were the only words he had to say.* - Wed Oct  7 01:10:49 2015
