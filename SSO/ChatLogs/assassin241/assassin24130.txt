By now the setting has changed, they were no longer in Sunagakure, no they were in Konohagakure. Upon closer inspection, Ortho could see Hideki next to two other shinobi, those shinobi were Lyala, and Maloth. Ortho however, in this illusion was next to Hideki. Then that's when hell broke loose. A large racoon looking beast (Shukaku) was seen at the gate, slamming it's iron sand tail against the Konohagakure gates, smashing it into bits and pieces.

Hideki at the time, was in awe as he quickly grabbed Lyala and Maloth, and started to run away from the square, but when Hideki turned around, he saw the beast form a huge ball, it was no ordinary ball however, it decreased in size as the beast literally -ate- it. Then, the beast opened its mouth and sent the blat toward the mansion, as a large explotion rang out, destroying the mansion and creating a huge explotion. However, that's when Hideki took Lyala and Maloth to Kumogakure.* - Thu Oct 15 02:24:12 2015

However you now know that these eyes can replay memories...You too will have the chance to unlock these eyes, when the time comes." he stated, as he sat down and leaned against the cliff.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got up from sitting down on the bench, but he looked at Mokutsu one last time, and notice a slight mixture in his chakra. He nodded his head. He kept moving going behind Sanoke.* - Thu Oct 15 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) whispers: (You seen Iza's chakra?) - Thu Oct 15 10:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) raised an eyebrow. 

But then that's when it clicked. He remembered Suitengu's words about the lavander eyes when he asked the young boy questions about them before his death. Hideki then stroked his chin, Sanoke was probably one of those people with the weird eyes aswell. And considering Suitengu died here, he probably has his eyes aswell. He stood there, crossing his arms. "Hm? What do you mean?" he asked curious.* - Thu Oct 15 10:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: So the eyes name is Rinnegan.. - Thu Oct 15 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out of his kimono a small jar, within the jar were to floating rinnegan eyes. Hideki looked at Sanoke. "This is what you want?"* - Thu Oct 15 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) examined the jar that had the floating eyes inside.

"And what if I was to accidently drop this.." he stated as he continued to toss the jar slightly in the air, catching it shortly after. Repeating this process.* - Thu Oct 15 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: He may have Suitengu's eyes.... - Thu Oct 15 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Probably why he knows so much about these uh....Rinnegan. - Thu Oct 15 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) caught the jar one last time. And glared at Sanoke.* - Thu Oct 15 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What happened to the one known as.. - Thu Oct 15 10:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Harada. . .? - Thu Oct 15 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Was that Taiga's last name? - Thu Oct 15 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes, - Thu Oct 15 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head, seemed like Suitengu didn't even stand a chance.

"I see....I see.... What's up with those shades?" he asked, he knew the answer to that already. But he continued to stand there, jar in his hands.* - Thu Oct 15 10:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: My new hair from Jin - Thu Oct 15 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) closed his eyes, he smiled, knowing there was still other people with speical eyes still left in the world,  after what Ushinawa told him, it seemed like there were no survivors. Damn he misses his cousin. Hideki tossed the jar over to Sanoke. "This Edge person you speak of. I've been around his uh...I guess you could say he's hiding somewhere in a village. But I wouldn't recommend going there." he stated worrying for Sanoke's well being. Hideki wondered why the hell he didn't use shades. He was a fuckboy for that.* - Thu Oct 15 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just becareful, Sanoke. - Thu Oct 15 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) was going to say something to object.

But this nigga Sanoke was gone like the wind. And with that Hideki went back to the square, to chill on the bench.* - Thu Oct 15 10:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Fri Oct 16 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) formed a single handseal, as he formed chakra within his bodies system, and when he was done gathering the chakra, in a plume of smoke next to him, was an exact copy of himself. Hideki got on one knee, as he started to pant. He was already sweating and it was just a single shadow clone. Hideki slowly got up. "For now....You can fight against my shadow clone.." he stated as he got on the water, converting chakra to his feet, he began to meditate on the water.* - Fri Oct 16 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The shadow clone however saw this coming, and quickly dodged the attempt, and ran forward toward Index's location, the clone took out a single kunai, considering Hideki's katana got stolen by Rymei, the Shadow clone itself, tried to slash at Index's shoulder.* - Fri Oct 16 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) omit* - Fri Oct 16 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The shadow clone quickly dodged the fireshot, as it made it's way toward Index's current location, however considering the distance that was given, it woud take awhile before the clone got there. So in this case, this gave Index more time to send another attack toward the clone. However, Hideki paid close attention to Index, observing his handseals and the jutsu's he sent off.* - Fri Oct 16 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The shadow clone took this into consideration, quickly it made it's way to the water, getting away from the Fire Run technique, however, the shadow clone also had sharingan activated, it continued to take note where Index's current location was at, the clone took out a kunai, and infused katon chakra flow through the kunai, giving it extra length on the small tool. And giving it extra cutting power aswell, as the clone continued it's advance on Index.* - Fri Oct 16 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The Clone however saw this coming, it quickly pick'n rolled out of the water, having the earth flash technique hit the waters surface and electricute the fish inside. However, Hideki was also on this water, so he stepped off of it, making sure his ass ain't get electricuted himself. He continued to observe the fight though. The Shadow Clone however, once again continued it's advance on Index. It held the kunai in it's hands, which had the katon chakra flow still flowing through it.* - Fri Oct 16 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The Clone noticed the lag inbetween the two, however it once again continued to dodge the attacks that were sent forth, as it continued it's advance toward Index, the clone threw the kunai that had katon flames engulfed on it toward Index's right shoulder, however it was not aimed to impale however, he only wanted the flame engulfed kunai to merely scratch it. As the clone dispersed shortly after, depending if it hit or not.* - Fri Oct 16 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ran toward Index, taking out some bandages, and handing them to him. "Sorry about that, next time I won't go as hard. I apologize, Index." he stated this as he tried handing Index some bandages.* - Fri Oct 16 01:06:59 2015
