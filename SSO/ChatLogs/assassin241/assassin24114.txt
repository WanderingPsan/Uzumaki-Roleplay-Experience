<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah, not that I know of. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: Talk about it later. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: We can talk in private, if you'd like. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: She's not behind her desk. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And she's not in the room to the right either. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sometimes she goes to train, but I don't know where. - Sun Sep 27 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So she might be training right now. - Sun Sep 27 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: When I killed Ikarus. I tore his eyes out, not because I wanted to. But it was more of an innate -need- for them..  - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: Once I pressed them against my own eyes. They just.. melded into mine. - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I see.. - Sun Sep 27 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I'm sure that Katsune will appear at some point, she always dos. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked forward, and looked at Hanabi, as he clapped his hands together, molding the chakra within his bodies system, as he tried to attempt what Hanabi attempted back at Kirigakure, but yet, the snake he summoned forth was not as big as Hanabi's. A small white snake came out of his back, and coiled around his arm as he sent his arm forward, the small snake eventually poofed into smoke. He frowned as he couldn't do the same thing Hanabi did.

He sighed, as he clapped his hands once more, molding the chakra within his system, attempting to form the large white snake. After regaining the chakra he lost, the white snake came out of his back, and coiled itself around his arm, it was obviously a medium snake, instead of a large one. It poofed into white smoke. He looked over at Hanabi. "Was that close enough?"* - Sun Sep 27 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Slippery. - Sun Sep 27 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You do not need to clap your hands but that was a good start. - Sun Sep 27 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh.. - Sun Sep 27 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Eventually you will get it down - Sun Sep 27 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Taiga. - Sun Sep 27 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Where is Maloth? - Sun Sep 27 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So, I saw Erebus get it on with that Yumiko girl in a restaurant. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: .... - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Maloth? That huge guy? - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: --- - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Er. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah Maloth. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So Erebus fucked Yumiko? - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, maybe he's inside. Not sure. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Nice~ - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, not saying the fucked. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But when I walked in. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yumiko was sitting on his lap, embracing him. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I swear the staff was aggitated before we came in. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: They must've done something there before I saw them. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well I am going to check to see if Maloth is inside. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: There was someone south of here though. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: That could be him. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: South and take a left. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll go check then. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Would you like a spar though, Taiga? - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A spar? - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh, alright. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) smirked, indeed Hideki knew the handsigns to the technique, since he himself knows the technique. He quickly formed handsigns while jumping backwards, he took out a windmill shuriken, and threw it toward the fireball, although he pulled his index finger toward himself, as the windmill shuriken suddenly manevoured itself around the fireball. Although, he did jump backwards, after he jumped backwards, he moved to the side aswell. * - Sun Sep 27 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) tried to dodge but failed, considering taiga's attack speed was far greater than his reflex ability. So therefore the tanto was near his neck. As Hideki looked straight forward, staring off into the distance. His facial expression remained blank though.* - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah, no problem. - Sun Sep 27 19:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eye's widened as he saw Hanabi unleash a shit ton of snakes, knowing it was probably going to drain her badly. He quickly activated his snake lycan state, scales forming all around his body, there color of course being a maroon color. After Hanabi released the 5000 snakes toward Erebus, he quickly grabbed her by her waist, although, while he was grabbing her, explosive tags were dropped from within his cloak down toward the grounds surface.

He then wielded a single handsign, as he shunshined -away- from the possible threat that Erebus was giving toward his ally. But, while he shunshined away, the explosive tags did explode. Creating a black smoke screen to cover said escape. So if he was going to chase, he'd have to have a good eye.* - Sun Sep 27 20:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to shunshin -away- from the area, he looked back to see how Hanabi was doing and it looked like things were not looking to good. He had to keep calm regardless of the situation. By now he was probably a great distance away from them, he converted chakra through-out his feet and climbed the west portion of the Konohagakure gate, and once he climbed it, he continued to make his escape, by now. Erebus was probably occupied by Hanabi.

And considering Hideki was ignored, Erebus probably didn't notice his snake transformation.* - Sun Sep 27 20:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Natural energy? What's that - Sun Sep 27 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to get into a meditative state, gathering up natural energy and mixing his own chakra with it, having the two combine together. Considering he wasted his snake lycan form earlier in order to escape, he'd probably need it to escape once more if things were to get rough. And he couldn't have that, but in order to gather the natural energy needed. He had to have full concentration.

He heard Niza's words, as he heard what he said and murmured to himself "...Be safe...you two."* - Sun Sep 27 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped gathering up natural energy, along with finally mixing his chakra with it. He started to run back to the mansion, where he last saw Hanabi. He kept thinking to himself <..Why am I so weak...I always let my friends down... And for what, to save my own ass.. Pitiful..> he kept running though, until he reached his destination.* - Sun Sep 27 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) came trailing behind Niza, but when he finally made it back to the scene, he could see Hanabi dropping to her death, literally  pool of blood is surrounding her body, followed by snakes all around the area. But needless to say, he kept his composure. He eye'd Hanabi's dead body, a blank expression remained on his face. He lost a mentor today, someone who was going to teach him everything about snake related techniques. 

He stared at the ground balling his fists.* - Sun Sep 27 21:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) arrived to Kumogakure, carrying a bloody corpse in his bare hands. He continued to have a blank expression on his face as he walked past the mansion, blood was also smeared all over his tan cloak. His gunbai on his back, as he walked past Kida. No words were even spoken toward him, nor did he even want to acknowledge his presense. He turned his heels and went up north to burry her body.

He gently placed her body on the dirt floor, as he got on his knees as murmured to himself. "I......I wasn't strong enough.....This is all my fault....I wanted to visit Suitengu and ask him how he was doing... I didn't know...You'd die..." he decided to get to work, as he magically found a shovel and started to dig the grave for Hanabi's dead corpse. After digging deep enough, he climbed out of it, and threw the shovel to the side.

But burried the body, he grabbed Hanabi's cloak and her mask. He wanted to keep these two items as a memento, she was the only mentor beside Ushinawa that actually took interest in him, although he has to admit Hanabi could be a pain in the ass, and a prick. But he stilled cared for her regardless, she taught him most of his jutsus, and it's a damn shame that she won't be able to do it later on either.

He then looked at the mask, and placed it on his face, he slowly closed his eyes and reopened them, activating his sharingan that was one tomoe. From within the masks holes, could be seen glowing red eyes. "I will avenge you one day.... Hanabi..."* - Sun Sep 27 22:29:07 2015
