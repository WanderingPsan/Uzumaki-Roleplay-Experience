<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) formed several hand signs, katon chakra was mixing within his bodies system. And after completing the hand signs, he opened his maw, and out came forth a volley of rather small fireballs. The small fireballs, impacted against the cliff's surface. Leaving just small craters on it. <. . .Bleh. . .Ninjutsu wasn't my greatest ally. . . I prefer taijutsu . . .> He thought to himself. He wondered where Sunagakure was at, when Kirigakure was getting attacked.

That just goes to show, that they're obviously up to something.* - Mon Nov 16 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: What else..can you do? - Mon Nov 16 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) took out a scroll, and slowly opened it. On the side it read 'Fire Run'. Hachirou wasn't much of an elementalist, but maybe he could help and teach other people jutsu, maybe help them get lower drains. Help them save there chakra, be a good guy for once. However, his eyes scanned the scroll, quickly reading the information given in it's contents. It seemed one needed somewhat decent chakra to perform the technique. In Hachirou's case, his chakra wasn't the greatest at all.

In fact, it was probably lower than average, which is why he usually uses taijutsu based attacks, instead of genjutsu, or ninjutsu. <. . . . Ugh. . . . .I hate reading scrolls, they're such a pain in the damn ass. . . .> He thought to himself. The user could use this technique, to even create a circle of fire around them. That seemed pretty neat. He could probably use that to trap his enemies, unless they have water based techniques, then that jutsu is useless.

He occasionally, looked away from the scroll, his eyes set on Haku, then at Eiyu, who seemingly weren't doing anything but training their summoning jutsu's. Hachirou kind of wished he had a summoning, that'd be pretty cool to have. He returned his sights, back on the scroll infront of him, not quiet yet done reading it's contents just yet. But, he was close to being done.

He just had to read a little more. His mind, wandered somewhere else. He wondered, how Kirigakure no Sato is doing right now, considering they were under attack, by someone on a giant snake. And of course, there was a large fireball that attacked the academy, probably destroyed it too, who know's. And there were probably a lot of deaths too.* - Mon Nov 16 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) was finally at the end of reading the scroll, he rolled it up, and placed it back within his jacket. He leaned against the cliff, observing the area infront of him once again. < . . .It's still quiet, and boring here in Kumogakure, despite there being one thousand sunagakure gaurds everywhere around this stinkin village.> * - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: .... - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: Guy with the blade. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) started to perform the required hand signs for the technique he just learned, despite even leaning against the cliff, he still performed it. Molding katon chakra within his bodies system, mixing it with the oxygen aswell, having the two elements combine. He opened his maw, and out came a stream of fire. It wasn't a large stream, it was a rather small stream of fire. Which, slowly started to vanish after about five to ten minutes of it staying there.

Hachirou, crossed his arms, and decided to regain the chakra he just lost from performing the technique. "Tch. . . " he wondered if there was a way, to flow katon related chakra onto his weapon. That would be pretty cool. It would probably help him out a lot more. But, then again, who would have a technique that could do that? Maybe he could use his scrolls, and have it go for a trade.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) throws up the blood sign before snoozing.* - Mon Nov 16 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) reached into his jacket, and took out another katon scroll, on the side of the scroll, it read in bold letters 'Great Fireball'. Hachirou, finally unraveled the scroll, his eyes remained glued onto the scrolls contents, gathering as much information as he could on the scroll itself. <. . . .Ugh. . . .More fucking reading. . .Why do I do this to myself. . .Why.> Yes, why the hell did he do this to himself, the world may never know. However; the scroll stated, that a genin would require more than average chakra, to perform the technique.

Sighing, Hachirou didn't even have above average chakra, his chakra, was pretty much lower than average. Which he probably needed to fix that in all honesty. He'll probably do that, at a later time. Or he could start now, and practice the jutsu at hand, -after- he learned it from the scroll. Seemed like that was the best way to learn techniques anyway, through learning it from a scroll. He wondered however; where Haku, and Eiyu went. "I swear to go if you went to Kirigakure Eiyu, I'm chopping off your damn legs. . ." he said to himself.

That was another problem with Hachirou, he tended to talk to himself a lot, which wasn't really a good sign at all. He leaned against the cliff once again, continuing to read the scroll, the fireball jutsu, it seemed one needed to mix the katon chakra within there body, with their oxygen that flowed in their body aswell, and once mixing the two componets, it seemed they can release a large fireball.

But with great practice with the jutsu, one could conjure up, a pretty large fireball, probably the size of the one that attacked the Kirigakure academy last night. He stroked his chin, he wondered who could've done something like that, could it have been the man named Ortho that everyone talked about? Or could it have been an unknown individual, who held a lot of hate for Kirigakure no Sato? Hachirou didn't know, nor did he care. He just liked to kill shit, and kill shit, he would do.

Next on his agenda however; was to learn this damn scroll, and possibly think of a way to get Sunagakure, out of power. But this, would definately be a difficult task. A task, he could not do alone, but the individual by the name of Index, seemed like a strong individual. Maybe he could ask him for help, Hachirou shook his head. "Focus. . ." he said to himself. His eyes, now shifting from sentence, to sentence from within the scroll.

By now, he finally finished the scroll, rolling it up, and placing it back within his jacket. Sitting down on the grounds surface, and leaning against the cliff. He stared up at the sky. ". . . .I'm so fucking bored. . ." he said to himself. He wondered, where the fuck were his friend's at to keep him occupied from this boredom.* - Mon Nov 16 20:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) watched Haku perform the jutsu, paying close attention. < . A Single hand seal to perform a technique? That's interesting.> he stated to himself, however, he decided to give it a try, he formed a single hand sign, raiton chakra was formulating around in his body, molding the raiton chakra he needed to perform the technique, and after he was molding it, he released the jutsu. But, it didn't go far, only a -small- spark was seen. ". . .What the fuck. . . ." That was pretty embaressing. 

He decided to give it one last try, forming the hand seal once more, he was molding the raiton chakra within his bodies system. Finally, he decided to let it loose, a small surge of lightning, came out of his body, and out into the air. Not even traveling that far of a distance. He looked over toward Haku, to see if he performed the technique correctly.* - Tue Nov 17 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) continued to lean against the fence, shifting his gaze from looking at the fence, toward Asteroth. 

"Heh. . . Yeah I guess so. . ."* - Thu Nov 19 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) crossed his arms.

"Hm. . . .I don't think the Mizukage we have now, is fit for the rank. However, out of recent events, he has become stronger. He's able to summon chains out of the ground and bind individuals. It was a pretty niffty technique. I plan on adding him to my kill list." he stated rather bluntly.

His eyes, remained on Asteroth* - Thu Nov 19 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) smirked.

"I already killed the Mizukage before him." he stated this, and took out a Mizukage Hat, and placed it on for a breif moment, shortly after, he took it off, and placed it back within his jacket's confinement.  "There is strength in numbers indeed. However, he can also use shadow clone jutsu. . . Which is a pain in the damn ass. . . And to answer your question, I'm not as powerful as you think I am, I'm just smart. . .And sly." he stated.* - Thu Nov 19 01:01:52 2015

"I plan to stay for another three day's before returning to Kirigakure, but if you need help claiming the land, that shouldn't be an issue. . .Considering there really isn't much here, it seems." he stated, as he looked around the area they were in, then stared back at the woman.* - Thu Nov 19 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) went back, and leaned against the fence once again.

"There isn't much there, after all, half of their land was destroyed. There's probably a total of three to four in the population, tops. There's also Sunagakure gaurds everywhere, that usually stop people before entering. But, from what my contact told me, theres just about a thousand or so Sunagakure troops, within the village itself." he stated.* - Thu Nov 19 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) sighed.

He decided now was the time to start doing some training, and yes, in the middle of the Konohagakure Square. He didn't care who would see his technique. Hachirou, reared his Zanbatou into the air, while he did this, he jumped into the air, however he performed another -jump- while in mid-air, his body, twisted in a vertical manner. Once he shifted his weight, he started to spin in the air.

By adapting gravity, and having it push his body downward faster, it looked like a corkscrew-like slice. To which, it impacted against the ground's surface, literally flinging debris all around the area he was in. Dust started to collect around his person, nearly cloaking him, sweat was dripping from his face. <I need to practice this a lot more. . > he thought to himself. Indeed, he did need to practice more with this jutsu, in fact it was becoming a pain in the ass in doing so. 

He would definately use this against the Mizukage when he had the chance to, he was going to prove that Hachirou, was definately the stronger individual. He didn't want to get showed up by some weakling, afterall, Hachirou was the one that killed the previous Mizukage, and he took all of that credit. He will take the credit when he kills Liu. That is, if he gets the chance to.* - Fri Nov 20 02:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) pulled up to the scene, grabbing hold of his Zanbatou's hilt. Slowly, he took the Zanbatou off of his back. "I want a match, one on one, this is a fight to the death. I want to see who's stronger, and since you have some good armor. . .You must be a worthy opponet. . " he stated, with a smirk on his face, he reared his Zanbatou into the air, and with this, he jumped into the air himself. 

Whe he jumped, he jumped rather high, his gaze, continued to remain on the male. He hasn't seen much of the males capabilities, if anything, Hachirou was the most Arrogant person ever, he was also an airhead at times. He thought he could beat anyone, unless he was beaten prior. His whole purpose for living, was to fight random individuals, his kill count, still remained at one, however; he was going to see, if he could exceed his kill count, of one, to two.* - Fri Nov 20 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hachirou(Assassin241) jumped in -mid air- to essentially avoid the strikes of wind against his body, but when he did this action, he twisted his body, he started to spin, his body however, was vertical for the time being, of course, he completed this, by shifting his weight. By adapting the gravity, he was able to decend down faster than usual, in his decent, his body was spinning sort of like a corkscrew. The slice, definately held not only sharpness, but destructive penetrative force.

If this was not blocked, this could be bad news for his opponet, known as the Anbu Agent.* - Fri Nov 20 03:50:24 2015

If this was not blocked, this could be bad news for his opponet, known as the Anbu Agent.

His blade, broke upon impact with the male's iron sand shield, that was seemingly conjured up. <. . Iron?!> his blade, broke upon impact with the surprisingly, durable iron sand, as sparks flew when the impact was made. His grip on the blade, seized, as he released the grip he had on it. His eye's widened <. .. How the fuck could I let this happen to me?!> he thought to himself.

The strong gale of wind, striked against his body, to where it once again, flung himself into the air. His eye's, were still pretty damn wide, he was just in disbelief, that he would be defeated, in such a quick manner. He didn't even last that long against this individual. However, this goes to show, Hachirou should've never been as Arrogant as he was. He crossed his arms in an X shape pattern, covering his face. That's where he thought the shurikens were aimed for, however, it seemed they were aimed in various other places.

The iron shurikens, obviously pierced -through- his body's core. Going through his stomach, chest, legs, arms, ect. There was no way in hell, he would survive this kind of attack, not even in a million years. Hachirou, coughed up blood, his arms, laid limp at his sides, as he plummeted down to the ground's surface. Hachirou's body, slammed against the dirt, dust collected as this happened. It wasn't much dust, it was very litte.

This, was the end of Hachirou. The one known to have killed the previous Mizukage, Tetsuki, Jehan. The Mizukage who held a rather awkward power, a person who was able to manipulate threads. Hachirou only killed one person in his life time, and it was Jehan. If there was one thing he regretted out of all of this, it was that he was to Arrogant. He thought he could take on everyone, and that wasn't a fact.

By now, a pool of blood, was now around Hachirou's body. Blood continued to pour out of his body's system.* - Fri Nov 20 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) took out a set of shuriken, and laid them infront of him. Quickly, he started to form several hand signs, molding chakra within his body's system for a short while. Then, when he finished molding the chakra, he grabbed the shuriken on the ground, having the chakra flow through-out his shuriken. The Shuriken, starting to float in mid-air, then, they were sent shooting forward. 

With great accuracy, and speed, they striked against the house infront of him. With his index finger, he tugged forward, having the shuriken's that were stuck within the house, get pulled out. The Shurikens, came back toward Ryouta, they stopped floating however, and fell on the ground's surface. Ryouta, inhaled and exhaled slowly. ". . .This jutsu might take some time to master, it's drain, is still pretty bad, and its taking it's toll on my body." he stated to himself.

He picked up the shuriken, and placed it within his back pouch. He placed his hands in his pockets, and started to walk back into one of the Amegakure buildings. <. . I should practice my fuuinjutsu, that will be very important to do here soon. > he thought to himself. Amegakure itself, seemed really boring, it seemed rather empty aswell, he didn't see many people here at all. He scratched his chin, <. . .Wonder where everyone is at.> he said to himself.* - Fri Nov 20 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) took out an empty scroll, placing it on the ground's surface. He took out a single pen, and with that, he wrote fuuinjutsu formula's within the scroll's confinement. He was going to practice his sealing ability, he wanted to get practicing for the fuuinjutsu formula's out of the way with. He didn't want to spend that much time on it, if he could avoid it. Which by this point, he had nothing else to really do, since Amegakure is kind of uh, empty.

He stopped writing on the scroll, he went into some deep thinking for a quick second. <. . .Why don't we have that many villagers. . I wonder why. . .> he thought to himself, but soon after, he just shrugged it off. It would be better to train within an empty house, and learn new things, new jutsu, new techniques. All that good jazz, it would be good  for Ryouta. Considering, there are probably hella of a lot more people stronger than him of course.

There was another thing, that raised his curiosity, He'd want to get into summoning animals, mainly because, summoning animal's seemed like it would be useful. He could have someone to talk to, whenever he was to be lonely. He shook his head. "Focus." he said to himself, in the rather empty room he was in, his voice echoed within the empty room. With his pen, he continued to write fuuinjutsu formula's.

Upon writing the fuuinjutsu formula's, sweat was dripping from his face. His hand of course, was cramping. He placed the pen down, on the marble flooring. He grabbed his wrist, with his opposite hand, and rotated it, slowly. "Fuck man. . .This shit does hurt your wrist after awhile." he said to himself, with his voice, once again, echoing within the empty room.

Ryouta, got up from sitting down on the floor, his hands, remained at his sides, and he walked up toward the window, peeking his head up, so he could see out of it. His eyes, scanned the landscape infront of him. He could see the Amegakure shops, and the vending machine, and the fences of course. It was still, empty. Ryouta, went back to the scroll, grabbed the pen, and of course, started to write more fuuinjutsu formula's within the scrolls confinement's.

Ryouta, yawned shortly after.* - Fri Nov 20 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) took out two scrolls from his inventory. He placed them both on the ground, they were facing horizontally. He formed several hand signs, molding chakra for a short moment. Then, his scrolls launched straight up into the air. Ryouta, jumped onto some of the scroll's pages. Using them as a base to jump off of. He quickly placed his hands against the seals that were on them, a puff of smoke appeared, shortly after, weapons were spawned. Small scythes, small blades, shuriken, kunai, wind mills, giant shurikens. The whole jazz.

Ryouta, landed back on the ground, the weapons that were spawned, disappeared. "It's a pretty simple technique that I just used though." he stated.* - Mon Nov 23 00:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) took off the shuriken from his back, and stabbed it into the grounds surface. He stared at Akito. "You, can fuck off." he stated. A serious expression remained on his face.* - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What's the matter? - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) formed a quick set of hand signs, he started to mold chakra within his body's system. After finishing his hand signs, he grabbed the Giant Shuriken, having chakra flow through-out the giant shuriken. Ryouta then, threw it toward Akito's current position.* - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) ||
With a single hand motion, the giant shuriken, did a turn about. Going straight back toward Akito's current position. Ryouta on the other hand, used his reflexive abilities, and dodged the fireballs that came at him. By utilizing his speed, he tried to create some distance between the two of them. If the giant shuriken didn't get him this time, then he'd obviously have to resort to his last and only technique he had in his arsenal.

And that was the Twin Rising Dragons.* - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) ||
Ryouta's dodging, wasn't all that great. So once contact was established, he was obviously kicked in the face, which sent him flying across the field, slowly, he started to get up. Only to get kicked, once again in the stomach region. <Fuck!>. The amount of power this male has, was definately incredible. This gave Ryouta not much time, to manipulate his giant shuriken, considering he was just being bombarded by constant strikes.* - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) ||
Wasn't really lightning resistant, and so when he saw the lightning coming toward him, all that was playing through Ryouta's head was <How the fuck am I going to make it out of this, I don't even have enough time to place the two scrolls on the ground!> he thought to himself. And then thats when it came, the lightning current striked against Ryouta's feet. Causing an electrical current to flow all across his body's mass.

This caused Ryouta's body to shake violently. "Fuck!" was all he said. It seemed, the raiton technique, definately, did it's job. By now, if the raiton technique was to wear off, from Ryouta's body, smoke was obviously seen coming off of him. He wasn't preparing any techniques of the sort, the fact of the matter was that, the raiton technique was so intense. That it literally just about burnt him to a crisp probably.* - Thu Nov 26 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryouta(Assassin241) eye's widened greatly. The raiton related technique, made it's way straight toward Ryouta's being. Ryouta himself, was still recovering from the last raiton attack, which of course did a great deal of damage on him. Regardless, his body was still smoking. Soon as the raiton reached his feet once again, it literally shocked him all to fuck. 

The amount of pain he was about to feel, was definately unreal. His body, started to shake violently once again. Foam was starting to come out of his mouth. <This is how I die huh? Tch, I was barely noticed in Amegakure anyway, here I'm going to die in a foreign land.> he thought to himself. The sad truth, he was going to die in a foreign land, where no body knew of his existance, besides one person. And that was the Raikage, Eyiu. He even taught the Raikage one of his valuable jutsu's.

It was probably a mistake to do that, considering now, the Raikage's own shinobi decided to take Ryouta's life. His eyes, rolled to the back of his head. Now, only the whites of his eyes were visable. The foam coming out of his mouth, obviously stopped. Ryouta's body, rocked back and forth for awhile, then, he fell backward. His lifeless body hitting against the grounds surface. A little bit of dust, was collected around his body when he did this.

His vision, was already going to a blur before this, considering the amount of power the lightning jutsu had against his body. The male he just faced, was definately an incredible fighter. If anything, he would've nicknamed his foe "Zeus." considering how strong the man's lightning was. Ryouta, took his last breath of fresh air.

He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. No one in Amegakure would even know of his death. His body, now lyed lifelessly, on the ground's surface.* - Thu Nov 26 02:32:44 2015
