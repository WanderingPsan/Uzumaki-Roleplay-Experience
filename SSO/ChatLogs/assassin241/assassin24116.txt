Once Ushinawa got into position, Hideki's eyes formed his sharingan, but this time it was no longer one tomoe, it was two tomoe. Yes, it had developed after Hanabi's death, he was still going through forms of depression though. "Is there anyone else besides Orakuru that developed these eye's Ushi?" he stated rather blankly, as he ran forward, gripping the gunbai's hilt.* - Tue Sep 29 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) kept a rather blank expression on his face, as he saw Ushinawa reach for his katana, he side-stepped the attacks sent toward him, as a large white snake came out of his back, traveling through his arm sleeve and wrapping around Ushinawa, if he was captured by the technique, he would use his gunbai, and swing it toward Ushinawa's ribcage. Although, the technique regardless required zero handsigns. This was also the last technique Hanabi taught Hideki.* - Wed Sep 30 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Indeed Ushinawa's speed was rather impressive, the blade did strike his torso, to where blood leaked from that location, Hideki winced in pain, which caused him to actviate his snake lycan state, causing scales to appear through-out his body, their color of course being a maroon color. He jumped back, mainly to not get striked by the blade attack toward his gunbai. After he jumped back, he placed the gunbai on his back, and he unsheathed a katana.

This katana of course, was Hanabi's. Although there was a major flaw for him doing this, and that was that he barely had an experience in wielding a katana, but he wanted to give it a try. He rushed forth, as he finally replied to Ushinawa's comment from earlier. "What happened to your brother." his facial expression continued to remain blank as the battle continued to rage on.* - Wed Sep 30 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
This attack would've been clever none the less, but regardless, he side stepped the attack, but instead of trying to scratch Ushinawa with his blade, he instead he wielded a single handsign, as raiton chakra built up within his bodies system, and after it built up, he released the jutsu, as raiton chakra surged through-out his body, and since he was still within Ushinawa's range, he would hope it landed.

But there was still another factor to take into consideration, and that was Ushinawa's speed, it indeed was rather impressive, infact Ushinawa's speed was more or less on par with Mamoru.* - Wed Sep 30 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out a scroll, as it read on the side 'Tethys Will'. He opened it up, as he had the scroll face Ushinawa, Hideki basically had the scroll memorized by this point, although there was dry blood on the scroll, considering he killed Himura for such a scroll that contained the valuable information. "It says here that someone y the name of Violet, has taken the kiba blades." he stated rather blankly at Ushinawa.* - Wed Sep 30 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) rolled the scroll up and placed it back into his cloak, he deactivated his sharingan, and he also deactivated his snake lycan state. As Hideki himself started to pant from the spar they were having, a blood stain was easily visable near his torso area.* - Wed Sep 30 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I shall demonstrate this technique. - Wed Sep 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I see... he's demonstrating hand to hand combat. - Wed Sep 30 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head. "I see, I see." Hideki decided to wield a single handsign, and conjure a clone of himself aswell, but it was a bunshin. He focused on the clones throat, and he tried to mimic the technique Niza performed, but upon doing the technique he missed the clone's throat, and instead hit it's sternum. To which it phased through, considering bunshin no jutsu was more so an illusion than an actual replica.

He sighed, and looked at Niza. As he tried to perform the technique once more, he wielded a single handsign as another bunshin appeared beside him. Hideki focused on the bunshin's throat region, determined to hit it's throat, and so he quickly, with a swift motion of his hand, he attempted to bash the backside of his hand into the bunshin's throat, of course it phased through the bunshin's body once more. He placed his hand in his pocket as he looked back at Niza to see how well he performed. Considering the first time it was pretty bad.* - Wed Sep 30 02:45:07 2015

He heard about Tetsujin, and knew better than to just sit around and stare at him, quickly, he activated his snake lycan state, having the maroon colored scales appear through-out his body, his eyes however, forming black slits. Quickly and effectively, he attempted a dodge at the attack that was sent toward him, if successful he would try and gain some distance between the two.* - Wed Sep 30 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: The fuck is he doing here...? - Wed Sep 30 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Upon Tetsujin getting closer and attempting to indeed close the distance between the two, a large white snake came out of his back, and traveled through his arm sleeve, in an attempt to quickly and effectively wrap itself around Tetsujin's frame. If this was to be successful, a second large white snake would come out of his other arm sleeve and of course wrap itself around Tetsujin's frame, having -both- the snakes binding him. Trying to immobolize his movement.

"I realize I won't be able to escape." he stated rather aloud for Tetsujin to hear.* - Wed Sep 30 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Tetsujin's body crumbled into thousands of pieces? Hideki found this ability rather odd, but thousands of senbon surrounded around him, in less than a mere instant they striked toward his frame, It would've been to late for his white snakes to wrap around him, considering they too were already hit before they could reach him. So thus the large white snakes poofed into white smoke. 

Soon as the senbons striked his body, his eyes widened. Blood leaked from his body as he stood there frozen for a split second, and then his body toppled over. His face hitting against the grounds surface rather hard. Hideki coughed up some blood, as he lay on the ground, motionless. Tetsujin was definately right though, Hideki did -not- survive this encounter. And definately learned his lesson from getting to close to Tetsujin.* - Wed Sep 30 04:18:08 2015

Broke his ribcage, both of his femurs, and got bruises all over his body. He started to literally -crawl-, but carefully. He already fucked his ribcage, but upon crawling, he screamed in pain. Crawling just made things worse, so he just laid there. Waiting on something to happen.* - Wed Sep 30 04:43:44 2015

Was probably the one being poked, he had broken ribs, both of his femurs, and bruises all over his body. He groaned when he got poked. "No...." poking a broken body by this point was a bad idea.* - Wed Sep 30 04:56:32 2015

If there was pain scale between one and reguel. He'd probably rank it at reguel, considering this man literally -dragged- Hideki first, which caused more pain for him, he yelped.
