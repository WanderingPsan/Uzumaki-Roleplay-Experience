All this talk about happiness is bumming Hideki out, he lost his father in a game of dice when he made a bet with a couple of rouge shinobi. Hideki took out a regular pair of dice in his hand and examined it. It had dry blood on the six dotteed side. He placed the dice back in his pocket, and stared blankly out in the distance. Hideki was in deep thought by this point, wondering what would it be like with no wars, if everyone would get along with each other and not fight.

But those who breed love, can also breed hate.* - Mon Sep 14 03:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mmm...Maybe. - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) started to form several handsigns, lightning flickered between his fingers. And upon completeing the handsigns, Hideki slammed his palms on the ground. Lightning electricity crackled as it broke through the grounds surface and went straight toward Ushinawa's current position. Hideki then took out a kunai with an explosive tag that was seemingly wrapped around the hilt of the Kunai. Hideki then threw the kunai to the left of Ushinawa's position.

Hideki weilded another handsign as the kunai landed.* - Mon Sep 14 19:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: such tenacity.. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: much lightning. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: wow. - Mon Sep 14 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: That lightning, though.. - Mon Sep 14 19:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Ushinawa moved like a bullet.

Hideki used this time to exert his chakra through-out his body, as he shunshined away from the lightning jutsu that was used and shunshined to the explosive tagged kunai. Hideki firmly grasped the kunai and took it out of the ground. Hideki reached into his backpouch and took out a windmill shuriken. Hideki quickly threw the windmill shuriken toward Ushinawa's position, followed by throwing the kunai toward the left of Ushinawa's current position once more.

Hideki weilded another handsign, as the explosive tagged kunai hit the ground Hideki said "Explode." as the tag exploded.* - Mon Sep 14 19:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: That's his fire. - Mon Sep 14 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Will you teach me Alpha? - Mon Sep 14 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I know the basic Ninja art jutsus. - Mon Sep 14 19:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But I am no means proficient when it comes to the element. - Mon Sep 14 19:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) frowned.

What else could Hideki do? He was limited on his options, and he didn't have numerous techniques. Hideki started to form several handsigns, having lightning electricity once again flicker between his fingers, after completeing the handsigns he distanced both of his hands away from each other, as a ball of lightning appeared. Hideki then sent the Lightning Ball forward toward the last known position he saw Ushinawa. Which was infront of him.* - Mon Sep 14 19:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I need to go and train. - Mon Sep 14 19:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) felt like Ushinawa was toying with him from the start.

Hideki quickly turned toward Ushinawa's new position. Hideki's eyes widened when he saw the fireball jutsu come toward him. But he also noticed the fireball jutsu crashed into the ground. This probably caused debris to get flung, followed by some black smoke to cover as a smoke screen-- For a short moment. Which a short moment is all Hideki needed.

Hideki jumped into the smoke as he unsheathed his tanto as Hideki quickly activated his sharingan for a quick second, considering the black smoke screen was covering his position, this caused for a great tactic. Hideki used this to find where Ushinawa's current position was at, and after determining where it was. He advanced forward.* - Mon Sep 14 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Yumiko. Step forth. - Mon Sep 14 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: How goes your own training? - Mon Sep 14 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I don't expect you to simply be a toy for my own usage. - Mon Sep 14 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
By the time he went into the smoke screen, he already deactivated his sharingan, he only activated it for a quick second to determine where Ushinawa's position was at. But ya boy Hideki took the L for this one, he got hit in the head with the weapons and got knocked the fuck out. Word to Smokey.* - Mon Sep 14 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: .. - Mon Sep 14 20:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: In the spar saw Zetsumo behind you, so his line of sight was probably blocked. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or two. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How do you know of the Uchiha's power? - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Right then. Restrictions are simple. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Ushi? - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Yes. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How do I know this to be true? - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: You can ask him yourself, came to this camp with him. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Ushi, told me of this bounty. - Mon Sep 14 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Then it's probably from Kirigakure. - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: He told me all villages know. - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I don't know if Zetsumo knows of it or not.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Dam it... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Tell me.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Miss uh.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: It is getting hard to trust anyone...I cant do it dear brother... - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Aiyana.. - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Well.. Aiyana, do you wield the same power? - Mon Sep 14 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: What makes you assume as such?\ - Mon Sep 14 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: It's obvious of your concern for my well being when I used it in that spar. So I'm only assuming, what relation do you have with Ushi? - Mon Sep 14 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: He is only someone i hold very dear- - Mon Sep 14 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) felt Hanabi wrap her arm around him.

Hideki looked at Aiyana, his facial expression changed. He made eye contact with Aiyana, basically in a way to say that they would continue the conversation elsewhere. Hideki coughed slightly and said "I was asking her for jutsu..Since ya know, Ushi doesn't really want to notice me all that much." he stated looking at Hanabi.* - Mon Sep 14 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This chick is mad fast. - Mon Sep 14 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She is just as fast as Ushi. Wonder who'd win in a race. - Mon Sep 14 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shivered slighty.

As he nodded his head and said "Yeah."* - Mon Sep 14 20:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And is she going to do it? - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is your name girl? - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Already know the techniques. - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: These people make me sick.. - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well I still don't know her name. - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Aiyana... - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And you guy? - Mon Sep 14 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is your name? - Mon Sep 14 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: - - Mon Sep 14 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Didn't I already tell her my name? - Mon Sep 14 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hideki. - Mon Sep 14 21:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hanabi. - Mon Sep 14 21:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Can you summon snakes? - Mon Sep 14 21:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah I can summon them - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I can become one. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Or something close enough to one. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you able to teach it to me? - Mon Sep 14 21:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I could. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But you must prove to me that you are worthy enough. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: There is a theme here. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Prove to me. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Show me - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How can I prove to you? I guess.. - Mon Sep 14 21:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I don't like it...So much room for betrayal... - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: If you'll excuse me.. - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 14 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ..Lord help me. - Mon Sep 14 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That is for me to know and you to casually stumble upon~ - Mon Sep 14 21:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...I'm not good with trick questions. - Mon Sep 14 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well that is part of the requirements - Mon Sep 14 21:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*Sigh*> Trick questions? - Mon Sep 14 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Also zeno needs to be on which is the major number one requirement -omit- - Mon Sep 14 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I will tell you this. - Mon Sep 14 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You need to think like a snake. - Mon Sep 14 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: To much work... - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Take that information and do with it what you think it means. - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I just want to summon things.. - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: In the meantime~ - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm.. - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ..Oh god no.. - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) felt her scaly finger go down his chest, the mucus that was coming off of it was unreal. Hideki gulped and said "Well, for right now it's my only elemental affinity I know... I also learned two new non elemental jutsu." he stated looking at Hanabi.* - Mon Sep 14 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) froze up.

Shit was getting real creepy by this point. But he had to keep his composure. Hideki spoke up and said "Well, Shunshin and Manipulative Shuriken." he stated looking into Hanabi's eyes, which resembled much of a snake maybe??* - Mon Sep 14 21:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) smirked.

Something obviously changed his demeanor, as he grabbed Hanabi's hand and gently motioned it back down toward her sides. Hideki then said "I suggest a trade then, a jutsu for a jutsu, yes?" he stated, his black eyes looking Hanabi up and down, as he made eye contact with her once more.* - Mon Sep 14 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This chick is really creepy, though she may have some decent jutsu up her sleeve. - Mon Sep 14 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Hanabi, as Hideki's facial expression went to a blank expression.

"I'm already going on a path of my own. I just want that summon from you." he stated looking at her very large fangs. Yes it was true, his path was already carved long ago, and he plans on going on that same path regardless of what happens.* - Mon Sep 14 21:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed her arm.

As Hideki then spoke up "Then how can I prove it to you? Hm? You're here stalling trying to get one of my jutsu's, when you could've told me already what I had to prove to you." he stated smirking once more at Hanabi.* - Mon Sep 14 21:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: That kid always stares at people. - Mon Sep 14 21:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: xD - Mon Sep 14 21:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) lost his grip on the woman.

Hideki continued to look at the snake charmer as his cheek was caressed. Hideki raised an eyebrow as he then said "Then I'd like it if you refrained from touching me." he stated looking at the snake charmer as lightning electricity started to flicker from the outside of his body. Hideki then said "What about that spar we were to have?" he asked with a smirk, as lightning electricity finally erupted from his body, and since she was in close proximity. It may have reached her, but then again she was fast. So she could dodge it with ease. * - Mon Sep 14 21:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Hanabi, hate was obviously present in his dark eyes.

Hideki crouched and said "Don't take it personal. I'll give you the jutsu once I have it mastered." he stated looking at Hanabi. He pinched her cheeks and said "Nice chat, maybe next time we can have a spar or something." he stated with a smirk. But he also noticed she was having a hard time breathing. Does she have asthma? Hideki spoke up again "Uh...Do you have Asthma or something like that?" he asked curious.* - Mon Sep 14 22:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

Being ignored at it's finest as it would seem. He placed his hands in his pockets as he then says "Chill, I'm sure the raiton technique will wear out. And you'll probably have your pay back soon enough." he stated with cold eyes piercing her soul. Hideki then spoke again "After all, I'm sure Amai would want her pay back wouldnt she.." he stated taking out a kunai and spinning the hilt of it around his finger. Hideki then stabbed the kunai near Hanabi's face, it didn't cut her or anything. Hideki sighed once more, as he took the kunai out of the ground and placed it back into his kunai holister.

Hideki then gave a friendly smile and said "How was that? Did it seem threatening enough?" he chuckled as he then said "I'll wait for the effects to wear down." he stated being completely serious.* - Mon Sep 14 22:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fair is fair, this was all a joke. I hope she realizes that. - Mon Sep 14 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Probably not. - Mon Sep 14 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) offered his hand toward her.

"I know I will." * - Mon Sep 14 22:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) felt his hand get slapped. He placed his hands in his pockets.

He repeated a phrase that was told to him by his father, it replayed in his head "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." Hideki then took out a bottled water and hovered it over Hanabi was he then said "You seem thirsty." by this point Hideki was just trying to be friendly, it was all an act, to merely entertain himself. After all he was being ignored by everyone in the group, he had to find something to do.* - Mon Sep 14 22:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed his hand on her shoulder and smiled at her and said "Good." as he turned his heels to go down south until he spotted Hanabi and sighed. He then said "I'm assuming you want your pay back?" he asked curious.* - Tue Sep 15 00:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed le misson and went to go do that shiz.* - Tue Sep 15 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked infront of Paine's excerise while frantically throwing his arms in the air screaming "SENPAI NO" omit* - Tue Sep 15 19:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly went to the storage area, opening the door and seeing all the weapons scattered across the area. It certainly did look like someone unleashed an earthquake in here. Hideki sighed as he went and carefully picked up a giant shuriken, he quickly examined it, making sure there wasn't any cracks in it and also making sure there wasn't any rust on it or anything like that, cause who would want a rusted weapon? After examining it, Hideki placed it on top of a wooden table.

He then walked off to grab more weapons, which seemingly the next weapon he found was a large scythe. He grabbed it and swung it in a down-ward motion. It stuck itself into the wooden flooring, making it hard to get it unstuck. Hideki pulled with all of his might--And that's when he broke the scythe, having the bladed portion stick into the roof, and the base of the weapon to fly in the air and land behind Hideki. Hideki sighed as he went and grabbed the staff, atleast now its considered a staff since the bladed portion got stuck on the roof. To which Hideki jumped and grabbed it, and once he grabbed it, he tossed the broken pieces into a broken pile to burn later.

Hideki then saw some kunai scattered across the floor boards, he quickly went about and grabbed the weapons and placing them into a box. He also went about collecting the senbons, considering they were also scattered about the place, Hideki sighed and talked to himself for a breif moment "Why did I get stuck with a simple misson." to be honest, he'd rather have a simple misson than a fighting misson. Considering he was somewhat a Pacifist. Just depends on what day.

Hideki then went and closed the box slowly, grabbing some tape and taping down the box preventing it from getting opened unless someone was to rip open the box. He carefully lifted the box and walked very carefully to the wooden table, as he placed it on the wooden table he could hear the weapons rattling against each other. Hideki looked down at his feet and saw two windmill shurikens. He bent down and grabbed it, examined it to make sure it wasn't cracked or rusted. And once he confirmed that it wasn't he placed it on the long wooden table aswell.

Hideki once more traveled around the storage area, looking for more weapons that were pushed down from said earthquake. And he found tons of explosive tags and shuriken that were on the floor. He carefully grabbed another box and placed it on the ground, and grabbed the explosive tags and carefully placed them inside the box, followed by the shurikens next. After he did that, he tapped the box down once more, and carefully picked it up and took it to the long wooden table.

Hideki then wiped the sweat that was on his face and said "Finally... Done." he quickly exited the storage room and locked the door, he then headed out and leaned against one of the fences, crossing his arms and staring off into space.* - Tue Sep 15 19:38:14 2015
