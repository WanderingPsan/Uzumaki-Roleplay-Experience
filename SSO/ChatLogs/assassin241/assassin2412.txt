<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

He looked in his pockets, and saw that he was a broke boy. He looked at the scroll that was given to him by Ushi. And placed it back into his pocket as he then says "I'll be down south if anyone wants to train, or whatever." he went down south after speaking.* - Sat Sep 12 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Its odd because I almost took you for a woman. - Sat Sep 12 21:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But isnt it a little weird to say that in front of a little boy? - Sat Sep 12 21:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Mmm. . . Talk is cheap. - Sat Sep 12 21:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) heard what Zetsumo said and spoke up once more before leaving "I'll think about it." he stated as he left.* - Sat Sep 12 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out the scroll that was given to him by Ushi, as he was reading the scrolls contents, it was easily identified as a C rank jutsu scroll. The more scrolls the merrier for Hideki. He needed some techniques. Hideki was a Pacifist after all, he wasn't about fighting, but lately the way the things have been going there has been a lot of wars. And he still wonders if peace is still within his reach. He's seen a lot of things happen lately, people fighting over girls, money, even for their position in power. 

Hideki slowly sat against one of the trees, and dropped the scroll on his lap as he looked at his palms. Then he looked up toward the sky, but the tree's branches and leaves were in the way. One leaf in particular slowly dropped onto his right palm. Hideki then said to himself "If there is such thing as peace. I will acheive it." he stated, as he closed his right palm, crushing the leaf entirely.

Hideki then went back to reading the scroll's contents that contained the jutsu for the Lightning Ball technique, the technique itself seemed pretty powerful for a C rank jutsu. You can either create a ball of lightning in your hands, or chakra flow it through your weapon. Seemed easy enough, after a long while of reading he quickly raveled up the scroll and walked back to give it to Ushi.

He scratched the top of his head, as he turned his heels to walk back toward the tree that he was leaning against. He then thought to himself "I don't think it would be wise to go back there with those girls arguing.." He then shrugged his shoulders as he placed the jutsu scroll back into his left pocket. Hideki then started to perform the handsigns for the required technique he was going to perform. And that was the Earth Flash technique.

After performing the handsigns and completeing them, lightning flickered across his hands as he slammed his palms on the ground. The lightning crackled as it was sent down south-ward, breaking the grounds surface it would seem. As he finished using the technique, he placed his hands back into his pockets as he then sighed slowly and said to himself "Well...I can feel the drain being less and less.."* - Sat Sep 12 21:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mmm, I'm not that good in genjutsu, but that could work to. Do you have anything else? - Sun Sep 13 21:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Alright then, watch closely. This technique is not difficult. - Sun Sep 13 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 13 21:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Not many of us here - Sun Sep 13 21:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I wonder where the others are - Sun Sep 13 21:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: War. - Sun Sep 13 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Over in kirigakure. - Sun Sep 13 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What? - Sun Sep 13 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yep. - Sun Sep 13 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head.

Shin seemed to know what he was talking about, considering Hideki himself recently learned suimen from Kirigakure, the village that they are at war against at this very moment. Hideki wielded a single handsign, having his chakra flare up around him, having it be a noticeable blue aura. The blue aura of course faded, Hideki stopped wielding the handsign, and let his hands fall to his sides. Hideki then had chakra coating his feet.

Hideki quickly looked around an area he could possibly shunshin too, there wasn't really that many obstacles in his way, just a couple of tree's here and there. Maybe he could shunshin ontop of a branch? Yeah, Hideki would probably do that, what's the worst that could happen? Hideki's body suddenly vanished as he tried using the technique, but when he used it he of course appeared ontop of the tree's branch. It of course was sturdy enough to support his own weight.

The only bad thing is, is that this was his first time using the technique, so when he used it he got really dizzy and lost his footing, falling off of the branch and falling on his ass on the grounds solid surface. Hideki rubbed his ass and said to himself "...Ow..." As he got up and walked over toward Shin and said "I did it right... Right?"* - Sun Sep 13 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You seem to have the just of it. - Sun Sep 13 21:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cool. - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Just practice and the daze-like effect will go away - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Eventually - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Or at least dim down - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Thanks. - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And if they are at war\ - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Why are we here!? - Sun Sep 13 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Some went. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Some didn't. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: As nmuch as I'd like to go with them, it may be best to stay here - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: They might try to attack us - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Things will probably get rough. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Rough how? - Sun Sep 13 21:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: For them at the battle front. - Sun Sep 13 21:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Indeed - Sun Sep 13 21:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Maybe we should . . . - Sun Sep 13 21:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It depends. - Sun Sep 13 21:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Even with genjutsu, if you have someone who can Kai it. It will be just useless. - Sun Sep 13 21:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Som,eone like myself or Beth - Sun Sep 13 21:43:40 2015
