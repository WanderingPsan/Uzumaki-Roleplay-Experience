<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I have to thank Kuro...If it wasn't for his words all those months ago, I probably would still be on the path of destruction. - Mon Oct 19 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Yeah. - Mon Oct 19 02:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head, with that being settled. He looked toward Kuro, he deactivated his sharingan, his eyes returning to regular black. "I thank you Kuro." he stated this and started to walk off, Mai would probably follow shortly after if she wanted to.* - Mon Oct 19 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You need to score top tier scores in examinations and psychological screenings. - Mon Oct 19 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) pulled up to the scene, seeing the nigga Tetsujin. Hideki stares as the man.

"Been awhile, Tetsujin.* - Mon Oct 19 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) says: I'm not here to talk to you, worm. - Mon Oct 19 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) says: Scram. - Mon Oct 19 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Ain't got to tell me twice. - Mon Oct 19 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) grabbed Mai and got the hell out as Tetsujin said, Ya boy already faced Tetsujin first hand last time in Kumogakure, and that led to yo boy being in a wheel chair.* - Mon Oct 19 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsujin(KenichiMD) says: My name is Tetsujin. - Mon Oct 19 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) pulled up to a spot in the desert that was isolated as fuck.* - Mon Oct 19 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um... - Mon Oct 19 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...Is he...a bad guy? - Mon Oct 19 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Eh, it depends. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: On? - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: In someone elses eyes, he could be doing something good, or he could be doing something bad. Just depends. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: He also ate a large blade in one bite. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: It was hardcore as fuck.. - Mon Oct 19 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...I guess that makes sense. - Mon Oct 19 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 19 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) thinks: Smart and strong... - Mon Oct 19 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) thinks: Maybe wise fits better...We'll see. - Mon Oct 19 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked down at himself. Noticing he wasn't wearing a shirt underneith his Kimono, so it looked like a V-Neck shirt. <...Shit...> however, he took out a bottle of water, and drank out of it. After he was finished drinking from it, he threw it to the side. No witnesses fam. * - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I need a shirt. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I was ruined from Tetsujin almost killing me last time. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Pick up that paper. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And use it for me. - Mon Oct 19 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Mhm...Katon. - Mon Oct 19 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 19 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Looks like I can teach you after all. - Mon Oct 19 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) thinks: Good...I chose correctly. - Mon Oct 19 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm.. - Mon Oct 19 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright, let's get going then. - Mon Oct 19 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) motioned for Mai to follow behind Hideki, they were going to travel away from Sunagakure no Sato. Hideki felt better working alone, not having to worry about people's safety, but it seemed like he was slowly turning into Ushinawa, except he was an emotionally unstable person, he needed to fix that, however he also knows that people would probably figure out that his eyes hold a speical power. Thank god Fujitora placed a seal on him for his eyes, he felt grateful that his own cousin was looking out for him, even when he wasn't around.

He missed a lot of people however, Niza, Hanabi, Mariana, Ushinawa, Seisuke, and most of all he missed his nephew Heiwa. He'd probably visit some time, but not yet however. He wanted to get some training done before they went to Konohagakure no Sato.* - Mon Oct 19 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She makes cat noises.. - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What the fuck. - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Could she be a lycanthrope? - Mon Oct 19 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What fire techniques do you know? - Mon Oct 19 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ....None. - Mon Oct 19 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) nodded his head. Hideki quickly started to form handsigns, however they were slow in this process, mainly so Mai could pay attention to his handsigns as he formed them, he gather up katon chakra within his bodies system, as he opened his maw and out came a stream of fire, seemingly it formed a firey circle around the vast area, that soon died down after a couple of minutes. Hideki then looked over toward Mai. "This jutsu is called Ninja Art: Fire Run. It's a low ranking technique, however it cane prove useful." he stated this as he continued to make eye contact with the woman.* - Mon Oct 19 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sat down on the grounds surface. Seemingly he didn't care that Mai belched. He just sat down and gazed up at the sky, sighing when he did this.* - Mon Oct 19 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I am from Sunagakure. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: You are? - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yep. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out his sunagakure headband from a couple months ago before he went traveling to be apart of the group Kenryoku.* - Mon Oct 19 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Strange...You don't seem like the rest. - Mon Oct 19 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I travel a lot. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I figured. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was a Sunagakure Genin, then a Kumogakure Jounin.....Then I became the Hokage of Konohagakure, to where I left. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And now I travel the world. - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...Ho...kage? You were...the Hokage? - Mon Oct 19 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) magically takes out the hokage hat, puts it on, then magically puts it away.* - Mon Oct 19 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Assassin241) says: Yep.. - Mon Oct 19 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...That's...Impressive. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Eh.... - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was suppose to be the Raikage....But they didn't want an emotionally unstable shinobi as their leader. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So I left. - Mon Oct 19 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh...I'm sorry to hear that...You don't seem emotionally unstable to me. - Mon Oct 19 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I've been through a lot....Uh....What's your name? I never caught it. - Mon Oct 19 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh. My name is Mai. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nice to meet you, name's Hideki. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Nice to meet you too Hideki. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But anyway, I've been through a lot. Seen a lot of deaths. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Been pretty hard. - Mon Oct 19 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got up, and started to walk off and out of the desert terrain, they were seemingly going into a foresty area by now. Which ment they might have been close to Genjigakure aswell, which ment Edge would be near by. That always ment something bad, and he wanted to avoid bad people for now. He wasn't strong enough yet to face off against Edge. He needed more time to train, and that's what he was going to do. And Mai seemed like she would need some training too.

She seemed to lack some techniques, to where Hideki will teach her majority of what he knows.* - Mon Oct 19 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped near the river, and sat down on the grounds surface once more. He turned around to look at the river, his faces reflection was reflected off of the river's flow. He turned back around, staring at the tree's now. Wondering what to do with his life, seeing it has chaned over the past couple months in a drastic way.* - Mon Oct 19 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Something wrong...? - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I'm...Just not a big fan of water. That's all. - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Come to think of it, you seem to resemble a cat.. - Mon Oct 19 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You make cat noises....And not a fan of water. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you a lycanthrope? - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: A lycanthrope? No. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: They're just some habits I picked up... - Mon Oct 19 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed, as he turned around once more, and placed his head into the water, after a couple of seconds, he took his head out of the water, as his hair now was dripping wet with water. He needed to wake up, as he ruffled up his hair just a tad bit, as he continued to stare at the tree in the distance.* - Mon Oct 19 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: This is very tame...compared to Sunagakure. - Mon Oct 19 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's not as hot. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 19 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So, tell me a bit about yourself, Mai. - Mon Oct 19 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um...Well there's not much to be honest... - Mon Oct 19 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nothing interesting? - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No boyfriends? No Friends? No Family? - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, I see. - Mon Oct 19 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Any unique abilities? - Mon Oct 19 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Um... - Mon Oct 19 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I can...use my nails for jutsu...Does that...count? - Mon Oct 19 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Of course. - Mon Oct 19 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Ah...Alright then. - Mon Oct 19 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) formed a single handsign, as he created a shadow clone that would scout the general area for them, Hideki decided he needed to get some sleep. He laid down on the grassy surface. He looked up at the sky, and wondered what Ushinawa would do if he was in Hideki's position, Ushinawa probably would scowl at Hideki if he was still alive.* - Mon Oct 19 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: By the way. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Hm? - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you don't feel safe around me, or in this general area. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Up north will be Konohagakure. - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: I think I'll be fine with you. - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 19 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) slowly closed his eyes, and started to doze off to sleep. He needed to get some rest after what happened today.* - Mon Oct 19 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) pulled up to the scene.* - Mon Oct 19 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Mon Oct 19 19:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared at Violet, looking her up and down. He closed his eyes and slowly reopened them as he activated his three tomoe sharingan. He went to reach for his katana, which was still tooken away from him by Rymei, who in return did not return his blade back. But instead he reached down into his holister and took out a kunai, and rushed forward.* - Mon Oct 19 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly and effectively dodged the young woman's strikes, he instead appeared to her side, as a large white snake erupted from his back, traveling through his arm sleeve and wrapping around Violet's body, holding her in place as Hideki tried to place the kunai he had in his hand near Violet's throat. It of course was close to her neck as he once again examined her frame, before his shifted his gaze back to Violet's facial features.* - Mon Oct 19 20:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eyes widened greatly, as he had to utilize his shunshin ability, and quickly shunshined away from Violet's attacking range. <...If I didn't have sharingan on just now, that would have indeed cut me in half..> Hideki placed the kunai he had in his hands back into his holister. Then he placed his hands in his kimono pockets, and bowed respectfully toward Violet. "Nice spar Violet. You are strong, that was a good enough spar for me." he stated this with a smile on his face.* - Mon Oct 19 20:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sat down on top of the moutain, that seemingly had a waterfall. He looked out into the distance of Kirigakure no Sato. It seemed like a peaceful village for now, considering it -does- have a lot of rumble. Konohagakure was worse. He looked at the river, wondering what Ushinawa, Niza, Hanabi, Mariana, and Seisuke are doing right now.* - Tue Oct 20 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared down below, looking at the river below him. Was it truely worth trying to attack the Gezo by this point? Was it truely worth trying to find out more about his eyes? What they hold? What they could possibly do? He looked at his own hands. He's only killed two people in his whole life, and that was Himura and Sabo. Sabo was a friend of his aswell, but his fascination for his eyes that were called the 'rinnegan' as Sanoke called it got the better of him. And he still can't forget about his other friends. 

Mamoru, and Kuro. He wonders what both of them are doing right now, wondering if they too are training as hard as he was, or if they were just traveling around the world. If there was one person he misses right now that would be Heiwa more than likely, he hasn't seen his nephew in a long while, and wonders if he hates his guts for leaving him so often. Not even sending him a messenger bird either. What kind of Uncle was Hideki by this point? Probably a shitty one. He was an emotionally unstable mess, so much has gone wrong, so much that he couldn't even fix himself.

He just hopes Fujitora is having a good time right now, being a retired shinobi he is. He had high hopes for Fujitora, Hideki found it quite funny however. He chuckled to himself slightly. "...Fujitora...Heh....Still trying to get the same eyes as mine huh..Well....One day you will friend...One day you will.." he stated this as he looked down and saw the river below. Considering the distance given, if he was to jump down right now he could probably kill himself from the sheer impact it would have on his body.

However, suicide was the pussy way out. He got up from sitting down near the ledge and started to walk away from it. This time standing near the water that was ontop of the moutain by this point. Hands remained in his Kimono pockets, he inhaled and exhaled slowly thinking about all the times he had Ushinawa holding Hideki back from killing someone, or at the time when Hideki and Ushinawa had there very last spar......Before he passed away....Damn that really hit Hideki hard.

If there was one thing he misses right now, it would be Hanabi's blade. He missed having it mainly because it was a memento givin to him, he also kind of regrets giving Ortho that Gunabi now, considering it too was a memento that was given to him by Ushinawa. What else was he to do now by this point? Just continue on living the life of a nobody? No one even wants to go near Hideki with the eyes he has now. No one.

Hideki stared at the water infront of him, looking at his own reflection.* - Tue Oct 20 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) closed his eyes and reopened them slowly, activating his three tomoe sharingan. He stared at the water, looking at his own reflection, staring directly into his own eyes via the reflection the water gave. He shook his head. "Tch....At what cost Ushi....At what cost.."* - Tue Oct 20 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to stare at his own reflection that the water gave of.* - Tue Oct 20 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) remained silent, as he looked over toward Index. He spoke toward him, but before doing so he sighed. ".......Index........Do me this favor, please..." he stated this as he looked at Index, his three tomoe sharingan of course was still active.* - Tue Oct 20 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) tossed a kunai toward Index.

"I've lived a long life of regret, pain, and sorrow Index. I've seen things with these eyes, things that shouldn't have been seen." he paused for a second. "I want you....To kill me Index. These eyes are powerful, there visual prowess is unstoppable in the right hands. However I do not wish to partake in this any longer. This game of life or death....I want you to kill me Index. I want to die a shinobi's death." * - Tue Oct 20 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head.

"This is no joke Index. I want you to kill me, here and now....I've lost so much....So much Index.." he stated this as a tear started to roll down his right eye. He quickly wiped it off, and continued to stare directly at Index. "These eyes Index, can see a lot of things....There next level...Is even greater." he stated this as he looked down at his hands, the once known Pacifist Hideki was no longer a pacifist. He returned his gaze back to Index, awaiting his reply.* - Tue Oct 20 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sprinted forward, -deliberately- running into the kunai, as it stabbed into his body. Blood coming out of his mouth as he did this. He gasped for breath as this happened. "Index......I...bequeath to you......My right eye sharingan....And left eye....Sharingan..." he stated this as he reached into his right eye socket with his right hand, and took out his right eye sharingan that had three tomoe activated. Then with his other hand he reached over and took out his left eye sharingan with his left hand.

Blood was coughed up, some of it even landing ontop Index's clothing. As blood continued to seep from his body that was impaled by the kunai in Index's hand. Hideki continued to gasp for breath as the life was slowly being drained out of him. "Heh....Grow up to be...Strong Index...Grow Up...To be strong.." This would probably be Hideki's last and final words to Index, a now blind Hideki, dying in a foreign land.

Let it be known, that the last wielder of the Sharingan, has now passed. Hideki's lifeless body, hit against the grounds hard surface. As blood continued to seep outside of his body.* - Tue Oct 20 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) took out the scroll that was given to him by Sanoke, and upon unraveling the scroll it read something about a mud flowing river that can be conjured out of his mouth. That seemed kind of disgusting and weird, yet it interested him in a way...Not in a sick way though that's kind of fucked up. But anywho, he continued to read from the scrolls contents carefully observing the words as his eyes read on.* - Tue Oct 20 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) body got rejuvenated by Sanoke's technique. He felt different, more energy was somehow given to him. Arata nodded his head as he performed the technique, doing the required handsigns for it aswell. Building up and molding doton chakra within his bodies system, and after he finished the handsigns, he opened his maw as a river full of mud came out of his mouth and rushing forward. It wasn't all that great considering it was still at new. He then looked at Sanoke shortly after.

"Does that answer your question?" he asked.* - Tue Oct 20 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) yawned.

"So, what do you do for fun Mr. Sanoke sir?" he asked casually as he went to stand near him.* - Tue Oct 20 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) felt like he was sinking into something. And when he looked down at the ground it seemed as if he was sinking in quick sand. However, he kept his cool. He continued to keep a casual conversation. "Uh........Ya know....Uh.." he was kind of worried about his own well being, and well. Considering he was sinking in quick sand he had to think of something to say to Sanoke quickly. However he wondered why Sanoke didn't see the quick sand.

"I like to train and get stronger, I recently learned how to use my sword effeciently in batte."  he stated this as he continued to sink into the sand itself. A worried expression remained on his face as his body seemed to be getting eaten by the sand he very much stood on.* - Tue Oct 20 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: What the shit is this.. - Tue Oct 20 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly grabbed onto Sanoke's hand. Grasping the males hand in hopes that Sanoke would take Arata out of the quicksand. "Yo help ya boy!" he shouted.  He hoped this wasn't a trick Sanoke pulled, and if it was, ya boy would probably laugh.* - Tue Oct 20 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) blinked as he looked down to see that he wasn't at all sinking. He laughed.

"Yooo! That was a good prank yo!" He went to high five Sanoke in his successful prank.* - Tue Oct 20 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) quickly utilized his speed, for a genin that recently just graduated the academy, he was rather fast, fast for his rank atleast. And once he made it toward Izanami, he'd try and strike at one of her charka pathway's, however he held back when he striked at Izanami. If he was to actually put force into his strikes, he could possibly kill Izanami, and he didn't want that.* - Wed Oct 21 00:40:57 2015

He hoped that would dispose of it. And once he did that, he'd continue his assault against Izanami, he once again went and striked at one of her tenketsu, but two of the strikes went toward her upper left shoulder, and the other strike went toward her upper right shoulder.

And if it was a successful strike, he'd seal her ability to flow chakra toward that area.* - Wed Oct 21 00:47:47 2015

Thank you for taking the time to spar against me....Uh...What's your name?" he asked rather curious, not catching her name the first time.* - Wed Oct 21 00:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) went over and used his gentle fist ability and unsealed  one of Izanami's tenketsu that he striked earlier in battle. His veins that were buldging toward his eyes, slowly faded away as he deactivated his byakugan. "You didn't do to bad Izanami." he stated this with a smile and ruffled her hair a bit. He crouched down, and extended his pinky toward Izanami. "How about we make a pinky promise? Hm?"* - Wed Oct 21 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct 21 00:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) smiled as they locked pinkys.

After that, he placed his hands in his pockets and started to walk out of the area. "If you need anything Izanami, just let me know." he stated as he left the area.* - Wed Oct 21 01:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) unraveled the scroll given to him by Trilliam, he quickly scanned the scrolls contents, reading the scroll throughly. It stated that it could flow doton based chakra through your blade, giving it some devastating power. This gave Arata an idea that he could use for a custom technique. However, he'd have to practice it first before he could actually implement it into his own fighting stlye. He shook his head, he had to focus on reading the scroll that was infront of him right now.

Arata continued to read the scroll, nodding his head here and there being satisfied that the ability of this technique was rather great. And could prove very useful in certain situations. After he was done reading the scroll, he rolled it up and placed it back into his back pocket. He then turned on his heels to go to the weapons shop and get himself some weapons. Ya boy needed some, how is he a ninja and not have any weapons?

He facepalmed after asking himself that question, but continued on his way to the weapon shop regardless to buy some weapons.* - Wed Oct 21 01:49:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) nodded.

Shortly after he followed behind Koji and Ai.* - Wed Oct 21 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Ravenscrotum. - Wed Oct 21 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Who's Ravenscrotum.. - Wed Oct 21 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) nodded his head as he looked at Koji.

"Well, I specialize in taijutsu and a bit of ninjutsu." he stated this as his pure white eyes continued to make eye contact with the man.* - Wed Oct 21 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: ^ - Wed Oct 21 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: -omit - Wed Oct 21 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) had veins buldging toward his eyes. He too could see the bandits around the surrounding area. He looked over toward Koji, he smirked and said something to him, low enough for Koji to hear, as by this point he was near him. "Yo, so who do you want? The one's on the left, or the ones on the right?" he asked curious to what his answer would be. He also unsheathed his Katana, getting ready for combat.* - Wed Oct 21 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Take the left.. Be quiick the assasin hasn't shown himseldf yet, and a few men haven't shown themselves.. - Wed Oct 21 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Right. - Wed Oct 21 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Ill be able to do both at the same time soon lol - Wed Oct 21 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: -omit that - Wed Oct 21 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) saw that Koji already went to work and fucked up a few bandits in the area, however his byakugan was activated, he indeed saw the raw power Koji held within him. But Arata didn't want to just stay on the sideline, he went ahead and sprinted forth, going for the first bandit he had in his sights, quickly Arata did a down-ward slash with his Katana, cutting at the man's chest, but he didn't stop there, after doing the down-ward slash, he extended his katana forward, toward the first bandit's chest. Stabbing it into the man's heart.

Next was the last Two bandits he had in his sights, he sheathed his Katana, and quickly using his Gentle Fist stance, he disposed of his enemies. Striking there chakra pathways first, then he did an open palmed strike on the second bandits chest, of course trying to do the same thing Koji did to the other bandits. The third bandit, however risked the same fate. After Arata was done with that, he ran behind Koji.

He then stopped next to him, he used his byakugan's ability of 360 degree vision to determine if there was anymore bandits around there general area, and if not. He'd continue to watch Koji's flank.* - Wed Oct 21 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arata(Assassin241) got to work, he went toward the last remaining bandits that he had to dispose of, quickly he went to his first targeted bandit, using his gentle fist fighting style, he quickly disrupted the man's chakra pathway systems, and then once he was doing that, he quickly used a open palm strike right on the man's chest region, and once it hit, he'd hope it would kill the bandit. Arata then went toward his next target.

Arata, quickly unsheathed his katana, and flowed doton based chakra through-out the blade, and once he saw his next intended target, which was bandit number two, he quickly did a horizontal slash on the man's chest region, then he decided to chop off the man's head. Having blood spill infront of Arata, even got blood on his favorite shirt. He sighed shortly after, it was his favorite shirt.

Arata then sheathed his katana, he sprinted toward the last Bandit, and used an open palm strike right on the bandit's chest, trying to stop his heart and once again hoping it killed the man. And once they were done with that, he walked back to the village with his teammates. If there was a celebration or not, Arata didn't really care for it.

He just wanted to get home to Sunagakure and chill.* - Wed Oct 21 05:21:42 2015
