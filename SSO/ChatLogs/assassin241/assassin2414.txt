<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked a certain distance away from Ushi and Mariana.

Hideki then bared a serious expression as he then said "We'll spar right here." he stated, his souless eyes piercing Hanabi. As he took out two shuriken, one was in his left hand, the other in his right hand.* - Wed Sep 16 18:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Its gonna be fun for both of us~ - Wed Sep 16 18:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: And then turn whatever's left into ash. - Wed Sep 16 18:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If I threw my shurikens, would they still make it to you, since you're charging forward at me? - Wed Sep 16 18:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Wed Sep 16 18:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) dropped his shuriken.

Shit hit the fan as the snakes coiled around his body, Hideki just kind of, stood there and stared at Hanabi. He sighed and said "Well, looks like you won. Again." he stated.* - Wed Sep 16 18:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oi, Oi. - Wed Sep 16 18:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) shook his head in an attempt to remove her finger from his lips. But he did hear Zetsumo's comment, which hit him hard. But he was right, he coudn't even dodge one technique from Hanabi, Hideki would speak, unless her finger was still pressed against his lips. Then he wouldn't talk at all. That shit nasty.* - Wed Sep 16 18:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I could try a headbutt. - Wed Sep 16 18:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) had no idea what just happened. But Hanabi was standing there like a vegetable. But he was still being binded as Hideki's lips were still being pressed by her finger, to which he tried shaking his head and having her finger trail off of his lips. One thing is for sure, he wants -nothing- to do with this bitches summonings now* - Wed Sep 16 18:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) wiped his mouth from that slimey shit.

Hideki was slightly confused, and raised an eyebrow. All this conflict over a jutsu? What jutsu does Hideki have that Hanabi wants? Hideki then spoke up and said "What jutsu exactly do you want from me?" he asked slightly confused.* - Wed Sep 16 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I owe you one Aiyana. - Wed Sep 16 19:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) woke up rubbing his eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 19:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked down south as he then said "If anyone needs me. I'll be down here." he stated.* - Wed Sep 16 19:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went to a nearby tree, and leaned against it.

Hideki then quickly activated his sharingan, scanning the area before deactivating it. Hideki sighed as he then said to himself "...Why is it the doujutsu uers that are getting hunted down.." he stated to himself. As he looked down at his hands, he opened and closed them slowly as he continued to lean against the tree. He would one day prove to them that he wasn't weak.* - Wed Sep 16 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: u lonely? - Wed Sep 16 20:16:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What kind of spar.. - Wed Sep 16 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) used his shunshin ability to body flicker away from said tree, and pretty much away from the area of effect. His eyes, continued to scan the two of them, seeing of course there chakra levels and such. Except for Ushinawa's, he could see a pinkish aura on his eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) squinted.* - Wed Sep 16 21:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .  . . You okay..? - Wed Sep 16 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) deactivated his sharingan.* - Wed Sep 16 21:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) slowly walked back.* - Wed Sep 16 21:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) was grabbed.

Hideki sighed and said "Hi...What do you want.." he stated unamused. * - Wed Sep 16 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Ya boy jumped when his ass got grabbed.

He looked at Hanabi and squinted and said "What the fuck is wrong with you." this chick was confusing as hell.* - Wed Sep 16 21:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Why is she so intrigued by this one? - Wed Sep 16 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Why me. - Wed Sep 16 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: WHY ME. - Wed Sep 16 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Senpai has noticed him. - Wed Sep 16 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: Too bad senpai doesnt notice you -omit- - Wed Sep 16 21:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped squinting and made eye contact with this woman.

Hideki then said "Why me though? I have nothing that could possibly interest you. I have basic techniques, and my elemental affinity is different from yours. Not to mention you beat me in every spar." he stated still confused as to why this woman is bothering Hideki in particular.* - Wed Sep 16 21:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You alright, Hideki? - Wed Sep 16 21:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm good. - Wed Sep 16 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Ushinawa comes in clutch. - Wed Sep 16 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why not you? - Wed Sep 16 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Uh...I don't really have -interesting- qualities.. - Wed Sep 16 21:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not really care about your abilities. - Wed Sep 16 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I just enjoy bothering you. - Wed Sep 16 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It is fun. - Wed Sep 16 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Fuck my life. - Wed Sep 16 21:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Seeing your creeped out expression is beyond amazing~ - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: sounds like a crush to me. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*coughs*> Right. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm just going to uh... - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: When I get tired of it I'll probably bother someone else. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: or maybe shes just another twisted person. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Excuse me.. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) side steps and moves toward the buildings wall, and leans against it.* - Wed Sep 16 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Son of a bitch. - Wed Sep 16 21:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sneezes* - Wed Sep 16 21:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Someones talking shit. - Wed Sep 16 21:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You remind me so much of Kitora. - Wed Sep 16 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. - Wed Sep 16 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Your also sucha quiet little kid. - Wed Sep 16 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: What gives? - Wed Sep 16 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) sighed.

He stopped leaning against the wall and went down south.* - Wed Sep 16 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took out a single shuriken as he looked at the tree infront of him. He felt that the more he used this technique, the less chakra drain he'd have. * - Wed Sep 16 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Nigga yelped, tossing his shuriken in the air. As he quickly turned around and said "What the shit man!" the shuriken flung north of there position.* - Wed Sep 16 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hehe~ - Wed Sep 16 22:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am no man~ - Wed Sep 16 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) smirked and said "Right." as he pulled his index finger toward him.

Once Hideki did that, there was an elastic wire that was connected to that shuriken as it did a U-turn and came back around, the wiring wrapping around her very quickly, this technique was pretty much used for immobolising people, or to just get them by surprise. But in this case, he used this technique for immobilising purposes. Hideki then said "Like it?" he asked curious.* - Wed Sep 16 22:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got tackled to the ground, the words that came out of his mouth were "Oof!" 

By this point Hanabi was ontop of Hideki as he then said "I was going to cut it right after..You didn't have to tackle me.." he stated being rather serious. He made eye contact with this woman.* - Wed Sep 16 22:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got licked on the cheek by the creepy snake tongue.

Hideki then said "I'm not really..Kinky... You're just making this situation seem like I purposely did it..." this chick really was kinky. Whatever Amai told Hideki before this encounter, was correct. * - Wed Sep 16 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) eye's widened.

He was -not- about to take this L. He still had her wrapped in the elastic wiring, to which was pretty durable. Hideki quickly formed a single handsign, as raiton chakra manifested within his bodies system as he finally released it, sending a surge of lightning electricity around the area they were currently in. Hideki then said "Yeah..To be left alone."* - Wed Sep 16 22:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I don't know if she is trying to kill me.. Or if she's just being sarcastic.. - Wed Sep 16 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I can never tell. - Wed Sep 16 22:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) used that couple seconds to form once again, -another- single handsign, as he utilized his chakra and used it to spread it across his bodies system. What he attempted to do was exert his chakra and increase his metabolic rate, as he shunshined away from the woman when she was in mid-fall. This caused him to gain a bit of distance. But to no avail, the snakes wrapped around him right after.

Hideki stared blankly at the woman as he then says "I'd rather you -not- do that." he stated worrying about his well being, Amai said nothing about her torture methods.* - Wed Sep 16 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) felt really creeped out, this chick was probably insane from the looks of things, but he felt Hanabi sit on his chest, as Hideki then said "I'd rather not." he stated. Staring at Hanabi.* - Wed Sep 16 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You'd rather not what~ - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd rather not -do- these...things.. - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why not?~ - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It will be fun~ - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: For me at least~ - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Fun for you, not for me. - Wed Sep 16 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well you might end up enjoying it~ - Wed Sep 16 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You never know Hideki~ - Wed Sep 16 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Like I said. - Wed Sep 16 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Amai would beg me to do it to her~ - Wed Sep 16 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm not Amai. - Wed Sep 16 22:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Indeed you are not~ - Wed Sep 16 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You are my next play thing~ - Wed Sep 16 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well Amai was my girlfriend. - Wed Sep 16 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So I guess you are my first play thing~ - Wed Sep 16 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) struggled against the snakes bind.* - Wed Sep 16 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I am no one play thing. - Wed Sep 16 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You sure about that~ - Wed Sep 16 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The faster to accept it the better it is going to be for you~ - Wed Sep 16 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Think about it~ - Wed Sep 16 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm good...I'd rather be left in peace. - Wed Sep 16 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm?~ - Wed Sep 16 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) 's cheek was licked.

Hideki continued to stare blankly at this woman, Hideki then spoke up "I do have a kinky side, but I'd rather not do it with you." he stated. In all honesty, Hanabi didn't seem like his type.* - Wed Sep 16 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
There was no hope, Hanabi's body turned all scaley, which kind of creeped him out. And in all honesty he only wanted a summoning jutsu from this chick. Where was his squad when he needed them? Hideki stood there as he then says "Explain to me the difference between the two." he asked curious. He wsa trying to stall for time. This shit was not what he expected.

If anything he was just trying to train his jutsu's, and this happened. Hanabi was really weird.* - Wed Sep 16 23:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Pry it open? This bitch was fucking crazy. Hideki then said "What exactly do you plan on doing?" he asked, he was running out of options, and stalling wasn't really helping at all in this situation. And when she got close, fam those scales are really fuckin creepy. But it is definately confirmed.

This bitch is insane.* - Wed Sep 16 23:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The weird slimey shit was poured into his mouth, he legit tried not swallowing this shit, but he didn't know where the fuck this shit came from. It just kept fucking -pouring-. There was one thing that crossed his mind, if he was to turn into something exactly like Hanabi, on god this nigga would have his revenge.* - Wed Sep 16 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) had no choice -but- to swallow it, she was basically forcing him to. But after that was done Hideki started to cough-- a lot. As he spat on the floor wiping his mouth staring down Hanabi as he said "What...The fuck....Was that.."Would Hideki become what -she- was? If so that is going to be really really fuckin creepy. But then a question rang in his head. He looked at Hanabi and said "Is this some sort of convertion method?"* - Wed Sep 16 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) scratched his head.

He was about to be a fucking snake thing. What else could go wrong? Ya boy was only trying to train his jutsu. Hideki sighed. He was -never- training alone, ever again. Learned his lesson, Hideki slowly got up and placed a hand over his head. He had a headache. But one thing was for sure, her attitude definately changed. Couple minutes ago she was a psychotic bitch. But now she seemed a little bit more calm?

And that's when Ushinawa came in with an attack on Hanabi. What if he was to die from those fluids? Was she right that he needed to have more of those fluids pumped into him in order to survive? He didn't know. He looked at Ushinawa as he then said "Don't do anything to harmful to her, Ushinawa." he stated looking at his ally in the eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) examined his body. He patted himself down, as he thought to himself "Skin...Still okay... Scaley?...Not yet.. So far so good.. Sanity?...Still good.. I think." he looked over at Mariana and said "Thanks for your concern. But I'm doing fine. Just feeling a little...Weird is all." * - Thu Sep 17 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This was all my fault.. If only I was stronger.. And not so careless. - Thu Sep 17 00:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You son of a bitch, you did do something to him! Why?!  - Thu Sep 17 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) placed his hand on Ushinawa's shoulder and said "Hold on a second, I know both of you are concerned and angry. But if what she says is true, then we might aswell believe her." he stated looking at Ushi and then at Mariana. Hideki then looked at Hanabi and said "First things first.. How does this process work? I'm assuming once it's done to the victim it can't be undone. So I guess I'll live with it." he stated looking at Hanabi.* - Thu Sep 17 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Believe her? That bit--... what did she do to you again? - Thu Sep 17 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: SHE BLEW HER LOaD IN HIS MOUTH! - Thu Sep 17 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She pryed my mouth open, and- - Thu Sep 17 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Some sort of fluid she had in her mouth, she basically forced me to swallow it. - Thu Sep 17 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I'm not taking that. - Thu Sep 17 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: - - Thu Sep 17 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Yo...If I headbutt her hard enough. - Thu Sep 17 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Could I knock her out? - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Do I want to test it now.. - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Or later.. - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Ushinawa is maybe high or drunk or retarted as fffffffffffuck. - Thu Sep 17 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: He wants me to heal her? Fine. I get a chance to get closer to her. One punch. Dead. - Thu Sep 17 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Yo.. - Thu Sep 17 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Ushinawa and then back at Mariana. He sighed slowly.* - Thu Sep 17 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What kind of fluid was it? - Thu Sep 17 01:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So explain yourself. - Thu Sep 17 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Looked lke he was wiping love stains off his lips- - Thu Sep 17 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I've explained what I have done to him. - Thu Sep 17 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What was the fluid woman. - Thu Sep 17 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You will explain to me. - Thu Sep 17 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not prey on the weak for fun. - Thu Sep 17 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I prey on the weak to make them strong. - Thu Sep 17 01:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I'm going to headbutt her. - Thu Sep 17 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What will happen to Hideki withint the next few days will change his life. - Thu Sep 17 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) walked up this this chick and headbutts her. As he then says "What's the damn fluid you put in me."* - Thu Sep 17 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: If he turns into a snake. I am going to get your little heart that lives in your chest and rip that out.. cooking it to those who need food. - Thu Sep 17 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ... - Thu Sep 17 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Get that heart and squeeze it so good as if you are squeezing the last juice in a carton box. - Thu Sep 17 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Jesus Christ.. - Thu Sep 17 01:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: You have a monster for a wife. - Thu Sep 17 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) rubbed his forhead aswell, and turned around to stand next to Mariana once more as he then thought to himself "...No one wins with a headbutt.."* - Thu Sep 17 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I guess all we can do is wait. - Thu Sep 17 01:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: He will be thanking me when it is all said and done. - Thu Sep 17 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Quick question, what's up with the random change in demeanor? - Thu Sep 17 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Our presence, Hideki. - Thu Sep 17 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ....Could be that. - Thu Sep 17 01:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What about that mask of yours that you have on. - Thu Sep 17 01:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Make no mistake, I care nothing for her. - Thu Sep 17 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But it's essential that there is no conflict among allies. - Thu Sep 17 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) went and leaned against the fence.

But suddenly Hideki felt a sick sensation deep in his core. He hovered his hand over his stomach region. Hideki then said "I'm not..Feeling to well.." as he said this, his face turned a green color. He turned around and vomited on the fence.* - Thu Sep 17 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: . . . . - Thu Sep 17 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) spat at the floor.

He looked over toward Kilm. "No...I'm not." Hideki was feeling pretty nauseous. Hideki looked at the people around him, as he then said "I'll be..Right back." as he started to walk away from the group, his hand still gripped at his stomach.* - Thu Sep 17 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Fuck you, you litte nigga. - Thu Sep 17 12:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) leaned against the tree.

His hand still gripped to his stomach as he thought to himself "Why the fuck..Am I so nauseous.." his eyes widened, as he started to vomit once again on the tree. Hideki wiped his mouth, and said "Damn...This is gross.." Hideki continued to walk down south. * - Thu Sep 17 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stopped in his track and sat down, leaning against the tree itself. He sighed slowly as he then thought to himself "I was perfectly fine yesterday..What changed.." Hideki started to think about what happened last night, and thats when it finally clicked in his head. Hanabi put that weird fluid in his body, maybe this was his bodys way of reacting to it? Hideki struggled to get up, as he started to sweat a little bit.* - Thu Sep 17 12:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: How long do you think this war will last? - Thu Sep 17 12:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Will change the shinobi world as we know it. - Thu Sep 17 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm.....Ushi. - Thu Sep 17 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Thu Sep 17 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Do you know suimen? - Thu Sep 17 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No. - Thu Sep 17 12:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Holy shit. - Thu Sep 17 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Deez.... - Thu Sep 17 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) looked at Ushi.

Hideki then converted chakra to the soles of his feet, evenly distributing it. Hideki then said "We can do it here." he stated looking at Ushinawa. Hideki carefully placed his foot against the fence, after it was secure he placed his other foot on it. As he climbed the fence and appeared on the top of it. Hideki then spoke "It's more of a simple technique, you evenly distribute chakra between the soles of your feet. But if you distribute to much, it will fail."* - Thu Sep 17 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Can I learn?! - Thu Sep 17 12:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) left the group that was at the northern section of Amegakure. Hideki continued to travel down south, and do a quick turn to the east. Hiding infront of the house, as Hideki once again felt sick to his stomach, as he vomited once again. Hideki talked to himself "..Disgusting.. If I turn into one of those..Fucking Ugly Th-" he was interrupted as he vomited once again on the floor. He wiped his mouth off as he looked at his vomit and said "Jesus Christ.." and started to walk away.* - Thu Sep 17 13:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: There are three stages from what I've learned, too much cannot be said about it because I fear Beth will attempt to extract knowledge from you about the Sharingan. - Thu Sep 17 14:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) glared at Zetsumo.

"I have no choice but to go find Hanabi. I need more answers, and she has them." he stated looking at Zetsumo, who of course wasn't looking at Hideki either. * - Thu Sep 17 14:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) glared at Hanabi.

He has barfed a total of four times today, not to mention he felt uneasy, he was very sick. He looked toward Hanabi, as he then said "What do I need to do now.. I've been barfing all day today." he stated as his face turned green once more, he vomited once again infront of everyone -again-. He wiped his mouth and spat at the floor. Hideki looked at Hanabi.* - Thu Sep 17 15:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) squinted and looked at Hanabi.

"I highly doubt it's the flu. I was perfectly healthy couple days ago." he stated looking at Hanabi, Hideki sighed slowly as he then says "Then I'd rather ask you the questions I have in private then." Considering Hanabi wasn't really being all that responsive, or being detailed onto what might happen to him.* - Thu Sep 17 15:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) reached into his back pouch and took out the scroll that was given to him by Ushinawa himself. Hideki sighs and opens the scroll, carefully reading the scrolls contents. Hideki was more fond of Raiton jutsu than with katon, but having more jutsu in his arsenal could be useful. Atleast people are actually starting to notice him, not like last time where he was being ignored constantly.

Hideki contiinued to read the information in the scroll, the title of the jutsu read 'Fire Run' it seems the technique can make a stream of fire and can then be manipulated. The technique seemed simple enough. Hideki diverted his gaze from the scroll and looked ahead, to see if anyone else was here. Seemed empty once again, as his onyx orbs went back to reading the scroll.* - Thu Sep 17 20:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) continued to read the scroll, the information it gave seemed pretty useful. Hideki wondered what other techniques Ushinawa would lend Hideki so he could learn more about Katon related techniques, but then something clicked in his brain. Where did Ushinawa go? Hideki quickly rolled up the scroll and placed it back into his back pouch.* - Thu Sep 17 20:42:14 2015

Hideki quickly ran over and grab some of the dummies. Carefully lineing them up and spacing them a part slightly. By now, he lined up about five dummies. As Hideki points to the helmets he brang along with him and said "What about the helmets?"* - Thu Sep 17 22:50:14 2015
