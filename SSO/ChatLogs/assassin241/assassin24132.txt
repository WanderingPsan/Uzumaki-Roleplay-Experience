<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't particularly like their influence on this world. I believe they are a source of the reason why we view ourselves as tools, and they further promote the mindset of killing for gain. - Sat Oct 17 14:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah....We're doing it right here? - Sat Oct 17 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We can do it inside the village. - Sat Oct 17 17:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not here. - Sat Oct 17 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) stared at Kilm for a short while, he slowly closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and exhaled slowly. As he reopened his eyes and formed three tomoe sharingan. Hideki decided to just charge in, his skin however, turned scalely, he had scales all across his body. The scales color however, was maroon. His eyes, continued to stay the same, they still had sharingan activated despite being in his lycanthropic state. But there came a risk when going in his lycanthropic state while in Sunagakure. He was apart of the cotton mouth speicies.

Meaning he can't have this form activated for long, espeically in the dry deserts of Sunagakure no Sato. * - Sat Oct 17 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Quickly had to dodge all these attacks that were sent toward him, Hideki himself started to break a sweat, and they barely even started the match. But then again he was in his lycanthropic state, so this was probably going to be a bother none the less. Hideki however, quickly formed several handsigns, molding chakra within his bodies system, and when he finished the handsigns, he thrusted his fist forward. Five snakes came out of his arm sleeve as they went straight toward Kilm.

However, these snakes were not going to cause any damage to him whatsoever, they were going to try and wrap around Kilm's frame and immobolize him, that's only if they reached him in time. * - Sat Oct 17 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
Took note of the jutsu's ability, and Kilm's ninjutsu prowess was something to be feared. None the less, Hideki quickly got out of the earth flashes way. Hideki had to deactive his snake lycanthropic state, the Sunagakure's heat was wearing him out, however that still didn't stop him from going toward Kilm. He took out a kunai, he converted Katon chakra through the blade, giving it more length as the katon flames manifested the blade.

However his intended goal on doing this? It was to see how well Kilm's reflexes were, and to see how well he is in close range combat.* - Sat Oct 17 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I miss my Katana. - Sat Oct 17 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) quickly utilized Niza's signiture taijutsu style that was taught to him before Niza passed away, he stopped converted katon chakra through the kunai, he dropped it on the sandy surface. He lifted his arm up to block Kilm's attack, he then quickly sent a knee toward Kilm's gut region, he of course held back when sending the knee attack toward Kilm. He didn't want to cause any injuries during this sparing match.* - Sat Oct 17 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took note of this, seeing that Kilm had flying capabilities could prove useful for what they're futures plans were. However, Hideki countered the attack accordingly, he quickly turned around, and grabbed Kilm's ankle, and if i was successful he would have a large white snake erupt from his back, and travel through his right arm sleeve to wrap around Kilm's body, and if it was successful he would have the snake throw Kilm on the sandy surface. However this was an attempt at doing this, and considering Kilm could also fly, this could prove useless as the snake poofed into white smoke after it was done doing what it had to do.* - Sat Oct 17 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) got caught in the genjutsu, a massive tree trunk seemingly constricted his body. He stood there immobolized for awhile, until Kilm released it, thus ending the spar. Hideki bowed respectfully toward Kilm. "Yo...When you got time, think you could teach me that? That seems very useful." he stated rather interested in the technique itself.* - Sat Oct 17 18:29:20 2015

Hideki then started to form the handsigns, however he did them slowly so Index could observe what handsigns were made while he did this process. He started to mold katon chakra within his bodies system, and after he was done forming the handsigns, he opened his maw and out came flammable gas, that spread forward in the vast area. Hideki took out a match. He lit the match and threw it into the flammable gas as it exploded, releasing large amounts of fire everywhere. Hideki then placed the matches back in his pocket as he looked at Index.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: His assistant however, she is very well equipped in Genjutsu. - Sun Oct 18 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She uses her breasts as a trigger for one of the genjutsu. I saw through it with my sharingan, but I of course...Was careless. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tits. . A man's greatest weakness./ - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm pretty resistant to genjutsu, though. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS! - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good...Good. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I must show you something.....Greater...My eyes have seen a lot Sanoke. - Sun Oct 18 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? - Sun Oct 18 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) took note of the large gust of wind that also seemed to pick up sand and flung it near his general area. He tried covering his face of course, his vision however was blurred still just slightly. He looked over toward Sanoke. "I'll show you....Through genjutsu that my eyes can produce. You'll have to trust me however, before I do this. But allow me to assist you in looking around the village. I don't want you getting blind sided." The paranoia was strong with Hideki.* - Sun Oct 18 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right. - Sun Oct 18 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) closed his eyes, and slowly reopened them, forming his three tomoe sharingn.

Then once eye contact with established, he used his sharingan genjutsu on the clone. This caused a memory to be replayed within Hideki's mind. The first memory that was replayed, was the first death he'd ever witness, which was Hanabi's death. There at the Hokage Mansion, it would show that Erebus indeed cut at Hanabi's mouth while snakes seemingly were coming out of her mouth. Sanoke at the time, while in the illusion, was next to Hanabi while she was dying. Showing Erebus indeed finishing her off. However, the scene didn't last long.

The scenery changed, now it shows Hideki next to two Shinobi, Those two shinobi were Maloth and Lyala. Sanoke in this illusion, would be next to Hideki. Seemingly the three shinobi looked at the Gate, to see a huge sand beast,--- The Shukaku. However, it had an iron tale as it slammed it's tail against the Konohagakure Gate, destroying it completely, Hideki however was seen looking at the beasts power in awe, but Maloth and Lyala at the time were trying to haul ass.

The sand beast seemingly opened its mouth, charing up what seemed to be a huge ball of chakra, to which Hideki -knew- it was a huge ball of chakra considering at the time he had his sharingan activated and noticed the huge amounts of chakra the beast had. However the large ball of chakra seemed to have shrinked, and the beast -ate-  it. Once the beast ate it, it seemed to have opened it's mouth and sent the blast toward the Konohagakure Mansion, completely obliterating the building.

Hideki at the time, could be seen grabbing Maloth and Lyala and shunshining out of the area and getting them to safety.* - Sun Oct 18 19:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The scenery once again changed. This time it was revealed that Hideki was in a wheel chair, inside Kumogakure's Mansion, however on Hideki's lap was Ushinawa's dead body, tears falling off of Hideki's face. His eyes were revealed to have two tomoe sharingan-- Suddenly things have changed in Hideki's demeanor, Seisuke seemingly took the dead body of Ushinawa off of Hideki's lap and escaped the mansion, Hideki at the time looked away from everyone, as his eyes formed into something...Different.

His eyes within this illusion showed them to change into Three spikes of black that formed along the edges of his iris. They quickly transcended into the cornea's layers. It sharpened instantaneously as the eye is formed. The iris is centered around a dome like structure where spikes protrude. A number of three spikes are visable on each of his eye's. Hideki while in the wheel chair laughed evily at the time. Sanoke during this illusion was next to Hideki as he went through this change.* - Sun Oct 18 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideki(Assassin241) ||
The Illusion stops, their back in Sunagakure no Sato. Hideki was breaking a sweat by this point as he wasted quiet a bit of chakra from showing Sanoke some of his past experiences.

"Now then...To answer your question..."* - Sun Oct 18 20:41:10 2015

"Come with me, we'll go out to eat somewhere." he stated as he started to walk north, controling Tetsumi's actions via eye contact, having the young teen follow behind Hideki.* - Mon Oct 19 01:12:32 2015

For Katsune, since she was looking directly at Hideki's eyes, she could notice that Hideki had three tomoe sharingan, different than Orakuru who had one tomoe. 

Hideki however continued to smile as he was starting to make progress with Tetsumi, taking notice of the iron sand that poured out of his gord. It was rather intersting, he hasn't seen that many manipulators in the world, the last manipulator he saw was a paper user. God knows whatever happened to that chick. "I can assure you, I'm not here to attack you, or hurt you. You can even ask Sanoke.." he stated this as he shifted his gaze to Sanoke who was eating a candy bar, he then stared back at Tetsumi.* - Mon Oct 19 01:33:00 2015

"Hey, wait up there buddy."
