Zehl had been off training alone for quite a while and he needed some human interaction to stop himself from going insane.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) slowly made his way toward the village gates, unsure of what exactly was going on in the distance. He knew his brother was nearby, but he had no clue that everyone else had gathered there. It seemed as if there was a shitty situation going but it was too late for Zehl to turn around, seeing as his big brother would probably kick his ass if he ran.* - Wed Sep 02 21:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) is torn apart by several of the incoming earth bullets. He wasn't quick enough on his feet, nor was he durable enough to withstand the incoming attacks. As each bullet hit his body, blood spurted forth from his mouth in a projectile fashion. They boy's eyes widened, expressing just how much pain he'd felt with each searing blow. It was quite an unexpected outcome but this is the life of a shinobi who hadn't trained for such a day. His last thoughts were well-wishes to his comrades, praying to whatever higher power that they made it out alive.* - Wed Sep 02 22:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) is heavily damaged after taking an attack head on from Zetsumo and his subordinate. He was now leaning and possibly bleeding all over the place. His ribcage felt as if he'd been hit by several trucks and his right arm would not move on command. The boy coughed, blood projecting itself from his lips before he turned to his brother for help.* - Thu Sep 03 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) lifts his head, his vision still a bit blurry and the pain seeming as if it was never going to end. In his immediate field of view, the young shinobi saw a figure with what looked like blonde hair. Upon further inspection, Zehl realized that it was one of his comrades coming to save his endangered ass. Relief washed over the boy and he relaxed a bit at the thought of being dragged to safety. His brother could hold his own against such powerful adversaries but Zehl was nowhere near as experienced in the ways of combat. If his rescue was successful, he would keep his bitch ass away from any sort of combat involving niggas with multiple hearts.* - Thu Sep 03 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) looked up from zoning out and set his sightso n his older brother and the breeding chamber that sat before him. Zehl hadn't the slightest idea what was going on here but he was never one to ignore family. The boy took slow steps toward his kin, a smile appearing on his face as he got closer. He could see his brother fooling around with some sort of insect but he wasn't entirely sure just where this was about to go. WIthout a word, Zehl then position himself to be standing just across from Dravae, just on the other side of the chamber.* - Sat Sep 05 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) lookedp uzzled for a moment, placing his right hand on his chin. It wouldn't be long before he recalled such a book from his younger days. It hadn't been something in the forefront of Zehl's mind but he surely did have bits and pieces of it memorized. Unfortunately, Zehl did not remember the section about such a parasitic insect, though he recalled others with parasitic properties. Not wanting to hold the conversation up, Zehl quickly inquired just what this specfic species was capable of.* - Sat Sep 05 03:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zehl(Last of a Crying Breed) had been standing idly by, watching everything taking place before it seemed things would abruptly stop. As Zehl opened his mouth to speak, he was interrupted by his older brother making his way over to him. Zehl looked at his sibling with an expression of concern on his face, taking note of the manner in which Dravae was acting. Taking hold of the breeding chamber, the boy nodded and a single tear ran down his right cheek. In his mind it was bullshit but he would need to man up and take responsibility for himself at this point. Zehl would grip tightly onto the chamber and do his best to keep from screaming like a child.* - Sun Sep 06 20:46:04 2015
