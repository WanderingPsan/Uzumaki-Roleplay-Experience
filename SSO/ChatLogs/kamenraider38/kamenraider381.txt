<br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) || Loud panting could be heard, as a cloud of dust squirmed towards the academy building. Several skirts, flags and various objects of threads over turned and flapped in the wind. Who was it? A  child! With black spiky hair! He screeches to a halt, with large droplets of sweat running down his pale face to his pointed chin. He hunches over, wasted from running. 

"I-i made it!" 

He says in a whisper while gasping for air. He bends over slightly, gripping his knees with his gloved hands. * - Sun Nov 22 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) ooks up to the cloaked figure, noting his kage attire. It's the boss! He thought to himself as he stood up straight with a salute over his right, black brow. "U-uh...I'm Kokoru!"
* - Sun Nov 22 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) stood stiff as a board.

"Yes, sir!"

Soon enough, he begain to slouch and relax his body. His comfortablility slowly rising. "I graduated a few days ago!"* - Sun Nov 22 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa c'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) look to the younger girl in front of him. His dark-brown eyes analized the girl's stance. She seemed rather sure of himself to him. Turns to her while rubbing his neck. "Sparring already...?" He thought to himself as he shrugs. "Uh...It's a pleasure to meet you!"* - Sun Nov 22 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like wise. - Sun Nov 22 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well then I guess you can have the first move.~ - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Kana, C'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) bends his left foot, to kick the dirt off the bottom of his toe-less sandles. His feet spreads apart. Just gotta remember a little of his fighting style! He just learned the basics of such skills. The young Genin jogs over, with both his arms behind his back. If he is uninterupted, he flat palms his left hand, so that he could slap it against her gut. To follow-up, he'd  drop to the ground, sweep his right leg through her legs and make her drop to the floor.

After this was accomplished, the Koko hops away.* - Sun Nov 22 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) "Woah!" 

Kokoru hesitates, as a arrow was being aimed at him. He moves his legs only enough to sustain a small scratch on his ankle. The boy was halted halfway through. "That was dangerous..." The young shinobi stood there with his eyes burrowing into his sparring partner. He has to find a way past that bow. It'd be to dangerous to use a jutsu, as innocent bystanders could be caught in it. Koko, starts slowly walking to her left, in a half circular motion, trying to throw off her aim.

It wasn't until he felt a small breeze run by the area, that Kokoru mades his move.

The spikey-haired child dashed straight after her, attempting to do what he did before! Only this time, he remained wary of her arrows.* - Sun Nov 22 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: That's still quite a lot of chakra to use.  Hmmm. - Sun Nov 22 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: She's using too much chakra..Yumiko can't sustain that anymore. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: At this rate she has to be going for a quick finish. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) stops the moment he saw the girl burst into a plume of smoke. What is this? A trap? Is she using the substitution? The young shinobi looked around at the area of the smoke and knew it would be dangerous to stay in it. So he simply hops away, not knowing that the younger child could possibly be behind him! He looks around to his left and right, wondering when she would show up.

"Behind me...?"

The child turns his back, looking for Yumiko's position after looking to his left and right. "More arrow tricks, huh?"* - Sun Nov 22 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) releases some held breath and sits down in place. "Ugh...My leg.." He said while coressing the wound a little.* - Sun Nov 22 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Nori. Heal him for me. - Sun Nov 22 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) rubs the back of his neck, trying to ignore the awkwardness he feels. "Um, I'm not...But I go to the candy stores all the time!" He returns to his child-like smile.* - Sun Nov 22 22:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) jumps, when the woman's hand lands onto his black spikey hair.The whole time she approached him, his nerves remained uncalmed.  But her petting his head, calmed him a small bit. He relaxed himself, feeling like there was nothing to be afraid of. He then looks up to the woman, as his cheeks start to grow rosey red from embarassment. "K-Kokouro!" He said while softly smiling.* - Sun Nov 22 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Don't come crying to me when she lowkey root sealed you. - Sun Nov 22 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) Trys to shrug off the flattery by clearing his throat. His smile turns into a serious mug. "Asteroth" It was a strange name to the young shinobi, strange but cool. He look down and then back up, before he knew it, the lady was bent over to his face. 

"Ummm..." It took the child a second to think. "I think you should try some of our resturants and or go fishing!" He said while placing his hands over his head. 
"Asgoth..."  Koko thought while peering to the other woman. 

"The fish we have here are fine and cool to eat too!"* - Sun Nov 22 22:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) "Well....."

Kokoru places his pale hand over his pointed chin, while looking to the air. "I mean...I don't know if I would be good for this..." After all, he is more suited as a shinobi. He didn't feel insulted. He didn't feel anything, only unsure. That's not to mention they are strangers. "I'm sure that our Kage will be back soon~!" He said while trying to shift the conversation. 

"He's just takin' a nap."* - Sun Nov 22 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course.. - Sun Nov 22 23:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) gives a large grin, while waving to Kyubishu. "Hello there!"* - Sun Nov 22 23:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) 's eyes grew wide, almost to the point his pupils disapeared at the sight. His jaw nearly dropped on the floor. Who  could do such a thing!? Why would they do that to him!? Is that the cost of being a shinobi* - Sun Nov 22 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: I-I'm so sorry... - Sun Nov 22 23:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Ichirou and Kida..as in the people with Sado. The people I warned the Mizukage about trusting.. - Sun Nov 22 23:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..They might not be in the village anymore. - Sun Nov 22 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...How is he alive with all of those injuries? - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) thinks: Because, he has hatred. - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I'm no medic but the blood loss alone from losing your tongue should be enough to kill him. - Sun Nov 22 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) says: Lord Mizukage! Those two ladies over there want to talk with you! - Sun Nov 22 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: T'is a shame, Kokoru. You were a joy to speak to. - Sun Nov 22 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) waves his right hand to Asteroth. "You where really nice." The child said with a grin. " I hope next time we meet, you get to stay longer!"* - Sun Nov 22 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alrighty...Let me get the brackets together then we'll kick off this tournament. For the time being, there's nothing we can do about Kyubishu's attackers but be prepared to destroy them upon location. - Sun Nov 22 23:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: But this new kid might have a few tricks up his sleeve. - Mon Nov 23 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) bends his knees, while staring down his opponent."She can shoot arrows..." The boy looks to her feet while licking his lips. "She doesn't seem much faster than me..." But then the boy considered she may have been holding back. This all poked at the spikey haired young man's neck. The risk to distract the woman could be too much..But he has to do something. He doesn't stand a chance in getting close to her.

The young shinobi pats his right fist into his left open hand, poppinig the knuckles in a bone cracking noise. The boy starts inching his way after the younger girl. * - Mon Nov 23 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. Let round one begin! - Mon Nov 23 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) kept his guard up, as he focused on his opponent. He licks his upper lip while still approaching her. She was considerably smaller, but as Asteroth said, kids in this buisness tend to have grown-up thinking. Which was true for Kokoru himself. Only, his thinking resided in combat. Once he got half-way ( 3 tiles) to Yumiko, the boy dashes after her, be careful to run in a zig-zag to avoid being hit by her arrow. If he made it to her, he'd swing his left leg at the bow and round houses her in her chest.

* - Mon Nov 23 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Come on, Yumiko. You've got this.. - Mon Nov 23 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Does this put me against Kana? Or is there someone else I'd be fighting? - Mon Nov 23 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) "-!?" 

Koko's expression burst open. It was a look of surprise, but only for a moment. The young shinobi starts to grin. She wants to play. That's fine! She ran faster, which only brought her closer to the young shinobi. He drops his body down, when she releases her grip on the arrow. It narrowly ends up digging into his arm. The boy shoots his foot up into the air, nailing her right in the jaw with enough force to possibly knock her off her feet and onto her back.* - Mon Nov 23 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) looked to the leader, while holding his bleeding arm. "I-i can still fight!" He'd say, attempting to fake wellness. "Ugh..."* - Mon Nov 23 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Good. ..The winner is Yumiko. Kokoru you did a good job. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Next fight. Heiwa, Nori. You're up next. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kokoru(Kamenraider38) turns to the short red head with a sigh. "Deja, vu, eh?"* - Mon Nov 23 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Against Nori.. - Mon Nov 23 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sir, are you sure about this? If Nori is healing him up just before the match she'll be at a disadvantage. - Mon Nov 23 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I'm sure. She'll be fiiine.  - Mon Nov 23 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Alright. Heiwa, Nori. Get in place.  - Mon Nov 23 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? Oh, okay. - Mon Nov 23 01:17:13 2015
