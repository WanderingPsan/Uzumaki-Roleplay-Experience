<br><font color=yellow>*Iba(They.Call.Me.Ninja) Walks down the long dirt path that lead from konohas front gate all the way down. He follows the path and caries a large object wrapped in cloths on his back as well a bag full of food and water and things of that nature. He seems to be enjoying him self so far just having a good time walking. He soon reaches the area where its more forest then most of villages main land. 

"I need to find a camp sight."He said ooking around. He wasn't sure if he could fnid the right place to make camp but he would keep a eye out for one. He walks in a steady pace just enjoying the freedom huming a little song to him self as he walks. EAch step he takes elaves a little foot print in the ground, he didn't care of notice it. But it's not like that would be a problem at all, he just keeps on walking taking a sip of water if he needed it. 

"I'll find a place to camp before dark hopefuly."He said again.* - Thu Sep 17 00:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iba(They.Call.Me.Ninja) puts the cap on his bottle and then places it in his bag. He waas still following the dirt path and all its turns and such. His eyes are looking around for a place for him to nap and then bam he finds it. There was a village near by and he would walk torward sit luckly the path would take him straight there. Once reaching the villages gates he stops and looks at the villages walls. Taking in all its glory, it seemed to be the tea village mabye another one of this small villages. 

He would waste no time and enter the village looking around at all other citizens of the village walking around. Though his eyes rea really looking out of ra nn so he could get a room and sleep for the night.* - Thu Sep 17 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Iba(They.Call.Me.Ninja) both os his hand reach up and over to his back. They are soon pressed against the large object thats on his back. He pulls it off and quickly sets it in front of him. He huffs a little for that object is heavey and he has yet to build up much strenght. He stares at a few trees marking them as targets for his training. "Man if only I didn't need to train this day would be amazing."He said as he began to focus chakra to his hands then carefuly pushe dthat cakra out to his fingers tips. Chakra strings are created and would attatch to the object near him.

His pointer and ring fingers on his left hand both bend down leaving his middle and pinky finger up and straight. Thise causes the object to move a little as well for the clothes wrapped around it to come undone. They would fall to ground quickly, exposing the puppet that was wrapped in them. "Wake up Ishi!"He shouted before he does few more motions iwht his hands causing the puppet to stand up then slowly float up off the ground.

"Lets get this done Ishi."He said as the puppet would quickly move forward. Its feet did not touch the ground no the puppet was flying or hovering up in the air. It heads torwards one of th emany trees and would start to circl the tree quickly. "Thats right confuse them."Iba said with a smile before bedning his pinky finger on his right hand and pulling his left hand back some. 

Soon the puppets mouth would open nd would fly up just above the tree. "Now!"He said as one of many hidden weapons in th epuppet would go off. From its mouth hundreds of senbon are unleashed on the tree. Leaves and small twigs would fal down s well rains of senbon. though most of the senbon stick into the tree hitting the tree over and over to the point bark and pieces of wood began to chip off of it.

"Yes, yes! There you go Ishi my creation you please me!"Iba shouted as he watcehs his very own creation destory some of the tree with rain of senbon. With a huff Iba flexes both of his thumb and the puppets arms would extend out aiming at the tree. They open up and soont he puppet began to circle around the tree by stay above it. In matter of seconds oil would spray out from the puppets left hand as the right hand trap opens andlittle spark is made. Then quick flame is shot out that mixes witht he fire creating a more powerful flame thrower effect that woud quickly scrotch the oil cover tree setting it to a blaze.

The then comes back torwards Iba and would rest near his side. The boy pants and huffs as he could feel the drain on his chakra. "Wow, you did good ishi."He said.* - Thu Sep 17 15:28:12 2015
