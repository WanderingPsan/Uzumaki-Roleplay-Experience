<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) examines Asteroth briefly.

"Yes, Raven. I've received your message and I think that cooperation is well-in-order and is above all else, plausible. If you offer your services in assistance to me, I will aid you."* - Mon Oct  5 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) shifts his Rinnegan to direct itself towards Asteroth's dropped body bag. He waits for what Asteroth was to reveal to him--perhaps it would be Madara.* - Mon Oct  5 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) discovers Hanabi in the body bag.

She didn't matter to Edge though, Edge had never ever seen Hanabi in his life. 

"I don't mind if you draw something up." Edge stated, facially indifferent in terms of his expression. His eyes twinkle with delight as he revelled in what may be an interesting move. Was Asteroth perhaps a necromancer? It would explain why she was hoisting around body bags. Or perhaps she was a medic? That'd also be a plausible explanation. Edge sees no other reason for why she'd carry one around.* - Mon Oct  5 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) hides his surprise and thrill at the prospect of reviving the dead. He would've went giddy if he wasn't the leader of an enterprise soon to rid the world of the corrupt shinobi governmental system. Edge manages to smirk lightly though. He tried his best to restrain it; it was to no avail though.

"Impressive. I am truly impressed. I have never met a necromancer as talented as you must be, Miss Raven. I implore you to set your services under my employment. In return, I would be happy to assist you. Though I must ask--what kind of assistance and cooperation do you seek from me?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) smirks. "So you want potential candidates whose bodies are incredibly durable and dominant? I might be able to arrange that in the future. Certainly. But you would have to assist and cooperate with me in my goals." He stated. "I will call upon you whenever I need you."* - Mon Oct  5 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Of course. - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) lays Kohaku on a bed. He heads over to the refridgerator and receives some of her refridgerated herbs. He mends them into bandaids using the Gantai no Jutsu, and wraps around her broken appendages in order to soothe her ails.

"Let's not die, shall we?" Edge muttered.* - Mon Oct  5 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) works on mending her appendages first. He places a herb over Kohaku's mouth so that her breathing would be put to ease. His other hand concentrates on massaging her temples in an attempt to ease her pain and put her to some relief. Another hand reaches for her chest, where the lungs were located. He'd massage the lungs carefully.* - Mon Oct  5 06:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) // His hands rapidly formed seals, stringing them together in a sequence that had barely consumed any time in terms of occupation and execution. The ANBU Agent sighs, not expecting it to have been such a hassle to just find two measly blades. Suddenly, his hands clasp together upon the completion of the fifth handseal.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu." 

His target was Nakahara, Setsuko. His aim was to break her from the fight as soon as possible so that Sin'ichi wouldn't have to focus on multiple opponents at a time. Not only that, Edge desired to isolate himself from the main fight by conjuring up an alternative dimension for his own altercation; that way he wouldn't be impeded by efforts in the main fight.

"Torture Chamber."* - Wed Oct  7 01:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) // The chains wrap around Setsuko's wrists and ankles, leaving her vulnerable from all angles. Edge slowly removes his mask from his visage, revealing his lavendar eyes, which possessed the eyes of the Rinnegan. He observes her quietly, before drawing his own blade.

"I wonder. How much blood do Kirigakure ninja like yourself spurt?" He questioned for a moment. A single chain wraps around Setsuko's left ankle, aiming to dislocate it in a brief instant at the clap of Edge's finger snap.* - Wed Oct  7 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) // Having torn Setsuko's ankle, Edge takes a step forward. His blade is brandished before his eyes and Edge's eyes sweep across Setsuko's frame. "Enough games though. I don't like wasting any time. I want you to tell me something. Where are the Kiba Blades?"

Blunt and straightfroward. A style that never seemed to be omitted from Edge's persona. His blade is drawn and he places it against Setsuko's shirt. His hand tears off portions of it so that he could get down to Setsuko's skin.

Upon doing so, his blade begins to circle around Setsuko's left breast, drawing a bloody red circle along the skin of her mammary. He'd dig in deeper with his sword.

"Well? I expect a response." His blade keeps digging into her breast. Of course, Setsuko had no idea that he would die if she died. However, he threatened her with death at this very moment. A bluff, but was she smart enough to perceive the bluff via intellect?

"You should tell me, unless you want things to get messy with that breast and that heart of yours."* - Wed Oct  7 02:25:55 2015

However, your leader has already professed that she knows of its existence and said that she wouldn't allow me to have it as it is Kirigakure's property. You, a Kirigakure ninja, must be lying. You have a clue, and you are hiding it." He mutters. 

"I shall not have you lie to me any longer." He sweat, but Edge wiped it off promptly. He wasn't the type of person to show any sign of weakness, despite how much pain he himself was feeling. He was about to go a step further as well. His blade is primed and cocked, before being swung in a vertical fashion to slice Setsuko's nipple straight off.

"I said to tell me the truth, otherwise you shall face a punishment far worse than death."* - Wed Oct  7 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) had removed of Setsuko's nipple and had succeeded in terms of his damage. He simply drew his blade back, unleashing another pole from his sleeve. However, he thought about it carefully. Did he want to sustain more injury? No, he couldn't tolerate the pain no longer. He had sustained enough mental pain; it had taken his toll on him and he would not be able to perform appropriately should he reform.

That was why he cancelled the jutsu. And as soon as he cancelled the jutsu, he realized something. Next to him was some kind of beast that was not Sin'ichi. His intellect was going to calculate this fairly quickly. Immediately, the ANBU Agent aims to pierce the beast with his chakra receiver, aiming to sap all of its chakra and nullify its Bijuu Transformation, as well as the Wind Armor that seemed to be protecting the beast.

It was a -in the moment- reaction, where he had to react so utterly quickly and calculate the situation so fast that it put a stress on him.

"Know pain." He thought to himself.* - Wed Oct  7 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) had removed of Setsuko's nipple and had succeeded in terms of his damage. He simply drew his blade back, unleashing another pole from his sleeve.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) had plunged his chakra receiver into the depths of Koeki's chest. While it wasn't enough to kill Koeki, Edge was certain it was enough to restrain her. From his sleeve unraveled one chakra receiver. His free hand grips Koeki's hands and suddenly forces them to the ground. His other hand, bearing the chakra receiver, aimed to spear through her hands and impale her upon the ground as further insurance. 

As for Setsuko, who was disabled on the ground due to a dislocated ankle, Edge unravelled a scroll and fired it off at her, aiming to pierce her straight through the kneecap and permanently ruin her ability to walk.* - Wed Oct  7 03:49:32 2015

(*Nakahara, Setsuko emerged from the alternate dimension, breathing heavily. She'd clench her teeth, finally understanding what he'd just done. The blondette burned with fury. "Trash like you... doesn't have a right to put a hamper on my appearance! I will fucking -kill- you!" She'd exclaim, sprinting right forth the male and lifting a single hand while holding her katana with the other.

A massive torrent of mud would spew from her maw, aiming to block his gaze. The pain resonating throughout her body didn't stop the enraged individual from charging on ahead.*)* - Wed Oct  7 03:52:57 2015
