<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) chuckels. He shook Ortho's hand quietly. 

"Well, yes. You dabbling in Fuuinjutsu must be something of a pastime. I'd imagine everyone's got an idea of how to operate Fuuinjutsu. It's like writing. Everyone's done it at least once."

Edge's left hand approaches Ortho's hand, to clasp his hand with the sense of friendliness endowing his hand's gentle grip over Ortho's backhand. 

His index finger trails along Edge's hand. 

Boom. It emerges from his wrist as a weapon. Lightning Flash Blade Creation. A blade had been emerged from the blue and out of nowhere, with Edge's grip still stagnant on Ortho's. Instead, a blade had been formed within Ortho's free hand, which suddenly brought Edge's hand in a swing across Ortho's neck-region, aiming to decapitate him on the spot with Dine Edge, a blade that instantaneously wraps around his forearm. The blade, should it etch into Ortho's neck, would cause the -EDGE- of the blade to dig deep into Ortho's jugular and into where his cervical branches were in terms of his spine.

Should Edge carry out with his strike, he'd finish off by swinging clear of Ortho's neck, leaving him bleeding and unable to breath for the most part.

Edge's left foot would raise itself and kick Ortho's body to the ground regardless of the situation, whether he die a short, painless death, or a painful, expressively long death by the hands of suffocation and bleeding out.

"I deplore such noble traits in my subordinates though."* - Tue Nov 24 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: 17.5 int 12.05 gen] - Tue Nov 24 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Clever. Edge reacts promptly though. Upon his blade digging deep into Ortho's person, Edge's head rears back to avoid the chakra scalpel. Upon dodging the chakra scalpel, the hand gripping onto Ortho's hand digs into his hand. Chainmail accompanies his hand and he brings his knee down to bring Ortho's body downwards. Should Ortho's body be brought downward, Edge would manipulate the exchange of gravity so that his opposing hand could now be used. He'd dispatch the blade in an attempt to toss it towards Ortho's face. Ortho would probably be distracted by the blade: otherwise, he'd face a nasty surprsie in the face of his head.

Regardless, Edge's hand then suddeny jets upwards to try and grab hold of Ortho's chest. It was the largest part of his body and it was a part of his body Ortho could not deny.

"Judgment shall be cast."

The King of Hell erupts behind Edge's body, as Ortho's tongue is yanked forcefully from his body from contact.* - Tue Nov 24 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [yall should I attack Kana fam?] - Tue Nov 24 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: Did she.... - Tue Nov 24 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ^ - Tue Nov 24 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Luckily, Rymei managed to slice through both of the snakes. Good. Edge quietly murmured words of insolence.

"You imbecile. So, you believed that that would be enough to slay a god like myself? There is one thing you will learn."

"I am Absolute. I am the Law. I am Order. I am Chaos. I am God. And I am your God. I determine who lives or dies. I determine if -YOU- live or die." 

Edge comments, as his right hand releases his hand and suddenly grips on Ortho's neck with violent brute force. He'd clench tighter and deeper against his neck and keep on strangling him with the force of a violent forefather to a black boy who had failed to do his father proud.

Edge's left hand removed itself from Ortho's chest and proceeded to reach for his gun, strapped away underneath his cloak.

He'd lift the Senbon Gun to Ortho's face.

And he'd fire the Senbon right into his forehead. 

"Bye."* - Tue Nov 24 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Suddenly, Edge's chainmail intercepts the strike. Edge's right hand and left hand struggle to move to his chest. Edge was panting; his sweat proliferated on his forehead and dripped across his temple. He knew that Ortho literally had him on death's edge.

Ortho would've killed him if his chainmail hadn't been in place. He releases his seal.

A bullet-like magnet emerges from his chest in an attempt to break into Ortho's body and kill him on the spot by piercing through his chest.

It didn't take much of a movement to activate the seal. Merely chakra had to be funneled into the seal to release it.

"Magnet Repulse."

He mutters quietly. * - Tue Nov 24 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [nigga didn't even help me qq] - Tue Nov 24 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | The kunai approached him. Edge had seen her from the corner of his eyesight and had difficulty dealing with her. He twists his neck around, craning it so that his shoulder could get in the way. He attempts to overpower the snake, but it was difficult. Now that Ortho was down though, Edge felt much more freedom.

Ortho had been hindering his plans the entire time. Now, Edge could operate. His right sleeve and left sleeve both release Black Rods simultaneously. His left sleeve attempts to dig three Black Rods right into the snake's body and cause it to become paralyzed itself, without mobility and to make sure it lost its strength. Edge's right sleeve aims to intercept Eri's kunai with his shoulder.

This is all done in one gallant, eloquent spin. Edge's right hand, three Black Rods in hand, attempts to swipe at Eri's chest and cause three large gashes to spawn across her person, before she could even contemplate an eye socket strike.* - Tue Nov 24 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: You two must want to be together that badly. - Tue Nov 24 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Then let me join you two together. - Tue Nov 24 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: We'll call it a human centipede. - Tue Nov 24 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I have six blades. - Tue Nov 24 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Six rods. - Tue Nov 24 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Let's see what six areas they want to be joined at. - Tue Nov 24 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Unveiling his six rods, Edge approaches Ortho and Eri. 

"You two are such love birds. I remember when I had love like that."

"However, I lost that love. I lost it and now you two are going to lose your love."

"Know True Pain."

Edge's right hand grapples hold of Eri's hand and yanks it over to Ortho's hand. He'd join their hands together, having them clasp their hands, before shoving his black rod through their hands to join them together. He'd shove a pole through Eri's lower back into Ortho's abdomen, so that they were joined at the stomach region as well. He proceeds to stuff them like porcupines, hand to hand, mouth to mouth.

In finality, he'd join them heart to heart by shoving his black rod through their hearts.

"Love each other. Heart. To. Heart."

He'd let their blood seep from their bodies, wrapping, melding, and mixing on the ground as they were killed. * - Tue Nov 24 23:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | With a swift motion of his body, Edge steps in to Aza, who was struggling to make a motion.

"Begone, fool." He lunges out a black rod and attempts to dig straight through his throat. It was too bad that Aza would never have any chance to open up that pouch and actually save Ryomen, or even blow up Rymei. At the same token though, Edge's eyes have now shifted over to Marrisa, who had come in a downward motion. She had floated -off- of her fan, spread a line of blood, and was now coming downwards while blasting a Sickle Weasel. 

Unfortunately, Edge wasn't going to let her off so easily. Five handseals are made with utmost haste, trying to intercept Marrisa's blast.

Even if he could not intercept the Sickle Weasel, there was an eruption of an iron statue attempting to grab hold of Marrisa.

He was aware she was attacking: he was a sensory-type and had the vision to see her in mid-air.

"Bloody Mary."* - Wed Nov 25 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Incredible. That woman was flying through his Bloody Mary: a jutsu that no one had ever broken through before. Edge bit his lip. Marrisa was flying and escaping from the vicinity. Edge's body breaks out into a sprint. He dashes for Rymei's position, attempting to clutch hold of her by the waist of her robe.

"You're not doing so well, are you?" He questioned. Nonetheless, Edge observes the situation at play. He attempts to jump backwards with Rymei in tow and build distance.* - Thu Nov 26 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Powerful.

However, Edge does not need to budge an inch. His Rashomon erects to the side, blocking Marrisa's sickle weasel for the most part. Edge grabs hold of Rymei and continues to leap back, building distance from Marrisa.

"For the meantime, I think that it's time that we execute perhaps.... a tactical retreat if I may say so myself."

Edge mutters, not expecting Marrisa's ridiculous strength.* - Thu Nov 26 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Already - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Quite literally, Edge throws Rymei to the side. With five quick handseals behind the Rashomon, he'd conjure up his Iron Maiden. The Iron Maiden was to wrap around Rymei, capturing her, ensnaring her, and leaving her little option since she had no legs. Once it had wrapped around Rymei, he'd let it sink back into the ground. 

Once it neared closing point, Edge merely smirked at her.

"Rymei. I'll see you around sometime." 

"This isn't good bye. This is simply a 'see you later'."

Once it had rooted back into the ground, Sanoke's Lion Maw would grab hold of Edge, causing Edge to be crushed by its embrace. Edge remained stagnant in position, no longer able to move from his binding hair technique.* - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: ....Well. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | An audible chuckle emerges from his vocals despite his ribs being penetrated by the black rod. Edge's eyes glazed over, setting their stony gaze on Sanoke. His mouth trickled blood along the edges of his lips; nay, he would not concede his ideology in the face of defeat for that was the man of principle that Edge was and dictated himself to be.

"Intellect. Power. These are two components necessary to complete ambition."

"My ambition was to bring Sunagakure to greatness. Do you not see it? The Land of Wind, united for its culture. A land destined for greatness; now, under the thumb of a Kirigakure-born leader and reigned over by a Kirigakure born military. Despicably unpleasant."

He commented. He twists his neck, craning it upwards so that he could see the sky.

"Your Master was not far from the truth. However, she also miscalculated one thing."

"Negative and positive attract. Just as it is true that positive intent can lead to positive action, in negative intent, positive action can be born. Thus, in positive intent, negative action is born. The latter would be definitive of me."* - Thu Nov 26 02:08:51 2015

"A flawed ideology, you say? Sanoke. You have never experienced what I have been through. Your life is probably wrought with pleasure and goodwill. You've never lost a loved one, I am sure, by the way you speak. Your utterly idyllic optimism will not ever be brought out to reality. It is no reality that there will be permanent peace."

"You cannot converse in the ninja world. The people I converse with are tools: they are not people who can be reasoned with. Your people seized Sunagakure---a village that deserved to stand on its own by its people."

He later goes on to his main directive though.

"However, I am not of noble cause. Sanoke, I sought your eyes. With the completion of your eyes, I would be able to bring back the one I sought the most."

He quietly analyzed. 

"Selfish, may I be. To kill people for the sake of one person. Now. Kill me, Sanoke. Kill me, and remove the burden from this world that I have become. Become the savior. Become the hero. Become the idyllic God you want to be. I know the feeling in you. You want to seize my eyes. Take my eyes. Become God. And play it for the world."

"I am all but certain that the world shall not be paved by the ambitious. But it will be paved by the idyllic."* - Thu Nov 26 02:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) is struck by each bullet. Edge's mouth opens to let loose a torrent of crimson which pours down his chin and onto the ground. Edge's eyes lost color momentarily, briefly as he felt the pain of death. Yet, there was also a relaxing sensation that came to shroud him from the feeling of death; conjured by bullets lining his body, Edge found himself caressed by death's embrace and found himself slowly succumbing to its effects. 

His last thoughts were on Misa. How he failed to protect her. How he failed as a father. How he failed at everything but combat and warfare. Certainly, he had destroyed Kumogakure. Yet, all of that was meager. A step in his plans had not let to his plans succeeding.

------

Glass, everywhere. Edge's feet track up the staircase slowly, as if he were wondering where he was now. It was a never-ending spiral staircase that seemed to ascend past the horizons. As he finally reached the final step, he was faced with a door. It was a plain wooden door. Upon its title was family. 

At the bottom were the bodies of the deceased that Edge had sacrificed to build the staircase up to family.

When all was said and done though, Edge could not open the door to family. He hadn't the key to open it.

That key had been in Sunagakure all along. And he had failed to retrieve it.

". . . . A good run I suppose." The staircase collapses. * - Thu Nov 26 02:55:47 2015
