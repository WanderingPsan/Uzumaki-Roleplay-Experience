His hands eagerly grip onto Pandora's black cloak, digging into the fabric and upon what was hidden underneath. "I'd ask for you to strip, but that's something I can do fairly easily on my own accord." He stated, his right hand sliding across the black fabric that was her cloak in an attempt to unhinge the gourd from her shoulders. 

"You won't need this to weigh down your shoulders anymore than your breasts already are."* - Mon Sep 28 02:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) finalizes the process by drenching Pandora in his white ropes. Afterwards, Edge closed up his pants and yawned.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Here is good. - Wed Sep 30 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) enters the restaurant. He passes by the curtain and takes a seat in one of the tables. He had entered the restaurant because it looked rather exotic at first sight. Not only that, but its title was Gourmet Seafood. He was supposed to treat Rymei to elephant, but that clearly wasn't going to happen in -KIRIGAKURE-.

"Well, seafood is all we got."* - Wed Sep 30 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "Order for you? What do you expect me to order for you?" Edge asked, placing his elbow on the table. His chin rests on the back of his hand. "What, do you want me to order you the tentacle surprise? I'm sure you'd like that." He wags a fork in front of Rymei playfully.* - Wed Sep 30 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "If you say so." Edge stated, folding both of his arms across his chest. "Oi, waiter. Can we place an order? I'd like to order some fried calamari for my friend over there. Glass of soda as well. As for me, bring me some crab. I'll take a glass of iced tea on my half, though."* - Wed Sep 30 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "A ninja cola? Well, you're into something fizzy today, aren't you? Is it celebratory because you found your brother? Or is it something else?" He asked, chuckling. He makes some more small talk, while he clings the glass. His eyes wander across the room, finding it to be relatively filled due to its expenses. 

"It's coming straight out of my wallet you know. So I hope this food is good."* - Wed Sep 30 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) sighs. "You seem to have this sultry attitude going about." He commented, playfully waving his hand. "Anywho, when the food arrives, I hope it arrives on the most splendous of plates. Otherwise, I'm not paying the money's worth." He stated clearly. He didn't really organize the utensils; rather, he played with them. 

When the food arrived, they were layered on silver dishes. They were decorated to some extent, and small sauce cups were next to them.

"Well. It isn't too bad. Not as good as I expected though." The high expectations having Edge stated.* - Wed Sep 30 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) rose his eyebrows at Rymei. "What do you mean, I'll need the strength?" He questioned shortly, as he tears a piece of the crab up. He had targeted one of its appendages, deciding that he would start with the arms instead of the body. Crab meat would've been nice to dig into after all. Edge yanks out a good section of the crab meat from the supposed crab "bicep", and chews on it shortly.

After swallowing it, he sipped some of the iced tea. "I have a feeling I know what you're hinting at."* - Wed Sep 30 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "I don't mean anything. But we'll see later when we get back to the Village, no?" Edge stated, slowly sinking his teeth into te base of the crab. He wanted to use the sauce; however, Edge was slightly pretentious of the sauce's good intentions. After all, that red color was an ominous color.

To be quite fair though, he was eating a crab. Which are red. But that didn't matter. The sauce had weird yellow specks of chili in it too. 

Hell, Edge finally gave into his carnal desire to test it out, finding it to be delectable with the crab meat.

"When you're done eating, I'll put the yen down and we'll get going."* - Wed Sep 30 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "In the middle of public?" Edge questioned abruptly. Not that he minded. Edge scooted his chair forward into the table. His pants had been unzipped successfully by Rymei's hands, and out went his member. "So, is this the type of dessert you wanted? One with extra whipped cream?" Edge asked, almost in a whisper-like fashion as to not draw too much attention.

How inconspicuous though. Sex, while trying to hide from the eyes of the nearby citizens. It only turned the nymphomaniac on.* - Wed Sep 30 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) bit his lip to restrain himself from groaning or moaning in public. His member was placed within the confines of Rymei's wet mouth, the salivating pink tongue only working to prompt his member to throb happily against her. His legs wrap around Rymei's shoulders and they even cross over at the calves. * - Wed Sep 30 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // His legs clench onto her tightly. "Shit.." Edge muttered quietly, trying hard to restrain himself. He didn't even move, in order to remove any chances of suspicion from spectators. Edge's legs just tightly beckoned her to keep on sucking his thick member, which was oozing out precum from the way she caressed it with her tongue. * - Wed Sep 30 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) found it hard to resist at this point. Rymei's blowjob was incredibly satisfyin. His full length of twelve inches jammed itself into her throat and passed through her mouth on several an occassion as she continued to dive into his cock. "Fuck." -Edge muttered once more, bouncing his legs and shaking them from the ecstasy that was running up his spine; chills were prompting him to climax but he managed to edge just a bit longer. At some point, Edge had to force his cock out and with that, thick steaming ropes of semen flew onto Rymei's face.* - Wed Sep 30 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) zips up his own pants afterwards, sliding his hands underneath the table. "It apperas that fork's eluded you, huh?" Edge stated. He places a finger into a sauce cup, before aiming to place his finger against her cloak. "Oh, look... It appears you've gotten a little sauce on your cloak. Why don't we go wash it up in the bathroom?" Edge questioned, raising himself from his seat. "Com'on, Rymei."* - Wed Sep 30 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // Upon entering the bathroom, Edge pulls her into a stall and locks the stall tightly behind him. He had made sure to use the women's bathroom. Tends to be cleaner, that's all. 

Edge's hands reaches for her cloak, aiming to remove it from her and perhaps hang it from one of the metal hangers conveniently in the bathroom. "Now, since we're done with the appetizers, it's onto the main course, no?"* - Wed Sep 30 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) places his hand against the wall. "You'd be surprised. It's an insatiable lust." He half joked. Despite his refractory period, Edge had already prepared himself for a second round. Hell, he was ready to wake up the next morning exhausted to all hell. His hands grip onto Rymei's breasts. However, he suddenly wrapped his arms around her waist and yanked her up against the wall, being the only thing to hold her up at this point.

His cock was primed to move in on her, and he jabs it into her vagina with ease. * - Wed Sep 30 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thrusted deeply into Rymei's vagina, prodding against her g-spot and repeatedly smashing into her against the wall. Hell, Edge didn't seem to care that he was making a helluva noise against the wall. He desired to augment his speed; lust may have dictated his action at this point. "Gate of Opening -- Kai." Edge opened the Gate of Opening, enabling one-hundred percent muscle use. And there he went, speeding against Rymei's pussy and rocking her.* - Wed Sep 30 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // He had no worries about that. After several climaxes Rymei went through, Edge had eventually climaxed. Not only that, they toppled over the stall's wall, destroying it. Edge finished climaxing inside of Rymei, unsure of whether or not she may be pregnant from the exchange or not. However, upon completion, Edge was panting and sweating heavily.

"Oi. Maybe we should leave." He suggested, stating it between pants.* - Wed Sep 30 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) works to dress Rymei up. He also works to soothe the guards. Upon completion, he'd carry Rymei on his back, piggyback style. He too was fairly exhausted.

"Oi, Sabo... Where the hell did that kid go? ... Whatever, we figured out he's in Kirigakure and that he's still alive. It should be alright."* - Wed Sep 30 06:01:23 2015
