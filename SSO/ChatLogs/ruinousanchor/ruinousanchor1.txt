<br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) // He stands on the balls of his feet. His left arm and right arm hang loosely by his side. Shoulder-width apart were his legs; he'd be standing in anatomical position should only he have loosened the firm grip that churned red pastel colors across his metacarpals. Of course, he is a figure that is recognizable by the infamous figure named Zetsumo; however, Edge was not as close to famous as he may be.

"Zetsumo." Edge utters rather abruptly; the tone of his voice indicated that it was in no way confrontational. 

"I'd like to request an audience with you momentarily."* - Fri Sep 04 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) glances towards his sides as well as executes a minor glance to his back. Eventually, he settles on Zetsumo.* - Fri Sep 04 22:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) clenches his right hand. His metacarpals are dug into by his phalanges, which bend at the distal interphalangeal joint at a cripplingly disturbing angle; this may be perturbing to those gifted in terms of anatomy and were also able to see the angle at which he bent it. In fact, it almost appeared as if he had four joints in his digit.

"The naivety of Chiyari. . . And this is what I told Sunagakure. His naivety would put Sunagakure in danger. Put it in jeopardy. And I fucking called it." He stated aloud. "The current populace of Sunagakure is blinded by a idyllic fantasy. Orakuru? Tethys? Both of them are none of my concern. I suppose they're more akin to yours. Doesn't mean I won't help you dispose of them if you want me to though."

Slowly, his seething rage subsided as he continued to ramble.

"Take this." He tosses two million over to Zetsumo.

"Pay for your services thus far. Since nothing you have done has actually damaged my plans in the long-run."* - Fri Sep 04 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) chuckles.* - Fri Sep 04 23:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) reaches into his pouch, before taking out a plain white scroll. He chucks it to Zetsumo casually with an underhand throw.* - Fri Sep 04 23:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) examines Naoko momentarily, from top to bottom.

"Who are you?"* - Fri Sep 04 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) removes his mask momentarily as well as his cloak.* - Fri Sep 04 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) slowly steps over to Rymei. His right hand runs itself along the side of her hip.* - Sat Sep 05 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: She may need to be broken in... - Sat Sep 05 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: If you know what I mean... - Sat Sep 05 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: I wouldn't mind....watching... - Sat Sep 05 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) quietly backed off from Rymei in the meantime, opting for Naoko.

"Well, Naoko. It seems you're the lucky one today. You get to firsthand witness the results of training. Something even you could achieve." -Edge stated.- "Now then, for that pay to be given to you, you as a maid, must obey my orders. None of which will maim you or harm you. Is that agreed upon?" -Edge asked, closing distance.* - Sat Sep 05 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) whispers: I suppose it wouldn't hurt. - Sat Sep 05 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) glances at the chastity belt, inspecting it for whatever material it was made of.* - Sat Sep 05 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // With a single stroke of his right hand, Edge's pants had been undone. Their once snug wrapped position around his waist had been dispersed and Edge had his member out in the open. Edge trusted Naoko. He trusted Naoko's desire for money at least. 

"So tell me. Why do you work for money? What interests you? Why is money important to you?" In all honesty, they were all the same question, merely worded in different ways to showcase Edge as articulate. He grabs hold of both sides of Naoko's waist at this point.* - Sat Sep 05 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "I see. You have a stoic facial expression. How I desire to see it contort with whimpers and feelings of pleasure which send chills up thy spine." Edge runs his right hand across her hip, along her ilyac spine. Eventually, he stops at the side of her hip once more, before suddenly lifting her up into the air. 

His head leaned into Naoko's chest. Tensely, his teeth eagerly aim to grip hold of Naoko's left nipple though not ferociously enough to cause bleeding. His penis aimed to insert its head within Naoko's confines, pressing against her labia to squeeze against her cervix.* - Sat Sep 05 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // Both of Edge's arms wrap around Naoko's waist, though his hands still rest firmly upon opposite hips. Edge runs his cock through her vagina, running against her tight cervix. Edge eventually turns around to face Rymei, while he held Naoko in the stand & carry position during his jabbing of her innards. 

His cock pressed onwards through her cervix, threatening to slam into her g-spot over and over again with each continual thrust, which Edge wasn't too worried about in terms of stamina.

"Rymei, you too, strip. You'll be after Naoko."* - Sat Sep 05 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // Edge didn't like the idea of Rymei heading towards his rear side. "No, Rymei. Down." -Edge stated quickly, already knowlegeable of Rymei's fantasies of anal. Edge's eyes scan her body though, nonetheless; he was still always surprised by her. 

In unison with Naoko though, thrusts were made, continually. "Lay down on the ground, Rymei--ngh." -Edge stated in a demanding, almost authoritative manner. Edge continued to pummel Naoko's innards at the same time. The last ngh was merely a moan, perhaps coming from his invasion of Naoko's privates.* - Sat Sep 05 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // Suddenly, Edge leaned over, keeling over towards Rymei before dropping Naoko off ontop of Rymei momentarily. Edge slowly pulled his cock out of her innards. 

"So. I'll give some love to both of you in this one." Edge stated, before channeling his muscles. His forehead made a bulge. A vein popped and he suddenly felt a surge of energy. He grips hold of Rymei and sandwiches his front ontop of Naoko. Suddenly, his cock penetrates Rymei's pussy, and Edge speeds up his process. His hands wildly spank Naoko's behind.* - Sat Sep 05 01:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // Edge thrusted within Rymei over and over again without any discernable rhythm. His body was moving much faster than it normally would; clearly, Edge was in the effort of trying to mindbreak Rymei at this point. His hands grip tightly on Naoko's asscheeks, her assets being the only thing giving Edge some sane balance as he borderlined on ecstasy. * - Sat Sep 05 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // In finality, Edge reared his body backwards and pulled his cock out. Suddenly, his jizz sprays all over the two's bodies, ropes of white thick trails draping them and coloring them in the color white. Edge leans his head back momentarily, sating his nymphomaniac tendencies for a short while.* - Sat Sep 05 01:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) pulls away from the two of them, slowly zipping up his pants. Edge was a nymphomaniac; this sexual drive of his was something that could not be blocked by a couple of impediments such as a refractory period. Edge slowly steps to the side, deactivating his Gate, and resting himself momentarily.* - Sat Sep 05 01:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) makes a single hand gesture.

His forces make their way into Sunagakure's gate. The workers he had implanted in Sunagakure's army released the gates' locks and latches for him, detailing him on various information. 

Two-thousand soldiers make their way into Sunagakure grounds.* - Sun Sep 06 22:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(RuinousAnchor) glances around Sunagakure momentarily. Silently, the ANBU Agent removes his mask. His eyes shift over to Izanami, before finally settling themselves on the mansion.

"An impressive expanse. Sunagakure has truly never looked better." He clapped his hands.

"I'm glad that it's in the palm of capable hands now." 

Edge stated, smirking. 

"Go, men. Remove this village of the infidels that haunt it."* - Sun Sep 06 22:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [AWKWARD] - Sun Sep 06 22:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [I thought you were the Anbu Agent near the Mansion] - Sun Sep 06 22:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [been talking to his AFK ass for like 30 mins] - Sun Sep 06 22:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) whispers: [LOL.] - Sun Sep 06 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [What did I miss?] - Sun Sep 06 22:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // His army enunciates on their actions, riddling victims with several holes in their body from emphasized technological advancement. "Well then. Rymei, I wish for you to handle any usurpants. At the same time, protect me with your life." Edge stated. He directs his army in the manner he desired them to.

"Now, work army. Follow my commands. The eastern front and the western front will be clogged by our forces. The five-hundred should have already created what I intended them to create. The sewage system is in place and ready. The explosives are all set and ready for my usage. And most of all, this is what's important."

He snaps his fingers. The walls of Sunagakure stretch upwards with boards. These boards seem to collapse into a dome-like formation around Sunagakure's walls and patterns. Their intention? No, it was becoming clear. This had been set up years before under the segment of the army he controlled. Boards uplifted to cast a dense shadow on the ground.

The necromancers manipulated this new shadow, all of them creating a formation in the center of Sunagakure in meditation.

"Now then. We will commence Operation #666."* - Sun Sep 06 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) whispers: [You missed me about to buttfuck Sunagakure.] - Sun Sep 06 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) whispers: [But you're in time.] - Sun Sep 06 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [im killing his daughter.] - Sun Sep 06 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) whispers: [So am I.] - Sun Sep 06 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [HEH] - Sun Sep 06 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [Infront of him!] - Sun Sep 06 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [let him unlock MS and then get killed. *nod*] - Sun Sep 06 22:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) chuckles calmly. "It is in this weakness that you will fall." He states calmly. "Now then. Your council members should be within the confines of the mansion, am I correct?" He questions, unsure if the Council's location had changed in recent years due to his absence.* - Sun Sep 06 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "You are simply a fool. You have no idea. You were there to see Chiyari exile me. And you know why I couldn't speak. It was because I was stripped of the opportunity to speak my case. Your people were foolish, naive, and blind to the fact. They were all blind. Just like Chiyari."

"Do you know what that smell is? It's something Chiyari and his dogs are probably familiar with. It's blood. The same blood that's covering Konohagakure at this very moment, most likely."

"And we all know when Chiyari returns, my attempt at Sunagakure has been removed. I can occupy it, but I cannot risk a defense, as you may know." He states, before snapping his fingers. Explosions raze soldiers loyal to Chiyari and kill off several bandits indiscriminately. "Bandits do not belong in this village, though. Let me make that clear. This village is Sunagakure. Not some vagabond mercenary's land."* - Sun Sep 06 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [you could totally remake Sunagakure by keeping the dome and planting stuff.] - Sun Sep 06 22:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) draws his blade. Suddenly, Edge's blade is swung towards the council members. One by one, he decapitates them. Those that attempt to flee are restrained by his soldiers. Soldiers restrain Fujitora and his daughter as well, holding them to the ground if applicable. However, they were unarmed, as if it were a sign of peace.

"One by one. These imbeciles shall be executed."* - Sun Sep 06 23:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) starts to laugh.* - Sun Sep 06 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: So. - Sun Sep 20 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Have you been training, Rymei? - Sun Sep 20 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Not really. - Sun Sep 20 19:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: I wouldn't be too sure...I dropped into Amegakure a week ago...They were still fighting. - Sun Sep 20 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Any idea of the troop number on every side? - Sun Sep 20 20:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And Sunagakure? - Sun Sep 20 20:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: How is that doing? - Sun Sep 20 20:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: No idea. - Sun Sep 20 20:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Then we'll lead the troops to an outpost near Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 20:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And we'll start stationing troops for a conquest of Sunagakure's desert. - Sun Sep 20 20:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: We'll need to train and recruit some more potent soldiers to our case. - Sun Sep 20 20:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Where do you plan on finding these soldiers? - Sun Sep 20 20:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'd like to avoid any contact with Kirigakure...at least for now. - Sun Sep 20 20:09:23 2015

"Unfortunate. Then I will have to look elsewhere."

He was immediately noticing of Ikarus's lavendar eyes.

In return, his own lavendar eyes rested on Ikarus's eyes.* - Sun Sep 27 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Observe my handseals. - Sun Sep 27 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) is relatively intelligent and can tell that Anguo would not understand the technique's mechanics less he show him each seal individually. Thusly, Edge demonstrates each of the five handseals one by one. After showing the hand formations for each seal, Edge brought his thumb up to his mouth and bit it, revealing blood.

"You'll need blood to summon a contract. Blood is essential because it represents your life energy and acts as a signature that only belongs to you, identifying you based on blood type, texture, and whatnot." 

Edge explained, before slamming his hand on the ground. A Summoning Contract formed and a rat exitted.* - Sun Sep 27 02:43:50 2015

"Next to my name, sign your name in blood."* - Sun Sep 27 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You know how to sign your name, yes? - Sun Sep 27 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 02:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: A B-Rank Technique. - Sun Sep 27 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: B-Rank? - Sun Sep 27 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) quietly observes Anguo. "I see. You're well-disciplined. I wonder who taught you to be so well-disciplined and eager to train. I'm already prideful to have a child who excels in such a prodigal manner such as yourself." Edge stated calmly and clearly. * - Sun Sep 27 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) receives said popsicle. He splits it in half and offers one of the pieces to his son, Anguo.

"It's vanilla. Hopefully, you're not disdainful about it."* - Sun Sep 27 03:06:01 2015

Should he penetrate, he would completely destroy Ossa's chakra system as well as immobilize him temporarily.

"Enough of your actions." He was able to see the attack due to the property of the eyes. His eyes were capable of seeing chakra as it moved. Of course, it did not rival the Byakugan's, though it did seem to rival the Sharingan at the very least. "You will not be hurting anyone at this moment."* - Sun Sep 27 04:05:45 2015

He unleashes it promptly, ferromagnetism being circulated from the inner contents and being fired out. 

"Ever buy weapons before? With a million dollars?"

It exitted at speeds perhaps easily breaking three-hundred miles an hour. Hell, it was akin to a bullet, but that wasn't the case. It was merely a magnet superheated and sealed while it was superheated. Upon exit, the rapid cooling and exposure to a new atmosphere rapidly energized the ferromagnetic properties of the magnet and thusly fired it out with excessive force and heat. * - Sun Sep 27 04:19:24 2015

Upon collision with the ground, the ground below Ossa rumbles and erupts abruptly. A massive cat comes out of nowhere, attempting to wrap around him with the size of a giant summoning.
