<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) says: This is good enough. - Fri Nov  6 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(RuinousAnchor) paces to the left quietly, before shifting his weight to the right.

"I wouldn't have you take the exams for no reason, no doubt. But, it's because I believe in your mettle that I think you can pass. I have gifted you with two great weapons that will aid you in your fight against the Gezo."

Suddenly, Shinjin's face warps into that of a twisted facial expression. His eyes are nearly bulging out of their eyesockets and his mouth contorts into that of a wicked smile. "What the fuck kind of bullshit am I spouting?" 

He laughs loudly. He glances at Takeda. "I've not the time to play your caretaker, Takeda-kun." His right hand moves to his face. Suddenly, his right hand begins to strip away at the mask that was his face, revealing his true identity.

Edge.

"Your caretaker died -long- ago with the information you gave me so lovingly."* - Fri Nov  6 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | He twists his neck towards Takeda, upon his pivotal axis. His eyes glaze over Takeda briefly. "Maybe it's because you remind me of myself when I was a youth. Perhaps it is because your appearance is so enticing. Or maybe it is simply because I enjoy toying with your emotional self. Seriously, you should cast them aside, perhaps you'd not be losing the ones closest to you if you had."

He states, stepping forward. "I'd advise you to not step away any further, less you wish to make my job harder. Making my job harder is proportional to the amount of pain you might receive."

He continues. "Of course, you're always free to let...."

"Those emotions of yours rampage and attack me. But that wouldn't do, now would it?"* - Fri Nov  6 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: My lord, I think I can almost.... - Fri Nov  6 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Oh, do try. - Fri Nov  6 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I always loved assassination attempts. - Fri Nov  6 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Though this isn't exactly my style---since I'm already fucking aware of it. - Fri Nov  6 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | "Quite fast at your handseals." Edge stated, as soon as he started with his first handseal. Edge activates the seal located on his right wrist, unsheathing his Dine Edge and shoving it in front of Takeda. His goal was to pierce straight through Takeda's hands and remove him from any ability to utilize his string of handseals. 

"But, what do you think is faster? The unsealing of a weapon or the tedious, weary handseals you're predisposed to use?" He questions. His left foot raises simultaneously, aiming to quite literally kick Takeda in the mandible and blow him upwards into the air, to land quite a distance from him if the sequence was executed.* - Fri Nov  6 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) found the Exploding Flame Shot headed towards him while Takeda got himself up to stance. Unfortunately, Edge was not so easy to kill, nor was it easy to find the perceptive individual that he was off-guard. His eyesight had quickly caught the technique in execution. 

His left hand unseals the weapon in question. A weapon is unlocked, a gun that was constructed out of gun metallic materials. The gun faces Takeda, aiming to quite literally shoot him in the side. 

Naturally, that didn't stop the Exploding Flame Shot. Edge's body moves in tandem with the shot, trying to elude the Exploding Flame Shot while Takeda was on such bad footing.

If successful, he'd fire another round into Takeda's back mercilessly, only to hear his screams.* - Fri Nov  6 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | "And you continue to annoy me with your impertinence!" Edge scowls. "I am telling you I have no -time- for this." He fires off his Senbon Gun once more, trying to strike into Takeda's kneecap. If done, it'd shut down his meddlesome movement. Edge's body keeps on moving, moving with rapid and unwasted steps to close the distance between him and his foe, while also maintaining safety & security. 

"I'm quite literally done with this incessant folly." He mutters. His hands begin to warp into a string of handseals---these handseals are surprisingly fast despite his injured state. 

He winces lightly, but it is unnoticeable due to his many practices of changing facial expression.* - Fri Nov  6 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) blinks.

"Oh, very well done. A strategist by heart! However, collapsing a mere corridor is not akin to a cavern's collapse. You will be coming with me." He slams his hands on the ground. Shackles from the sides emit from green portals that form in the air around Takeda, aiming to violently grip his hands, wrists, legs, ankles, and in general, his appendages. 

As clockwork operates to try and trap them into a cubical complex, they'd find themselves in nearly a separate dimension altogether --- it was a form of reverse summoning into the cage.

"Let's begin the execution."* - Fri Nov  6 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) grins. He walks over to Takeda slowly. His head cranes so that he could get a better perspective of his mandible. His right hand pinches Takeda's jawline, before running against the flat region of his jaw nearby his ear.

"Let's see.. body, to the angle, to the ramus, into the temporomandibular joint. I wonder how it feels to have the synovial membrane broken... I guess I must find out."

A single spike enters the area, stabbing the mandibular joint connecting Takeda's jaw to his skull.* - Fri Nov  6 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Really, I wonder what kind of brain is held behind those bones. - Fri Nov  6 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Maybe I should detach the coronal suture. - Fri Nov  6 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Or maybe lambdoital would give me a better view of what you fucking see through your eyes. - Fri Nov  6 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Nonetheless, I am very curious to see what will happen if I crush your joints. - Fri Nov  6 05:35:21 2015

"Right. Um. I'm going to say goodbye to you at this point." Suddenly, the King of Hell erupts from behind him. The fires are restrained by the chains wrapped around his wrists, preventing him from actually tossing them at Edge.

"I'll be having your soul."

His ever watchful eyes glare at the environment; he takes in his surroundings and what was at his capacity for disposal in potential combat. Nevertheless, he did hope that matters would not draw to such an extent, and merely waits near the gate, where guards stand-off with tense expectations. 

Upon Ortho's arrival, Edge brushes his bangs aside to his left. 

"Are you the leader of this settlement? If so, I must compliment you on what a job you've accomplished. Not often do I find the innovator type in this ninja world. * - Sat Nov 21 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | Red eyes make contact with purple spiralled veins plastered on Edge's cornea. Edge's iris suddenly contracts, diverting into a slit-like feature for a brevity of an instant, before it relaxes back to its originally spherical shape. Edge turns around, stepping forward. Once that single step had been executed, Edge reruns his focus, riveting himself back to Ortho.

"Red eyes. The blood eyes of the Gezo's myths."

"Ironic. That I am the villain with the purple eyes of justice, and you are the hero with the red eyes of pandemonium."

His eyes settle themselves on Eri, whose posture and maneuvers indicated a sense of restlessness, trepidation, and anxiety. 

He unleashes his aura, letting it bring forth tension from all parties in the vicinity.

Your settlement bears potential. Of course, potential means nothing if the bearer cannot make use of it; nurture it in a way, I suppose." Edge muses gently.

"But yes, I do suggest you sheathe your eyes in the next few seconds. Otherwise, there will be casualties I wish not to occur." 

A valiant threat emits from Edge's vocals, hitting the atmosphere with the thud and crank of heat on steel bars.

One or two seconds. That was all it took for him to complete every single individual handseal needed for his ninjutsu. Edge squatted down; his hand was now moments away from touching the ground.

"I wonder what type of Kuchiyose this is." Edge muses.

"Hopefully not a -bad- one. One that might kill you and your precious lady over there."* - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015

Edge's hand smacks the ground. Suddenly, erupting from the earth itself was a massive dog-like statue intent on capturing, ensnaring, and trapping Supaiku, Eri, Uchiha, Ortho, and multiple other shinobi.

"I'm sure you're a durable one. I just want to see what you value more: your life or your woman's."

The dog statue, should it succeed in capturing them, would simply remain in place. Lights would stream from every corner of the dog statue. Enveloped in a bright white sheen of glorious purgatory, the ensnared would find themselves in despair.

"Bloody Mary."

He'd snap his fingers. It only gave them little time to react.* - Sat Nov 21 21:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) cranes his head over towards Menma. 

"I will be leaving. Don't worry." He looks on to the spectators of the fight, who all seemed too bewildered to make a move. Not only that, but the caucus of Edge's soldiers seemed to keep them at a stalemate of a standstill.

Edge approaches the dog statue. Once the explosions had ceased, his hand would be placed upon it, letting it unveil and uncap both Ortho and Eri. 

As it revealed Ortho, Eri, and Hatsujin, Edge makes his way over to Ortho.

Regardless of the state of Ortho, Edge unveils a chakra receiver to force Ortho into the ground. He'd grab hold of Ortho's free hand and place it atop of his other, before plunging the chakra receiver to skewer both of his hands with the ground.

"Now then. I'm going to tell you something. Listen carefully."

Edge would proceed to yank Eri out from underneath him, regardless of her condition and hold her to his side, left hand now moving behind his body.

"Pay attention."* - Sat Nov 21 21:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) | | An impressive and valiant effort. Edge hadn't a clue that there were ninja with the capacity to even react after such a violent, brutalizing explosion. Edge observes Eri for the moment.

With their abilities though, there was no need to simply eradicate all of them. Edge knew their potential. He'd only leave a message. His left hand's fingertips glow with an ominous purple light.

"This is a curse technique. She will die in exactly ten days, unless you succeed in attacking Sunagakure. In six days from now, you will attack Sunagakure no Sato from the northern flank with your entire force. Your goal is to eradicate their northern wall. Maintain your alliance with them until then."

"Because if you don't succeed, she dies. Unless I dispel this curse."

Secretly, this wasn't a curse. But they wouldn't know unless they had the jutsu themselves. Upon contact, this technique would knock Eri out.
