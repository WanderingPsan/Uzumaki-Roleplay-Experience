<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) draws the receiver and proceeds to thrust it straight through Koeki's stomach, aiming for her gastric cavity. Upon collision, Edge would raise himself from the ground and drag Koeki by her hair, aiming to drag her out of the village.* - Wed Oct  7 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: It seems I won't find a birthday present for her here.  - Wed Oct  7 04:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) is able to sense with his Rinnegan. He avoids it, dragging Koeki along mercilessly across the pavement.

"Come, Anguo. We're taking a caravan."* - Wed Oct  7 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Lady Koeki... what do I do? should I fight? - Wed Oct  7 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) had not imagined the precipitation of such an event. Edge's hand had let go of Koeki promptly. His eyes widened at the sight and Edge was literally stunned momentarily. A Bijuu was before his eyes. Its putrid gaseous substance was fast and ultimately dangerous. Edge moves. And it was fast. He breaks his own body in order to move, activating the Gate of Opening promptly. He grips onto his son and for a moment, he zoomed away, trying to escape.

He clutches his son within his grasp as he escapes the fatal embrace of the beast. However, he is unable to prevent himself from receiving third-degree chemical burns along the entirety of his back, scarring him for the rest of his life and burning through nerve tissue within his back. Parts of his olecranon and parts of his shoulders are severely burned, as well as parts of his legs. The skin melts off and his muscles begin to burn off as well. 

As soon as he arrives at the entrance, Edge is already in a near-death situation, using his private caravan to seize escape as quickly as possible, while mitigating the suffering of his son.* - Wed Oct  7 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) approaches the scene. He emerges from his hut of a shelter. Edge's hands were solemn at his waistline. His eyes were lucidly gray; perhaps a result of the grievous injuries he received at the hand of Koeki when he had finally slain her. Edge finally arrives at the arena, eager to speak with Anguo regarding matters, seeing as he had just 'abducted' Anguo from Kirigakure.

"Ang-." He had started his words, but had stopped abruptly upon noticing Misa. Not only that, but Anguo said the word "mother." 

Edge finally places his eyes on Misa. His lavendar purple eyes, with a single ring around the iris, were beading up and shaking with anticipation. 

"....Misa?"* - Fri Oct  9 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) notices an individual he could not recognize. His right hand rushes to his holster and drags out a scroll. His left hand remains by his side, though claws its way up his stomach. Edge inches forward, edging towards Misa and Anguo at the same time. Cypher was here for some reason or another. 

Somehow, both of these people had gotten past his two-thousand soldiers. He wasn't sure how Cypher managed to get into Genjigakure, especially due to the caravan system in Genjigakure being closed. It would mean both individuals in question, in Genjigakure, had infiltrated.

He didn't mind Misa. He did mind the one he did not know, somehow infiltrating his defenses.* - Fri Oct  9 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) looks at Misa and Rymei. He then glances at Anguo.

"It's... been a long time. Misa." He directs his conversation to Misa first, wondering how she might react to him. Edge bit his lip regretfully. * - Sat Oct 10 00:10:40 2015

"I'm... glad that we can be together again. Perhaps as a family." He states. He looks towards Rymei at this point.

"Rymei.... has been my bodyguard for a while, Misa. I found her when she was being auctioned as slave." Edge stated calmly. * - Sat Oct 10 00:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) attempts to approach Misa. He is slow in his pace though, indicating that he was injured. His right hand eagerly attempts to press against Misa's left cheek. Suddenly, Edge's face would near hers, aiming to kiss her lovingly and passionately. His left arm aimed to wrap around her waist should she let him.* - Sat Oct 10 00:24:19 2015

"And what would you like me to do for you to soothe your ails?" He questioned lightly. "I'm sure that... you didn't just drain yourself of all emotion from all of those events." Edge was half-certain Misa had been crying at least at some point. Edge's right hand grips onto Misa's waist and his left hand grips onto her shoulder from behind. He'd bring her close to his face, perhaps slightly forcibly. 

"I'm ashamed that I wasn't there for you at the beginning of that ordeal. Tell me. Is there anything you want me to do? Perhaps revenge on any of these people?"* - Sun Oct 11 01:20:12 2015
