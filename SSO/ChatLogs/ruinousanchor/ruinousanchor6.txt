The dog creature was brown in color and was tall, perhaps numbering eighty meters in height. Not only that, but the dog creature was able to cover the group of them, capable of imprisoning them in the smallest of caves.

"I love this. Good work, Rymei." Edge whispers. "Now, let's take a few steps back for the -scenic- view." He states. He takes hold of Rymei's hand and starts to step a few paces back. The poison ball had managed to get by, but that didn't matter. Edge had them trapped --- it was all that was necessary for the next technique.

While Edge moves backwards, he snaps his fingers.

In a cataclysm of explosions, the innards of the statue light up.

Every single part of the inner statue had an Explosive Tag on it. Explosive Tag Balls, canonballs attached to the walls, metal shuriken, Fuuma Windmill Shuriken, Giant Shuriken. There were just so many different tools in it. (Inspired by Hogetsu.)

There are so many explosions that it occurs three times, smashing and smashing and blowing up everything with its incendiary prowess.

Since Kyushiki was probably on the ground and looked as shit as everyone else, Edge would judge him as dead. His Rinnegan ran over Kyushiki, though it too was fooled by the imprint of death...seeing as Kyushiki had taken such lethal damage. 

His eyes now land on Maloth, who was paying no attention to him.

"You survived that. You're as strong as the rumors tell me..." He makes no other move other than his comment.

A merciless killer. He spared no one: not even children.

Next, was the main course. Maloth. Edge's right hand aims to grab hold of Maloth. He is weak though, and cannot pick him up as easily as he'd like to.

Instead, he weaves a series of handseals. Preparatory actions for his next move of course. He places his right hand on Maloth's body, using the ROOT Sealing method to seal his movements up.
