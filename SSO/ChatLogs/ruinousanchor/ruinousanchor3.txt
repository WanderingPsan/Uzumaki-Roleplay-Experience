<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) walks over to Pandora, pacing with her with interdisciplinary anger. His right hand attempted to grip hold of her head. "You're going to have to pay me back for this."* - Sat Oct  3 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Suck on my dick. - Sat Oct  3 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) grips the sides of Pandora's temple with his hand. His strength gradually increases. His free hand unzips his pants and his floppy member is removed. Quite literally, he slaps Pandora across the face with his dick.

"I said. Suck it."* - Sat Oct  3 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: . . . . . - Sat Oct  3 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) runs his right hand through her hair. His right hand presses against her temple at some point, motioning her forward as well as keeping some degree of grip incase she attempted to bite his dick. His illuminating lavendar eyes remained on her as she sucked on his member. His shaft hardened and pushed deeper into Pandora's throat, before finally, he jammed it into her throat all the way, without her permission.* - Sat Oct  3 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) kept on shoving his cock down Pandora's throat, thrusting in and out of her mouth and using her mouth as if it were a pussy. Edge seemed to have no problem with the rough behavior and brutal treatment he was having with Pandora; in fact, he revelled in the fact that he could dominate this girl like so. "Com'on. Use that tongue of yours. You'll be a professional with handling long lengths after this."* - Sat Oct  3 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) yanked his cock out of her mouth. His cock twitches and throbs wildly, before firing out its wet white ropes all over Pandora's face, covering it blatantly in white. "Now then. Now that we're doing with the appetizer, let's move onto the main course, shall we?" He asked. His hands aimed to grapple hold of Pandora and yank her up onto his person, so that they were in a stand & carry position.* - Sat Oct  3 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "Unfortunately, you don't have the choice to decide when." Edge stated. "You have wasted my time. Now, I'm going to play with you how I wish." Edge states. Suddenly, Edge's right hand slides out with a chakra receiver, which seizes hold of Pandora's clothing and pierces through it to discard it. Edge then keeps it in one hand as he aims to single-handedly hold her up with his free hand.

"Naturally, if you don't comply, you receive another pole up your ass. We wouldn't want that, now, would we?"* - Sat Oct  3 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: That's what I thought. - Sat Oct  3 05:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) reaches in the refridgerator and withdraws various herbs. He molds them into bandages using chakra and walks over to Ryomen.

"Show me your injuries. I'll plaster some herbal bandages over you."* - Sun Oct  4 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) wraps the herbal bandages around certain areas of Ryomen. "Well, hopefully, this should soothe your wounds. You won't be feeling too much pain after I finish wrapping the rest of you up." He stated.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: In the meantime though. - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm? - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: It took me a lot of effort to find you. - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: At the moment that I calculated. - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You had the most potential. - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Out of the Kirigakure -ninja-. - Sun Oct  4 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: All of them huh? - Sun Oct  4 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You have ambition. - Sun Oct  4 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Kenshin trained you. - Sun Oct  4 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: From my research. - Sun Oct  4 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But you're not used to being..... - Sun Oct  4 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And I will buy you weapons. - Sun Oct  4 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You will be free to go after my desires are over with. - Sun Oct  4 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And Kenshin will be free to visit you. - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: The deal seems fabulous, doesn't it? - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess...? - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But tell me. - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: How did you ever get separated from Kenshin? - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well, I can't really..say. - Sun Oct  4 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or I would gladly tell you. - Sun Oct  4 05:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I usually figure out what happened. - Sun Oct  4 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You get a couple of bruises and bumps. - Sun Oct  4 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Or someone puts a -bounty- on your head to be delivered to them. - Sun Oct  4 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Like I did. - Sun Oct  4 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Uh-huh.. - Sun Oct  4 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "Like so." Edge commented. His right hand slides along her thigh and aims to tear off her kimono from the lower down. His strength was surprising, for a rather bookwormish individual. 

"And as such, I can inspect you for any "beauty" marks."* - Sun Oct  4 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) runs his hand across her back promptly. 

"You've been through quite a bit of torture. I can tell. As a torture specialist, I adore it myself." Edge muttered. He felt sympathy for the girl, to some extent. He was only really interested in the competition between proteges of Kenshin.

"Why don't we see which one of us is the most talented of Kenshin's students with a game?" 

Edge questioned. His pants had been drawn down promptly and his member was prodding at Kohaku's asshole. Mainly because it said "No Entry". He was attracted to breaking the rules... and breaking many other things.* - Sun Oct  4 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Sadly, she can't ever see my own back. - Sun Oct  4 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Her back reminds me of my own. - Sun Oct  4 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: The only reason she isn't like me is because she doesn't have power. That's something I'll fix though. - Sun Oct  4 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // His hands wrap around Kohaku's face. His mouth aims to seize her lips quickly and quietly.

"No. In truth, I brought you.... for a different reason." He stated quietly. "However, you have to give me a break. I'm.... a nymphomaniac." He struggles to say the word. "I need this." He stated calmly. And that was the truth. He struggled with going about daily activity without some sexual activity mixed in.

"I'll tell you what I need afterwards. I'm not only going to use you for sex. You're not a prostitute. No, I brought here because of your prowess as a ninja, not your prowess as a woman."

His cock prods her asshole and slowly, the head of his dick entered her asshole.* - Sun Oct  4 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // He could tell after he had entered that Kohaku's body seemed to be rejecting it. Edge withdrew his cock from her asshole, before placing it against her pussy. He seemed to have no qualm with the difference in age. He didn't care whether or not it was consensual either: it was Edge's persona.

"I sicken you? I see that we may not have quite an amiable relationship." Edge stated, pumping his rod into her pussy. His hands gripped onto her sides. "But let's see. I think we'll be a good match for each other. That's what I personally think." He states, opening the Gate of Opening in the midst of fucking Kohaku, in order to rapidly speed up the rate he pumped and pummeled her entrance.* - Sun Oct  4 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // "I wouldn't dream of it." He stated quietly, as he continued to push his cock inside of her. He continued to pummel her, pumping faster and harder inside of her pussy. He definitely didn't care about how angry she got at this point. He passionately keeps on fucking her, grabbing hold of her sides as he rammed her deeply. Eventually, he came, ejecting his cock from her pussy only to spray it all over her ass cheeks. Upon climax, Edge zipped up his pants.

"Welcome to the group."* - Sun Oct  4 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: The seal is to prevent you from exitting Genjigakure. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Nothing more. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: As for your tongue. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm dispelling it. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So you pulled me from being a slave..to being a sex slave for you. - Sun Oct  4 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // At this point, Edge returned to his normal demeanor. His right hand reaches for Kohaku's mouth and his left hand tries to pull her tongue out. 

It was a good question to note though. How the fuck did Edge know she had a ROOT Seal on her mouth? 

That'd be revealed through the purple eyes he had, bearing a single ring.

His left index aims to dispel the ROOT Seal promptly, due to his intellect allowing him to decipher it.* - Sun Oct  4 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: No. - Sun Oct  4 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) nods. "It sounds about right. You jet out your leg rapidly in order to deliver a series of kicks. Do you know what the flaw is though, with the Boulons de Foudre? You require extremely good eyesight to hit pinpoint locations." Edge stated, not giving Kohaku a chance or opportunity to respond to his question.* - Sun Oct  4 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: This vision that Kenshin has enables him to run quickly as well. - Sun Oct  4 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm aware that you may have inherited the Hit & Run stance. - Sun Oct  4 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But you may not be within the stance for dodging. - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: What if I threw it at you while you were resting? - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: How will you dodge? - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Expect the unexpected. - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And I'll get closer as we proceed. - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sun Oct  4 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) reaches into his holster for a single scroll. Within the contents were ten different seals bearing different amounts of weaponry and varying kinds of weapons. He unseals the first seal, firing out three kunai at Kohaku. They seemed to be designed to target the torso region.* - Sun Oct  4 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) unseals the second scroll. Out from the scroll came about thirty Senbon. All of them were pinpoint on what targets they desired to strike; roughly dividing themselves up equally between regions of the body. Some of them even covered the left and right sides of the area, aiming to blindside Kohaku should he sidestep.* - Sun Oct  4 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) nods quietly. He was making certain that Kohaku had basic skills in terms of jutsu. He takes a step forward and unseals the next tool, aimed towards Kohaku's shoulder.

It was unsealed. In that one second, the object had flown out at tremendous speeds rivalling 350 mph. * - Mon Oct  5 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I'll be authentically impressed if she can dodge this one. - Mon Oct  5 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Intentionally, it won't hurt her in a lethal manner at least. - Mon Oct  5 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: . . . . . .  . - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I see. - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: So you're able to avoid the first two but not the ferromagnet. - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: That's to be expected though. - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I don't waste time though. - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Stand up. - Mon Oct  5 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What now? - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Follow me. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And you're going to follow the entire way. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) // He prompts Kohaku briefly. Suddenly, Edge jets forward in front of her, expecting her to gain on him anyways. "Follow me. We're going to have a miniature race. However, the goal is to increase our stamina. I want to see if you can keep up with me." Edge stated. He--despite being protege of Kenshin--does not run as fast as one may presume. * - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) keeps on running. "Anywho. Tell me more about yourself. And also, stop being annoyed." Edge rolled his eyes. He could tell by the tone in her voice that she was angry at him, despite complying with his orders.* - Mon Oct  5 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: There isn't anything else you need to know about me. - Mon Oct  5 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) keeps on running, listening to her banter.

"I see. Kenshin, Fujitora, Sanoke. So which one of them did you want to be pummeled by the most?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Like, who did you want to fuck the most? - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm sure it was Fujitora. - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Maybe Sanoke. - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I didn't wanna fuck anyone! - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But Fujitora's two inch penis might not be enough, you know? - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Right, right, whatever you say. - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't fucking like any of that. - Mon Oct  5 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: If you say so. - Mon Oct  5 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Edge, if you -really- want me to get to like you. - Mon Oct  5 00:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or ruin their life. - Mon Oct  5 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm not sure if I want you to like me in a romantic way. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: But I don't mind having you as a friend. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Preferably with benefits. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And I also don't mind dirtying my hands when I kill people. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So how about..No benefits? - Mon Oct  5 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I wouldn't rape you. - Mon Oct  5 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm sure it'd be consensual at some point. - Mon Oct  5 00:46:04 2015
