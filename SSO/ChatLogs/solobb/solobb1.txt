<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Puts his head on his right hand bored expression maintained but lightning up with a flicker in his eye.. "Naoya, wiped out an entire village supposedly." He appears to be seventeen.* - Wed Nov 11 22:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends what kind of present it is. - Wed Nov 11 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Reaches behind himself for a red pebble, he tossed it towards Akira with intent to send the red pebble over his forehead towards the entrance to the hokage mansion, upon landing the case would snap open and begin to explode into a burst of red gas reaching for Akira from behind, unless he caught it in which case the effect would be alot different and it would go off in his hands.* - Wed Nov 11 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Naoya Reaches behind himself with a frown for a red pebble, he tossed it towards Akira with intent to send the red pebble over his forehead towards the entrance to the hokage mansion, upon landing the case would snap open and begin to explode into a burst of red gas reaching for Akira from behind, unless he caught it in which case the effect would be alot different and it would go off in his hands. The spray would obivously go in all directions smelling like intense skunk spray, resulting in vomitin for those caught in the spray.* - Wed Nov 11 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Follows up on his attack with a smirk as he jumped the table to punch Akira in the face. The poisonous cloud Koh was caught in would result in him still vomiting or dry heaving, most likely dry heaving since he seemed unable to escape, the smog didn't seem to be fading anytime soon, still expanding towards the position of Akira and Naoya.* - Wed Nov 11 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Lands behind Akira as he sidesteps, he moves to try and counter his stab by trying to sweep his legs out from under him before allowing himsself towards the wall his back would hit it as he tried to move from the gas that had almost reached the pair. The exchange wasn't without a price as the strike hit apart of his body and dark red blood started to leak  from behind his shirt.* - Wed Nov 11 23:35:15 2015

The exchange wasn't without a price as the strike hit apart of his body and dark red blood started to leak  from behind his shirt. In the meantime koh would remain in the gas due to being caught, presumably having already lost his launch he would be stuck dry heaving. * - Wed Nov 11 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) With his back to the wall the gas had gained ground on the tripped up Akira possibly resulting in him gaining a whiff of the putrid gas. He moves his head to the side to evade the kunai and gets up to move to the corner of the room, drawing a kunai from his backpouch holding it in a reverse grip in his right hand.* - Wed Nov 11 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Tossed the kunai at Akira once he got in position, he had an edge and he knew it but he had to escape the cloud. He reached into his backpouch for a tag and slapped it on a nearby wall to detonate it, it seemed Akira was wrong because the cloud was still approaching rapidly two scrolls slipped out of his pocket on the way out trough the wall. (It approaches for 5 rounds total) The cloud started to enter another stage on koh resulting in him puking blood while Naoya ran.* - Wed Nov 11 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Runs trough the grass with a wide smile, it looked like he had won now that Akira was caught.* - Thu Nov 12 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Runs trough the newly made hole in the wall and uses the wall as cover waiting for the poison to do its work. <Now i just wait for them to pass out..> His smile had grown even wider he knew shinobi would be on him soon since he was in the mansion in combat, reinforcements if they wherent to busy with another part of the conflict but his focus was on the two.* - Thu Nov 12 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Keeps running as Akira gave chase he stopped to catch his breath as the poison did its work and faces Akira "It's no use now, you're only hope is to get treatment." His smile was wickedly wide "And it will cost you something."* - Thu Nov 12 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Holds his right hand out with a smile "Knowledge." The cloud stopped approaching the wicked smile turned into something closer to neutral. He was hoping Akira had a jutsu of somekind.* - Thu Nov 12 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Is caught off guard by the mud wave, moved back a ways now covered in mud  he stood up with the brown crap all over him "Man you aren't ever getting an antidote now." The distance between them was now increased naturally. He had no visible wounds, but it was possible he had blood in his grazing wound. He adopted a malicous grin to his features "Unless you beg." He was running out of time since he was drawing attention with earth style. "Should i move to an S rank?"* - Thu Nov 12 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Is clipped on the face by the shuriken, the mud seemed to have just enough protective coating to avoid the strike drawing blood. He remained motionless and focused on breathing, this was turning into a long match.* - Thu Nov 12 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Falls back in the mud on his back to let the shuriken move past him. He just layed in the mud while covered in it himself still focused on catching his breath and recovering as much as he could.* - Thu Nov 12 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Eh.... - Thu Nov 12 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Stops his panting and begins to roll away on the ground to get out of the mud hoping to avoid the next mudwave.* - Thu Nov 12 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Was already at a distance from the previus mudstrike, he found himself pushed back more. He wasn't neccasrily dealing with a swamp so he swam up trough the mud "river" since it was essentialy a liquid like earthstyle. After climbing out he let out a groan. "You're hard headed.." He layed down outside the mud river.* - Thu Nov 12 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Comes to a stand and moves over to Akira reaching out a hand to the downed redhead. "You'te fun."* - Thu Nov 12 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Sits down next to Akira "I like you." Since Akira was powerless to stop him, as far as he could tell due to the poison he moved trough his things for scrolls and things of value, probbing him like a full on gank. "Knowledge."* - Thu Nov 12 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Naoya(Solobb-) Frowns upon not finding a single scroll or knowledge based object"I still like you, you'll make it." He didn't give a dam about the weapons. So he took nothing.* - Thu Nov 12 01:33:52 2015
