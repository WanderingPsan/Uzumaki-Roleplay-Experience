When the smoke cleared, lera would find that momura was no-where to be found, every trace of her was gone, and the ground had been unmoved in every possible way, where did she go?* - Fri Nov 27 20:25:48 2015

It was hard to really comprehend what this did to momura, but she'd break through it for the most part, having a sting ringing in her body, she'd push on through it.

If able, she'd suddenly pop up behind lera, it was time for her ultimate technique. She'd aim her index finger and both middle fingers directly at lera's behind, it was time she got a good penetration. She'd ram her fingers up into lera's bottom, aiming to surprise her and send her into the air with her pure strength.* - Fri Nov 27 20:34:20 2015

She'd throw down a smoke bomb when she got closer, it'd be thrown directly infront of lera as she'd suddenly find herself being attacked by three momuras, one in the middle, one one each side as well.* - Fri Nov 27 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've suddenly been swept away by the fire as the three momura's passed through lera completely, the real one no where to be seen. Suddenly the ground shifted under lera as her ankles were grabbed, the fire wouldn't coat -all- of her body, just around her, which mean her ankles were free. Momura used the surprise attack as she'd aim to throw lera -hard- against the ground.* - Fri Nov 27 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) held onto lera tightly as she'd begin going through the ground, "Y-You're not gonna g-get away!" She'd keep a tight hold on the female's ankles, aiming to pull her out of the, now quicksand...If succesful, she'd aim to throw the female against the northern wall of the village.

If not successful, she'd either be dragged down with lera, or would've had her go alone.* - Fri Nov 27 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've began a strut towards the southwest quadrant of the village, she had to go be a nursing aid..Which was weird, since she knew nothing about healing anything..She usually just went to bryson or some other medic and told them her wounds..and magic happened. Oh well, she'd learn now.

She'd waltz into the makeshift hospital as it seemed to be slightly busy...Which was a tiny bit annoying, but she surely did not mind. She'd change out into some more appropriate attire, a nurse outfit! She walked over to some of the doctors and nurses, telling them she'd be here to help, and off she went, her first task...Disinfect the beds..

Well, this outta be fun. She'd round up her supplies across the vast space of the hospital, swiping at random things she'd need before heading over to the empty beds that were waiting to be cleaned, the sheets and everything removed and were being washed. She'd get out her rubber gloves with a snap, and got out her other supplies as she'd get a sponge and began to soak it in disinfectant. 

The female began to swipe left and right across the bed, cleaning the top of it as time went on, she'd need to hurry things up..There were quite the amount of beds needed to be disinfected! She'd begin scrubbing more rapidly, flipping the bed and doing the sides to! She now had sponges in both hands as she'd disinfect the first bed! Now she'd get together the dried bedsheets and such, placing them on the bed before finishing it off.

She'd rush over to the next few beds, doing it all in the same order, except this time she'd use one sponge in each hand for each bed, doing work at double speed! She began scrubbing them down rapidly, finishing and putting the bedsheets on, along with everything else, such as pillows and the such. After about thirty~sixty minutes of working on the bed, she'd rush over to the doctors and nurses.

Once she recieved her next duty, she'd begin walking around and scrubbing down the counters with more clean sponges and disinfectant, damn everything was just dity in this sandy village. She'd scrub down the counters, the sinks, the cabinets and everything around there. She'd begin scrubbing inside of the counters, the inside of the cabinets, and the whole shabang.

After finishing that up, she'd grab the mop and dipped it in the water, as she'd begin washing down the floor, cleaning off the germs from it. She'd start from less populated areas of the hospital, and worked her way towards more populated areas of the hospital. She'd shift rooms here and there, changing mops and buckets a few times as well, as she wanted to be as clean as possible.

She'd continue mopping the makeshift hallways..and the other rooms, until the whole floor was sparkling clean. She'd walk back to the main area and put her supplies back, speaking with the doctors. She'd have a final task. The female would now have to assist patients into the hospital and into the beds. She'd begin her strut out the door to help new arriving patients. 

Momura would've went and helped the more sick, and or older patients into the hospital and into their bed first. After a long time of taking the patients in and placing them in the disinfected and safe beds, she'd make sure her job was finished as she'd change out of her nurse outfit, of course, asking to keep it...for...reasons. She'd then change back into her regular outfit and leave, heading to sanoke.* - Fri Nov 27 22:08:12 2015

She'd dash forward as the female would've reached into both pockets on her way their, throwing two smoke bombs in an instant as smoke filled the area around the two.

Through the smoke, suddenly three momura's came towards kinami, the two on the sides aiming to punch kinami's shoulders, as the third one aimed to run into the female's chest with their fist.* - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015

Suddenly the female came from her side as she distracted with the shadows, her elbow was pointed at kinami as her fist was pushed against her palm, which was used as a cushion. She'd aim to ram her elbow into the female's side and send her flying towards hiroshi's direction.* - Sat Nov 28 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've blinked as she'd be easily countered, the female had launched a counterstrike against momura as she'd feel the blow connect against her as she'd quickly aim to hop back, but would've gotten struck as she'd slide against the sand, leaving a trail..

She had forgotten that she really couldn't hurt kinami at all..

"I see..."

She'd reach into her pocket, only to realize more people appeared, causing her to stop mid-way..She'd slide into a fighting position as the female decided it would be rather hard to fight kinami the way she was...

Suddenly momura zipped through the air, sliding down as she'd aim to launch a kick against kinami's chest, although this was a feint, as she'd attempt to launch her other foot towards the female's lower body, and instead of doing a regular kick, she'd aim to raise the female's body with the upper-kick, aiming to launch her into the air if possible.* - Sat Nov 28 03:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I remember you.  Anyway, have you seen someone named Sado around here? - Sat Nov 28 03:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What about someone named Kyubishu? - Sat Nov 28 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He's a friend of mine and I heard he got into some trouble. - Sat Nov 28 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) knew she couldn't do any damage to the female..But tried her hardest, she'd come up towards kinami as the female got into her stance. A quick kick attempting to come at her as she'd be able to bypass the woman's reflexes maybe this time...

Momura had her foot grabbed, she had a plan, suddenly her other leg came up from behind as she'd aim to ram her lower-foot against the female's throat quickly, aiming to simply stun her before she were able to proceed with her techniques.

Of course, if she had failed, everything went through as momura was used as a dummy, and tossed off into the distance, rolling infront of hiroshi. She'd get back onto her feet and stared at the female, it was annoying to have a woman who attacked so fast..She'd simply give herself a moment to rest.* - Sat Nov 28 03:55:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I kind of want to go at it with someone here. Last person was Yan. I wonder what's he's up to.  - Sat Nov 28 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I'll fight Kinami next! - Sat Nov 28 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I owe her a fight. - Sat Nov 28 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) took a deep breathe..To many people were around...She couldn't quite use any of her good techniques like this..She'd probably be KOed by the end of the spar to..Since she knew kinami was in her usual rather powerful stance. The female would've recovered from the last set of strikes...even though her body was stinging with a bit of "paine" (puns op)

She'd raise suddenly raise a leg as she'd zoom forward, aiming to kick up sand towards kinami's face, aiming to blind her for a moment, before aiming to kick her in the gut, and send her into the air.* - Sat Nov 28 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've kicked the female into the air as she'd quickly follow behind, of course now behind her as she'd utilize a new technique, following her movements exactly. She'd end this female quickly..

Suddenly the girl's hands came together as she'd jam her index finger and middle fingers into kinami's bottom, aiming to push her down to the ground using extra force from the blow!* - Sat Nov 28 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) also screamed, "O-One thousand years o-of death!"* - Sat Nov 28 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hmm well if you are goign for the red-head, for the sake of competition I am going to go with Nami. - Sat Nov 28 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: How old are you kid? - Sat Nov 28 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've been kicked in the chest as the female wouldn't even be able to retaliate, she'd be sent backwards into the air a bit further before coming down to the ground, hard. She'd leave a rather large sand crater in the field, as she just kinda laid there, face first.* - Sat Nov 28 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: O boy. . . I think Nami just won. . .  - Sat Nov 28 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) just kinda looked up at kinami, a small scowl on her face was hidden.

"T-Thank you.."* - Sat Nov 28 04:19:24 2015
