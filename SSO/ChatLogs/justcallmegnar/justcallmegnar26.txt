<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've gotten into a quick position, seeing as they took the defensive, she had to take the offensive position. She'd suddenly get into a fighting stance, but cosinsdering she wasn't to trained in any of that, it was a bit difficult. She'd start off with one of her newer techniques she guessed. Suddenly the female dashed forward as she'd ball her hand into a fist, before her other palm cushioned the fist like a pillow. She'd point her elbow directly at marrisa before lifting her foot up before getting -directly- infront of her as she'd aim to kick up sand to blind marrisa for a moment, before ramming her elbow into the girl's gut.* - Wed Nov 25 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've suddenly blinked as the woman shifted positions the moment momura neared her with the strike, suddenly she'd be jabbed right in the abdomen as her body hurled away from marrisa, rolling on the ground before momura got onto her feet. That strike surely did pack a punch, momura's side hurting quite a bit...

She'd put her fists up towards marrisa before suddenly moving forward in a zig-zag movement, left-right-left-right, she kept this up as she got towards marrisa. At the next right, she'd suddenly slip out a smoke bomb infront of marrisa to blind her for a moment, as momura would've quickly came out of the side of it, aiming to land a punch directly onto the girl's shoulder, if successful she'd then aim to do another jab at the woman's cheek if able.* - Wed Nov 25 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) blinked, her strike doing nothing to the female sadly..She'd suddenly be slammed right into her right breast as the girl was suddenly sent fliyng backwards, making a small hole in the sand as it'd take her a moment to get onto her feet. She'd take a deep breathe, letting the paine soothe in..

"I-I'm..gonna go full power now, T-Try not to hit me as h-hard please..?" She'd plead as she took a quick breathe, suddenly antennae came out of her head as muscles around her body began to change. After a hot second, she'd get into a running position as she faced the god-tier shinobi woman...If only marrisa had been there during the war, youth-guy wouldn't of died, is what ran through her mind as she raced forward. 

As the female got closer, she'd take out two smoke bombs, throwing one forward infront of her, to hide her form as the other seemed to be thrown directly as the woman's face. If successful, marrisa would've suddenly seen three momura's infront of her through the smoke, all of them rushing her as they bundled up their fist and aimed to triple punch her.* - Wed Nov 25 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) was just kinda stopped before she could even begin her next move, suddenly marrisa appearing next to her as momura just blinked, before her body was sent flying off into the sand again, her antennae retracting..seeing as marrisa found out that momura loved smoke bombs a lot. She'd just kinda plop there, slowly getting back up after a moment as she looked up at marrisa..She really was stronger then momura in pretty much every possible way, which made her feel kinda shitty...Then again, the whole village of sunagakure was overpowered to the maximum.

She'd try with a long-range technique as she simply cocked her head back before shooting out a black bullet towards marrisa.* - Wed Nov 25 09:34:43 2015
