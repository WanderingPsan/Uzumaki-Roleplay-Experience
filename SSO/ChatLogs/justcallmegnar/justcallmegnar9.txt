<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) stared down at the female. Her eyes stayed onto the smaller girl's frame, the six foot three woman hoped ortho had put her with a good fight..As she didn't want to spar someone who was weak, she needed to get stronger..And to get stronger meant feeling pain, fighting weaker oppenents wouldn't increase anything..It would simply give masa an annoyance in her way. Yet she felt compelled to give the girl a good challenge, wether she be weak or not..

As she'd get into a stance infront of masa, she'd suddenly zoom forward. The girl brung her fist down aiming to punch straight into the female's shoulder, using -some- of her strength.* - Thu Oct 29 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) was simply hitting easy for now..A single look was given to the girl as her light hit hadn't done much, as expected..She was decently durable. She'd suddenly be hit with a kick to her shin..Yet it seemed to do absolutely nothing to the titan-like female. A single look was given to the girl, a blank stare.

"You need to hit harder." She'd say in mid-combat.

Her other hand went out to grab onto the female's neck and lift her up into the air before tossing her away, a single stare was given towards her, "Hit me harder if you want to hurt me."* - Thu Oct 29 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Ortheo better have someone to teach me some taijutsu. - Thu Oct 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I need it. - Thu Oct 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Masa is too much in the middle. . .either people can't help her train because they're too weak, or too strong. - Thu Oct 29 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) blinked for a moment as the girl seemed lost in concentration..Thoughts and such..Always things like those..People seemed to be lost within dreams, especially in moments like this. She'd watch as the girl suddenly came towards her in a jolt of speed, around the same speed of the female..She'd allow herself to be suddenly kicked in the chest, her feet sliding on the ground a few inches back..

A stare was given towards the female once more..It had hurt though..She'd quickly raise her hands and grabbed the girl's leg, pushing it down..Before she'd suddenly jolt her hands out towards her. Upon this, she'd grab the girl's chest and her tri-cep, sliding her leg inbetween the female's legs. With a final motion, she'd twist her body, so her back was against the female before suddenly throwing her down violently, aiming to toss the female the other way now, a good few feet.* - Thu Oct 29 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) had tossed the female to the ground for a moment, it didn't seem she was going to be getting up for a few moment..Masa was deciding upon things..She could use some more strength and pummel the female but that wouldn't accomplish anything, not here at least. She wasn't on her complete guard duty for vessul at the moment, so no need to get hostile..She felt like she was giving the girl to hard of a time..So she'd follow her movements as the red head came back at her..

She'd quickly swirve around the female's first kick, being next to the girl's leg..Curious on what she planned to achieve now? She'd suddenly be hit in the side of her leg by the female..She decided to let the girl win this time, as she didn't want her to feel completely useless. She'd be swept off of her feet, falling down sideways..One thing on her mind was..

What was the female's plan now?* - Thu Oct 29 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Suiton hm. - Thu Oct 29 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) fell to the floor rather hard, but not that hard. She'd hit the ground on her side, her shoulder hitting first..As she wasn't really trying to block the damage. The blank look upon her face laid eyes onto the woman's handseals..She seemed to be also capable of elemental techniques, which did indeed interest her...

She'd feel the water suddenly cover her form as she'd roll back a bit from it..But simply got back onto her feet, the water not quite effecting her that much..A sigh was released from the female as she'd stare towards the girl with the same blank look..A hand being raised..Suddenly shifting into a thumbs up.

"You're hitting a bit harder, I like that." She'd say with a smile, before suddenly attempting to strive towards the female, and hit her with a full-powered punch right in the gut, aiming to send her backwards.* - Thu Oct 29 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) stared down at the female, then over towards ortho.

"We finished out spar, she say, wiping some of the water off of her face.* - Thu Oct 29 02:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) caught the scroll, staring at it blankly.

"Hm.." She'd stare it for a moment before walking away for a bit.

She'd plop onto the ground and opened up the scroll, her eyes began to scan through the scroll, looking through each word to detect exactly what it was..By the end of her reading, She'd have an already decent understanding at what the scroll was, it was a pretty simple technique..Which Masa could use effectively in hand-to-hand combat.

She'd continue reading through it several times though, she wanted to make sure each motion was perfect in her mind..Scanning through each motion within her head, she'd continue to screen through the scroll with minimal time needed in all honesty. Upon her final read, she'd close the scroll and let out a sigh, getting up and putting her hands into the air. 

She'd begin a "shadow" spar of sorts, as she'd suddenly begin doing the motions of the certain jutsu, moving her hands as the scroll had told her to do, after a while of "misdirecting" the "shadow" clone she'd let up, taking a moment to think while she'd open the scroll again, taking a quick read.* - Thu Oct 29 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) had..remembered this jutsu from two times before..And already knew what it looked like..She'd slam her hands together as she'd begin to churn her chakra, of course she had a good understanding of her chakra, as she could summon a slug at least. She'd let her chakra turn inside of her, mashing up and forming together. She'd then preform the needed seals before spitting out, well a bunch of spit..It had failed horribly.

She'd take another crack at it, slamming her hands together. A single smile was given as she'd then begin to go through the handseals as the chakra turned together and formed inside of her. As she'd finish off with the handseals, she'd take a deep breathe before spewing out a small wave form her mouth, she felt like she was throwing up..It was awkard..The water just spilled out of her mouth, forming a mini-pond beneath her.

She'd have to take yet another attempt at it..She'd clap her hands together, taking her chakra from within her body..A suddenly force came from within her as she'd clump the chakra together before spewing it out in a weird sticky liquid form, it'd form out infront of her, like a mini-river.* - Thu Oct 29 04:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've raised her hand as she'd slide out of her two shoes..She had to train to get stronger, and to get stronger..She had to endure self-inflicted pain and injuries..To help her body..To help herself, pain was the only way..She'd lift her thumb to the mouth as she'd bite into it with her teeth. Suddenly she'd clap her hands and jot through handseals, slamming her palm down to the ground as a puff of smoke formed and a slug appeared, masa gave it a determined look as it looked back at her, giving her a sage slug nod..It was time for masa to move one step closer to becoming the perfect guard for vessul.

The slug was unsummoned as she'd already have blood trickling from her thumb, going through a set of handseals she'd plop her hand down onto the ground once more..She had to gain strength..! The slug was summoned, a determined look was on it's blank face..Or at least in masa's face, it was. Pure determination was set upon in her will..The only way to truly protect the one she cared for most..She had to...

Get stronger.* - Thu Oct 29 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) had to continue..She'd bite into her other thumb, blood spilling out of it..Adrenaline rushed through her due to these actions..Even such small pain can cause such rash actions..It was all crammed into the woman's head..She was getting a better understanding of what she will do..She'd slam her palm down after forming the needed handseals, the slug forming with..Another slug this time. She'd nod towards them as they'd be unsummoned in a poof of smoke.

She'd continue on with her constant training, looking small yet it was a big help. She'd form several handseals now, zipping through them with speed..Her body was shaking with anticipation about what laid on the other side. Once finished with the handseals she'd slam her palm onto the ground with might, the two slugs being summoned back..She'd give a nod to them as they'd nod back, unsummoning themselves within that moment as she'd take it to rest.* - Thu Oct 29 04:41:36 2015

"Why do you find so much attraction in me?"* - Thu Oct 29 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a small giggle to his comments..He was sweet in all sense.

She'd lean forward and lock lips for a moment before releasing, "How about I go off duty?"* - Thu Oct 29 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) led him over and onto the bed as she'd sit down, "How about that full body massage now?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) felt his thumbs move on the bottom of her feet, getting a bit giggly..She'd listen to his comment with a sigh, "I'll make you a deal, you can get pervy with my feet." She said jokingly as she wiggled her toes.* - Thu Oct 29 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) giggled at his joke back, "Oh really? Do your best."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a sudden laugh as she had her feet tickled a bit, she'd look up at him with a smile as he moved onto her ankles and above her feet..She'd feel him massage her gently, looking at him with a gentle smile.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let him massage her legs as she'd let out a relaxing sigh, opening her eye for a moment as she'd feel him rub the inside of her thighs, she'd let out a sigh as she laid her head back down..Ignoring his stupid talk.

"Just don't be a perv, Vessul, Or I won't let you touch me again." She'd say with a smirk, letting him work his hands around her body.* - Thu Oct 29 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a sigh hearing him, "You're a real perv."* - Thu Oct 29 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a giggle, "I am enjoying this..But I feel a bit restrained." She'd undo the back of her bra, it wouldn't come undone but it'd be loose, she'd then extend her arms and spread them.* - Thu Oct 29 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've simply laid back as he man handled her, "I might let you massage my butt if you do good with the rest of the massage." She'd say with a smirk, if he stepped out of line, she'd go straight to bed.* - Thu Oct 29 05:48:09 2015

"I'm getting pretty tired, I think I'll head off to bed soon, Vessul." Completely ignoring the fact he was about to pop, she'd get up, her bra falling off as she'd turn towards vessul with her chest exposed, "Do you mind if I sleep?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) , Finding herself in need of training her new technique, she'd walk to the center of the room, making sure that she wouldn't hit anything once she had started. Looking around the room, she'd nod finding herself in the position where she wouldn't. Moving her feet a bit, getting into position, she'd look forward, getting her mind right for the technique, imagining a fake fighter in front of her. Trying to rush it, she'd thrust her hand forward, aiming for the throat. Though, messing it up, and handing her aim off, she'd know she'd have to keep practicing. 

Looking at the fake person in front of her, she'd try again, closing her eyes first to get her focus. Controlling her breathing, she'd open her eyes, looking to start again. Aiming the best she could at the throat, she'd thrust forward, softly, simply trying to get her aim right before she tried to add any force to it. Though, glancing off, as she didn't hit it dead center, and in turn not getting the effect that the technique calls for. Shaking her head, she'd sigh a bit, clenching her fist a bit. 

Stretching her arms a bit, she'd be determined to get it right, she'd again go to start, getting a quick swig of water from her nearby cup. Thinking that she absolutely had to get this right to get stronger, so in turn, looking forward, she had a determined look form on her face as she again thrusted her arm forward, going to hit the shadow man on his throat. Though, having focused even more on aiming than damage, she'd only hit it lightly, and still not have the wanted effect. 

Feeling that she had now gotten her aim down, she'd start to go into the force aspect of the technique. Taking a few deep breathes she'd look to the being in front of her, focusing on his throat to make sure she'd hit it again. Then, thrusting forward with her right hand, she'd go faster with it, trying to hit the fake beings throat with enough for to cause him to cough, and grab at it. Though, hitting it, she'd still have been too worried about aiming being that the hit would only cause the being slight discomfort. 

Now, knowing she had her aim down, she'd get to the force aspect completely, devoting her self to getting it right. So once more, he's pull her arm back, thrusting forward to hit his throat, though, throwing her fist forward with as much force as she could, she'd hit the shadow beings adams apple, causing her to literally fall and grasp at it. This, making her content, she'd take a small break, walking to the side of the room and again getting a sip of water, knowing she still had more training ahead of her. 

Moving back to the center of the room, having her sword with her now, she'd look to the invisible being again. Knowing that this would be harder with a weapon, as she have a harder time aiming, and a harder time controlling the force, she'd simply stretch out again, getting ready. Picking the weapon up and extending her arm all the way forward, she'd use her incredible arm strength to take the very end of the blade, being mostly flat, and thrust forward with it, again only focused on aim. Hitting him lightly with it, she'd nod as it didn't do any damage, but at least she knew she had the aim. 

Deciding once again to go at it to see if she could add her force behind it, she'd keep her arm extended. Thrusting forward experimentally to see how much force it would take, she'd nod figuring about how much she would need. Then, looking up to the shadow being she had made in her mind, she'd again pull her arm back, blade in it, and thrust forward relatively hard, hitting the shadow being on his throat. Doing such with about the right force, and aim, the being would again fall, clutching its throat. Nodding, she'd move onto the next thing. 

Now, turning her blade backwards and having the blunt end at her command, she'd do as she had been up to this point. Solely focusing on aim again, she'd pull the blade back, looking to the beings throat. Swinging it forward slowly, she'd line the blunt end up and tap the man's throat. Being that she was only working on aim this time around, she'd nod, feeling like she had at least that much down. Thus, walking to the side, she'd finished off her water, determined to finished this technique as well. 

Now, feeling like she had the aim down, she would of course work on the force of it. Raising the blade back, she'd again take aim, and simply swing the sword forward, not wanting to control the force. Though, as she did this, her lack of control would literally crush the beings throat, as she wasn't really paying attention. Pulling the blade back and simply sighing, she'd assume she'd have to pay more attention with force on this one since she had to swing the blade. 

Thinking this, she'd grasp the sword with both hands, again taking a few experimental swings as she wanted to make sure she'd have just the right amount of force. Content with what she had decided on, she'd again swing the blade forward aiming for the man's throat. Hitting it just hard enough, the shadow being would fall to the ground, grasping his throat again. Nodding, she'd put the blade to her back, happy with the progress she had made today with this technique. * - Thu Oct 29 20:49:16 2015

The girl didn't just stop there, no..What is she waiting for? JUST DO IT. She'd do another round as the water dissipated into air. She'd let the chakra move around in her core and tummy, forming liquid inside of her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) felt him push as he'd let out small noises, she'd closer her eyes..She'd have to make him enjoy it even if it killed him, In her mind, she'd please him then they could move on with life, much easier. She'd feel him go full length as she'd force herself to go all the way to his base, his whole member inside of her mouth and down her throat. She'd gag but didn't mind as she'd then move her head back, then pushed it forward again, moving her head back and forth as her tongue ran along the bottom.

"Mmmph.."* - Thu Oct 29 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) heard him, but ignored him. She'd grab onto his sides with strength and suddenly forced his member straight down her throat, going straight up to it's base. She was practically choking herself, but she didn't mind. Saliva covered his member as she'd then pull out, before moving her head back in half-way, going back and forth from there as she'd look up at him, giving him puppy dog eyes.* - Thu Oct 29 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) suddenly had her mouth filled with his liquid, she'd wait until he'd finish, before rubbing her legs against his member as she'd slide back, she didn't have much choice, so she'd swallow it, looking up at him with a smile.

"Did you enjoy it..?"* - Thu Oct 29 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) began to walk away, leaving the hug. She'd stand in the middle of the room as she'd let her chakra form inside of her stomach. Within a moment's notice, her stomach was filled with chakra as she'd begin to formulate through a set of handseals, cocking her head back she'd release a small sticky liquid pool form her mouth that covered the general area infront of her.

She'd then dissipate it with a hand-wave, the chakra pool disappearing. She'd have to go through this yet again..Her stomach filled with other liquids besides chakra liquids. She'd formulate a set of handseals as the chakra formed inside of her stomach, releasing yet another small sticky pool.* - Thu Oct 29 23:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've strolled away from him, a good..Few inches. She'd raise her hand up and stick her thumb out, biting into it as blood trailed down. She'd then formulate several handseals as she'd have her little slug buddies in her mind, of course her closest one being kastaya. She'd slam her hand onto the ground as a small slug appeared from a black seal. It'd crawl up her arm as she'd rub her finger against it's head, "You should get yourself a summoning sometime in the future."* - Thu Oct 29 23:51:53 2015

A sigh came out of her..It took so long to actually -master- these jutsus..Even for her, it was a rather big annoyance..She'd raise her thumb and bite into it with a snap, blood trickling down her thumb. She'd then formulate through several different handseals, slamming her palm onto the ground as the slug disappeared.

The slug was unsummoned after a nod towards it. She'd then raise her thumb again, looking at the blood for a mere moment, before formulating through her handseals once more, a sigh coming out of her on the final handseal. She'd slam her had onto the ground as the slug formed once more from a puff of smoke, this time there were two slugs, both staring at masa before being unsummoned.* - Fri Oct 30 01:33:26 2015
