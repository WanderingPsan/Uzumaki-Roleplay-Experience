<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Tue Oct 27 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) grabbed her zanbatou with a single hand, she'd lift it into the air, it had become rather light in her eyes, she'd swing it around several times before placing it next to her. Sliding her shoes off she'd crack her neck..After the small interruption from ortho, she'd have to get back into training-mode..She had to get stronger for vessul, she had to be strong enough to defend him against these shinobi..The viscious shinobi of today's world..

She'd glare forward as she'd suddenly tighten the muscles in her arms, getting ready to train to her max. She'd walk backwards before suddenly springing forward with her hands first, but instead of doing a full cartwheel, she'd stop mid-way, preforming a handstand with the strength in her arms, carrying a full 190lbs was rather..Hard in most people's eyes, but she'd go against that logic and held herself up with her pure strength and will.

The female stuck her legs straight up, her toes wiggling around in the air as her hands began moving across the ground..She'd be moving on her handstand, barely shaking or wobbiling..It took incredible amounts of focus to stay on her hands like this, especially for prolonged amounts of time. She'd continue moving around on her hands, struggling to keep up..But she'd push her body hard at it. Her shirt falling down over her face for a moment as she'd move it out of the way using her mouth.

She'd hold her stance for around..Twenty minutes, her stomach appeared to be coated in a fine layer of six-pack abdominals, showed off to vessul. She'd hold her stance right until the twenty minute mark, to which she'd fall onto her back with a thud, although it barely hurt her at all...She'd sit on her back, suddenly getting into her next training pose, she'd put her feet firmly on the ground as the female looked at the ceiling, putting her arms against the sides of her legs, directly on the ground.

She'd begin her sit-ups now, going up and down at a slow pace..before taking it to her usual regimen. She'd hold herself off the ground for two minutes, feeling the burn on her back before releasing and laying on the ground for ten seconds, then lifting herself up for another two minutes...After she finished she'd let out a grunt as she sat back on the ground for a few moments. She'd quickly raise herself up then down back to the ground once more. She'd quickly begin several hundred sit-ups, rapidly pushing herself well over the limit of what she could normally do...

She'd continue on with the situps until she'd do around a hundred, before stopping. She'd hop up onto her hands once more, and began doing upside down pushups. Her hair fell to the floor a bit, she didn't have much so it didn't matter. She'd begin doing push-ups upside down now, it seemed to be weird...Since her chest was bouncing up and down infront of vessul. 

She'd continue working rather hard, her arms using all their possible strength they could, pushing themselves further and further..They had to get stronger, that was the key! They had to work harder and harder..The female's body was working as hard as it could, pushing her beyond her limit..She had to get stronger for vessul's sake..For her own sake at that..She was apart of ortho's organization..and with vessul, she'd be moving in life..And she had to be strong enough to protect him..Even if it meant tearing up her insides and re-creating her body into an indestructible force of nature..

Minimasa did a total of fourty upside down push-ups, blood rushed to her head causing her to fall onto her back with a thud..She'd grunt to herself and flipped over, putting her hands on the ground as she'd begin pushing herself up then letting herself fall slowly to the ground..The female slowly began going faster and faster as the seconds ran by, suddenly she was going full-speed as her body was shaking at max capacity. Her head nearly slamming against the ground now. She was trying to go as fast as she could, getting more training in..She never broke a sweat for quite the while.

She'd stop after quite some time..Taking a deep breathe in her mouth and releasing out of her nose, regulating her breathing...She'd switch back over to her other workout now, getting onto her feet. She'd begin squats. She'd get into a squat position before slamming down onto the ground, or as close as she could get. She'd begin low-speed squats, one every few seconds would occur, as she was simply letting herself cool off, her muscles on fire. She'd have thoughts of how vessul would be helpless without her if she were unable to protect him again..Her will undying for him..She had to be there!

Her eyes opened widely as she'd let her inner-fire burn brighter then ever..Suddenly she'd begin her squats at the fastest speed she could muster up, going up and down as her arms turned into after-images of themselves, moving up and down faster then the normal human eye can even see. She'd be moving at higher speeds then normal, she had to get stronger no matter what..Even if it meant self-harm..If it was the only way to protect vessul and perhaps save him one day..She didn't care..! She'd do a final squat down to the ground, suddenly cracking the floor with her ass.

She'd get up and rub her butt for a few moments, her glutes taking quite the pounding during her training...She'd take a moment to rest, she'd have to begin more training soon!* - Wed Oct 28 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) Continuing to train, she'd decide that she needed to get into some running. Thus, she'd made her way back outside, starting off slow, doing a quick lap around the house. Doing this as a warm up for her legs, she'd feel that they'd been stretched out more than enough. Coming to a stop, she'd walk a distance, and use her foot to mark a line in the grass. Moving back to where she had started, she'd put another line, feeling that she should do sprints and get in a good bit of leg training. 

Looking out over the grass where she had marked, she'd begin, first only running about half pace so that she could get used to stopping and touching the line, and running back to the begging, and touching that line, and continuing to do that. Which, after doing it for some time, she'd feel as if she would have the hang of it, and that she would be able to pick up the speed if she wanted, though first she would finish up the set of ten she was working on currently, and think about what was next. 

Having completed her first slow set, she'd move onto a bit of a faster set. Getting herself ready to start, and invisible gun in her head would pop with sound that told her to start. Running as fast as she could, she'd hit the first line, doing her best to stop and touch it before turning back around and getting back up to full speed again, having to stop and touch that line. Struggling with this for some time, right as she came to the end of the set of ten, she'd feel herself getting the hang of it, knowing when to stop and such, and when to turn the other direction. 

Though, knowing full well that it wasn't the fastest she could possibly go, she'd take a small break, grabbing some water as she was going to attempt running it at full speed, which would a giant like herself was a bit hard to do. Shaking these thoughts away, she'd get back to the starting line. Again, a non-existent sound telling her when to start, she'd blast off at top speed. Hitting the line, she'd know to stop early to touch it and turn. Heading back to the first line, and so on, continuing to do such until she hit the last stretch of the set, running through the line. 

Finding herself tired, she'd sit for a moment, taking a break as she'd wipe her face. Though, knowing that she still wasn't good enough to protect Vessul, she'd take sight of a nearby tree, already having an idea. Going up to it, she'd start to use it like a punching bag. Hitting it softly at first as to not break any of her fingers, she'd try a few different things on it, trying to get used to the feeling of having something hard to hit. Clenching her hands a bit as she finished, she'd nod, thinking that this would be a good training method. 

Quickly finding something to wrap her hands in as to not hurt them while hitting the tree, she'd go back to it, starting to throw a few jabs to get warmed up again, hitting it lightly and quickly retracting. Doing such over and over, until she go used to it, she'd then move onto stronger hits, hitting hard enough to knock the bark off of the tree, though she wouldn't do much else yet, just these two to get the feel of it all. Taking a small break, she'd wipe her sweat before going back at it. 

This time, adding in kicks, she'd of course test the water with this as well, giving small, slight kicks towards the tree to see what it felt like, quickly pulling her leg back as not to hurt herself. Though, noting that it was fine, she'd then start to kick harder, to the point that her kicks as well would start to knock bark off the tree, and leave sizable marks on the tree itself. Happy with this, she'd think that she was making progress to getting stronger and being able to protect Vessul. 

Moving on now to throwing combos in, she'd start to mix the jabs, of both her hands and feet, with the stronger shots of both, doing her best to get used to hitting a solid object in front of her, and training her body to withstand the force and pain that was put in and received from doing such. Basically trying to shrug off whatever discomfort came with this, she'd continue on until she had removed all of the bark from this portion of the tree, determined to take it down before it was all said and done. 

Moving back and stretching her body a bit, she was determined to take this tree down and prove her improvement to herself. Quickly moving back in, using all of her strength this time, she'd start to jab and kick at the tree, and watched as it began to shake and move from her efforts. Though, as she did this her knuckles would begin to take damage, ignoring it, she'd continue onward. Only thinking about the need to get stronger and protect at this point. Moving back once more, realizing that the tree was more sturdy that thought, she'd take one more break to tend to her hands. 

Feeling like this was going to be the last shot at it she'd move it on the tree, literally holding nothing back and imagining that it was an enemy attacking Vessul. This, allowing her to go full strength on the tree, she'd slam into it, using both fist and legs to attack it again, though, as she heard, and saw it start to break, she'd slam one fist into the side of the tree, as hard as she could, which in turn would literally break the tree down and make it fall. Content with this as training for her body, she'd nod. She knew she was on her way to being stronger. 

Knowing though that she needed to cool down before simply stopping her training, she'd move again to the house, deciding to run a few more laps to let her body prepare for the lack of activity. Starting fast as first as she was already revved up, she'd go for quite a while, only slowing down around the fourth of fifth lap. Though, as she approached the tenth, she'd stop running completely, coming now down to a brisk walk as her body cooled down from the days activates. Though, just to make sure, she wanted to do one last stretch. 

Getting back inside, being that she had just ran, she'd simply go with some leg stretches to cool, off, and make sure she didn't cramp, again like this morning she'd take one leg and extend it forward, throwing it as far as she could to stretch them out and strengthen them. Doing the same with the other leg, she'd continue on until she'd done a few sets, and was sure that she would be fine and her body stronger. Almost knowing that she'd made more progress today than she could probably see. * - Wed Oct 28 00:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) had to get stronger! And to get stronger, she had to train even harder! The female's body had to work in overdrive from here on out to protect the man she had been bodyguarding for five whole years. Her body shook with pure adrenaline as she'd suddenly dash out of the house, running outside and began dong laps around the house. She wasn't fast enough to really make a good speed like other shinobi, but she did what she could! Her legs carried her far and true. 

The female continued to keep up with her pace, running as fast as she could, a good thirty-four miles per hour at top-speed. She wasn't even thinking about failure. Her mind had one goal. Get stronger. She'd continue her dash around the house, the wind riding along in her hair as she'd run around the house for nearly the fifth time, coming to an immediate stop as she'd meet with the door. Suddenly she'd leap forward, doing a roll and getting onto her stomach.

Within the moment she got onto her stomach, her hands stretched out to grab ahold of the dirt and ground beneath her, she would have to wash-up after this one. She'd suddenly push herself up with all her might, her hair being tossed into the air. She'd then pull herself back down towards the ground, in a rapid motion of forceful pushups, her arms burned with intensity as they'd be worn down just to create new and stronger muscles within her body..She had to commit to self-harm to get stronger..This was her philosophy, and would be for as long as she could keep one.

The female did a total of a hundred and twenty one pushups within the moment of her doing pushups..Her body still heated with adrenaline..Her mind shook with intensity as she was on the verge of unleashing a deep power locked within her..She would've grabbed the ground with all of her might and suddenly pulled the rest of her body up into the air, holding herself up with just her arms. The female began to do rapid motions of upside-down pushups, using all of her muscles within her arms. She'd also begin doing bicycle kicks while upside down, her legs kicking out into the air within a certain motion. She was truely in a state of training.

She'd fall onto her back when finished, breathing rather  heavily, she could feel her body gaining a new attribute to it though, something that would help in the future. She'd walk back inside and clean up, before walking out to vessul.* - Wed Oct 28 00:43:05 2015

She'd let out a relieving sigh as he'd push against her shoulders and began rubbing around her shoulder blades.

"Everywhere.." * - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've felt delighted by the massage by the end of it..She wanted to say something because she knew he'd be happy..But she didn't know.

"I dunno."* - Wed Oct 28 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: My whole body is sore after today. - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015

"My stomach and then my legs."* - Wed Oct 28 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) laid on the bed without choice.* - Wed Oct 28 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've laid back and let him rub against her abdominals...She didn't mind at all, putting her arms behind her head as she'd support herself up, she'd look down at him, making sure he wasn't being a big pervert. She had her bra on, which pretty much covered everything, nothing at all being shown except her black bra.

"It's fine..I think you can just do my stomach for tonight..Today's tired me out.."* - Wed Oct 28 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) kept her eyes on his hands, "Not the legs, just stomach..And..Thank you, I am." She'd let out a smile as some tension was released from her stomach area, his hands rubbing over her newly-coming in abs..It seemed they were becoming quite toned, and would soon actually -be- there.* - Wed Oct 28 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a sigh to his comment, she was exhausted and didn't have time to smack him upside the head...

"I've been fine..I'm really tired vessul, do you mind if I go to bed now?" She'd say in a tired-tone.* - Wed Oct 28 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) got dressed back up, taking her shoes off. She'd slide under the covers, waiting for him to crawl in..She'd watch him for a moment before curling into a ball and falling off to sleep unless interrupted.* - Wed Oct 28 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) didn't give him the option of a kiss, as she'd keep her head the opposite direction..She didn't wanna slap him.

"Sure, you can hold me I guess."* - Wed Oct 28 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) stared at the ground, grabbing her zanbatou and letting it sit next to her. She'd raise a hand into the air, before suddenly jolting it forward towards her face. Her jaw opened before closing onto her thumb, suddenly blood began to stream down from her finger, hitting the ground gently. She'd clap her hands together, suddenly forming all together five handseals. After forming all five, she'd raise her hand and slam it down onto the ground, a slug forming infront of her. She'd give it a little scratch on the top of it's head before letting it crawl up her arm and rub against her cheek. She seemed to have a soft-spot for slugs/snails.* - Wed Oct 28 15:18:36 2015

Tag Specialist: The tag specialist excels when he has a partner. One every three turns, he can make a coordinated attack with his partner which guarantees him a non-lethal strike on his enemy. He does better in combat once he has a partner, and is capable of pulling off combination jutsu with much less effort. Note: Requires a second person with this perk. An Inuzuka with this perk can use combination transformation alongside their Ninken, -without- the required techniques. T2
