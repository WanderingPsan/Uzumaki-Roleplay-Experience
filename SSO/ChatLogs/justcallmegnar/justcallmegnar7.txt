She'd begin a walk towards ortho's shadow clone, suddenly turning him towards her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) continued dashing forward towards the, now sticky liquid..Her battle-mind going through several different ways to counter the..rather sticky liquid..Finally coming to the field, she'd wish she had her zanbatou, but that was fine..Suddenly her leg muscles increased, putting most of her strength into them. She'd leap a good..Eighteen feet in the air, looking down at ortho.* - Mon Oct 26 01:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) was going through the air as she'd take a deep breathe..She was to slow to catch up to the male, which was indeed a problem, but she could probably go on longer then him. She'd land onto the ground with a large BOOM.

Tiny cracks formed beneath her as she wasn't trying to be gentle at all, The amazon-like woman..The six foot three female looked towards him, "At least try a tiny bit I suppose, it's no fun when you can't be hurt..Just don't scar me." She'd say, staring at him blankly.* - Mon Oct 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) stared forward as suddenly water shot out towards her at a rather high velocity...But she'd let out a smirk, suddenly putting her arms in an X shape where the water would collide with her body. She'd let it push upon her, her feet sliding against the grass. The female was taking it rather easily still, even as some of it gave her a small bruise, she'd be fine once it ended. 

Staring at him with a grin, she'd uncross her arms, and began her run back at ortho if able to.* - Mon Oct 26 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) was suddenly caught within the sphere of water, unable to breathe? Or maybe not, ortho would usually be able to control some properites like that. She'd be stunned there, staring at him with a confused look for a moment before closing her eyes and nodding.* - Mon Oct 26 02:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) laid ontop of him for a moment before releasing their lips as she'd stare at him in the eyes, "Want me to takeover for the night..?" She'd ask with a grin.* - Tue Oct 27 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) suddenly shrunk off the bed, "Make yourself comfortable." She'd walk away, hopefully him not looking. She'd come back some time later with just an apron on, literally nothing else. It seemed to cover only her front-side.

"How do I look?"* - Tue Oct 27 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) smiled towards him as she'd walk up to the bed, leaning over him with a confused look.

"So, anything you want me to do for you?"* - Tue Oct 27 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) leaned towards him, her cleavage seen quite clearly.

"It's becuase I love you, Vessul."* - Tue Oct 27 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) smiled as she'd put her hand towards his cheek, rubbing it gently, "Yes..I love you, No lie."* - Tue Oct 27 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out a large smile, inching towards him...

"So what would you like me to do?"* - Tue Oct 27 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) grinned..Sliding down until she met with his boxers, slowly tugging at them, "I'll make sure you're happy first."* - Tue Oct 27 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) slid his boxers all the way down, and looking at his member with a smile..She had read in a book a while ago about what to do..She remembered that the girl's character was based on a real slut..Her name was uhm..Rymei, yea..Minimasa remembered some of what rymei did. She'd slide upwards until her warm breathe slowly cast against his member, she'd move forward and began to gently lick his tip.* - Tue Oct 27 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) looked up at him and stopped.

"Read it in a book."

She'd then slowly start to wrap her lips around his tip, beginning to move her head up and down only on his tip, moving her tongue around it several times, "Mmm..You taste good ya'know."* - Tue Oct 27 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) looked up at him for a moment as his hand was placed on her head, giving him puppy dog eyes before going a little past the tip, she couldn't go much further unless forced, since she never really did have that much room inside of her mouth, only able to fit a good..Four to five inches, at max unless it was literally shoved down her throat. She'd continue to suck him off until stopping with a deep breathe, "Would you like to please me to..?"* - Tue Oct 27 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9fk - Tue Oct 27 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) took her apron off before slowly twisting around until her more gentle lady parts laid above his face, already wet. She'd simply wait for him to grab ahold of her and dig in as she'd go back to sucking on him gently, putting the tip only in.* - Tue Oct 27 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've let out a soft moan from him forcing his tongue in and licking inside of her, she'd give her hips a small shake as she'd continue sucking him off with ease, not going in to deep, since she didn't feel like choking..She'd continue sucking him off gently, stroking his balls with one of her hands, giving a gentle and light touch.* - Tue Oct 27 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) // This had been the first time anything's ever gone there, so his tongue would find itself like it was a stuck inbetween a rock and hard place, as she was incredibly tight. She'd suddenly open her eyes widely as he'd thrust into her, if he did manage to fit everything into her mouth and down her throat, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as she didn't even know what to express.* - Tue Oct 27 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've felt him mess around with her, trying different things with her lower-body..She didn't mind at all. Barely audible moans were given out as small shocks went throughout her body everytime he touched her clit, and squeezed it..She would've let out gentle moans, but she currently had his large member choking her.

She'd feel him pull back before thrusting in, a squish noise being heard as he saliva covered his member completely, to the point where it was dripping.* - Tue Oct 27 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) felt her hole penetrated once more by his soft and squishy tongue, her liquids seeping onto his taste buds for delight. She'd get tiny shocks through her body as her clit was pinched, making her lower-half shake a bit. She'd have time to breathe, which she did, her saliva dripping out of her mouth and onto his member as she'd drop back down, wrapping her mouth around the tip...She wanted him to feel good tonight.* - Tue Oct 27 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) let out her continued muffled moans as she'd try to go right back to pleasuring him, only ot be met with a sudden thrust down her throat. Suddenly he'd spurt his liquid down her throat, which slid down inside..As for her clit, the moment he'd squeeze it..rather hard, she'd let out a rather loud moan for a few moments, before resting next to his member, giving a final lick on the side.

She'd quickly aim to twist her bod and lay next to him, snuggling on his side, she still had saliva dripping out of her mouth due to it being unable to come out earlier, so she was practically slobbering..She'd cuddle up to him tightly before falling off to sleep* - Tue Oct 27 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) Looking about, she'd set her sword to the side, figuring that she'd use this time to train being that Vessul was still in bed. Walking to an open area the house, she'd drop down onto the floor, pushing her legs out behind her, and having her arms spread out an equal distance, she'd start to push her body up off the floor, and then returning it back down just above it. Continuing this for some time, she'd do about fifty push-ups, not even breaking a sweat yet. 

Having moved onto the next thing, she'd simply flip her body over, now laying on the ground with her hands crossed over her chest. Nodding to herself that she was ready to begin, she'd start to raise her entire upper half forward to a sitting position before leaning back down to the floor, and doing it all over again. Performing these sit-ups, she'd start to sweat just a small bit, so after an equal set of fifty of these as well, she'd stop to get some water, checking to see if Vessul was awake yet. 

Having checked on Vessul, she'd simply shake her head, knowing that they needed to get going, but not wanting to wake him. Returning to training instead, she would return like she was going to go about doing sit-ups once more, though instead of having her hands over her chest, she'd have them behind her head now. Raising her upper half slightly to about a forty-five degree angle she'd start to go about doing crunches, working out her midsection. Doing about fifty of these as well, she'd slowly raise herself back to her feet, before realizing she could still do more. 

Moving back to a position where she'd be looking to the ground, she'd put both of her arms resting on the floor, and have her legs stretched out behind her, working out her back and abs once more as she maintained the position, holding her own weight up. Keeping this planking position for the count of about two minutes, she'd now stand, thinking that all the exercises that required her to be on the floor were done for the day. 

Now going to the wall, she'd lean against it, once more going for a workout that would use her own body weight to help. Keeping her knees at a ninety-degree angle, she'd force herself to stay there, causing her thighs and leg muscles to burn a bit. Holding this position for about five minutes, she'd force herself to her feet, grabbing a nearby towel to wipe her head, as it felt it was getting hot in the house. 

Moving now to the open part of the house again, she'd start to move one leg forward, pushing it as far forward as she could, and lowering her body down a good amount. Then, moving the leg back, she'd rotate the other leg in, leaning forward with that instead, and then of course bringing it back to where it was originally. Continuing this, she'd be at it for fifty on each leg. Once she was done, she'd feel herself finally start to tire. 

Moving now remembering that there was yet one more floor activity she could do, she'd lay back on the ground on her back. Raising her legs about six inches off the ground, she'd start to feel a bit of burn again in her legs. Doing this for about two minutes as well, she'd sigh a small amount, letting them drop back to the floor and then moving to stand to her feet. Feeling all warmed up, she'd figured she could continue on. 

Staying where she was standing, she'd start to lower her body as far as she could to the ground, bending her legs to lower herself before raising herself back up, again working her legs out. Working her way through this, she'd again make it to about fifty in before she decided to stop and get some water. Doing such, she'd think that there had to be an easier way to do all of this, but she'd simply shake it off, finishing the water she had. 

Now, trying to slip out of the door, she'd move to look around the small building where they lived. Deciding that it was clear, she'd start to simply jog around the building, doing her best to keep her body in the best physical condition that she possibly could. Doing as anyone paying attention would notice, another set of fifty, going around the building. Coming to a stop, she'd find herself looking at the door. Heading back inside, she'd wipe her face down. 

Moving back inside she'd think of what to do now. Coming up with an idea, she'd move over to the two different packs of materials that they traveled with. Picking them up, she'd use both of her arms to somewhat curl them, using there weight as a tool to strengthen her arms. Going about it quite easily, she'd set them down, finding it not enough of a work out. Setting them back down, she'd let a sigh go, wanting to hurry up and leave. 

Finding things to do in order to continue to work out, she'd find herself moving back to doing push-ups once more, though in a modified version, using only one arm. Struggling a bit at first, she'd start with her right arm, forcing her body to lower and come back up, doing her best not to fall. Keeping with the program, she'd do about fifty of these before she felt she had done enough with that arm, 

Moving onto her other arm, she'd start to do the same thing, once again finding it a bit hard to do right at the start. Though, after a few moments of adjusting to it, she'd find herself going about it again with ease, getting about another fifty reps out of it before she finally decided to stop. Shaking her head, she'd come to the conclusion she was running out of exercises to do. 

Deciding to do one more physical activity before she took a break, she'd move back to bags, now attaching the looks used for carrying to her ankles. Sitting in a chair, she'd alternate between the two, raising them up with the extra weight on them, using them as makeshift training materials. Though, not really keeping count this time, she'd go for quite a while until she found herself to be over it for the time being. Removing them and putting them back, she'd simply sit and wait for Vessul to awake. * - Tue Oct 27 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) Finding the wait to be too much, she'd look around, deciding instead to practice something else. Shaking her head she'd move back to the center of the room once more. Sitting down, she'd slowly bring her thumb to her mouth. Quickly taking a bite at it, she'd let her thumb be cut open, causing a bit of blood to come forth. Nodding, she'd place he hand to the ground, pouring chakra into it. Having done such, she'd get a response with a puff of smoke. Watching as it cleared she'd get nothing out of it. She was too busy trying to rush forward into the technique. Shaking her head at this, she'd bring her hand back up, trying not to let but so much blood drip to the floor. Closing her eyes to maintain her focus, she'd try and get it right the next time around. Controlling her breathing she'd again go back to retry it. 

Putting her hand back down which was bleeding, and pushing chakra through with it, she'd attempt to summon her friend. Which, with a puff of smoke would appear this time, a small, somewhat cute slug which would find itself crawling up onto her shoulder. Smiling a bit, she'd simply nod to it, rubbing its head a small bit. Finding that she had cured her boredom for the time being, she'd simply nod. 

Letting the slug poof back to where it had come from she'd sit around, still waiting, thus, she'd look back down to her hand, realizing that this was the perfect time to keep practicing being that her thumb was already cut, and Vessul wasn't bugging her. Thinking this, he'd again move back to the center of the room. Sitting down carefully, once more crossing her legs, she'd give it one more go, again summoning the little slug, "Sorry, I just want to get better." Saying such she'd pet the slug once more. 

Again letting it dissipate, she'd wipe the blood clean, and move back from the chair, now finding herself over training for the time being. Simply waiting for their supposed trip to Kirigakure which was meant to happen today, she'd glance around, wondering if she should simply wake Vessul up, or let him keep sleeping. Shaking the thought off, she'd simply continue to sit there, waiting. * - Tue Oct 27 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) would've got tired of waiting of vessul. She'd let out a single sigh as she'd quickly dash towards the wall, sliding against the ground with a stop. She'd toss her shoes off as she'd stand still, she could at least work on her lower muscles and abs for now. She'd suddenly drop down into a position, spreading her legs as she'd stick her butt out a bit. She'd place her hands infront of her, her arms directly straight, pointing towards the opposing wall. She'd slowly drop down towards the ground, letting her butt touch the ground with a cold touch..But she didn't mind.

She'd begin a small routine, letting her butt touch the ground for twenty seconds, then slowly raising herself up and standing in a squatting position for twenty seconds. She'd continue on with the different twenty-second intervoles between touching the ground and not. Her butt swayed up and down as she'd work out the muscles within her legs, stomach, and her glutes. After three or so minutes, she'd move her hands to the back of her head for more comfort, but she did look rather lewd.

The girl shortened her time now, dropping two fifthteen seconds touching the ground, and fifthteen not touching the ground. She'd do this for several minutes, dropping down then up, down then up. After five minutes was up, she'd change to ten seconds, now her butt scrunched onto the ground for ten seconds, and her butt in the air for ten seconds, doing faster squats as time went on although it seemed she was doing more of a sit and stand kind of exercise. She'd quickly remove that from the stand as she'd change the intervoles into a second or two. 

She'd stare hitting the ground with a smack before raising up into the air in a squatting position. As she'd do this, the muscles in her legs, stomach, and glutes got quite the workout, she could feel the burn throughout them as she'd move up and down. It was easier then her next exercise though. She'd continue on with the squats, moving faster with each up & down motion. She seemed to be enjoying herself for the most part, as she usually didn't get this much -free time- to herself.

After around ten minutes of fast squats, she'd stop and hold in a squat position for a total of TWENTY minutes. She'd keep still there, holding her body in the same position as gravity tried to fight against her, but failed as she'd push against it. Her body was nearly on fire as her core was burning up with adrenaline! She'd -feel- the burn inside of her body with a glorious rage. At the final minute mark, she was nearly at her limit..But there was no stopping her! She couldn't stop now! The twenty minute hit as she'd plop onto the floor with a heavy breath..It was simply hard to hold yourself perfectly still like that for so long, fights didn't even last that long.

She'd eventually get back onto her feet after a few moments..She had to get back to her training..

She'd roll over onto her stomach, her arms reaching out over to each side of her. She'd place her hands onto the ground and with a mighty heave, she'd lift her whole 190lbs body up off the ground as a small bit of sweat dripped off of her, her genetics usually left her unable to produce much sweat, as her pool of stamina was usually amazing...She'd begin doing the same she'd done with the squats. Letting gravity work, be around one inch off of the ground, now holding it for a minute, before pushing off and holding herself off of the ground in a full pushup for a minute. She'd then drop back down and hold herself for fifty seconds, "One.." She'd mutter before doing the next pushup. After holding for fifty seconds, she'd raise herself back up onto both arms, holding high off of the ground. 

With that, she'd have to continue onwards, pushing herself to hold for thirty seconds each time, each push-up decreased ten seconds off of her timing. By the end, she'd begin regular pushups, going down then up, down then up in a perfect motion together. The girl's breathes were calming as she'd breathe in her mouth and out of her nose, regulating her breathing to not be so heavy and tiring..She had to last as long as she could..She couldn't allow herself to be overtaken anymore..She had to protect vessul..She was vessul's bodyguard, and had been for five whole years..She had been with him through a lot and he's finally showed his emotions to her...She didn't know how to feel about them though, but now wasn't the time to run away in thought.

She'd push herself up and down at max speed, doing two push-ups every second now..She was forcing herself to go at her current max capacity of stamina. It was as if she had a never-ending source of stamina though, her will and inner-strength keeping her able to keep going for vessul. Pain ran through her body as she burnt with a lust for training. Her body kept going even if she had hurt..She could never stop training, especially now. She'd push herself to the limits of her human body and surpass even that..She had read all about people within this world, and how amazing some things were..She'd become one of those people..She'd be known and respected..As well as vessul being even more famous and liked as a famous blacksmith..That is all she really wished for..But the only way to do that was for her to get stronger..

She'd continue pushing herself to the limit with the push-ups, suddenly forcing herself to do three push-ups a second, practically faceplanting into the ground a few times as she did a total of thirty push-ups in ten seconds before stopping, a tiny bit of sweat dripping off of her hairline..Her breathing a becoming heavy...She'd take a few moments to rest after her workout.* - Tue Oct 27 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) Had finally finished off from her first set of training, and had to get back to worth..but had nobody to train with..Realizing such she decided to simply make someone up in her own mind. Starting to imagine that someone was attacking her, she'd get ready to fight. Closing her eyes, she'd basically imagine that someone was right in front of her, and that they were going for Vessul, thus, she'd storm forward, punching at the air where she envisioned the man's face. Though, in her vision, the man would dodge and throw his own attack. 

Forced to jump back, as she was living this like it was a real person in a real fight, someone watching would probably think she was crazy, as she would dive forward to the non-existent person trying to knock them off their feet. Doing such, she'd hit the imaginary person into the dirt, while in reality, she'd just be in the ground herself, but all of that didn't matter, as she'd be kicked off of the person, pushed back onto her feet. 

Angered at this point, she'd get into a stance and wait for the man to get back up, and watching as he advanced towards her. In turn, she'd try to reach forward, grabbing the man by his shirt, and moving her legs between his, bending her back and throwing him. Though, as she did this, the imaginary man would basically land on his feet, making it as if it didn't happen. Shaking it off, she'd simply advance forward again. Though, getting there she would obviously be attacked by him. 

Being forced to dodge, she'd take this as work on her reflexes, trying to avoid every punch the invisible being threw, going as fast as she could. She'd even flinch back when she got hit, and faint the pain, as it would be pointless if it wasn't all real to her. Continuing this for a bit of time she'd make her move once she had avoided an attack, quickly moving to uppercut the man and send him flying back. Doing such, she'd brush herself off, thinking that she had one this fake fighting session. 

Though, turning to look back, she'd figure she may as well keep it up, and this now imagined two assailants attacking her, forcing her to avoid constantly, like she was weaving back and forth from attacks. Though, as she started to build up sweat, she'd quickly make her move, sending one attack at an invisible man, missing, but forcing him to back up. Doing the same thing to the other one, she'd find herself a second to rest, simply watching the two she'd made up with her mind. 

Feeling a bit of a rush from this, she'd wave them both to come at her as she was ready to start up again. The two running at her, would cause her again to go back to the dodging maneuver, trying to think of where they'd attack before they did it. Though, mistiming it, she'd be hit back, causing her to stumble heavily. Catching her balance, she's wait for them to come back in, aiming to kick one away, and have time to fight one of them by itself. Doing such, she'd find herself facing just one of them. 

Facing just the one now, she'd rush forward, trying to attack it with multiple blows that would likely have half of them blocked, as she wasn't gong to make it easy on herself. Quickly trying to aim a kick, she'd aim to knock the fake person down, getting on top of it and start bashing its head in basically, even if it was a fake fight, she wasn't going to show mercy. Once she had done this, she'd move to face the last one of the two, ready to pick a fight with him. 

Watching as he moved close, she'd now focus on her blocking, as the man began to throw punches at her. Trying to keep her speed up, she'd block them the best she could, still getting pushed back, as now that it was only one, her mind had turned up the pressure. Quickly back tracking as she blocked parts of the blows, and simply took the others, she'd try to aim a counter strike, hitting him in the shoulder, and likely sending him back. 

Having done this, she'd move forward, deciding to end this fake fight now, quickly again Trying to aim a kick at the mans legs to get him down, though, missing it, she'd find him advancing again. Going back to trading blow with it, she'd decide that she'd have enough, quickly sending a punch aimed straight at the fake man's head, she'd literally knock it off, her brain giving her this victory as she had started to tire. Shaking her head, she'd decide she needed to cool down before simply stopping. 

Deciding this, she'd go back to what she had don earlier, moving to the door and walking just outside. Setting a cool down of ten laps, she'd start to run around the building, going fast as first and gradually getting slower as she wanted her body to slow down and adjust. Once she had done this, she'd make her way back in and wipe the sweat off that she had accumulated, taking a small break to get water. * - Tue Oct 27 21:36:12 2015
