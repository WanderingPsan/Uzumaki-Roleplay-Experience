<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) nodded as she'd remove her knuckles from her hands, putting them away as she'd get into a running position, "I haven't sparred in forever...And sure, use whatever..I suppose." For some strange reason, her confidence boosted and everything else about her boosted since having a child.

She'd motion the girl to come forward.* - Wed Dec  9 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) stares at the female blankly, listening to her weird chanting..She'd stare at the girl with a confused expression, the girl seeing the spears suddenly form above mitsunara. Momura needed to work on her running anyways..She'd suddenly blurr backwards away from the girl.

"Throw those at me one by one, I need to train my reflexes back up." She'd say as the girl stretched, her attitutde had changed since child birth apparently, weird right? She'd of also moved out of the way from the blade in a quick movement, having a small cut on her leg from the strike..She'd crack her neck as the girl got into a running position, obviously she saw this as more of a training session then spar..* - Wed Dec  9 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) grinned as the female sent out her spears...More of them forming befroe she did. She'd be in a running position as the girl suddenly took off in a rapid pace, sliding through most of them as her feet danced upon the ground, upon one hitting her, it just..did nothing to her really, it'd dissipate upon the damage being done of her torn clothing. The female seemingly appeared right infront of mitsunara as she'd aim to sweep the female off of her feet with a quick kick, if possible, she'd then kick the female into the air.* - Wed Dec  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) grinned as the female had gotten a bit stronger since last time. She'd watch as the nodachi came down towards the female..As it'd clash against her leg, not really doing much, but she'd send the female backwards with the kick apparnetly. She'd watch as the girl went backwards apparently. 

She'd get onto her feet as the girl talked about her kicks, "I trained my legs a lot with sanoke and my old teacher, as well as before that." She'd mutter, nodding, "I've gotta get stronger to protect my children now, Mitsunara." She'd say seriously, suddenly rushing forward in a blurr of speed towards mitsunara, quickly aiming to kick the female in the stomach, that's it really.* - Wed Dec  9 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) blinks as the blade is back to..fire. She'd grit her teeth painfully, she hated fire. As teh female rushed forward, she'd quickly leap backwards, her leg getting cut by the flames..She'd grit her teeth quite annoyingly as the female would've blurred behind the female in a rush of speed, aiming to take advantage of mitsunara for a moment..

If this went to her plan, she'd kick the female up into the air..(I'll continue depending on what you do)* - Wed Dec  9 05:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've watched as the woman attempted to create more spears of darkness..

She'd grit her teeth even more as the spears came towards her, she'd prepare her defenses as the spears..didn't quite do much to the female's skin, except rip through her clothing and cause minor bloodshed, although this didn't stop the female's combo at all..She'd kick the girl high into the air as she'd leap up with her, sudden appearing with her..but was in a weird formation as suddenly mitsunara found herself in an awkward position, now facing the ground with her head.

"I win."

She'd grab the female's ankles and wrapped her legs around the girl's waist, using one of her newer jutsus on the female, Suddenly they'd descent to the ground as she'd ram the girl's head into the sand, of course not trying to bring serious harm to the female.* - Wed Dec  9 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: <*Incoherent Kenpachi Laugh*> - Wed Dec  9 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've been struck on her side from the female's nodachi..Which was a setback as pain rattled throughout her side, still slamming the girl into the ground pretty darn hard. She'd leap away as the female got back up rather fast..And apparently was attacking her once again with the nodachi, to which momura complied with ease.

The girl would've seen the blade coming at her rather quickly, her reflexes kicking in as fast as they possibly could..She was still a bit rusty, so this was difficult.

Suddenly a leg raised into the air as she'd slam the bottom of her foot against the nodachi, hoping to not take any of damage herself, but more to her shoe/foot area. She was at equal strength with the female, so it was obvious that mitsunara would win if they kept trying to slam their weapons together like this, due to the female's fire..

She'd kick off of it, aiming to blurr away from the female quickly as she took a quick breathe..Nine to ten months of not training really put a lot on a girl...She was still working off her fat from her pregnancy.

She'd stare at mitsunara for a moment, trying to decide what to do as the bottom of her shoe was partially burnt off and cut into, the bottom of her foot leaking some blood maybe..Depending on what side the female used, "You've grown stronger since I started a family life, mitsunara." She'd say with a grin, getting ready for the next round.* - Wed Dec  9 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) stares at teh black spears...It was annoying to deal with the woman since she couldn't quite go all out and overpower her right here..Or else she'd hurt herself a lot...

The girl got into a running position as she took a moment to calm her breathing and her body..Her eyes focused on mitsunara and each of the spears...Dodging them was going to become harder as time went on within the spar, it's kind of sad that she had a better chance against sanoke's gigantic summon then mitsunara, which kinda proved that shinobi were stronger..Then again, the turtle was a tiny bit slower then the female. 

The female began a zig-zag motion at a sudden speed of 134mph towards mitsunara as she'd reach into each pocket, throwing out four shuriken towards mitsunara.* - Wed Dec  9 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: What I wanna knwo is - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ari, Momura(JustCallMeGnar) watched as the spears came forward, the girl moved her fingers around as there was actually eight shuriken, one under each, and then there seemed to be wires connected to each, as they'd follow along towards the female, momura would've kept her fingers moving as the female saw the dark spears coming, suddenly changing direction to go around where mitsunara was heading, the female dashing off as two of the spears scratched her arm and leg, but didn't do any damage to really say 'ow' to. 

She'd aim to slice the eight shuriken towards the girl as she'd let go of the wires, hoping the shuriken took care of the girl's current vision. 

If successful, the female would've quickly ran towards the girl, staring at her massive blade as the girl gritted her teeth, the blade was annoying..And she knew mitsunara wasn't even using it at it's full potential yet, which..is where momura wanted to break it.

She'd rush forward in a zig-zag motion with her feet, constantly hopping from one to the other ready to dodge any strikes from the female. Upon getting close, the female would've most likely attempted to use her crescent moon beheading, which momura was annoyed by.

The girl was used to the technique by now as she'd quickly shoot her hand forward as she'd aim to get to mitsunara's wrist, the blade about to reach them before she'd attempt to "misdirect" the blade, and send it away from her instead of towards, if successful, her other hand launched out as she'd attempt to simply stun the female. 

If she was successful in stunning the female with the momentary blow, she'd most likely follow up with a combination attack of rapid punches.* - Wed Dec  9 06:38:56 2015
