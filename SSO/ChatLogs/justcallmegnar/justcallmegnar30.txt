She'd suddenly drop a smoke bomb out of her pocket as her form was covered, suddenly two anntenae popped out of her head before the female quickly dug underground, but to koji..It'd look like she disappeared, as there were no traces left of her above ground..Could he see underground with his byakugan? Probably.

If the female was overrall successful, she'd aim to come behind koji...(This is if you don't do anything like idk..)* - Sun Nov 29 07:07:05 2015

She'd quickly zoom through the earth as she'd aim to come right underneath koji, hoping he dodged, which he probably would, she'd make sure to be facing towards him as she'd back her head for a moment, before shooting out a small black bullet directly at his chest, aiming for it to pierce into his chest.* - Sun Nov 29 07:25:00 2015

"I..can't...l-lose...here.."

She'd think to herself as she took a deep breathe..This man could see her every movements..It must've been those eyes..Something about them..She couldn't block his vision..So this was going to become difficult..

She didn't have any actual clone techniques, and since he could somehow always see her, it was pointless for her to use her regular attacks..and there two of him..Her stamina took a big dip with that second strike to..She'd bundle her hands into fists before suddenly taking off in a quick burst of speed, not holding back as she'd aim to ram her fist into the real koji's chest, aiming to send shockwaves around his body with her full-powered punch, not holding back at all.* - Sun Nov 29 07:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've missed the strike as she had that, 'ohdeargodno' moment in her head. She'd look over at him as he got into a sudden stance..She'd suddenly be barraged as her chakra points her shut down, the woman looked shocked...She'd..never had this done to her..She'd take a few steps back as paine slithered through her body...

"W-Wha.."

She'd just be shocked..she couldn't feel most of her body..And those strikes..he attacked..so..fast..She literally had no clue what to do...She was helpless against him..But..she couldn't stop here..She'd quickly rush up the side of the mountain, going ontop of it as she'd plan out her next attack, getting out of range.* - Sun Nov 29 08:07:40 2015
