She'd then grab shuriken out of her pockets and tossed them forward, it looked like two shuriken, but turned out to be four as she'd pull back strings on the hidden shuriken and regular shuriken, manipulating them with strings as if she were a pro-kage.

She'd let them plop to the ground before leaning back and simply shooting out a black bullet from her mouth infront of paine..Who knew what that was? She'd continue..using the movements for the technique known as "misdirect" followed by the technique, "throat strike" as she'd thrust her hand forward. She'd then back up and leapt forward, doing a high kick, which seemed to be a feint before doing a low-kick, utilizing an actual taijutsu technique amazingly...

And last but not least, she'd walk on the wall, utilizing suimen...Showing off all of her techniques, which were all mostly D-rank or lower.

"T-There." She'd say, walking infront of paine.* - Thu Nov 19 02:36:35 2015

"I-If this is a s-spar..we h-have to work together m-mana.." she said, waiting for another ball or balls.* - Fri Nov 20 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) kept the same motions..She had to keep doing it over and over..she could tell paine would make her do it over and over until it were correct. She'd move her hands out of formation before re-doing it..Her fist met her palm as she'd cushion it gently. She'd take a few steps back..Maybe she needed a running start..She'd nod.

A sudden dash was given as the female blurred forward, using her palm to cushion her blow as she'd ram her elbow right into the rock, not holding back at all, she was trying to give it her all to impress her master..She had to get stronger for hanai..So she had to do this elbow-training!* - Sat Nov 21 01:28:19 2015

She'd scream out before suddenly rushing forward in a whirlwind of fury as her elbow rammed into the rock, she'd hit it with as much force and rage as she tried to break it with all of her might..She felt she wasn't doing the best she could, she had to do the best!* - Sat Nov 21 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) had to do just that. She'd bring back her elbow once more..She had to get this one right..She took a few steps back, her eyes tunnel-visioning directly on the point where she struck before..her subconcious developing this as a critical-point.  She'd rampage forward as she let out a small howl, "I-I'll get it this t-time!!!!" She'd ram her elbow directly on the critical point, giving it her all.* - Sat Nov 21 01:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've leapt back once more as she'd point her elbow directly at the critical point once more..Adrenaline ran through her veins..she wasn't doing good enough! She'd get into a running position after going all the way to the wall and turning around. Her elbow pointed directly at the rock as she held her open-palm as a cushion...She wasn't doing good enough..! She'd suddenly kick the sand back up into the air as she'd dash forward, her elbow ramming forward as she'd let out a war-cry, suddenly her elbow rammed into the rock at full-strength, "I-I will impress you paine-s-sama!!!"* - Sat Nov 21 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) had to try it with the coral now! She'd leap backwards as she'd point her elbow towards the coral..Her eyes focused and tunneled directly upon the critical point of the coral. The girl took a deep breathe as she'd get into a running position before suddenly taking off at high-speeds directly towards the coral, "I-I'll break it for you...P-Paine-sama!!!!!!" She'd scream out, ramming her elbow directly into the coral as she'd aim to break it!!* - Sat Nov 21 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) sighed, nodding to them in reponse. They'd walk back as their arms began to straighten up together, her fist pumping into her open palm. She'd wait until her arms were steady and straight, after several moments of fumbling around, she supposed she got it right, as it was decently straight and seemed good enough. She'd then position herself so that the point of her elbow was pointed directly at the coral..She'd suddenly zoom forward as she'd aim to keep her body steady and neat. A quick jab with her elbow was given towards the coral, giving it her all.* - Sat Nov 21 02:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) blinked, nodding as she'd walk back and face the rock..She'd get into her position once more, fixing herself up..she had caught the tiny crack..the coral must be retardedly durable..She'd line-up her elbow like she lines up her bullets..The tip being the part you wanna aim with. She'd straighten up her aiming and her arms as her fist kept against her open palm. She held it tightly as the girl took off, sand trailed behind her as she'd ram her elbow into the rock..who knew if she were successful or not? She didn't care.

She'd return back to her spot anyways..She'd attempt to do the "meditation" she'd been told about, putting her hands together as she'd close her eyes and began to focus on her inner-mind, letting her strength and the current flow of time leave her conciousness as she'd rest for a moment, her mind going at ease before she'd slowly open her eyes and let out a glare forward..She'd have to accomplish this soon, she felt as if this were a low-ranking technique and paine was looking at her like a complete idiot, she couldn't be an idiot...She had to make sure she looked good and was treated with respect, as she treated others.

She'd clasp her palm open as her fist pushed into the middle of it, she'd wrap her fingers around it, her flesh and muscles acting like a "cushion" against the forces of the rock and such..She'd then line up the point of her elbow to the critical point on the rock, her legs began to move forward as she kept her body still, aside form her legs. Upon the moment her leg left the ground, sand rushed around her as her speed was at maximum. She'd ram her elbow directly into the stone, aiming to crush it, or do something at least with a final strike.* - Sat Nov 21 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: May I ask, why the sword? - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: My dad wanted to train me to be a strong warrior, and I wanted to be just like my dad. - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) poked chikyu on the cheek.* - Sat Nov 21 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: F-Fists are the b-best weapon. - Sat Nov 21 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The best weapon is compassion. - Sat Nov 21 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Anyway, I ask about the sword because I've grown an interest in it. - Sat Nov 21 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) poked chikyu in the cheek once more, "B-Bullets are.."* - Sat Nov 21 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I'm no good at teaching. And, I don't think my dad would teach you anything. If you want any basic info, I can tell  you anything you want. - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've seen rather graceful and composed moves from swordsmen.  They don't allow their emotions to sway their judgement.  - Sat Nov 21 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) poked chikyu's cheek back once more, adding a small rub to!

"O-Oh well maybe.."* - Sat Nov 21 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't plan to learn the sword for combat reasons, rather for meditative reasons.  My training with Yukio has been quite difficult, and I've been convinced that by taking up the sword I may be able to concentrate more and build up on my physical attributes. - Sat Nov 21 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) blinked..She didn't know what chikyu was doing, but she didn't mind!

She'd giggle as her cheeks were rubbed, momura copied chikyu's actions!* - Sat Nov 21 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) made a fish-face as chikyu did this, doing the same to her! They were now fish.* - Sat Nov 21 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: This is pretty funny. - Sat Nov 21 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) giggled as she'd reply back, "Blub blub b-blub!" She'd say with a weird crunched up fish smile, the girl couldn't cross her eyes but she tried her hardest!* - Sat Nov 21 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) saw chikyu and couldn't help herself..She'd fall back laughing her ass off, it was more of a light kitty giggle, her voice was never that deep, her sneezes were like kittens to!* - Sat Nov 21 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) tried to pull herself back up as she'd take the cup, "T-Thank you!" She said in a giggly tone.* - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you.  I used to make it all the time at the temple. - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're welcome. - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Temple? - Sat Nov 21 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) sucked up her tea quickly, "I-It's good!"* - Sat Nov 21 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't? I thought I did.  - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nope! - Sat Nov 21 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: So, what temple did you become a monk? - Sat Nov 21 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The Lightning Temple near Kumogakure. - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Thats pretty far away right? - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why did you come all the way here then? - Sat Nov 21 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I used to live in Kumogakure, until a dear friend and mentor of mine died... - Sat Nov 21 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, to give you the simple answer, to explore the world. - Sat Nov 21 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The real answer is a journey to find an answer to an age old question. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hmm..? - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The question? Well, how to obtain peace.  I thought my initial views from when I was in the temple would suffice, but I've seen hardships and not everyone is willing to share my views. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Well easiest w-way to peace.. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Tea...a good r-restaurant..family o-owned.. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's no easy way. It's a long and challenging task.  I can find ways to obtain peace, but none will stick. I want a peace that will last for a life time, one that will never break. - Sat Nov 21 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-Watermelon? - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmm... that sounds all pretty complicated. I'll just keep on protecting those who I care about. - Sat Nov 21 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Everyone believes that they can obtain peace by cutting down their opponents, but that's not true peace. That just leads to an eternal linegae of bloodshed and agony. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, I'm not chasing peace. I'm chasing to protect what I can while I'm alive. - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You take the life of one, you're robbing others.  It's a large domino effect. - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) just keeps mumbling about watermelons.* - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're willing to take a life to protect what's yours? - Sat Nov 21 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) nodded, plopping against chikyu's side, they took a liking to her.* - Sat Nov 21 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Even if taking said life will rob another of the ability to protect what's theres? What if someone comes for revenge? Will you keep taking lives after lives until you have nothing left? - Sat Nov 21 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the world I wish to create, you won't have to worry about such a problem.  Everyone will be able to coexist together and not have to fight for resources, and protection.  - Sat Nov 21 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-That's a basic human p-problem. - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Taking a life is never a good deed, no matter how you justify it. However, is not sitting back just as wrong. When you can help someone to the best of your ability. I'm here to be a good person to my friends, and thats all I can offer in my life thats of value. Other then that, I'll selfishly protect those around me. I'm not good at creating peace or anything like that. But, if you can do that I'll be really happy. Because, I won't have to fight anymore. - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: T-This got really d-deep.. - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: W-Wait.. - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Why d-do I stutter in my m-mind? - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: W-What is t-this!? - Sat Nov 21 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Why do you stutter in here... and why does your mind have a watermelon wallpaper? - Sat Nov 21 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: W-Who knows! - Sat Nov 21 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uhm.. - Sat Nov 21 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) pulled out a random watermelon.

"T-This is the best w-way to solve a-any problem.."* - Sat Nov 21 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: R-Right? - Sat Nov 21 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want to bust it open, and take a few bites for ourselves? - Sat Nov 21 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) nodded, "Already ahead of you." She'd crack it into two pieces with ease.* - Sat Nov 21 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want some Kuro? - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No thank you. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thank you for offering though. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Sat Nov 21 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) blinked as she'd devour the watermelons, blinking over at chikyu, she had the seeds in her cheek, "Y-You can shoot them out at the wall.." Of course, momura's bullet-seeds were like pokemon-tier. She'd shoot them out like a rain of gunfire, of course making it so they didn't have enough power to penetrate, just hit the wall.* - Sat Nov 21 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You should at least aim for the garbage can. - Sat Nov 21 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'll clean it up.. - Sat Nov 21 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) pats chikyu's head, "G-Good job!" She'd then swoop the seeds, and put them in the garbage can in a moment's notice, being back in her chair.* - Sat Nov 21 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You have to teach me though, how you shot them out like that! - Sat Nov 21 07:04:32 2015
