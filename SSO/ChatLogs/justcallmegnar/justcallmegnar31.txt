As the female suddenly threw out five kunai towards both of them, five for each of them..She'd quickly slide down the back of the sand hill, as it seemed to be that ai's kunai just flew overhead. She'd then peer back up, seeing how her master had fended off, and seeing what she should do..* - Mon Nov 30 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've been gone within a moment as she felt the giant sandworm..Oh boiii..This would be interesting..She'd take out kunais strapped with explosive tags and suddenly pop out as koji and ai were to busy handling the worm. She'd suddenly release around ten kunai, each with an explosive tag towards the group, of course..Having knowledge of koji's air palm, she appeared more south-east to ai, so she didn't face koji's air palm technique. 

She'd attempt to have four of the kunai lodge into ai's back before she could comprehend what was happening, letting off a sudden explosion to destroy the clone, or dissipate the technique. The others were set off towards koji, aiming to explode around his feet.* - Mon Nov 30 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) would've watched as the sheets of paper..easily dodged momura's attack, making everything she did practically useless as she knew koji could see in a 360'view from his "doujutsu" So it made it nigh-impossible to fight him..Since his reflex and attack speed -highly- beat hers in every possible field..She had wished paine had taught her that whirlwind technique so she could of been of some use, but she still hadn't when she said she would..So..yea..

She'd quickly aim to go back underground as she'd rush towards ai and paine. The female, she would've attempted to outrun the sheets of paper and throw up a single kunai from the ground with an explosive tag, aiming to strike ai's sheets of paper directly if this was possible. 

If she had failed, she'd then toss out several shurikens from underground, tossing them into the sheets of paper as she attempted to rip the female's paper..Of course, with her masters technique as well.* - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015

She..had no clue what to do now..She could use her single poison bomb she's had forever and ever...She saw her senpai roll down the mini-mountain.nooo..She couldn't let this be the defeat of the two of them..She had to succeed in these exams..

She'd suddenly raise herself out of ground as her hands finished a final seal..This was her final strike, knowing that ai would easily overpower her if she couldn't pull this off..

She had learned that every piece of paper was apart of ai..And she had no AOE techniques..The only technique that could serve useful here..Was one of her weakest..yet most effective.

She'd raise both hands to the sides as wires wooshed out, aiming to tangle into the paper, she'd begin rapidly swishing her hands around, aiming to bind the paper up into bundles, and dis-assemble it with rapid movements of the wires.
