<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) gazes at Kilm, running her eyes across his arms, his legs, and the majority of his frame. A light blue color drapes the cornea of her eyes as she examines him intently.

"I'm.... from. . . . Sunagakure." She manages to utter, deciding whether or not to say Amegakure, since that was where she spent the majority of her ninja life.* - Sat Sep 05 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) nervously laughs.* - Sat Sep 05 15:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) // It would be too difficult to hide emotion when she heard of Kronos' death. A visible flinch is present, though Amu quickly tries to regain her calm composure.* - Sat Sep 05 16:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) observes the black guy who was carrying her get destroyed so she falls on the ground.* - Mon Sep 07 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) was laying on the ground, rather fearful of those around him at the moment. Amu at present did not have her Sunagakure headband on her. Her body looked to be rather worn down; this was clear because she looked much skinnier than she used to be, arguably from abuse by Amegakure no Sato. 

When her name was called, she glances up at Tetsumi. "....H-How do you know my name?" Amu asked, recognizing the iron sand gourd first. It looked like Tetsumi's. But Amu seemed to have difficulties discerning if it was Tetsumi or not. * - Mon Sep 07 03:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) // "T-Tetsu-kun? That's you?" Amu said, bewildered. She moves through the trees, before noticing Ikarus. Amu bites her lip. She recognizes Ikarus immediately. He didn't change. At all. The guy was still hoisting around a hammer. 

"I.... didn't think you'd ever be as tall as me." Amu stated. She glances back to the ANBU Agent who seemed to be approaching her.* - Mon Sep 07 03:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) // Her eyes illuminate briefly with a light blue color that sets itself towards Tetsumi and the others. She glances at Ikarus, Tetsumi, and the ANBU Agent. Though, most of her eyesight goes to Tetsumi and Ikarus, since they were the most important to her and most prevalent in her life back in Sunagakure.

Her light blue eyes scan their bodies, as though examining their growth. Not in the perverted way, assholes. But in a way to see if they were really who they were.* - Mon Sep 07 03:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) looks over at Ikarus and Tetsumi. She seems to completely ignore Dravae's existence though. It was the idea of seeing her friends again that really revitalized her, despite her severe emotional trauma over the past couple of years. She looks at Tetsumi, before silently saying. "I missed you..." 

Quietly, she walks over to Tetsumi, trying to forcibly hug him, wrap her arms around him, and tighten her grip. To her, Tetsumi was akin to...perhaps a little brother. And Ikarus? Well, she still kept distance, somewhat. She knew that she wasn't as close to Ikarus, even though she desired to be close to him as a friend.* - Mon Sep 07 03:39:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) tears up a bit. "What's with you, you sound like a man and not a child." She punches Tetsumi in the side weakly, more in a playful manner than in a hostile manner. She didn't want to bring up her five years of confinement in Amegakure; she was sure there was -some- reason they didn't do anything. Right? Right. Right! Amu holds onto Tetsumi with a grip akin to a deathgrip though, as though she was afraid of losing him again.* - Mon Sep 07 03:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Hi. - Tue Sep 29 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) examines Erebus shortly. Her lavendar eyes move across him and his supposed concubine beside him.

"My name is Rosa. A Genin of Konohagakure. I seek a mission."* - Tue Sep 29 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) receives the scroll and departs.* - Tue Sep 29 01:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: May I ask you for thy name? - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Sabo. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: My name is Rosa. - Tue Sep 29 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: ..Right. Same to you. - Tue Sep 29 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) bows towards Sabo.* - Tue Sep 29 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) recognizes that Sabo was in the midst of a mission. She apologizes briefly with a gesture, unsure if Sabo was able to see it. She stands beside him for the time being though, not wanting to move from her position since she was interested in the male. * - Tue Sep 29 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) remains stationary. She doesn't budge from her position. In addition, her hands don't make any intimate maneuvers towards Sabo, in fear of making him feel uncomfortable. Instead, she remains to herself and keeps to herself as well. * - Tue Sep 29 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) continues to remain stationary. Akin to a statue, she only wavered when she desired to look at Sabo and inspect him. He was disciplined; that much was what Rosa could tell from a single glance. She didn't speak, in fear of breaking his concentration.* - Tue Sep 29 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) observes Sabo. After noticing his capacity to summon, Rosa was increasingly curious in his abilities. Her right hand rose behind Sabo and aimed to flick the back of his head, expecting him to dodge or counter.* - Tue Sep 29 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) withdraws her finger and returns it to her side. Her facial expression was rather stoic. Despite Sabo's threat, she appeared to look more amused than frightened. 

"You have great skill with your blade. At least pulling it out." Rosa stated, folding her arms across her back gently. His blade was exposed; Rosa carefully inspected it for any sudden movements. 

Rosa assessed his power in the few seconds and the brief exchange they had. Fortunately, Rosa was able to calculate to some degree, the overwhelming prowess the swordsman before her had. 

"But tell me. Why are you so tense?"* - Tue Sep 29 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: ...So it's by choice. - Tue Sep 29 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Are you lonely?  - Tue Sep 29 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: To live such a lifestyle. - Tue Sep 29 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Lonely? No. - Tue Sep 29 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I see. - Tue Sep 29 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I simply assumed you lived the life of the sword. . . By means of how you act.  - Tue Sep 29 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I do. - Tue Sep 29 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I too... sympathize. - Tue Sep 29 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: ....You don't look the part. - Tue Sep 29 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: What's.... that supposed to mean? - Tue Sep 29 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Exactly what it sounds like. You don't look like you do. - Tue Sep 29 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: ....... - Tue Sep 29 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: But how do you infer that? - Tue Sep 29 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I don't see a blade, that's all. - Tue Sep 29 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) finds relief in that Sabo didn't accuse her based on gender.* - Tue Sep 29 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: My sword is within my clothes. I can show you if you'd like. - Tue Sep 29 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I'd like that actually. I'd like to compare our blades. - Tue Sep 29 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) runs her hands across her jacket and unzips it gradually. After it is unzipped, she is left with her white blouse wrapped around her torso. She slips her hands into the blouse, running her hand in between her breasts before pulling out a small baton-like object. 

She swings it and stretches the baton to its full length of perhaps four feet.

"This is my blade."* - Tue Sep 29 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Thank you for the compliment. - Tue Sep 29 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: You're welcome. - Tue Sep 29 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I would say the same for yours. - Tue Sep 29 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: But you haven't pulled it out from your pants yet.  - Tue Sep 29 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: So, Sabo. - Tue Sep 29 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Are you a ninja of Konoha? - Tue Sep 29 03:05:10 2015

She figured the monster was a threat to Kirigakure no Sato, and the rearing maneuvers of its head were signs of incoming misfortune. Rosa's right hand slides through her cleavage to retrieve a six inch baton. A quick throw in the air and her right hand had caught it, only to extend it fully in the arc by which she catches it. 

Revealed is a heavy, long sectional staff with a bladed end. It was just preparatory measures incase she may have to vote. She steps back momentarily, calling out to the individuals in the general area.

"Step back, Genin. . . . . You can't fight this."

So be it. Allow these Genin to march on, whether they flee or whether they attack. It was up to them at this point.

Rosa activates her Suimen and walks across the Mud Silhouette with little issue. Her goal though, is not to engage the Rokubi. She keeps a fair distance away from it in order to prepare for any erroneous mistakes to be made by the beast for her to take advantage of. Of course, she does want to wait to see what the others planned to do; specifically her attention was on Ryutaro who seemed to be... developing some strange chakra.* - Sat Nov 14 19:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Look at this...all of this for one beast! Hahahaha!~ - Sun Nov 15 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Hanai. Is this where you live now? - Sun Nov 22 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: It gets worse. - Sun Nov 22 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sun Nov 22 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) kind of just walks in.* - Sun Nov 22 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: T-That woman... - Sun Nov 22 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: W-Would be a teacher of m-mine. - Sun Nov 22 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) grabs hold of the fist in a moment's notice as it heads towards her. Rosa inspects Momura up to down. She releases the hand if Momura does nothing, and just walks on forward. 

"You have a nice house." * - Sun Nov 22 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sun Nov 22 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: U-Um. - Sun Nov 22 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: R-Rosa-san. - Sun Nov 22 03:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Y-You don't a-always have to bust down doors. - Sun Nov 22 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sun Nov 22 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) counteracts the majority of Momura's punches with her hands. Her reflexes outmatched Momura's attack speed by quite the handful. Regardless, no matter the outcome, Rosa did not choose to actually physicall retaliate. She regards it as merely an introductory welcome if anything.

Of course, if Chikyu just stopped it, she'd just walk on forward as though she also lived in the house, rather abruptly. Her sociopathic tendencies made her show little emotion.

"Do you cook, Hanai? Or does one of your girlfriends cook?" She asks quietly. * - Sun Nov 22 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: U-Usually. - Sun Nov 22 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Is going to screw over my day. - Sun Nov 22 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I see that now is not a good time for me to resume your training, Hanai. - Sun Nov 22 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I can return later. - Sun Nov 22 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Ari*_ - Sun Nov 22 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I can fix the d-door. - Sun Nov 22 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Have you seen someone named Nina recently? I've taken a curiousity in a girl who goes by the name of that. I haven't seen her lately. I figured she left to Sunagakure after the attack. - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: N-No, I-I can't say I h-have.  - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Hanai, please take care of yourself as I am gone. Don't need you dead.  - Sun Nov 22 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) glances at Kinami and nods at her. She'd step by Chikyu and brush by her. Of course, her eyes move to examine her for a moment.* - Sun Nov 22 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: You would be...... - Sun Nov 22 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: May I ask for your name?  - Sun Nov 22 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: It is nice to meet you, Chikyu.  - Sun Nov 22 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rosa(RainbowForce) steps out, deciding she'd come in later.* - Sun Nov 22 04:01:29 2015
