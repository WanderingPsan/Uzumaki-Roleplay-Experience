<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Assistant? - Sat Nov  7 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Some girl named Mei. - Sat Nov  7 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Sounds like a whore. - Sat Nov  7 23:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) stared at him with an expression that said she was quite serious.* - Sat Nov  7 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not ready to talk to Ortho. - Sat Nov  7 23:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded a single time, "yeah... you too." Then she headed off.* - Sat Nov  7 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) walked into the mansion and peered about before finally resting her pale blue eyes on the Mizukage and Mei. "Hello, Sir!"* - Sat Nov  7 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded and stepped closer, "Hello, I'm one of the shinobi of this village. I was out on a long term mission when Mizukage Kirie was murderered. I sort of fell out of sorts when I didn't recieve orders in a timely manner and then some turn of events happened that left me stranded in the middle of no where left for dead. That man, the one that you were speaking with a few days ago when I popped in so rudely? He saved me from the barren land I was laying dying in. I was just coming to report in and hope that maybe I could get a new assignment or take up my old one under your new leadership?" She had said a rather lot, taking a deep breath to make up for all she had said, Owari wrinkled her nose up with a smile of humor at how she managed to get the whole story out so quickly.* - Sat Nov  7 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Damn Ume for ever talking me into this. - Sat Nov  7 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) really only had the kirigakure headband across her head holding some of her hair in place as a show of her shinobiship, she looked rather casual for the moment. "O-oh sorry about that... er... well see, my job honestly was to spy on other villages. I stayed out on missions for a very long duration so that I could create identities strong enough to uphold. Sometimes even gaining shinobi authorization by going through the academy so I can access certain records and buildings that aren't available to the average civilian." Nodding confidently and then smiling, she looked to be someone who was sweet in nature but very serious about her dedication by how she sounded and formed her phrases, not to mention body language while speaking with the Mizukage.* - Sat Nov  7 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He sounds tired. - Sat Nov  7 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) bowed her head to him respectfully and reached down to her dress at mid thigh to lift it a short distance as she pretty much curstied respectfully. "Yes that would make me happy, Sir. I will leave you be unless you need anything from me, you sounded busy when I came in."* - Sat Nov  7 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then rose her head back up, "I'm Owari Hajimari by the way, for your records!" She then flashed a smile Mei's direction and headed for the door.* - Sun Nov  8 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Jehan... - Sun Nov  8 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Nov  8 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yo. - Sun Nov  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Too easy to trick him. - Sun Nov  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Look at you being cocky. - Sun Nov  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I told him I was a shinobi that had been out on mission before Kirie was assassinated, that I was a type of spying shinobi that worked long periods of time outside of Kirigakure to gather information... and thus he gave me my 'old job' back at my request. - Sun Nov  8 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: He believed that? - Sun Nov  8 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: He's an idiot. - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Yep..... so I get to travel as I please. - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: To be fair... I knew what lies would work on him. - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Hm? How so? - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: He isn't who he appears to be. - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Who is he? - Sun Nov  8 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Thaenan...  - Sun Nov  8 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: ... - Sun Nov  8 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Yep. - Sun Nov  8 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I see. - Sun Nov  8 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I'm starting to think he's like... a place holder transition to get people used to Kiri being ran by someone they don't know... for Ortho to take over. - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: It's certainly possible. - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: He hasn't told me any of his plans though, so I don't know. - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Where do you intend to go now? - Sun Nov  8 00:09:23 2015
