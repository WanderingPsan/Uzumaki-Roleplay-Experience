<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) || The strange medium sized person crouched looming their straw covered face over the berry bush. Staring down into the blooms beside the dark small berries on the plant and not giving much of a care about any civilians or otherwise walking in the area, including Ortho. Granted, Ume did feel something -different- about him than others in the area but she couldn't be quite sure what it was. The only signal that she might be female was the extremely long dark violet hair secured under her cap and cascading down the back of her cloak.* - Tue Nov  3 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) 's brim of hat shifted for a moment at the cough and her eyes shifted up towards him for only a second before drifting back to the particularly small bloom on the bush. Her eyes grew larger as her solid yellow eyes nearly as bright as the yellow which brimmed sunflowers became further enthralled in whatever she was doing. It seemed as if she had some sort of fascination with the bush... or maybe she was just holding a staring contest with something that couldn't stare back?* - Tue Nov  3 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) didn't bother looking up again, she could tell his general motions through her periphereal so there was no reason to look up, after all she was busy! She resumed her staring and waited for the man to do something that would require her to act or speak.* - Tue Nov  3 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) felt her eyelids twitch a bit lower as he came to crouch on the other side of the bush. He now could easily enough see her strangely white skin, not just pale but seriously white as if she had painted herself to be a geisha without all the lipstick and the fancy kimono. She gently relaxed her eyes to focus back on the berry bush and then whispered.

"Shh, I'm trying to listen..."* - Tue Nov  3 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and now fully lifted her head up to peer over Ortho's face. How did he know she was listening for it to -speak-, she hadn't said that, only that she was -listening- so perhaps he believed that plants could talk? 

"You.... believe me?" 

She always thought herself just a tad insane by how everyone else reacted to her fascination with plants and how they 'spoke to her'. With the burst of wind from the air bullets, Ume felt the brim of her straw hat catch a breeze and fell flush back against the back of her neck and upper shoulders. Her pale geisha like complexion exposed with her brilliant yellow eyes staring over at the attacker. To her this wasn't something potentially playful, it was all harm intended in her book. Whispering to herself she backed up a few steps after having stood.

"Child bad..."* - Tue Nov  3 09:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) seemed entirely calm and tranquil while listening to the child speak, though she got more annoying by the moment. Exhaling out a breath as she had began to try and turn to leave with pale white hands tucking away into her cloak she heard the word 'she' mentioned several times and turned back to see them focusing their attention towards herself. A long drawn out pause of silence from the woman continued before she spoke in a hushed tone barely above a whisper, likely only Ortho had heard it honestly.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because you have nothing better to do. I'm going to take out Kirigakure. Take control and rebuild it form the ground up. That village is tainted and I'm going to cleans it.. - Tue Nov  3 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) didn't like that look on his stupid face so she looked back down at the dirt path in front of herself.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) peered back towards him and then up to the other male near them and then down to the berry bush with minature blooms. <i>"They were saying that the soil here is very weak, they remember better in a dim forest before someone planted it here for ease of access."</i> She found it oddly... -personal- to speak about what a plant had said to her and she quickly faced front and away from Ortho after having answered his question. Clearly she could be shy at times...* - Tue Nov  3 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and her body went rigid, what an odd thing for someone who appeared not to believe to say.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) stopped smiling as soon as she caught on that he wasn't smiling. Was that bad timing for a smile? She would remember that was not a proper time for a smile.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) found his question odd and his smile strange but she simply didn't smile knowing he only had smiled to try and make her feel better. "No... of course not silly."* - Tue Nov  3 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) pretended as if this was taking her a while to figure out, as if it was a 'theory' rather than her actually knowing. "No, it does not. There is just life, and death."* - Tue Nov  3 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So If I HM01'd that bitch it wouldn't scream? -omit- - Tue Nov  3 22:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: . . .Do I want to even try and jump in this conversation? . . .Nahhh. - Tue Nov  3 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) glanced up slowly towards Index. Her pale white skin the shade of a geisha's facepaint as she peered from under the old straw hat.* - Tue Nov  3 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) glanced between Ortho and Index, by now she was starting to gather that Ortho was somewhat of an important figure. Thaenan was just some fodder that Ortho's little sister ... dated? And this Index person was dangerous. She then looked at the plant, the plant was the most normal out of all of them. Normal depression issues from being planted inside of a village. Yes, normal.

She wore a ragged cloak that looked worn with age, an old straw hat, and her boots had a few wears and holes here and there. Clearly she was wearing peasant clothing and nothing shinobi related. The only thing that stood out about her other than her geisha white skin and deep violet lengthy locks of hair, was the fact there was a rather beautiful green sheathed katana poking out of her cloak. It looked old but well taken care of...* - Tue Nov  3 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Friend. - Tue Nov  3 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) stared at the hand held out to her. What was she suppose to do with it? No one really ever shook her hand but she watched as he didn't move it and there was nothing really interesting to see about his hand, thus finally she extended her own and touched his hand. Though she didn't shake his hand, instead she brushed her four finger tips over the back of his hand and stared up into his visage with her sunflower yellow eyes. Whispering soon afterwards, "are you dangerous?"* - Tue Nov  3 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) inhaled and exhaled out slowly. She lowered her hand back down and under her cloak. "Why should I give my name to someone who is 'extremely' dangerous?" It seemed as if she was teasing him but it was a genuine question for her. She wanted to learn from the situation, to figure out if she could trust -some- dangerous people.* - Tue Nov  3 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) swallowed a lump in her throat, the need to learn was strong and he had just dropped some interesting amount of information on her. "Did... you just offer protection? Maybe I read that wrong." She couldn't figure out for the life of her why some man who was considered oh so dangerous would offer a peasant such as her protection. Was her association, granted so fresh, to Ortho all that important?* - Tue Nov  3 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why is he talking to me instead of the person who is important? - Tue Nov  3 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head curiously to the side almost similar to a child, the straw hat fell away to reveal more of her messy long purple strands. "Why care if I make friends? No one cared in the past, I go about unnoticed most times."* - Tue Nov  3 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Strange, it looked like he was delivering bad news but then he smiled. - Tue Nov  3 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) fell silent and had nothing else to say. She didn't understand why he had faith in her, she was a stranger after all. Because of this though she decided that now was a good time to tell him her name. He had earned it for having given her the time of day, just as Ortho had.* - Tue Nov  3 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Ume. - Tue Nov  3 23:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) was slowly walking around the courtyard, it seemed things were rather inactive currently as there weren't all that many people around. She wasn't sure why she was being focused on out of all of the people in the courtyard, after all she was only a peasant girl and only had one weapon upon her person. Merely for protection on top of that. She simply shook her head to the redhead asking to assist her. When crashing and screams began to sound the woman turned her head towards the distant sounds in the South East and then began to head out of the courtyard.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Should, but don't. The shinobi that aren't foolish are outnumbered by the foolish ones. Numbers are a major factor in the shinobi world. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Blame me for the foolish mindset that Kirigakure brainwashed her with. - Wed Nov  4 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: My mission was to destroy their military. Violet's false pride for the village led to her death. - Wed Nov  4 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hell, if it weren't for my love that I had for you as my brother, I wouldn't even acknowledge you. - Wed Nov  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Apparently not enough. You still hold malice for me when I didn't even pay attention to Violet until -she- came at me. - Wed Nov  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I was fine with letting her live until she made the wrong move. - Wed Nov  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So take your "joy" in killing as well as your "joy" of losing your sister. - Wed Nov  4 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hate me? Fine, good. Do that. - Wed Nov  4 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Losing my sister? Pssh. - Wed Nov  4 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Wow...no one is going to answer me. - Wed Nov  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Hm? - Wed Nov  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The.. potential. - Wed Nov  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: If she learned to harness her anger, don't you think she'd be ten times stronger than she is now? - Wed Nov  4 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Honestly.... I don't see any potential... I see a weak girl with training and hate.... a girl who needs to grow up and figure out what she really wants in life. If she hates you and wants you dead, her love shouldn't have stopped her. - Wed Nov  4 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I see that too, I see that too. - Wed Nov  4 07:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The flourishing part. - Wed Nov  4 07:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'd like to watch that happen, each stage. - Wed Nov  4 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: As for your question from earlier: there are more villages, but Kirigakure is.. unique. - Wed Nov  4 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Because it's crumbling? - Wed Nov  4 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Haha, I wasn't thinking that.. but yeah. - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Nothing more I can really do now. - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Kirigakure is more.. wet than the others. - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .... - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) nodded.* - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Konohagakure has the most plant life, though. - Wed Nov  4 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: ...can we go there? - Wed Nov  4 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Ton of trees and grass and all that good stu- - Wed Nov  4 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mhm, sure. - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: If I get any closer she'd be likely to go for my head again, and then Ortho might threaten to cut my lips off once more. - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You want them to tag along? - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Such a hostile family. - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) turned her body to face Ortho.* - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Do I have that decision to make? - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Of course. - Wed Nov  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I honestly don't want to.... but I can tell you want to watch her.... growth. - Wed Nov  4 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can multitask. - Wed Nov  4 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) followed after him if they weren't stopped.* - Wed Nov  4 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Take your time.  - Wed Nov  4 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Didn't even make it far. - Wed Nov  4 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: ...w-woah. - Wed Nov  4 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov  4 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Figured you'd like it here. - Wed Nov  4 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) stared around at all the trees and slowly began to walk about feeling along their trunks and concentrating on them intently before smiling with her small rounded teeth peeking out.* - Wed Nov  4 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) spoke out in a hushed voice, "The tree's are so healthy here."* - Wed Nov  4 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: What happened here? - Wed Nov  4 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A lot of war. - Wed Nov  4 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Similar to Kirigakure. - Wed Nov  4 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Are there people here? - Wed Nov  4 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Few. - Wed Nov  4 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not much. - Wed Nov  4 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thought for a long while as she rubbed her hand up and down the trunk and the bark covering the rounded surface filled with knots. "Do you want me to kill for you like you did today in the future? Is that why you want me?"* - Wed Nov  4 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) frowned slightly hidden away as she was turned from him. Turning to face him now with a relaxed expression, "You want me.... to live?"* - Wed Nov  4 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) felt her lips curl up into a wide grin. "You think I'm the flower."* - Wed Nov  4 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) slowly walked towards him till she was standing just before him. She was sure no one was around and then spoke again. "I am a tree."* - Wed Nov  4 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Wed Nov  4 08:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't ... - Wed Nov  4 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) looked confused how he had gotten to that conclusion.* - Wed Nov  4 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I'm tryna be respectful, and not just like blunt.... - Wed Nov  4 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) stood just inside the door, incredibly silent watching the three at the bar counter.* - Wed Nov  4 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Really now? - Wed Nov  4 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's new. - Wed Nov  4 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Yeah.. - Wed Nov  4 08:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So you do have some type of restrait? - Wed Nov  4 08:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Or brain... - Wed Nov  4 08:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: No.. - Wed Nov  4 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Not really. - Wed Nov  4 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Since you want to know. - Wed Nov  4 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I was going to sa-- God... - Wed Nov  4 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh yeah. - Wed Nov  4 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Where is your puppy? - Wed Nov  4 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Sleep for the time being. - Wed Nov  4 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) flicked sunny yellow eyes between the two males simply listening and standing there.* - Wed Nov  4 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) stared him down and then slowly walked over to the last stool on the line and took a seat before staring out towards the menu.* - Wed Nov  4 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) had heard the mutter faintly, well... really only the 'bitch' part. She was used to this very phrase being muttered about her or even said out right to her face quite often due to her silence she forced upon her lifestyle. Regardless, she still stared at the menu, reading over the various foreign dishes.* - Wed Nov  4 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh he was talking about him. You can call males, bitches? - Wed Nov  4 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) reached up now to pull the old worn straw hat down to hand against the back of her shoulders and nape of neck. Her messy dark violet hair revealed atop the crown of her head and her geisha pale white face with the bright yellow eyes flicked over to peer at Yonbu. "I'm not all that hungry," was all she would state in a hushed voice.* - Wed Nov  4 08:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked two times and stared down at the counter. She -did- have a reason for looking at the menu but it wasn't a normal one. She couldn't speak of it so she needed to think of something fast to retort back at the inquiring man. She actually -did- look poor, she was wearing peasant's clothing, and the only thing that looked to be of value on her was the green sheathed katana at her hip. Granted as poor as she looked in attire, her hair and skin was well taken care of and looked very soft in radiance.

She parted her lips to give her excuse but then Ziare spoke up abruptly and she quieted her tongue to hope that Yonbu would be distracted by the angered bar man.* - Wed Nov  4 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) exhaled out a sigh, "No I do not have money.... but I am not hungry either."* - Wed Nov  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Ahem? - Wed Nov  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: What do you want? - Wed Nov  4 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) simply stared at Yonbu until the woman entered. Glancing back towards her over her cloaked shoulder in the worn dark clothing she simply watched the girl with a strange object on her back with bright sunflower yellow eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) looked up to the male who approached the gate as she stood waiting on the other side of the guards standing post at the gate. "Am I allowed to enter?" She was dressed in peasant clothing, torn and old black coat and worn leather boots, with an old straw hat that clearly was just for shade and not to hide her features. Her hair was a dark violet and was quite lengthy so clearly she was likely not a shinobi, the only gear she had upon her person was that of a green sheathed katana at her hip that looked newer than her clothing but still quite old. The most notable thing about this peasant girl was that her eyes were sunflower gold and quite vibrant, not to mention her skin was as white as a geisha's painted face.* - Wed Nov  4 10:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) rose her head again and reached up to brush the straw hat back even if it would expose her face, she didn't seem to care about hiding her visage even as strange as it looked, course some in the past had found her attractive beause of her oddities. "Are non-shinobi not allowed to enter the village freely? I have no other reason to travel here other than to visit and see Suna for myself, this is the first time I have ever been here. Course... I thought there would be more cactus flowers, I did want to see some special flowers."* - Wed Nov  4 11:10:43 2015

She lowered her head and worried about what was so excitable about her appearance. "Tan? I cannot tan." She spoke in a hushed voice and then replied to the second part, "okay." She wasn't sure why she needed to speak to the leader of the village, she was just a civillian after all.* - Wed Nov  4 11:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) glanced around the conference room before resting her golden yellow eyes on Hassan's visage. Her pale geisha white like complexion seeming odd for anyone even near this village, but clearly it wasn't paint due to it resting on her very hands that hung out at the sides of her cloak. She simply waited for him to speak to her.* - Wed Nov  4 11:24:22 2015

It also stated she was a civilian of Kirigakure.* - Wed Nov  4 11:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're a wanderer, then? - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Our...Kazekage is....well... I don't know. I haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm from Kirigakure.... it is not safe there. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So a peasant girl was required to meet him...but his own people haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kiri. . .Yeah. I saw one of my friends dead not too long ago. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah..? What happened...? Are you okay..? For that matter- would you like someone to keep you company while you're here? I know that wandering alone can be really unpleasant. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It would have been nice for him to know how I entered the village....he assumed a broke in and it made for a bad first impression. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Damn. She's really friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at Sanoke.* - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wow.... that's messed up. I can see why things might have gone poorly, then. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It happens. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I doubt it would change anything.... - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I suppose he said you could gather supplies and get a change of clothes- thus the two days- then leave, huh? - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. He -really- doesn't like strangers. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Coming to his village. And it makes sense. . .sometimes. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I suppose it is true to say that.. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah.... well... considering he expressed he is from Kiri... it was rather insulting to have me turned away so quickly. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
