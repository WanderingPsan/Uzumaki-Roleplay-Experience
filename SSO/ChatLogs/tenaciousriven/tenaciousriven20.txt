<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If I may ask. - Fri Dec 11 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What was the deal? What was Eiyu going to get for the people? - Fri Dec 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: .... I uh.. I sort of said I wouldn't kill anymore people if he let me have the prisoners he was going to execute anyway. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then he doesn't have to execute them or dispose of them. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: No. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It is what makes you. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah but I threatened your village. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And? - Fri Dec 11 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I am not as attached to this village as you may think. - Fri Dec 11 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I do not wear the headband even though I am a shinobi. - Fri Dec 11 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh.... - Fri Dec 11 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked him over, so it seemed he was telling the truth.* - Fri Dec 11 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: People threaten this village more than you do - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Besides. - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You are Yu-chan. - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I am going to get Eiyu to give you the part of the deal - Fri Dec 11 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "He agreed but I don't think he likes it."* - Fri Dec 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: He doesnt have to like it. - Fri Dec 11 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oooookay.~ - Fri Dec 11 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was drug along by her hand with a light bite to her lower lip at how Akito was acting. She enjoyed his company.* - Fri Dec 11 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was being held by the hand peering around aimlessly.* - Fri Dec 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Oooh! I love carrots, sure! - Fri Dec 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We'll go after I figure out what Haku needs. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's pretty close. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I believe that you owe Yu-ch- Yuriko something. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...? I'd rather she just tell me. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because I have no idea what you're talking about. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Unless you mean the prisoners. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That is exactly what I mean. - Fri Dec 11 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) just continued to look around and started to hum gently.* - Fri Dec 11 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O--hm? Thank you, Eiyu-sama.~ - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No problem. - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Who is that? - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose a brow noting how Dahyn grabbed at Eiyu's arm.* - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That went easier than I thought - Fri Dec 11 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded, "I told you that he already said I could have them." She was still holding his hand, for some reason it was like she wouldn't act other than walk or speak when he was holding her hand. She made no move to approach the prisoners, guards, or even let go of his hand.* - Fri Dec 11 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Hmm. - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Well. - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Go get em. - Fri Dec 11 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Bon Appetit. - Fri Dec 11 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked down at his hand and then up to him as if for 'permission' if he released her hand or looked okay with her letting go she would release his hand finally and walk forward for a guard to let her through the prison gate and into the first cell of the man who was to be executed. No matter how filfthy, weak, strong, or what else he was she would consume him. Normally she would eat in a manner of swallowing a person whole which was terrible enough as it is... but instead she ate in a manner that was extremely messy..tearing him apart and making the death slow and painful as screams echoed through the halls.* - Fri Dec 11 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took a very long time of going through person after person in the cells until everyone up for execution was dead and non existant entirely. When she walked back out she looked the same in terms of stomach size, as if she hadn't eaten at all. Her entire body, face, hair, clothing, limbs...everything... was soaked in blood as she licked over her lips and left trails of blood dripping from her form as she walked out to stand in front of Akito.* - Fri Dec 11 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's lips widened and she smiled a giant cheshire grin, her white teeth coated in blood and nothing about how she looked was especially cute unless... Akito was into that kind of thing (Eiyu is--cough). She giggled out and leaned forward as he was cleaning her face of the blood as she purposely hadn't absorbed it into her body so that it could grace her skin in her crazed mentality. "Mhmmmmm.~ Soooo many MANY..." she found herself moaning out in a feminine way as her eyes shut and she bit down on her lip. "-Screams-," moaning out the word as her eyes reopened to peer up to Akito. * - Fri Dec 11 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) licked over her lips again as he tried to clean her off which was pretty much hopless all things considered with how soaked in blood she was at the moment. "Mnnng... I'm satisified... I don't -hunger-... I just -want-." She ran her hands over her torso and shuddered out. "I need to calm down... mgnng... I don't want to lose control.~" She shuddered again while trying to hold still in front of him as he tried to clean the blood off of her soft skin but it was proving hopeless.* - Fri Dec 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard the mention of a bath and she hummed out before nodding, "okay." It might have seemed normal that she agreed to a bath since she was dirty, or perhaps it was due to something else...and she had agreed a bit fast.* - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had a bloody hand, she looked towards his own and thought about it but he had -said- for her to come along and he was holding out his hand. She extended her blood coated hand towards his own to take to be led away, she made no comment about taking any extra food for the road.* - Fri Dec 11 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stopped at the door as he released her hand. She was worried a small amount about getting blood on his floor but then he called her forward and she scampered quickly with blood dripping all about the place over to his side and up the steps into the room behind him. Her eyes peering about curiously at what might be in this room.* - Fri Dec 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked through the room and into the bathroom. As he showed her which one was which she giggled, "I don't feel temperature..." she reached out and turned on the cold and then looked over at him with her coy gaze. She looked back at the shower then and cocked her head to the side, "where is the tub?" She was used to baths rather than showers.* - Fri Dec 11 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at the towel, "I don't need that either. Heh." She started to pull off her clothing as if it didn't matter if he was there. If he didn't want to catch a glimpse of her nude body he better leave soon.* - Fri Dec 11 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pursed her lips at him commenting about feeling more human, unless he closed the door behind him she would leave it open before stepping into the shower fully nude and rinsed off and using soap to clean all the blood off of herself. She didn't stay an extended time like humans usually did, instead she did only what was necessary, turned off the water, stepped out, absorbed the excess water and was completely dry. She looked at her blood soaked clothing on the ground. "What am I suppose to wear? It's not appropriate to go outside naked."* - Fri Dec 11 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: Hmm. - Fri Dec 11 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: I do not have much clothing here.. - Fri Dec 11 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: Never in a million years would I think that I would be giving a female my cloathing to wear. - Fri Dec 11 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked out of the bedroom and towards the bed in the buck naked. She looked at the boxers and the looked like shorts to her, she pulled them on and then his oversized shirt. She stood there with the sleeves much too long and it looked like a dress on her as she stood there. She shook her head and pulled the boxers back off and looked around for a belt and then wrapped it around her waist and rolled up the sleeves of the shirt and stepped behind him barefoot. She was completely silent and then spoke up, "the other stuff was too big and the shirt is like a dress.. is this okay?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They won't get clean...that was a lot of blood. - Fri Dec 11 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You can throw them away, I have plenty at home. - Fri Dec 11 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I see.... - Fri Dec 11 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Y..You..can take my coat...if you want.. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You might get w-wet.. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I mean... - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Cold. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You..might get cold.. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm going to get wet? And... remember silly I can't get cold.~ - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked down at how her breasts without a bra were pressed against the white shirt, it was obviously easy to see the perfect shape and perkiness that most women didn't have when braless...not to mention her nipples.* - Fri Dec 11 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do I need the coat? - Fri Dec 11 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ..... - Fri Dec 11 05:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not really. - Fri Dec 11 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Y-Y..You probably.. - Fri Dec 11 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: should.. - Fri Dec 11 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why? - Fri Dec 11 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head to the side curiously.* - Fri Dec 11 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Y-Y-Your....breasts...I-I..can..s-see them.. - Fri Dec 11 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ......oh. - Fri Dec 11 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at her chest and snickered.* - Fri Dec 11 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I forgot how humans react to those things. - Fri Dec 11 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: H-H..How..can..I..not.. - Fri Dec 11 05:05:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I-I.. - Fri Dec 11 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you not like seeing them? - Fri Dec 11 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm confused. - Fri Dec 11 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Humans cover things they want to see. - Fri Dec 11 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I-I..do - Fri Dec 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's a confusing concept to me... but I suppose I will wear the coat. - Fri Dec 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: T-They...seem..nice.. - Fri Dec 11 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Y-Yeah..the coat...i-its..right...over...there. - Fri Dec 11 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked over to the bed and picked up the coat and pulled it on, she had to roll the sleeves up of course but she was covered now for the most part. "Better?"* - Fri Dec 11 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I do? - Fri Dec 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... I didn't know some people like such simple clothing on me. - Fri Dec 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Usually they always put me in very fancy and complicated clothing. - Fri Dec 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Like panties and bras, the bane of my existance. - Fri Dec 11 05:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What..would you like to do now? - Fri Dec 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged some, "I like people watching but you don't like people...so..." * - Fri Dec 11 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: We can do that.. - Fri Dec 11 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I did ask what you wanted to do. - Fri Dec 11 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If that is what you wanted to do then so be it. - Fri Dec 11 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) inhaled sharply as she saw the blood and her eyes widened with a predatorial instinct. She pressed up against him and reached for his wrist trying to bring his hand to her face and his finger...to her lips to suck at the blood. Staring up at him all the while... Course, because he had ended up on the ground this meant she was probably crouching beside him. "Did I?~" mumbling around his finger if he had allowed her to put it in her mouth.* - Fri Dec 11 11:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't harm Eiyu at all, there was no burning... it simply felt like an extremely soft suction and the lapping of her tongue over his finger. Though when he had shoulded at her she opened her mouth and fell backwards carelessly with a flash of her skirt rising for a moment before easing down against her legs. * - Fri Dec 11 12:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose a brow towards him and shrugged, "I don't care if it does happen or not, you are human it's expected... and I fell over, my own fault." She then leaned in to whisper in his ear, "you taste -really- good Eiyu-sama.~" With that she stood up and hummed while skipping down the hill path. "I'll see you later, Tease-kun.~"* - Fri Dec 11 12:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked through the flooded streets barefoot, soon enough catching up to Nigen and she seemed uneffected by the rubble and such as she approached and came to stand at Nigen's side. Staring out at the two, tailed figures and widening her eyes before a sickly grin formed on her lips. She licked over her lips and then moaned out gently as she whispered under her breath. "Such chaoooooos.~" 

Wiggling back and forth in a sway but then she noticed just how many trees had been destroyed and a slight anger filled her mind as she reached out to the trees to hear their cries of pain. "Hmph..." her lips downturning in upset for only a moment before she felt a cheshire like grin tugging at her lips as she watched. An eerie tune began to hum from her lips as she watched and swayed back and forth beside Nigen.* - Sat Dec 12 07:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was not at all trying to avoid attacks at the moment, she knew Kana was coming towards her as soon as she was flying through the air from the whispers of her tree's and plants in the area but only smiled wide. As the water shot out she looked up at Kana and then made kissy lips towards the woman in beast form before being slammed hard against the fence behind her. The water slamming into Yuriko's body and then tearing parts of her apart as the water ran pink and then red as the fence splintered and Yuriko's body was torn up in places and spread out along the alley and damaged water soaked destruction behind her. (not literally dead but i look really fucking dead ICly j/s)* - Sat Dec 12 08:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's body began to 'melt' into the ground as she reformed beneath and then morphed the earth around her and swam away from the area. There was fake blood and body parts around the area and although when she reformed beneath the ground she was quite.. -rough- looking she still able to mold chakra and move. Of course no one could see any of this and what remained of her body was enough to look real and like she was torn to shreds in the wreckage.* - Sat Dec 12 09:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) had a very simple reading book out, it looked like it was for people who were trying to learn how to read with the pictures and all that good stuff. She had a cup of hot tea steaming infront of her and was simply turning a page every so often as she peered down at the pages intently, her ears burned when she heard the chef and saw Nigen out of the corner of her eyes but said and did nothing. Pretending as if she was very focused on her book as her lengthy green hair was tucked behind her right ear with the left side hanging down against the edge of the counter. One forearm rested on the counter and the other in her lap with a type of grace that befit someone who was a civilian and not at all prepared for if she might be attacked, clearly she wasn't the type of persona to be on guard.* - Sun Dec 13 03:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) peered up from her book and instead of looming her eyes over his body like she would do in the past or looking for signs of a shinobi she would look at him with genuinely sweet eyes and slowly purse her lips in question before speaking. "Order someth--" muttered out and then realized he meant food. She looked down to her book and then the tea. "I guess I should, huh?" she reached up and scratched her head just behind the temple. A soft smile tugged at her lips and she squinted up towards the menu and then reached out for one of the small ones on the table and opened it up to peek inside. She pointed to one of the random appatizers since she couldn't read any of the menu and then tucked it back into it's little holder. * - Sun Dec 13 03:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) 's expression looked some what embarrassed and hesitant as she closed her book and held it up to show him the title. 'The steps of learning how to read', she sat it back down and then tucked it into her bag. "I can't read very well, dish names are more difficult than most."* - Sun Dec 13 03:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) shrugged a bit, "I only am learning because my bookie is getting upset with me not knowing how to read his notes beside the records." She weakly smiled and drank her tea slowly with a fold in her brow. She hadn't said what her accounts were for, but it was clear she was in charge of something business wise... it sort of matched with her way of dressing.* - Sun Dec 13 03:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Bookie? - Sun Dec 13 03:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) says: So I bought one of the destroyed buildings that were still pretty much intact and did some fixes. - Sun Dec 13 03:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) || The ramen chef brought her a plate of onigiri with eel tucked inside and she picked up the strange triangle. Looking at it curiously she wrinkled her nose, clealy not being what she wanted to order but accepting it in silence. A soft smile was offered to the ramen chef and she laid out some yen before taking a meager bite of the food and chewing slowly as her sunflower yellow eyes remained on the snack.* - Sun Dec 13 03:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Heh, you know if you were unsure of what to order you could've asked for a suggestion. - Sun Dec 13 03:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) grumbled and lowered her head and the half eaten onigiri to the plate. "Not to mention humiliating."* - Sun Dec 13 03:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) huffed and propped an elbow against the counter as her hand ran through the hair of her lowered head. "hmph."* - Sun Dec 13 03:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) turned her head to rest her temple against her palm and stared over to him with her genuine and soft gaze.* - Sun Dec 13 03:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Heh. - Sun Dec 13 03:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just keep working hard, I'm sure you'll get it. - Sun Dec 13 03:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes slowly and exhaled out a small sight. When her eyes reopened she finally looked his form over and spotted his jounin suit and general appearance. "You're pretty kind for...what looks to be a shinobi?" She wasn't sure and was testing the water to see if she was right. Reaching out for her tea she took another tiny sip and then sat it back down as she composed her posture to be sitting upright again with both her hands folded in her lap and shouldered pulled back.* - Sun Dec 13 03:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes in a bit at what he said and turned her gaze back to her food and reached out for the half eaten onigiri to try and force something into her mouth so she didn't have to respond. She wanted to kind of cut the conversation off there and nodded simply to him two short nods before minding her own business, clearly trying to push him away from conversation. Her eyes were dilated and she looked a little on edge now at the prospect he was a bandit. Although she was pretending this, it wasn't difficult for her to pretend to fear, instead she focused on things that -really- did scare her and it was easy enough to appear genuinely afraid of him.* - Sun Dec 13 04:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) shifted her gaze towards him for only a moment in a coy manner before focusing back on her food. She only finished one of the three onigiri and then picked up her bag and tried to shift off the stool with a small tug at her shirt to assure her belly wouldn't show. She headed for the cloth flaps of the exit to try and leave looking rather nervous by what he was saying.* - Sun Dec 13 04:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) froze when another shinobi ran in and she was trembling in fear as she stood there clutching her bag in white knuckle fingers. "U-uhm... I'm finished...with my meal... b-back to work you know? High...ho?" She closed her eyes at her stupidity and stood where she was facing away from him with her shoulders pulled up near her neck.* - Sun Dec 13 04:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) kept running of course, it seemed she had taken her chance to flee and run back to her flower shop.* - Sun Dec 13 04:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) stepped into her flower shop and went to work watering the plants, dead heading some roses, and pruning other types of plants that needed upkeep. She then took a set of garden scissors and snipped off a variety of colored tulips and took them over to her table. Setting out some ribbon she went to work preparing a boquette. Snipping away at the tulips as she organized them and got the all the right length to have some a bit higher than others in the boquette before wrapping the purple ribbon around the flower's stems and super glueing it in a fold under. Soon after she tied a bow around the ribbon and then stepped back to look at the boquette. Setting it off to the side to be delivered in the next few hours.

Walking back out into the shop's garden area she snipped a few pieces of greenery and a dozen roses. Humming gently to herself as she walked back to the counter she laid them all out and cleaned the roses up by stripping dead leaves and removing thorns. She pricked her finger a few times but that didn't bother her at all as she continued on working and eventually had them all cut and lined up. Wrapping the roses and greenery in a type of dark red and white paper she wrapped them up to go and sat them next to the order form for the dozen roses.

She decided it would be best to take these two orders out now so that they woudl be fresh and a little learn on delivery. Taking up the two bouquettes she headed down the streets of Konoha and eventually came to the first house. Knocking on the door a man answered, paid her, and then took the bundle of tulips. The second house she made her way to didn't have an answer, they hadn't paid but Kanari couldn't bring herself not to leave the flowers for someone to enjoy. Leaving the bouqette of roses on the porch for whoever was to return home.* - Sun Dec 13 10:41:39 2015
