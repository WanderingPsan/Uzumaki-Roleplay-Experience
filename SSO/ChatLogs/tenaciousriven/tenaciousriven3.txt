<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) remained silent for a very long time.* - Thu Nov  5 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why do you care for me? - Thu Nov  5 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought he had decided not to answer the question and so she moved on in thought until he suddenly answered. "What kind of care do you have for me then?" She -knew- there were many types of care to hold for a person.* - Thu Nov  5 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: A mentor... - Thu Nov  5 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And a student. - Thu Nov  5 08:32:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him now, he clearly was skirting around the bush.* - Thu Nov  5 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I mean.. you hold a special.. place. - Thu Nov  5 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Special how? - Thu Nov  5 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Special as in.. the feelngs I fought, and still fight, to get rid of.. is there for you. - Thu Nov  5 08:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because they will get you hurt.. - Thu Nov  5 08:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) then rose a brow, "You think I -have- emotions?"* - Thu Nov  5 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not that I think you have them, it's me preventing them from being hurt just in case you do.. - Thu Nov  5 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down at his nearest hand and then rest it atop his own. "Even if you hurt me, I could forget those feelings... I would rewrite them, or pretend... just as I pretended to bleed."* - Thu Nov  5 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why do you think you will hurt me? - Thu Nov  5 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It always happens.. - Thu Nov  5 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I never catch a break with that. - Thu Nov  5 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Do you have much ... experience with that? - Thu Nov  5 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No.. Not really.. - Thu Nov  5 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Then why say it always happens? - Thu Nov  5 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Cause the little experience I do have, it has happened. - Thu Nov  5 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Maybe things will change? - Thu Nov  5 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You think so..? - Thu Nov  5 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Despite all the.. chaos.. I cause? - Thu Nov  5 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Yes.... but then again, maybe chaos will work for us? - Thu Nov  5 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I already have committed suicide for you once, do you think I'm not willing to go through the others? - Thu Nov  5 09:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared over towards Ortho quite seriously as he spoke his grave serious speech. His glare of intensity didn't bother a person like her at all, she didn't even look like she was showing emotion even as she had given her hushed words in reply to him. She knew several people had just entered the cafe, but hadn't had the chance to see exactly who.* - Thu Nov  5 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Damn it Marrisa is gone and didnt even even notice me - Thu Nov  5 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I see you two are still here... Well I got some one to been enjoy your stay! - Thu Nov  5 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well I see you two are still here well enjoy your stay - Thu Nov  5 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov  5 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him very closely as it seemed that all the emotion he hid away was being revealed. She found it so odd that he wanted his sister only to feel hate yet he was filled with love. It was awe inspiring to her and made her want to feel such emotions even if it was nearly impossible for her to reach such feelings. Golden yellow eyes flicked over his expression and then she smiled, "I think you forget what I am... or perhaps you just don't understand, have you not seen enough? My physical body can't be hurt, and my emotions are slim to none." She leaned in closer to whisper towards the companion. "Shouldn't you be more concerned that you will be hurt by my lack of emotions for you rather than breaking me?"* - Thu Nov  5 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wasn't nervous, she had no heart to beat, or mind to over induce her body with hormones, in fact she had none and so she simply felt him touching her cheek. A cheek so soft it was likely the most tender thing he had ever touched in his life, not even baby skin could rival her own. As he leaned in she knew what he was about to do but still yet she only watched and waited, clearly going to allow him to follow through with his desire to kiss her. When he had stopped himself and expressed such strong emotions for her she smiled wryly, "isn't it silly, you wish to throw your life before mine when I cannot die. When I am not even human, nor was I born... and yet you are so devout to me, Ortho. There is no need to concern yourself with any pain I might run into, because as you stated earlier today." Pausing for a moment as she swallowed, "I am able to decide my own fate, and that fate is going to be beside you. You won't send me away like it sounds like you trying to do."* - Thu Nov  5 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't know how to react to a kiss, nor did she know how it was suppose to feel. It didn't make her feel emotion but she knew it did wonders for Ortho so she endulged and kissed him back. Letting him lead the kiss since she had never done so before in her very short lifespan. Her eyes stayed open as his were until she saw him close his own so she closed hers. Gripping his hand gently she allowed him to kiss her for as long as he needed.* - Thu Nov  5 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) opened her eyes and licked over her lips briefly, she had a very...fucked up thought for a moment she would probably  not share with Ortho in any time in the near future. Staring into his eyes and listening to him she could tell that emotion was still dripping around the expression of his eyes and face. She on the other hand shown nothing as such, it wasn't that she didn't have some part of her that could feel a tiny amount, if not she wouldn't even have put up with the kissing. It was just that she didn't show the emotions outwardly, she had no reason too unless she was going to pretend, but that was as good as lying to Ortho. "Does that mean you have reconsidered?"* - Thu Nov  5 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled now and nodded before whispering to him, "I think you should sleep now, I will watch over you."* - Thu Nov  5 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: im so sorry >.< - Thu Nov  5 11:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked over towards Ortho immediately, she had important news and wasn't wasting time to walk across the field of training people (?) to get over to him. She was hesitant since many of the people here she didn't know and Marrisa was right there. Ume had pretended she didn't know Ortho... but clearly Ortho didn't care at this point, so she made a point not to care either.* - Thu Nov  5 20:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) then suddenly remembered something.* - Thu Nov  5 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I'm sorry I pretended not to know him, it wasn't safe to know him in Suna. - Thu Nov  5 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: No. . Ortho and I know how to manipulate the earth. . To move it with our chakra.  - Thu Nov  5 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That isn't the same as telling it what to do? - Thu Nov  5 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: I understand. You had your reasnons. . I forgive you - Thu Nov  5 22:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) tucked the scroll away and nodded, "Why do you teach me? I'm not a shinobi and you still teach me. You must know I'm not a shinobi, I didn't know how to do your paper test."* - Thu Nov  5 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll only return there once I'm able to lead it myself. - Thu Nov  5 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You ... wish to challenge Ortho? - Thu Nov  5 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nope. - Thu Nov  5 22:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm going to go look around. - Thu Nov  5 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was just walking towards the large building when Aden was so RUDE and asked her a one worded question. She stopped in her tracks and craned her head to the left in confusion without a word.* - Thu Nov  5 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Index. - Thu Nov  5 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't understand why Aden had acted that way but soon after she peered up towards Index beside her and heard his question. "I'm looking around, what was that all about... with Marrisa and Ortho? You two didn't look so friendly anymore." She of course was whispering all this.* - Thu Nov  5 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Where's..Zeus..? - Thu Nov  5 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Thu Nov  5 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was about to nod to Index and then Nigen had approached and questioned about the same person mentioned earlier by Aden. She peered back at him for a moment but since she didn't know who Zeus was, she peered back to Index and nodded.* - Thu Nov  5 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: He isnt in right now. - Thu Nov  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Of course he isn't.. - Thu Nov  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He's a lazy bum... - Thu Nov  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Lazy bum. - Thu Nov  5 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Thu Nov  5 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What's the status on this dump? - Thu Nov  5 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I haven't been here in a while, so....things are a little iffy.. - Thu Nov  5 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked into the house, not sure why they had to do this so privately but she stood in the center of the room peering around curiously.* - Thu Nov  5 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not a fan of crowds in all honesty. - Thu Nov  5 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But you were asking about me, Ortho and Marissa right? - Thu Nov  5 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Looked....bad. - Thu Nov  5 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I suppose it did. - Thu Nov  5 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But Ortho most likely still has feelings for her. - Thu Nov  5 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: He wasn't trying to be the peacekeeper. - Thu Nov  5 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But protect her. - Thu Nov  5 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head some in thought of that statement.* - Thu Nov  5 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Something wrong, Ume? - Thu Nov  5 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think he does, I think he just respects that she is willing to give up everything for him. - Thu Nov  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He shows emotion for me. - Thu Nov  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Emotions for you? - Thu Nov  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded, "you act like you don't know, you forced it."* - Thu Nov  5 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---Oh, He actually...So...What did you guys end up doing when I left? - Thu Nov  5 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "sat in the water and talked."* - Thu Nov  5 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Really? And he confessed to you? - Thu Nov  5 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Or was it just... - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: His body language? - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He tried to send me away. - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What do you mean? - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To protect me because of his feelings. - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see... - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And how did you feel about that? - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I told him it wasn't happening. - Thu Nov  5 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you care for him? - Thu Nov  5 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't have emotion, but I like that he cares. - Thu Nov  5 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov  5 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Ume, I was curious, Would you like to play a game? - Thu Nov  5 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What kind of game? - Thu Nov  5 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: A dice game, I want to confirm something. - Thu Nov  5 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's basically...A game of chicken. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I've never played a game before. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll teach you then. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Take a seat in front of me? - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) went and sat down in front of Index with her legs folded under her rump since she was wearing this horribly heavy dress.* - Thu Nov  5 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked some, "you have seals, seals are bad!" Her voice had raised more than normal and she was actually concerned for a moment. She calmed herself as he went right into the rules, it was very confusing with all those rules.

Suddenly the alarms went off and she peered up at the ceiling.* - Thu Nov  5 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Ortho is in the Village, we can ignore it for now, would you like to continue? - Thu Nov  5 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sure he'll take care of whatever is going on. - Thu Nov  5 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded as she watched him put up the protective barrier and waited for him to stop the game.* - Thu Nov  5 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do me a favor? - Thu Nov  5 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Could you name six body parts? - Thu Nov  5 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: With the exception of eyes. - Thu Nov  5 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: uh.... - Thu Nov  5 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: head, hand, foot, legs, arms? - Thu Nov  5 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: One more. - Thu Nov  5 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh six. - Thu Nov  5 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Stomach? - Thu Nov  5 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That works. - Thu Nov  5 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I don't unrstand this game. - Thu Nov  5 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll say, Touch, poke, Pinch, Kiss, Lick,  rub. So in the order we've listed these, will be the corresponding number with the dice count. - Thu Nov  5 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll let you go first, and explain the roll. - Thu Nov  5 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes now at what he said.* - Thu Nov  5 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you get why this game is called 'Chicken' now? - Thu Nov  5 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think..... Ortho would like me kissing someone else. I have seen how people get over kissing more than one person. - Thu Nov  5 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then, You can pick a different action to replace that. - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But then again. - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's the point of the game. - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Unfavorable options. - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Which would force someone to take a penalty. - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So let's continue shall we? - Thu Nov  5 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about this, she wasn't upset or anything. Its just the knowing that Ortho might be mad, none of this meant anything to her. It was a game, she didn't even feel sexual tension possible between the situation.* - Thu Nov  5 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Okay. - Thu Nov  5 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Go ahead and roll. - Thu Nov  5 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Index was around when I was naked... maybe Ortho doesn't care about him. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The roll was pinch my stomach. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you don't want to do that, you can take a penalty. - Thu Nov  5 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinks, "what are the penalties anyway?" She reached out and pinched his stomach gently.* - Thu Nov  5 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov  5 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right, you said that. - Thu Nov  5 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... what now? - Thu Nov  5 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Rub your stomach? - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) just watched him.* - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This is strange. - Thu Nov  5 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Um....okay. - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I was honestly hoping for more chances to ask her questions, I feel like she'd be more likely to answer under the rules of a game.. - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kiss my head..? - Thu Nov  5 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) twitched her lips to the side but kissing someone that wasn't on their lips was okay right? She leaned forward and kissed him on the forehead as long as he hadn't tried something.* - Thu Nov  5 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) would note that her skin is -extremely- soft. Creepily soft, softer than any person in the world potentially.* - Thu Nov  5 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't care about what he did to her, she had this sense that what was bad is when she did something. She allowed him to take her foot if he reached for it. Of course she still had her shoes on he had given her, lucky for him though if he did go as far as to take off her shoe she was an extremely clean person? It would be like there wasn't a single smell -at all-.* - Thu Nov  5 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Uh... - Fri Nov  6 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You get to dare me to do something. - Fri Nov  6 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You are scared of licking a foot? - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I told Marrisa that I pretended not to know you to protect myself, she said she understood. - Fri Nov  6 01:37:16 2015
