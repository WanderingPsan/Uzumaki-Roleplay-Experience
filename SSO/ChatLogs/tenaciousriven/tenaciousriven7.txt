<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Too bad you're more focused on hating me than working together. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Working together? That's actually a nice idea. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ever since he and I fought in Kirigakure. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe you shouldn't have fought then, smart ass. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That little 'games' he play is just a hit list. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe I shouldn't have fought? He attacked me. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Or were you too blinded by Ortho Hate - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: To see that? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And then when we calmed you both down, what happened? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You shot a fireball at him. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Instead of calming the hell down. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But when Ortho gets tired of something and throws a fit. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're too conflicted for us to work together. - Mon Nov  9 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well when I suggest something and you try to deny it like that. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Then yeah. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just like when I say something and you're quick to jump down my throat? We have a love-hate relationship as siblings. Organizing a way for us to "work together" will have us argue. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Instead of thnking about "working together", we just do it. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No questions asked, just actions. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, but that'd be better with practice and talking. - Mon Nov  9 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What we do while working together is fine, that can be discussed. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But to sit down and talk about feelings, hate, love, all that mess.. no. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No thank you. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A little after we met. When you heard all my plans for Kirigakure. That's when it started. Then the second time is when you came back from Sunagakure and I told you stuff more in depth.. Back when we went deeper in the forest from my settlement. - Mon Nov  9 15:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: The first time we met, and you believed that I could hear plants. - Mon Nov  9 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Or at least pretended to. - Mon Nov  9 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I started to trust you. - Mon Nov  9 15:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) smiled wider and wider with each description. "And other things you have done with me? Not that... I'm going to stop you from kissing me forever."* - Mon Nov  9 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh?  Nothing else? - Mon Nov  9 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anything else can't be put into words. - Mon Nov  9 16:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) walked onto the traing field and simply stood far away from all the others peering over. She had no weapons on her, only a simple cotton chinese style dress that was pretty n' pink and a funky faux mohawk to contrast it with a Kirigakure headband working like a hair accessory to hold strands out of her face. She glanced at Ortho, then Marrisa, and finally Ziare. Wondering if this was simply a spar or a real fight being enacted.* - Tue Nov 10 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not holding back. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think this is quite done. It's been a while since I've went a round with you, Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I must've fallen behind in my training, but I'm sure I can entertain you well. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you say? - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Love? Are they close or together? - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hm... - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) glanced towards Daiki and nodded toward him. "Hm?"* - Tue Nov 10 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) watched on with great amounts of focus towards Marrisa and Ortho. "Owari," was spoken in a soft voice.* - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm, thats cool... I wonder what she is doing? And are there traces of chakra in her eyes? And why am I asking so many questions ? I really dont care.... - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Hmm.. So he knows fire style? - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: I'm guessing I better speak to him soonish.. - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) looked the boy up and down and then focused back on the fight again. When she had looked at him, he would see her Kirigakure headband in her hair. She then only replied with a simple, "no."* - Tue Nov 10 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Did I just get blown off because of where I'm from? - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm waiting for a friend at the moment. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Owari. Would you like a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) looked over at the rude Inuzuka. "No...thank you," She had a risen brow and was curious why he thought she would want to spar him after he just blew her off from being from Kirigakure. How idiotic.* - Tue Nov 10 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck.. - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Can't make the kid get hurt... - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Why the fuck he decide to stand behind me..? - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Excuse me. Miss with the read hair. Fancy a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I think he's talking to you Rias. - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm me? Ugh, I dont think thats a good idea... - Tue Nov 10 07:42:30 2015
