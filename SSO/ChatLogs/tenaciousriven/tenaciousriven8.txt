<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) had her eyes shut, cross legged so her dress was hiked up a good amount, her chin was risen with her hair falling back briskly along the nape of her neck. The headband was laying on the grass in front of her and she was speaking to the tree's through her mind.* - Tue Nov 10 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) could hear Othro and on top of that the tree's were whispering about another walking among them who they didn't all that much like due to him dropping clothing and gear all over the place. She peeked open one eye to peer over at him before shutting it again and sighing out a breath. "I thought you would go to the cafe." Obviously to get sake.* - Tue Nov 10 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) remained as she was with chin up, "did you want me to join you?" She of course was entirely unreadable by his doujutsu, even when she was asking the hard questions back at the training field. It sucked for him that she had no chakra fluctuations to see since she held no emotion.* - Tue Nov 10 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) stood after lowering her head and then unbuttoned her dress as she started to pull her dress off. She left on the white panties and bra since they were technically in public and Index and Ortho had taught her nudity in public was bad. She slipped off her shoes and the jewelry upon her hands before wading down into the small pond.* - Tue Nov 10 09:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, I'm not. - Tue Nov 10 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I assumed because of your sigh when I left the training area, and the urge to get alcohol. - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Annoyed, yes. Mad, no. Surprisingly enough, I'm fine now. - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Annoyed, why? - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because I told Nina to watch out for Index back then. She didn't listen. You're the only one that actually listened. - Tue Nov 10 09:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's one thing I have to coach Nina through.. - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Apparently she though that's what 'friends do'. - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I asked her where she got that from and said Index told her that there was nothing wrong with what they were doing cause they're just friends. - Tue Nov 10 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) remained silent for a long time and then spoke in a hushed tone, "Because that's what he tells you."* - Tue Nov 10 09:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... are you going to kill him? - Tue Nov 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not going to hunt him down. That's your friend, I'll leave him be. - Tue Nov 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: He was using it.... because he wanted to get to know me as a friend. He didn't think I would actually want to talk to him like a friend does. In fact he stopped the game because something was going to happen that I didn't know was pre-fertilization and he wouldn't let it happen. - Tue Nov 10 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So instead of talking like I did, he played a game..? - Tue Nov 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Makes so much sense. - Tue Nov 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like I said. I'm not hunting your friend down. - Tue Nov 10 09:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) lowered her gaze from him and turned over to look up into the sky at the clouds. "Yes but how you are acting suggests you think something did happen but I suppose you don't want to get into details, even though I told you what his intent was."* - Tue Nov 10 09:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: He stopped the game when it got to me rubbing his behind, he said that we shouldn't do it. Then I got the hint that there was something involved that was meant only for me and you and then he explained everything and why he had wanted to play the game.  - Tue Nov 10 09:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) paused when she saw Marrisa, remaining quiet and watching the woman walking up the opposite alley, trying to see if she was going towards the training field and might not notice Owari. The less she was around Marrisa the better as to avoid any... similiarities she might find, granted there were very little to find.* - Tue Nov 10 12:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) shot back quite fast and nimble for someone who looked so feminine. "Oh my," a smile tugging at her lips. She folded her hands into the seals and then closed her eyes and began to feel out the ground around her with her connection to the earth. For a long while nothing was happening but the Earth rumbling beneath the top soil before Owari.* - Tue Nov 10 13:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded in silence as she focused her energy more seriously. The ground trembled more and then a single crooked spike shot out of the ground and Owari peeked her eyes open to look it over. "Erg, crooked," her eyes shut again and the spike collapsed rather than staying solid, clearly her control over earth wasn't totally terrible if she was capable of demolishing it so easily. * - Tue Nov 10 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) folded her hands through the seals again to get more comfortable with them, the ground groaned and she smirked, "Oh come on, fiesty," snickering at the tension in the ground and rocks as she thrust another spike up out of the ground. Peeking once more she saw that this one was much straighter but small, allowing it to stay there she continued on with another attempt.* - Tue Nov 10 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) had already begun the next attempt, she wanted to try and make the one spike the right size. Focusing everything she had into it, earthen chakra flowed in front of her and soon enough a large spike shot out of the ground diagonally. "One down."* - Tue Nov 10 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) leaned her neck to the left and then right like she was trying to pop it but no sound occured. Perhaps her neck was simply too taught for it to crack and she went back to work in repetition of the attempts to build up from one spike to two while maintaining their straightness and size.* - Tue Nov 10 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) yawned some and after she had managed to get two spikes going she began to work on the third. This is where she started to run into trouble, "bollocks." Grumbling as she couldn't manage to get a third spike out of the ground, several times over she only managed two and had to end up moving to a different area to have clean ground to work with.* - Tue Nov 10 14:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) || Somewhere around the fifteenth try, she managed to create a third spike. "Fuckin' finally," gasping out as she wiped her brow as if to remove sweat. Ruffling her hair and then folding her hands into seals, "Just one more...I got this." This whole talking yourself up crap she had seen other's do plenty of times, she didn't understand why they did it but apparently it was a 'thing'. She began to focus and tried several more times to spring up four without result.* - Tue Nov 10 14:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Because you never have in front of me, or smelled like it. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: What swords? - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She asked me to use my connections to get her a unique sword, but refuses to wait. - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Until the swords arrive. - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) shrugged and then her eyes widened and she just sort of looked at Nina like 'what did I even do'. Backing away slowly, "H-hey, you'll mess up the hair!"* - Tue Nov 10 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Get her Nina! - Tue Nov 10 19:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) was pretty much fucked, Nina was way faster than her and so Owari was tackled to the ground and held down. She groaned as her head was drilled into by the knuckles. She began to groan and grimace as she tried to get away from the knuckles but to no avail... Nina seemed way more capable than Owari.* - Tue Nov 10 20:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) hadn't known someone was behind her since she was focused on Ortho and Nina. When the man had whispered to her she literally sprung up and had twisted over onto all fours with her fingers spread out and palms arched holding her up with her knee's only slightly bent and only the toes of her slippers against the pathway with her back straight and her head jerking up to look at him. It was clearly a defensive move from being startled, she did not recognize him but his words had registered and she began to analyze. 

Shortly after she rose up and nodded to the man, "I'll be back later Ortho, Nina, have your fun time. Nina, don't let him have that back, it's terrible for him." Pay back maybe for making her get her hair fucked up? I think so. She waited for the man to lead her away from the area.* - Tue Nov 10 20:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) frowned, "I already was aware I probably was going to be locked away for a while.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It's very much possible, I wouldn't invite him to my base anyway, And I'm willing to get passed our differences for -your- sake. - Tue Nov 10 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Explain how it would be possible. - Tue Nov 10 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'd take samples from you occasionally, and take them to my Scientists. They'd work on it, but they'd never know, who it was from,  In which case the only time I'd need to bring you to my base would be about a week or two before the procedure is completed. - Tue Nov 10 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: It is kind of you to say that but there is also the fact I do not trust your scientists -at all-. - Tue Nov 10 20:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Just... do what needs to be done. Don't change what you do because of me, after all I won't feel any pain from it until I can feel  emotion if your scientists succeed. - Tue Nov 10 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) stood up from the table with the chair screaming against the hardwood floor.* - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Should I. - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Wait? - Tue Nov 10 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: You can come with me if you want, but I still want some privacy when I talk to him. Either you can wait here or follow. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'll wait here. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Take the time you need. - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) approached Ortho with a blank expression, "We need to speak, now."* - Tue Nov 10 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) turned to face Ortho in Hideki's old home. "There are several things I need to speak to you about before I leave."* - Tue Nov 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded, "first I'll tell you about the conversation I had with Marrisa." She sat down on a chair at the dining room table facing away from the tale and out into the room so he could sit in front of her if he wanted or just stand in front of her even. "I wanted to know a few things about you two so I pretended to just be a consoling friend. During your fight together she wanted to impress you, she felt shamed because she thought that her not landing a hit meant that you weren't impressed but I know you were. I told her you were, that it was obvious. Then she said she still loved you, I asked her why you two broke up and she told me, she said you still love her too, I don't know if that is true but even if it is, then it's okay. I asked her what she would do to get you back and she said she already is trying to make herself good enough to stand beside you in your fight to get you back, she said that even if she can't reach that goal she will stand by you anyway and sacrifice herself to be with you. When I asked what she would do if she couldn't get you back, she said that would mean she is dead."

She sighed out and closed her eyes, "There were other things but that was the important part, she also trained me in a few new jutsu...hah.. you were right, she does help anyone.." Shaking her head, "anyhow....the point of me telling you all that was to show you how much she loves you." Nodding some, "I spoke to Index and apparently the work on  me will take an estimate of....two to four years time. I will be in the base that whole time likely but he feels guilty about keeping you away all that time, so much so he tried to say he wouldn't let me do it anymore just so we could be together. This is what I want though, to have emotions. He said he is going to try and work out a way for you to come to the base during that time to see me." She then went silent knowing this was going to be a lot to take in.* - Tue Nov 10 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly in thought, "The only thing is... two to four years is such a long time with the kind of things you do. You could die, I know I won't be dead but you could very well die while I'm in there... that's the reality. I.... want you to know that if you want to be with Marrisa at all... you should be with her while I am gone, and if she is still around when I come out...then so be it. I don't want to hear you say that it won't happen, this is just me telling you that it's okay if it happens. At whatever point that I am gone.... and if you don't want me to do this because of how long it is... say so now."* - Tue Nov 10 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded to what he said, whether he meant it or not it was what he had said and she was going to accept it. "Is there anything else you need or want before I go?" She stood up and walked over to him to stand before him.* - Tue Nov 10 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) didn't resist him pulling her in and kissed him back deeply for his perfect goodbye kiss. She knew this meant a lot to him but the only part of it that was hard for her was not knowing if he would be alive when she returned. "Yeah, best not for now..." She lowered her head in thought and then looked up to him. "Are you ready to say goodbye then?"* - Tue Nov 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) smiled and nodded as she hugged him tightly, "yeah... see you later, Ortho."* - Tue Nov 10 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) pulled away from him, knowing this was going to be hard on him. She forced herself to leave the house without looking back.* - Tue Nov 10 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm ready to go. - Tue Nov 10 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I see. - Tue Nov 10 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Is there anything you wish to take with you? - Tue Nov 10 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't have anything. - Tue Nov 10 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Just clothing you gave me and clothing I stole. - Tue Nov 10 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It goes without saying. - Tue Nov 10 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Anything you see, is completely confidential. - Tue Nov 10 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, Index. - Tue Nov 10 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) didn't peer around, she simply kept her head forward and walked where he took her. When they stepped into the bedroom she finally looked around and when he spoke about getting her more things she simply replied, "you could have had me sleeping on the ground and it would be the same Index, but you can do what you like that makes you feel better about the situation. I can't feel uncomfortability and colors do not affect my mood." She then thought for a moment, "The only request I might have.... is if I can have plants.... or at least one... there are no windows in here so I can't see any outside but there is also the fact I do rather like to talk to them... if it isn't allowed, I will understand." 

She turned to look at him with blank expression and then asked, "Should I turn back into Ume now? Or do you want me to stay as I am as Owari?"* - Tue Nov 10 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) walked towards the bed and sat next to him since that's what she thought he was signaling her to do. "What would the scientists want me to do then?" She watched him as he removed the hood an mask and then wrinkled her nose some. "Your hair is very strange looking right now."* - Tue Nov 10 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thought about this, "how are they going to inject me? I am just a solid mass, no organs, no blood..." She then thought again, "will you be here?"* - Tue Nov 10 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Of course he isn't going to be here all the time but will he be gone all the time? Me alone with scientists and guards. - Tue Nov 10 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) stared down at the floor, "It's almost funny.... if I could find things funny, that Ortho and you hate each other so much and yet I'm going to be spending longer with you than I've even known him."* - Tue Nov 10 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It is ironic, but once all is said and done, You can be with him for as long as you wish. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I told him..... - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I had talked to Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I found out things about her feelings and their break up and everything really. - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Maybe the problem isn't a lack of emotions, it's that your body can't process them. - Tue Nov 10 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Everything I did when talking to him before leaving, was for his benefit. - Tue Nov 10 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: And not saying anything would just be the fact you might be scared of saying goodbye. Ortho was afraid to say goodbye, he had me say I'll see him later. - Tue Nov 10 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably because of the one thing I left out telling both of you that makes me complete. - Tue Nov 10 23:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Probably to sate their curiosity. - Tue Nov 10 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I left out about that the last thing that makes me complete is an owner. I'm a weapon, weapon's are owned. My previous owner didn't want me for whatever reason but couldn't figure out how to kill me.  - Tue Nov 10 23:14:20 2015

She started to unbutton the top diagonally lined buttons of her dress before slipping it off but leaving her shoes on. She took off her Kirigakure headband which Index should know was clearly not her's but just for the persona. She didn't take off the pink panties and bra because she thought she was suppose to wear these now under other clothing she put on. Reaching out for the gown she would put it on unless he told her she needed to take off the undergarments and shoes.* - Tue Nov 10 23:25:26 2015
