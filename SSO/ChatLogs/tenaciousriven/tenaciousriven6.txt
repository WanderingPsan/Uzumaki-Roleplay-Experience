<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The vow that as you walk this path with me, your 'life' will not be compromised. - Sun Nov  8 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ....How long is it going to take you to realize? - Sun Nov  8 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) looked seriously at him, "The  only threat to me is the Gezo...." pausing and then wobbling her head back and forth, "well... and really smart scientists... or doctors."* - Sun Nov  8 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ...maybe Sanoke too. - Sun Nov  8 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: If that will make you cease this blank persona of your's, it's rather boring. I honestly don't know what you all find so interesting about me. - Sun Nov  8 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You'll figure that last part out soon. - Sun Nov  8 02:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: East of Konoha. - Sun Nov  8 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov  8 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded and started to walk towards the bed of water. She was undoing the buttons high up on the neck of her dress in the front. Diagonally going down following the buttons until much of her cleavage was showing and then she slipped it over her shoulders and let the cotton dress fall to the grass below her feet. Slipping out of the slippers at the same time she left them under the dress and stepped forward as she continued walking and began to pull off her panties and bra, leaving them scattered on the way to the river.* - Sun Nov  8 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) looked up and down his body shamelessly as he stepped up beside her. Stepping into the water and turning once the water was up to her belly button with her breasts fully exposed and looking more human than he had ever seen her before with color about her aerola and nipples, not to mention her sex when she was walking into the river. "You are going to end up killing yourself drinking that stuff so often. Will you show me how to swim?"* - Sun Nov  8 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times as he was pulling her in towards him. Her hands brought up to his shoulders as she stared up at him from her tiny weak frame. She really did feel quite a long weaker in this body form after all. "What about your hopes...dreams...goals?" Her tone was lowering into a hush for them to speak in a more cozy conversation.* - Sun Nov  8 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes gently and smiled faintly, "that sounded what humans call romantic... but do you really believe it?"* - Sun Nov  8 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few more times as he kissed down her neck, she knew this was working endorphines throughout his whole system but she felt nothing but the pressure of his lips and the wet warmth of his saliva cooling on her 'flesh'. "I can tell you are enjoying yourself, but what you say... does that mean you are ceasing everything you have worked for? You killed so many people for this cause but you are ready to give it up for a woman who isn't even human...who can't -feel-."* - Sun Nov  8 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) sighed gently at his mention of her meager emotions in the time of conflict, "yes...but that's not -physically- feeling. I feel no pleasure, no pain...."* - Sun Nov  8 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) folded her brow faintly as he stared at her so intently, ".... not in the sense  a human would...does that ruin it for you? I have it go on because I know you enjoy my form, and I.... like when you are pleased so I want it to happen."* - Sun Nov  8 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why should I? - Sun Nov  8 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Resist that is. - Sun Nov  8 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) wrapped her arms around the back of his neck and locked them together with fingers interlocking. She braced her thighs around his hips and crossed her ankles as she held onto him wondering what he was about to do, this was a position that hadn't been in the plastic book after all. "If I say why should I resist, is that not an answer enough that I will let you? I'm yours, at least from what I assumed I was yours, with how you act around me. Unless you do not follow the common human tradition of one male and one female."* - Sun Nov  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That feels strange, he's inside of me. - Sun Nov  8 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) squirmed for a moment in trying to get used to something foreign, and living, being inside of her. It felt rather strange needless to say, after all this was the first time for her to experience anything but a weapon piercing her. She peered across at him and her eyes shown how she was curious but estranged to what was going on. * - Sun Nov  8 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) watched him carefully in silence, seeing the pleasure this brought him. Such a simple human action and yet he already looked ten times better than he was in Konoha or on the Kirigakure cliffside. He looked... refreshed.* - Sun Nov  8 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) kissed him back trying to learn from what he was doing, she squirmed in his arms, helplessly unable to control her movement due to the thrusting. Each time she felt the pressure inside of her it made her body want to morph but she forced it to hold form against him. Honestly this was time spent that she could ask him questions or him her, but she knew this was going to give him some relief and hopefully more focus on his goal. * - Sun Nov  8 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) imitated a gasp for air as they broke the kiss and closed her eyes leaning back as he kissed down her neck. Making everything easy for him to access to do with as he pleased. As his words sounded she peeked through her lashes to him and spoke in a hushed tone, "yes?"* - Sun Nov  8 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as his length was removed from her. Gasping again and making a short sound that sounded like a whine as he turned her around. She was surprised how much the pressure of being pushed into could affect her. As she pressed her hands against her lower thighs over her knee's to support her upper body weight and heard his words it made her smile and for a second she felt a flicker of happiness that he was finally feeling accomplished in something.* - Sun Nov  8 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I don't understand....how is he able to feel so deeply for me? A science creation... - Sun Nov  8 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) exhaled out and peered over her shoulder to him as he gripped her chest. She didn't dare question him now, she didn't want to ruin his moment. She would wait until after, allowing him to sate his passions in whatever way he needed so that she could rest easy knowing he wasn't conflicted.* - Sun Nov  8 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That sound he made... - Sun Nov  8 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she peered up at him from over her shoulder. Watching him through the entire climax and feeling the burst of fluids inside of her. She swallowed hard while in thought of what she had just given him but at the same time it wasn't any different than them walking to another village, sitting in a tea shop, or him teaching her... it was just another activity to her that he enjoyed.* - Sun Nov  8 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) was wraped around him with her legs and arms as he rest against the bank. She shifted to lay atop him and glance down to his awe filled face. "In reference to what?"* - Sun Nov  8 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) 's eyes opened wider and she said nothing, she did nothing but lower her head down onto his chest.* - Sun Nov  8 05:32:48 2015
