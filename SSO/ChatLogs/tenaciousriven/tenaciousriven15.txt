<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Something else is different about him though. - Sun Nov 29 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: His blood is black. - Sun Nov 29 14:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) is also only wearing stockings and a light green sundress. She waved and then walked over and crawled onto Thirteen's lap so she was stradling him and hugged around the back of his neck with her head resting on his shoulder. She did not have any undergarments on.* - Sun Nov 29 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Hello, Master. - Sun Nov 29 15:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.~ - Sun Nov 29 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do I get a good morning kiss before we start training though~? - Sun Nov 29 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip and nodded quickly before leaning in to kiss him passionately.* - Sun Nov 29 15:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What are they? - Sun Nov 29 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Water Prision...Exploding Collision Wave, And possibly Shadow imitation. - Sun Nov 29 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sun Nov 29 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: We'll start with water Prison. - Sun Nov 29 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Oh? - Sun Nov 29 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched how the jutsu worked and then chuckled, "This wouldn't work on me. Silly humans.~" She shook her head to him about Mizu bunshin and looked through the flip book a few more times before folding her hands into seals and trying to raise water up out of the ocean to use for the ability since it was always much more normal for her to use natural water and earth than spit it out from forming via her chakra.

"I was wondering, did you dislike how I did in Amegakure, Master?"

She formed the handseals several more times and practiced forming a large orb of water and tested to see if she needed her entire arm in the water or just a hand, and even just the touch of her fingers to keep it held together. * - Sun Nov 29 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) awaited his answer and tried to form the water prison into a better shape. Honesetly due to her ability with water this was quite easy for her to create. She ran her hands over the surface and soon enough she had a water prison that would make most water users jealous. She kept this up for an hour about before finally deciding it was time to move onto another jutsu.* - Sun Nov 29 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) is just going to note that she is literally made to clone so this is extremely easy for her to create with her water chakra flow nature. She easily makes a perfect clone of herself and shrugged. "That was easy..." she did what he told her to do, so what if there might be some of her body mixed in there?* - Sun Nov 29 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's what worked. - Sun Nov 29 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: To get what I wanted. - Sun Nov 29 17:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And rebuild Ame.. - Sun Nov 29 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: For our benefit. - Sun Nov 29 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Our Benefit~? - Sun Nov 29 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, 'our' benefit. - Sun Nov 29 17:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Mhm~ - Sun Nov 29 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then... why do you have me be this way here? - Sun Nov 29 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's a good question...I never knew how you could be. - Sun Nov 29 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Why not...give it a test run today? - Sun Nov 29 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll see how I enjoy it some more~. - Sun Nov 29 17:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe just for today, It'll be a change in rhythm~. - Sun Nov 29 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm... that's no fun though. - Sun Nov 29 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Only getting to be bossy for one day. - Sun Nov 29 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's a tease. - Sun Nov 29 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm~. I see. - Sun Nov 29 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then... - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How about.. - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can be bossy when it's just the two of us? - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but you like being bossy when we are alone, Master. - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Wouldn't it...make more sense the other way around? - Sun Nov 29 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) might have been up to something!* - Sun Nov 29 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip hard as he ageed. "Does that mean you will let me take care of the business stuff again?" She lifted her head as he kissed her neck, in all honesty they are alone so much he would be in charge most of the time.* - Sun Nov 29 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) hugged him back and slowly slid her hand between his legs and cupped his groin as she spoke. "I always wanted to run the things I own... but you took charge...and when I questioned it you got all serious and got that -voice-... but now you seem different and you looked like you liked me when I was bossy and making deals. I want to learn how to read...."* - Sun Nov 29 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm surprised. - Sun Nov 29 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought you might punish me later for it. - Sun Nov 29 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Were you looking forward to it Yuriko? - Sun Nov 29 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no. - Sun Nov 29 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Or should I say...Mistress Yuriko for the time being~? - Sun Nov 29 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: O-oh. - Sun Nov 29 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip at the title but shook her head, "No no... Yuriko is fine."* - Sun Nov 29 21:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: I was hoping to see what it'd be like, like a sneak peak~? - Sun Nov 29 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Although... - Sun Nov 29 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If I'm in charge, there's been something I've been desiring to do. - Sun Nov 29 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What is that, Master? - Sun Nov 29 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "There isn't?" He hand shifted in a massage over his groin.* - Sun Nov 29 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged faintly and peered out over the water, "Perhaps. But there are many emotions I do not have yet."* - Sun Nov 29 22:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Silly you.~ - Sun Nov 29 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Of course I wouldn't~ - Sun Nov 29 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nuzzled in against his chest.* - Sun Nov 29 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat on the bed and smoothed out her dress sitting all lady like.* - Sun Nov 29 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the vial and then drank it down. Soon enough she felt an immediate reaction. Her eyes narrowed in on the scientists in front of her and a sickly crazed grin came upon her face. She darted at him aiming to grip his neck and slam him to the ground, unless she was stopped.* - Sun Nov 29 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) laughed manically at what Thirteen's voice sounded like and continued to crush the throat of the doctor. She was enjoying every last moment of his pitiful eyes and how they begged her to spare him.* - Sun Nov 29 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) ignored him entirely and continued to squeeze the throat. Cracking could be heard and the scientist was already passed out... likely dying. She stared to laugh loudly in enjoyment as she killed him.* - Sun Nov 29 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's hand released the throat as soon as the genjutsu took over her. She felt herself going into an unnatural reality where nothing felt real and it all made her feel like she was turning into a puddle constantly. "Ngnngg..." she wasn't moving at all, and the scientist was being checked out by the other doctors, his next was fractured in a few places and he was knocked out but alive. "AGhhghghh!" She screamed in pain as she couldn't figure out what was happening to her.* - Sun Nov 29 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was easily forced back and the serum went into her body easily enough and she slowly began to calm down from the chemical but she was very much so still in the genjutsu.* - Sun Nov 29 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) trembled as she lay on the ground in shock of what had just been happening. Suddenly she was back in the bedroom, and peering around wide eyed. "Where did I go?"* - Sun Nov 29 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh... - Sun Nov 29 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) saw the scientists backing away and carrying out an unconscious body. "Did I hurt someone?"* - Sun Nov 29 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes "O-oh... I mean.. he was just eager right? I don't have to eat him for trying to do more experiements.... is more experiements bad?"* - Sun Nov 29 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) trembled and pulled in close to Thirteen, "W-why would they do that when you are here, Master?" She turned her face in against his chest for comfort.* - Sun Nov 29 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't ever let them think that again, Master! - Sun Nov 29 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't Yuriko... - Sun Nov 29 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Not -ever-. - Sun Nov 29 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) held tightly onto him.* - Sun Nov 29 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) totally fell into his trap...he was too devious for her, she was intelligent but he was vast beyond her.* - Sun Nov 29 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah! - Sun Nov 29 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took his hand to follow him out of the room?* - Sun Nov 29 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) llicked over her lips and looked at the man like he was the most divine meal to be offered to her in her life. She stood on her tip toes and kissed Thirteen first, "Thank you, Master.~" Then she turned and gripped the man's shoulders and began to widen her jaw more and more until she started to swallow him whole. As his body disapeared she groaned out and moaned as she felt over her body. "This just keeps feeling better and better the more I -feel-.' Rushing over towards Thirteen she peered up into his eyes with her lust filled hunger resting through a mild satation. "I think I could eat a whole army.~"* - Sun Nov 29 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned out in pleasure of the corspe parade being mentioned. She licked over her lips and then kissed him passionately. She broke the kiss soon after, "I love you, Master.~ Do you want to keep doing the experiments now that I've eaten? I feel fine."* - Sun Nov 29 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was carried off back to her room.~* - Sun Nov 29 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the serum offered to her and then drank it down. It seems nothing happened.* - Sun Nov 29 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the vial and drank it down. She then looked around at the others and slowly began to stand up and move towards the door. Once she was at the door, if she had managed to get there, she was trying to open it from the inside but she couldn't. "Nngng...ngngng..." She was panicking and darting he eyes back to the others in the room in panick.* - Mon Nov 30 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || If there was anyone to fear in here... it was most of all Thirteen. She screamed and stumbled back into the corner as he tried to comfort her. * - Mon Nov 30 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nealy sounded like she was sobbing in the corner trying to get the girl to leave her alone. She wouldn't take what was in the vial from the lady, WHAT IF IT WAS POISON.* - Mon Nov 30 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) evently came down from it in the normal amount of time.* - Mon Nov 30 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was sitting in the corner staring out in shock of what she had just endured. "That.....what was that?"* - Mon Nov 30 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him and she was cautious but soon moved to let him wrap his arms around her body. "Yeah.... why do I need it if I can't die?"* - Mon Nov 30 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Emphathetic? - Mon Nov 30 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 30 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's the comprehension...And understanding of another's feelings. - Mon Nov 30 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If I was crying because I was hurt. You'd understand. - Mon Nov 30 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And wouldn't be judgmental but relate. - Mon Nov 30 01:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well.. - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There's one... - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: A vial of happiness on the tray. - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe we can fill that gap? - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at the tray and then nodded in approval.* - Mon Nov 30 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the bottle and then drank it down quickly. She looked up to him, "I love you too, Master.~" She then felt a warm fuzzy feeling coming over her that was generally more neutral than love but certainly better than she normally felt. "Huh... I feel... really good... like really good."* - Mon Nov 30 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like.... amazing. - Mon Nov 30 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Is this how people can smile at things that are normal? - Mon Nov 30 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And mean it? - Mon Nov 30 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah......It is~. - Mon Nov 30 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Huh. - Mon Nov 30 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) began to smile genuinely.* - Mon Nov 30 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Look at me! I'm smiling. - Mon Nov 30 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Just because something nice happneed. - Mon Nov 30 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What? - Mon Nov 30 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and walked towards him.* - Mon Nov 30 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Speechless* - Mon Nov 30 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Heh. - Mon Nov 30 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Does it? - Mon Nov 30 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah.. - Mon Nov 30 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I could look at your smile...All day. - Mon Nov 30 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) couldn't help but smile wider and wider.* - Mon Nov 30 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I've never seen you this way, Master.~ - Mon Nov 30 02:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Nervous.~ - Mon Nov 30 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't know....my heart it's racing.... - Mon Nov 30 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Of course, Master. - Mon Nov 30 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you want to talk about? - Mon Nov 30 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took his hand and led him over to the bed.* - Mon Nov 30 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) scooched in close against him and nuzzled against him as they lay on the bed. "What about us, Master?~"* - Mon Nov 30 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Huh? - Mon Nov 30 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, crazy.~ - Mon Nov 30 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Always hanging out...Alone.. - Mon Nov 30 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Whispering to eachother. - Mon Nov 30 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...together? - Mon Nov 30 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Yeah.... - Mon Nov 30 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: I think so.. - Mon Nov 30 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: We are. - Mon Nov 30 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The whole. - Mon Nov 30 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: One man, One woman thing. - Mon Nov 30 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: A....couple? - Mon Nov 30 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit.* - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you want the really honest answer? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah...The truth.. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think I have a choice. - Mon Nov 30 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: You have every right, to choose who you want, as long as you're there when I want you. - Mon Nov 30 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: So...You have a choice, But you're still my precious doll whether we're a couple or not~. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You know that isn't true. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You killed a guard because you thought he might be interested in me. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Isn't it? - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You may be right. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But then again... - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's weird.. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How I can take pleasure... - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: From commanding you to do stuff for me. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As well as you willingly doing it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: So... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you were -my- owner. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What would you do? - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Then again..I suppose you -are- my owner, aren't you? You said you wanted to control what you owned...I was techniqually entrusted to you when ownership of this base was given, wasn't I~? - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was frowning faintly and concentrating on her thoughts.* - Mon Nov 30 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Mm, Something wrong?  - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko-sama~? Mistress Yuriko~? - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: S-stop that. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hmm~ Do you not like it? - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned her head away ashamed. "It's just...it doesn't sound right."* - Mon Nov 30 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Ngn.. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So hard to resist. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's hand rose and rest on his thigh hesitantly.* - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Technically atop him. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was becoming nervous. She kept her eyes down and chin down a bit, "uh... w-what kind of things?"* - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Se-cr-et things~ - Mon Nov 30 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Although...You'll find out more in the comming days. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Be prepared~ - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Mm. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: One last thing. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This is an order. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I.Am.The.Only.Person.You.Are.To.Take.Orders.From. - Mon Nov 30 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Sh-shit. - Mon Nov 30 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared up at him with the widest eyes she could manage naturally.* - Mon Nov 30 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) now frowned while staring at him, "no." There were many reasons why, she figured she was about to be punished.... but what he was asking was extemely conflicting of what he said earlier. Not only that he was trying to restrict where she went and when when previously she left whenever she wanted to. * - Mon Nov 30 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. Now. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I can't resist it much longer. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This feeling, I hate it sometimes. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You want to talk about it now? - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's body had mildly trembled.* - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Stand up, and Strip. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then start talking. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -Now-. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt the presure of the hand around her neck and watched his eyes with her own. She again stated in the same tone, "no."* - Mon Nov 30 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't resist him pulling her around. It was almost like she actually was a living doll in that moment as she slammed against the ground quite heavily and hard with a thud as he hovered over her. She said nothing and only focused on him.* - Mon Nov 30 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt him rip her dress off of her down the front, destroying it. She trembled some and watched him carefully. She simply stared up at him, his threats seemed to not get through to her as she looked at him defiantly.* - Mon Nov 30 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) immediately activated what she had been waiting to activate as soon as she would see handseals. Suddenly a giant white clone was morphing and forming aound Thirteen's body and securing him into a bind that would stop him from being able to form the handseals. See she had been focusing and before his hands even touched together he was already being sapped of chakra and forced into a submissive restriction of lacking movement.* - Mon Nov 30 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and walked over to the closet and began to pull on a nice pretty dress. "I knew you were full of it."* - Mon Nov 30 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat down on the bed staring at him and sighed out as she wasn't smiling looked cruel and hateful, but shame was in there too. "You were saying all those nice things earlier but then switched like a flip... you got worried about me wanting to be dominant and run things that are rightfully mine when you have no senseof the outside world. Sure I am learning but you know hardly anything at all, you might as well be a new born." She ran a hand up through her hair and sighed out, "I serve you because I need an owner, but I don't -always- have to have an owner so if you were gone I would only suffer on the inside and find a owner again at some point." She stood up and walked over to him, crouching beside his warped body from the large bulge of the white clone. "I do the things I do fo you because I -want- to do them. I do want you to be my Master, but you are losing control. I'll let you punish me if you wish.. but you told me to stop you if you eve got out of hand. Know that if you ever get out of hand again? I will end  you." She rested her hand on the clone and absorbed all of it but the one cell that rested in secret on his body.* - Mon Nov 30 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then walked out of -their- room, which used to be -her- room. But she wasn't obsessive so she went to her plants.* - Mon Nov 30 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was staring at some of the flip books Thirteen had made her, "Okay."* - Mon Nov 30 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed the flip book she was looking through. "Because you told me if you ever lost control and crossed a line to stop you. So I did."* - Mon Nov 30 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You were stripping all the power away from me because you felt threatened by me wanting to learn to read and to take control over that I rightfully own, this base and the money. - Mon Nov 30 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You tried to control when and how long I can leave the base for. - Mon Nov 30 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Nov 30 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Understood. - Mon Nov 30 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him as he stood. She wondered why he seemed distant when she had answered him as he liked. She looked back down to her flipbook and began studying again, since she had no plants in the area she couldn't be aware of what he was doing.* - Mon Nov 30 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's hand trembled and then she was forced to release the flipbook. It fell to the table and bounced off onto the floor. She slowly slid down in the chair and then fell onto the ground in a small hump of limbs in various directions and her body laying completely still. She said nothing and only stared out blankly, like a real doll. * - Mon Nov 30 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was declothed and then forced into another genjutsu. Her head jerked up as she was pulled out of the fatigued feeling. Bindings applied pressure sensation on her body and she looked down to her nude form and began to tremble. Looking back up to Thirteen and saying nothing, she didn't fear since she couldn't fear but understood she -should- fear. Instead all she could feel was hate...and betrayal. On top of all of that, she felt a sensation she had -never- felt before, not even from the chemicals she had taken in the experiments. He body continued to tremble and shudder from the chill on her body but of course since she wasn't human there was no other reaction other than her trembling.* - Mon Nov 30 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's shame was being played upon, she trembled more and when he slapped her ass she screamed out in a yelp of surprise. She wasn't sure what she had just experienced but it reminded her of when she took the chemicals for pain. Had he drugged her again? She looked around the darkness and then winced at the pain of the light shining brightly on her as the voices were heard. She adjusted to the light and then trembled harder and turned her head away as she shut her eyes and refused to look in the mirror as he had her publicly shamed. Currently she thought that it was everyone from the compound doing this to her.* - Mon Nov 30 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook more and more, as he touched her she jerked in the bindings away from the touches and grunted with whines of terrified and shameful emotion. She couldn't cry but it was as close to crying as a thing like her could get as he violated her. Her hands remained closed so she couldn't see herself but the whispers and bright lights made red splotches shine into her eyes from the lids filtering the light. She groaned in pain as she began to develop a headache from the light and the whispers made her mind ache in pain of the terrifying situation. As Thirteen's hand went over her sex she jerked her head up and gasped out in terror and strange tingles. She didn't enjoy it, she was so terrified that instead of her brain processint it as pleasure she processed it as pain slightly, she didn't -understsand- pleasure.* - Mon Nov 30 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) could hear someone walking towards her. She peeked her eyes open and saw herself and what was happening, that dark figure. She trembled and then yelped from the finger touching her tight pucker and then squirmed against all the stimulation and pain of her head. She felt like she was heating up but didn't understand -why- she was heating up. "Y-yeeeeeees!!!" She screamed out in panic.* - Mon Nov 30 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: \ - Mon Nov 30 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned out and squirmed against him as he wrapped the hand around her throat. She gasped out as if she actually breathed and struggled against his hand as she 'sobbed' out in turmoil. She trembled against him as he pressed behind her and her entire body was vibrating with fear. As the figure approached her she now was staring at him in terror as she was fully forced to keep her eyes open due to sheer anguish and fear of what was going to happen. When he cupped her sex and kissed her neck she grimaced and shook her head against the hold on her throat, barely able to speak out words due to her thinking she was being strangled. "I-i don't kno-know what to say! Nngng... S-stop pl-please! I don-n't like this anymore! S-stop!"* - Mon Nov 30 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) screamed out loudly at what was happening now, she couldn't even comprehend what to do or say. She screamed in terror constantly and fought the bindings and Thirteen as the hand neared her, she was becoming more and more frightened and -honestly- had no idea what he wanted her to say.* - Mon Nov 30 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) screamed out louder and louder as the burning was felt. She was losing it and he was breaking her, she didn't even know what to do. His hint was either ignored or unregistered to guide her to the answer. She was too hateful, terrified, and in pain to try to answer or even speak right now.* - Mon Nov 30 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook hard, and when the scenery changed she gasped out and peered around at the bright area and then herself mirroring her. Suddenly the image of herself was -not- a good thing. -Mirrors- were not good, anything where she could see herself was -bad-. Very, VERY, bad. She screamed out in terror as the replica touched her and kissed her lips. Muffled screams as the kiss persisted and the words echoed in her mind about if she had just listened to him.

As he continued to hold her and the bindings were gone she -immediately- fought against him and tried to get away helplessly. She even tried to activate the spore on his body...but it failed. <He managed to get it off of him? How?> She of course wasn't really activating it, she was just failing since she was in the genjutsu and couldn't control her chakra right now.* - Mon Nov 30 23:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was turning her head this one and that. "Something weird...talking..whispering.."* - Tue Dec  1 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought that was my story? - Tue Dec  1 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned and sat down on the ground as she started to hold her head. She was snapping, too many similiar things between reality and 'stories' in her mind. "Nngng...."* - Tue Dec  1 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded some against his chest and then groaned some. She wasn't sure what had just happened but she felt confused... and angry.* - Tue Dec  1 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was sat on the bed and held he head. She didn't look like she was focused on the box or magazines, she groaned and held her head and curled up into a ball of fireworks went off in her head as she tried to come back to a 'normal' level of mind.* - Tue Dec  1 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Ngng...  - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too many stories. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too many emotions. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: All cloudy. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: All shattered. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Bloody..blood...shatter...shatter..crack.... - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sounded -broken as fuck-.* - Tue Dec  1 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || That was the problem, she -was- focusing on him. He was the factor that caused her so much pain, no one had done worse things to her than him... and he likely knew this. She suddenly began to scream as he mentioned the story they created and how it had ended. * - Tue Dec  1 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) screamed for a bit more before falling silent. He wanted a broken doll, he got one.* - Tue Dec  1 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt the world around her change and then she stared out at the moving water. She simply watched it come in and go back out, over and over.* - Tue Dec  1 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Staing at walls - Tue Dec  1 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: I wonder... - Wed Dec  2 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: but i - Wed Dec  2 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hikaru(God of Fate) says: Ah, headband - Wed Dec  2 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked through the forest with a defined grace. She had on likely the fanciest dress Mystic had ever seen and she wore heeled boots that walked in a divine fashion with little struggle across the rough terrain. When she spotted Mystic, her pink and brown heterochromic gaze focused in on his person and a devious grin pulled up along her perfect doll like visage. 

She slowly approached Mystic in open view and looked the male over. She came to a stop a few feet away from the boy and stared down at him curiously without a single word. Her big eyes blinking slowly as she folded her hands back behind her back and stared at him. Something about her eyes gave off a vibe that she wasn't all right in the head.* - Wed Dec  2 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stepped closer and crouched down in a lady like fashion with her legs together and skirt covering her---course, he probably caught a sight of her pink panties as she lowered down. She craned her head to the side while watching him. "I came to see the tree's, what are you doing out here little bee?" She paused and then giggled girlishly, "I'm Yuriko."* - Wed Dec  2 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) craned her head further to the side, "everyone hates you?"* - Wed Dec  2 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) hummed gently and rubbed her lips together, "but everyone that liked you is dead... yes?"* - Wed Dec  2 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: False. - Wed Dec  2 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: Only one person didn't like me. - Wed Dec  2 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: Lady Noriko and Tethys Were nice. - Wed Dec  2 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: Niklaus was a cock. - Wed Dec  2 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but the people who cared are dead. - Wed Dec  2 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: Two people whom I darely cared about are dead yes. - Wed Dec  2 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: So is the girl I loved in Kiri. - Wed Dec  2 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So nobody that cares about you is alive. - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: No idea where she is now. It's world. I just have to cope with it. - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: I can't bring back the dead. - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: So dwelling over it isn't my problem. I'm over it. - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thought he was an idiot but she reached out and pat his head gently.* - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) gripped the male's hair harshly and then began to open her mouth wide. On top of that a safety measure has been placed on his body with him entirely unaware of it in anyway...

As she widened her mouth it was like elastic, her jaw 'unhinged' and her mouth became as wide as a giant anaconda's. It was very unnatural and it seemed that she was about to try and swallow him alive.* - Wed Dec  2 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Silly boy, saying he doesn't have anyone. - Wed Dec  2 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Too easy. - Wed Dec  2 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || As soon as the boy was beginning to go past her jaw, he would be dissolved somehow... it would be extremely painful and not at all 'normal' to the ways of normal human digestion. Clearly she was something else entirely...* - Wed Dec  2 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: wind fire lightning magnetism] - Wed Dec  2 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: do you want a puppet for your C rank?] - Wed Dec  2 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) came into the area with blood coating her front from the mouth down, it all seemed to be dried and originating from her mouth showing she had eaten something... in a very messy way---which was totally unlike her normal self.* - Wed Dec  2 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Someone didn't have anyone to care for them. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He was stupid. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I think he liked it. - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) squinted in thought for a bit and then started laughin a maniacally manner.* - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: laughing* - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....Liked it? - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hehehe... He smiled. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he screamed. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at Thirteen vey seriously as she walked over to him, clearly she hadn't cleaned herself up like she normally would do at all. "Yes... -very- good...." her words were growly and animalistic.* - Wed Dec  2 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) licked over the dried blood on her lips and shuddered some. "Mnngg... you should have come with me, he was so stupid. Eating his stupid human food and letting me touch his head, who lets a strange girl touch their head in the middle of no where? It was too easy..."* - Wed Dec  2 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked down at the blood and shrugged, the particular dress she was wearing was clearly ruined. "Why?" Looking back up to him with wide eyes and then bending over at her waste with elbows on the desk and cheeks and jaw in palms to prop her up in front of him. Of course this meant her clevage was very viewable to his line of sight and people passing behind her were getting a good view of her pantie covered ass.* - Wed Dec  2 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit at the comment, "wear what again?"* - Wed Dec  2 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up straight as he stood. She looked down at herself again, "You don't mind me getting you dirty?" She then peered back up to him and smiled wide and innocently once again, "Bath time!!!!!"* - Wed Dec  2 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was picked up and kicked her feet back and forth as she hummed an eerie tune but smiled all the while with her eyes closed and head rocking back and forth. She was sat down on a chair and then stared up at him, "why? That place isn't real." She had long since figured out that was a 'dream'.* - Wed Dec  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched as he crouched down and removed one shoe and kissed over her black sheer stocking, then the other. She couldn't feel him but she found it interesting that he always kissed her feet when he removed her shoes. "Why do you do that?" She was very curious and leaning forward as he pulled her panties off to expose her sex and kissed her inner thigh. Then he spoke of making her feel and to her feeling was attached to pain and suffering... 

Biting down on her lip she looked scared and hesitant.* - Wed Dec  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood and then turned around so he could undo her dress, she stood there in only her pink sheer bra and black sheer stockings. She was very much so dressed like a doll for him all the time... though this dress was ruined now so she was going to be needed a new outfit soon.~ She turned around and lifted a foot as he removed her stockings. As he did each thing she watched him until she was only in her bra with blood spanning from her lips, chin, neck, and chest. "If you really want to go there... but I'm ... s-scared."* - Wed Dec  2 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) reached out and started to undo his pants and let them drop and picked up each of his legs to have him step out of the pants as she pouted and tried to explain her reasoning. "Because I only remember bad feelings, really bad feelings... lots of pain... humiliation....--I mean.. those are from my stories but I -remember- them..." She twitched her lips to the side and then stood back up and reached for his boxers and started to pull them off until she had him step out of them as well and her head and cheek had brushed against his manhood as she helped him. Once she was finished she restood and looked up to the larger male.* - Wed Dec  2 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly towards his offer, she was sort of worried but she felt him surrounding her body and in her mind she knew that she should accept. "You asked me to name you the other day...why do you want me to name you?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit, "but no one else would know it?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Kaiju - Wed Dec  2 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned her head away as he knew the meaning of the word.* - Wed Dec  2 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Y-yeah. - Wed Dec  2 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took his hand in return and she climbed into the bath and sat down with her legs pulled up against her body. Peering over at him curiously but with a bit of worry...* - Wed Dec  2 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stretched out her legs just before the genjutsu was formed and then she jumped and gasped in pain as the heat hit her body. It didn't actually hurt but sent a burst of traumatic memories through her mind as she started to tremble and recalled her first experience of pain.* - Wed Dec  2 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) panted heavily and as he told her to focus she looked around and pressed back in against him and began to realize it didn't actually hurt. She slowly came down from her frightened state and shook her head slowly.* - Wed Dec  2 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: s2 - Wed Dec  2 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) leaned into him and closed her eyes as she sighed out and stopped shaking.* - Wed Dec  2 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as he started to brush the rough cloth against her breasts. The roughness of the cloth made her squirm and how it ran over her nipples as he morphed her sensation through the genjutsu made her lean her head back some and curl her toes. She vaguely remembered this sensation at the 'end' of their story but there was pain then...and now there wasn't.* - Wed Dec  2 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes and felt the wet sensation of warmth on her neck. It felt strange...she didn't understand it and the way the rough cloth went between her breasts and over her belly made her shudder and squirm about again against him as she tried to understand the sensation she was having. "Er... what... is this... nng... hghahg..." She moaned out gently and squirmed some more in confusion. She wasn't sure if she liked the feeling or not yet.* - Wed Dec  2 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) jumped a bit in her genjutsu'd state---course, in reality she wasn't moving -at all- she was like a doll as he held her up in his lap within the water. As he rubbed the rough cloth between her legs she whined out and pressed her thighs together with his hand between them in her genjutsu'd state. "Nngng... s-so..." she craned her neck back further as she realized how good everything he was doing felt. "Feels like... h-happiness.. ngngn..mngng."* - Wed Dec  2 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) relaxed her legs and spread them slightly as he continued to massage in circles. "Nngg.. y-yes.." She wasn't sure what else to do but lay there shuddering and ginding back against him in reaction to the pleasant feelings.* - Thu Dec  3 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) opened her eyes faintly as he was shifting his length between her cheeks but that didn't feel all that amazing to her personally, just strange and violating. When he cupped her sex she shifted back against him and gripped his thigh with her right hand before his finger entered her soft cunt beneat the water. A lewd soft moan sounded out as she closed her eyes and leaned her head back and the off to the side. Her lips parted slightly and puckered as she was captured by the pleasure and unable to react in any way other than giving him the opportunity to do whatever he wanted to her body.* - Thu Dec  3 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) moaned softly and rubbed against him with her soft body, as he continued to pet over her sex and give her pleasure she had never felt before she called out to him. "M-masteeeer..." she didn't know what else to say while he was making her feel in a way she could never feel outside of a genjutsu. "Mngng..." her head rubbed against his shoulder as she rolled her hips against his fingers and tried to feel more of the pleasure but no matter what she did he was utterly in control of what she felt or didn't feel.* - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) continued to surrender to his wishes and strokes of fingers as he tried to push her closer to the edge in a sense through normal means of how he would treat a human but her pleasure remained where he was holding it steady. "Y-yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees."* - Thu Dec  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: group* - Thu Dec  3 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked up to the area wearing her perfect dress, her perfect heeled boots, her perfect hair, eyes...skin...she looked like a freaking beautiful porcelaine doll that shouldn't be able to walk around. She also wasn't wearing any type of jacket as she appoached the area humming an eerie tone with a bright smile pulling he lips up high. Her heterochromic eyes and hair was pink and brown on opposite sides.

While she approached the area the beautiful 'doll' slowed her graceful steps and stared over towards Takuma and the others in the area. Her eyes shown a bit of crazed joy in her eyes. She came to a stop finally in the chilly mountain air with no jacket on and clearly not cold. She stared hard at Takuma as her head slowly craned to the side.* - Thu Dec  3 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slinked over towards Takuma and peered deep into his eyes with her pink and brown set as her head settled back straight up in posture and her humming continued. She said nothing.* - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: -- - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Uh. . . - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Can I help you, ma'am? - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm.... - Thu Dec  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noted his age and was learning based off his appearance noted him to be a shinobi. She stopped humming and leaned in till their noses were nearly touching but just short of doing so. "Do you have those who care for you?"* - Thu Dec  3 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sighed out gently at hearing his reply, "Mnngngng,~" moaned out as she reached out to try and grip his chin while he gave off a vibe of utterly hating what was going on. "You sure about that? You are just so ...-pretty-...how could you ever not have someone to care for you? No one to dress you up?~"* - Thu Dec  3 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her lips together and leaned in while holding his chin to whisper into his ear. Her lips brushing against his ear but...no breath came as she spoke against his ear, which was unnatural. "You know.... I am -so- very hungry.~ Can't you give a girl a little dessert?~"* - Thu Dec  3 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) moaned out gently into his ear with pleasure and then giggled girlishly as her extremely soft thumb ran over his jaw and then trailed her lips down against his ear and then neck and finally shoulder. "My lips crave a different .... palet..." she then opened her mouth wide and aimed to bite down on his shoulder hard. It wouldn't feel -sharp- like normal teeth but more so like a burn was occuring suddenly.* - Thu Dec  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was definitely not going to be pushed off gently. She continued to hold her mouth as wide as humanly possible as the burning became more intense and the pain became foriegn, likely something he had never experienced before as she tried to wrap her arms back behind his neck and body to latch onto him. If he didn't push her off agressively, blood began to leak from where she was biting in a steady stream, it seemed -alarmingly- fast how quickly it had began to flow. In turn if he hadn't stopped her it might feel as if he was being basically vaporized at the shoulder where her mouth was located and a dizzy spell from the sudden blood loss would likely cause him some issues.* - Thu Dec  3 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) gasped out and was pushed off with a few stumbling steps back but she seemed so graceful even on heels she didn't fall over. Blood ran down her chin and neck from her lips and then between her fair toned breasts. Looking at Takuma with such -hunger- and -lust-, she clearly wanted more and now looking at his shoulder there was a literal gap of where she had dissolved away his shoulder muscle nearing the bone, had he waited any longer and his shoulder would be permanently ruined for life, now he just needed to deal with a pretty nasty scar and scar tissue for life. 

She darted her pink and brown gaze towards Eiyu and craned her head while licking over her lips and moaning out before sleuthing closer to Eiyu and pressing her front of body up against his and wrapping her arms up behind the back of his head and running her fingers through his hair in obvious seduction. she peered up to the man who was much taller than her and realized how she couldn't reach his shoulder with her lips but that wouldn't matter any...

Looking him up and down a devilish grin tugged at her lips. "Oooooooh, kage-kun~. How very nice to make your aquaintance, I do have a deal to make with you... I do hope you oblige.~" She licked over her blood soaked lips and for the moment it seemed like Takuma was forgotten.* - Thu Dec  3 07:33:32 2015
