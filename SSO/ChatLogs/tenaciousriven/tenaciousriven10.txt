<br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Are...Y-You alright...with that..? - Sat Nov 14 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Wait. - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that like a kiss? - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah I suppose.. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yeah, it's okay. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) kissed him back but clearly with all things considered she kissed better than him already. Allowing his tongue to mingle with her own and let her nostrils flare with a breath out as she kissed him while eyes were closed. * - Sat Nov 14 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) || When the kiss was broken she couldn't help but comment. "Is that the first time you've...kissed?"* - Sat Nov 14 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked some, "oh." She stared at the dice while he was answering, "rub crotch."* - Sat Nov 14 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) almost immediately reached out and had shifted her legs off his lap enough that she was sitting beside him with her legs still fully showing as she was suppose to have them like. She began to rub the bulge through the pants and then asked innocently. "Am I suppose to go under your pants like I did your shirt? You didn't go under my shirt."* - Sat Nov 14 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him as he gasped and she quickly undid his pants and began to toy and massage his length and the surrounding bulges he had to play with. She watched him carefully to learn what was good and what was not, all while going on for a bit -longer- than she should have. After all... she was interested in learning and he looked like he was enjoying it.* - Sat Nov 14 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip as she looked into his eyes and saw all the pleasure he was feeling that she would never be able to feel. "You want me to stop?" She kept massaging but slower while also tighter.* - Sat Nov 14 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Alright....I need to call it a night... - Sat Nov 14 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was watching him, it was probably creepy. "That stuff tasted interesting," not that he was aware she had tasted his cum before he went to sleep, she had waited for afterwards.* - Sat Nov 14 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked at him, "of course, the rest of you tasted good I wanted to see what it tasted like."* - Sat Nov 14 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It was.... interesting. - Sat Nov 14 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sticky. - Sat Nov 14 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I-I see... - Sat Nov 14 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Anyhow, why didn't the scientists come yesterday? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure...Maybe something happened? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'll go check. - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well are they coming today? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: If they're available would you like them to come now or later? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Now. - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This is taking so long. - Sat Nov 14 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked at all the bottles, "whatever you think we should do. How are you going to make it go in me?" She was staring specifically at the syringes wondering how that was suppose to work.* - Sat Nov 14 13:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....You are still trying to treat me like a human. - Sat Nov 14 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared up at the woman wondering why she was doing so. "I ask because I don't think that will move through me at all... because I don't have blood to circulate it...but if you insist on wasting it to try." She sighed and held her arm out as the woman was trying to give her an injection like a human would receive. * - Sat Nov 14 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat there for a while but she was having to actually force the liquid to morph into her body, the syringe wasn't the best delivery method by -far-, it was difficult to work with and she was squirming about and her body making strange morphs as it adjusted. Soon enough she then felt her lips curling up and she was confused what was happening. A feeling of happiness began to come over her as endorphins were actually running through her system. "W-what is happening?" She reached up to touch her smile and was very confused how it was doing that without her being able to control it. "Something must be wrong, I can't control my face." She was smiling like a fool it seemed.* - Sat Nov 14 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) started to giggle girlishly as she rubbed over her face, "it feel so weird!" She giggled more and then looked over to Yosuke and looked at him smile trying to mimick it's naturalness and giggled some more before falling back on the bed as the endorphine high was rushing through her like a wave. Wiggling on the bed like a goofball she giggled more and more.* - Sat Nov 14 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was a giggle monster for a good long while, eventually it was likely to wear off but she spoke to Yosuke excitedly for the rest of the time after she had gotten over the sensation being strange. When it started to wear off she could feel it and her excitement in her voice tapered and her smiles dampened, her giggles fading.* - Sat Nov 14 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Using a syringe was not effective, I had to waste energy. - Sat Nov 14 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I had to force it through my cells. - Sat Nov 14 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to the scientist but she didn't think whatever insulin was going to work either. She then shook her head, "No ... the reason it doesn't work and makes me waste energy is my cells are so compact it doesn't flow through me. When you injected it, a pocket was made for the liquid, then I had to hold it in and force it to integrate with each cell. Whatever insulin is, I would have to do the same with if it's injected."* - Sat Nov 14 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...right, yes. Okay, I'll just have to reserve energy later. - Sat Nov 14 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) simply picked the one closest to her since she didn't care which one once she was in her normal state.* - Sat Nov 14 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched the scientist inject her and then she actually frowned and looked down at where she had the needle in her part way through the injection. "O-ow..." she was confused for a moment at what she was feeling because Ume had -never- felt -anything-. Now she wasn't actually experiencing pain but she was imagining it from whatever they had given her. She stared down at the needle as it was extracted and then began to rub her arm. She started the process of pushing it throughout her body still confused about what she had just felt and then her entire body began to feel hot. She didn't understand hot, "what is this one? I don't have any knowledge for this emotion." 

She frowned more and was twitching as her body shifted and she started to grimace as her body went into shock basically. The pain was spreading and it was getting so hot she could barely stand it. This was going to last as long as last time but soon enough Ume was -screaming-. She didn't even use the concept of screaming until this point in her short life. She couldn't think because every cell of her body that was also her conscious was being attacked and burned brutally, at least she -thought- she was being burned. It was by far the worst thing she had ever gone though... 'dying' did not compare.* - Sat Nov 14 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) couldn't hear him, she just screamed and screamed. It wouldn't take long before the form she was holding diverted back to her most basic one where she was pure white all over and looked like a clay doll. She was curled up in a ball now while still screaming and shuddering, everything that touched her... Yosuke, the bed, the nurse..anything, everything all hurt.* - Sat Nov 14 15:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) continued on for quite a while... almost the exact amount of time the happiness had lasted before it tapered  off and the screaming had stopped. Any humans in the area likely had their ears ringing from how long the screaming had gone on while she was under the state in the underground echo-y building. She said nothing and only lay there, she didn't attempt to make her body look like it was before, she just laid there in a ball.* - Sat Nov 14 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) jerked out of reflex from the pain she had felt earlier but she felt no pain when he touched her. Even if she didn't feel the pain anymore it was a memory now... embedded in her mind. She didn't say anything for a long time as he stroked her back but eventually spoke up, "What was that?"* - Sat Nov 14 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I...wasn't suppose to feel bodily things... - Sat Nov 14 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why did I feel that... - Sat Nov 14 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Pain is an emotion? - Sat Nov 14 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why..... - Sat Nov 14 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I...don't know why that was there.. - Sat Nov 14 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I never asked...for this... - Sat Nov 14 15:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why can't I forget... - Sat Nov 14 15:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Ume...I'm sorry...I'll find...whoever did this...and make them pay.. - Sat Nov 14 15:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why..... - Sat Nov 14 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Wh-why... - Sat Nov 14 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was held and silent, if she could cry she would have... instead she just lay there trembling. Clearly the creature was traumatized by what she had felt...* - Sat Nov 14 15:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thinks: Man... - Sat Nov 14 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thinks: What did they do to her.. - Sat Nov 14 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) would eventually come back too it and slowly changed her appearance back to the one he enjoyed.* - Sat Nov 14 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: K-kill them. - Sat Nov 14 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: C-couldn't die.... suppose to die... couldn't die... - Sat Nov 14 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: ...Kill...The scientists? - Sat Nov 14 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Wh-whoever did this to me... - Sat Nov 14 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I... I want them to feel this... - Sat Nov 14 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Ume...I'll be here for you, I'll make sure nothing like this happens again.. - Sat Nov 14 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do you want to....Get out of here..? - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why did they go away... - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It's a bit stuffy. - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: N-no. - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And...The emotions..? - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: The scientists, why did they stop. - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You....didn't look like... - Sat Nov 14 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You were in the mood to continue.. - Sat Nov 14 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Is this what a mood is? - Sat Nov 14 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: More or less.. - Sat Nov 14 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I can administer the next one...If you still desire to continue. - Sat Nov 14 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Okay.... - Sat Nov 14 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at them and then picked the red one only because it was the color of her hair.* - Sat Nov 14 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt him inject her and she processed it through her body and laid there. Nothing happened as she continued to lay there and then finally peered up at him, "it's all dissolved into my cells, but nothing is happening."* - Sat Nov 14 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then waited as he injected her again. She waited and waited but nothing happened once again. Shaking her head up to him as she laid there.* - Sat Nov 14 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What about the other ones? - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: They'll cause....The 'badder' emotions. - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Which emotions? - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Anger...Fear... - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But those make a person whole? - Sat Nov 14 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Pain...that was not an emotion... I didn't -feel- anything but hurting. - Sat Nov 14 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't have a freaking vein! She lay there as he injected her and yet again...nothing occured.* - Sat Nov 14 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Did I break? - Sat Nov 14 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: No clue.. - Sat Nov 14 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Let's try one more. - Sat Nov 14 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was injected again and still nothing happened, Ume closed her eyes and sighed dramatically. "Are you sure you are doing it right?"* - Sat Nov 14 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched as the needle was injected to her and then began to cycle the chemical through her cells. Soon enough she felt an encroaching strange feeling coming on. Things around her felt bad... she jerked her head towards Yosuke and then the scientists. She was halucinating now as she saw strange figures, all herself, mocking her, shouting at her. Ortho was there, Yosuke was himself, there were others... and then one of the scientists she widened her eyes looking up at the person who had injected her and trembled as the fear settled in and she -swore- they were the ones who had given her the pain injection. They were behind it all! She quickly gripped a random syringe and tried to stab the scientist in the throat with the syringe before injecting it unless she was stopped. All the while her entire body was quaking and her form was struggling to hold the features due to her being so unfocused.* - Sat Nov 14 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) jerked and screamed more in an angry way than anything as she tried to get free. She was spastic and out of control of how she was acting, she was feeling fear that was for sure but it also had elements of hormones that go into effect for 'fight or flight' which was a very bad mixture for them to toss into there for someone as dangerous as herself.* - Sat Nov 14 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) jerked and writhed but the rational thought of morphing herself to get free didn't come to mind for her. She jerked about until finally she went slack in his arms and seemed to be passed out. Really she was having to regenerate a large number of cells due to 'brain failure' in a large amount of them.* - Sat Nov 14 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) remained 'passed out' in his grip as he pet her hair. She would remain like this for quite a long time, a half hour in fact before she might come around. So if he just held her like that then fine she'd wake up to him petting her hair, otherwise there was quite a lot of time.* - Sat Nov 14 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 'awoke' to laying on top of him and lifted her head to peer down at him. "What happened?" Since she had been hallucinating she hadn't remembered a whole lot.* - Sat Nov 14 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Normal...sort of. - Sat Nov 14 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think....no more today. - Sat Nov 14 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) groaned and laid her head back down on his chest, she was severely out of energy.* - Sat Nov 14 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You cried. - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: H-Hm? - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You cried. - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I can see the signs in your syes. - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: eyes. - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: It was...scary... - Sat Nov 14 17:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I...did -I- scare you? - Sat Nov 14 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: No...It was...the situation. - Sat Nov 14 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: I thought I may lose you. - Sat Nov 14 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Ouichi, Ryutaro whispers: No...It was...the situation.
Ouichi, Ryutaro whispers: I thought I may lose you. - Sat Nov 14 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I see. - Sat Nov 14 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she saw what Yosuke looked like. Rushing over to him she started to look to where his worst injuries were and already was ripping part of her arm off, literally.* - Sun Nov 15 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) narrowed her eyes and then she began to shove the piece of her into the hole found with her hand being covered in blood. Rapidly he would feel healing as it began to resort him and any other part of his body honestly as she sat beside him. Course the dislocated arm was going to have to be put back into place by a doctor or scientist.* - Sun Nov 15 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had never done this before to anyone, she just did what felt 'right'. Even -she- was surprised it worked, "I just... I just tried something?" Squinting some in hesitation.* - Sun Nov 15 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at his perfect skin that left not even a scar behind.* - Sun Nov 15 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Were you dying? - Sun Nov 15 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Got into a fight... - Sun Nov 15 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Honestly...I don't know what happened...There was this giant monster... - Sun Nov 15 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: All of a sudden I lost my cool. - Sun Nov 15 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But were you just dying? - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Some guy... - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Locked me in a Cage. - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And try to stab me. - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Well he -did- stab me. - Sun Nov 15 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: He tried to stab my face. - Sun Nov 15 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I dislocated my arm, and he stabbed my shoulder. - Sun Nov 15 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wasn't used to being dirty and stared at her hand with the blood and was tempted to lick it from her fingers but resisted.* - Sun Nov 15 04:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) || It was too late though he was leading her away and she tried to forget the blood covered hand as best she could. When he asked her the question she shook her head slowly and lowered her chin.* - Sun Nov 15 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was holding her hand out away from her like it was a dirty bag of trash currently and watched him get undressed but was iffy about her hand still. "Can we hurry?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sighed out as he finished wiping her hand clean and then stepped forward to get into the bath with him. She didn't need baths but it was just like swimming sort of when you sat in a pool of water any way she looked at it. "What happened though? Why were you fighting a monster?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had pulled shit off of course but the narrator was eating and distracted okay? Kay. She was indeed facing him and simply peered through the water towards his body. "Is what I did to you good?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "I didn't know I could either... It didn't feel anything different, it was seperate from me and not connected at that point. It acted on it's own to heal you and integrated into your body. It shouldn't do anything bad though."* - Sun Nov 15 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) leaned back in the tub to the point her back was against the edge and her hips shifted forward closer to him.* - Sun Nov 15 04:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't stop her foot from resting there, why would she? "What will you do to them?"* - Sun Nov 15 05:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't like looking at that form as much. - Sun Nov 15 13:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes but I stopped wearing those terrible small pieces you made me wear. - Sun Nov 15 13:25:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sun Nov 15 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You had all these clothes in here so I thought you wanted me to wear them. - Sun Nov 15 13:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It was optional, but I appreciate the consideration. - Sun Nov 15 13:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No I won't wear any anymore. - Sun Nov 15 13:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Like last time? - Sun Nov 15 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Yeah...But....can you use your feet this time..? I'm in the mood for something else...I like experimenting with you... - Sun Nov 15 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit at his request but then tried to use her feet to start massaging his manhood. She didn't know how because this wasn't something that was in the magazine but she tried. Her toes were wiggling around and squeezing while smooshing against the hard length between her curved arches.* - Sun Nov 15 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wondered if this was something to be embarrassed over since he was getting red in ways he hadn't with her in a while. She continued to massage and squish and tug gently as she played with his cock and then looked down at his balls and used some of her toes to toy with those but it was harder to do anything with them than with the hardened manhood. Going back to that she watched him carefully while pleasing him.* - Sun Nov 15 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched with interest because he enjoyed it so much. She didn't say anything, fake any breathing, or anything like that. She simply watched his pleasure and if she was human she might have been envious. Ume kept doing what he wanted trying to bring him to climax, when she didn't really even understand it.* - Sun Nov 15 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) craned her head to the side as she looked at the murky liquid making the water turn a foggy color. * - Sun Nov 15 14:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: T-That....was nice... - Sun Nov 15 14:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You liked it? - Sun Nov 15 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah. - Sun Nov 15 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared the head of his cock in the eye and then looked to his hand as it was extended. Taking it she stepped out of the water and stood beside him but was soon entirely dry without the need to dry off.* - Sun Nov 15 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt the cock against her but simply looked back at him when he pressed his forehead against her own. Staring back with wide red eyes...* - Sun Nov 15 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) heard his statement and then kissed him back but her eyes stayed open since he allowed her to be her weird self that didn't conform to stupid human habits of closing your eyes while kissing. That was something she liked about Yosuke, he wanted her to be herself, not just be something pretty and make her own choices. She could be a plain white clone looking thing and he would still enjoy her. "I always intend to make myself the ideal woman for you."* - Sun Nov 15 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes, "You do love me." That's all she could say, or think.* - Sun Nov 15 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You had to hesitate? - Sun Nov 15 14:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Hesitate...? It wasn't hesitation...I just never saw myself...Saying those words. - Sun Nov 15 14:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It was foreign.. - Sun Nov 15 14:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I see. - Sun Nov 15 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do you think... - Sun Nov 15 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I can hold you like this for a bit longer....Ume? - Sun Nov 15 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, you can hold me all you want. - Sun Nov 15 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...You are floating? - Sun Nov 15 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down, this was black magic.* - Sun Nov 15 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared down at him and found this odd but didn't question it again. Once she was sitting atop him her hands were placed on his chest as she sat there nude, likely with her sex pressed against his lower abdomen.* - Sun Nov 15 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought for a moment, "you bought a lot of scientists and offered me something no one else could, then stole me away from the world."* - Sun Nov 15 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You looked dangerous. - Sun Nov 15 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakata, Yosuke(Jjking217) says: Do I still? - Sun Nov 15 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Sun Nov 15 15:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was told sealing was bad. - Sun Nov 15 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakata, Yosuke(Jjking217) says: That belief has changed then? - Sun Nov 15 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Only dangerous when the man Sanoke uses it. - Sun Nov 15 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakata, Yosuke(Jjking217) says: That's probably a good belief. - Sun Nov 15 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ortho said the same thing. - Sun Nov 15 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked him over as she sat on his lap. "Where do you want to go when I'm free?"* - Sun Nov 15 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakata, Yosuke(Jjking217) says: Y - Sun Nov 15 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was talking to her plants of course.* - Mon Nov 16 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Normal. - Mon Nov 16 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Did you kill that scientist? - Mon Nov 16 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 16 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: He wanted me to tell you 'Sorry'. - Mon Nov 16 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: His corpse is in the morgue, if you want to eat it... - Mon Nov 16 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He felt sorry for trying to experiment badly on me? - Mon Nov 16 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 16 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Probably to save his life. - Mon Nov 16 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Are you hungry? - Mon Nov 16 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yes. - Mon Nov 16 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Let's go then. - Mon Nov 16 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was still naked by the by. She looked the body over and frowned slightly, "he didn't suffer then?"* - Mon Nov 16 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: He did. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: When you're stabbed through the heart. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You don't die instantly. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Your heart still pumps blood, but the bleeding become internal. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I did that once, I healed in two seconds. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: The blood stops flowing to your brain, which causes a stroke. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: He was in a lot of pain. - Mon Nov 16 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at him long and hard, "Good." Then she looked up to him, "are you sure you want to watch this?"* - Mon Nov 16 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) kissed him back with a peck since it was such a small kiss. She looked over the body and nodded before moving to his feet and then her jaw stretched like a snake's might unhinge. It stretched wider and wider as she began to move her mouth around both of his feet and pull him into her mouth. It looked exactly like what a constrictor might do with it's dead prey but she was a cute, sexy red head with pale skin...and naked. It took her a few minutes to fully get him into her body but it seemed like after he had passed her mouth he didn't bulge any part of her body at all. By the time his head had disappeared, hair and all, all those bones...everything, she was back to normal and licked her lips before looking up to Yosuke.* - Mon Nov 16 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at him wondering if she had scared him, "Are you alright?"* - Mon Nov 16 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "No one is enough, I don't have a particularly large craving." She looked at where the body used to be and wondered if that was wrong considering how much more she eats compared to humans.* - Mon Nov 16 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged towards him and looked up towards the man as she stood there buck naked in a cold morgue without a second thought. Surely guards and scientists were flushing, whispering, and staring when they came down here.* - Mon Nov 16 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to him, he seemed to like her massages after all.* - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about his question and replied bluntly, "You kind of are already sharing the room with me." She smiled faintly and then waited for him to tell her what he wanted her to massage, if he said nothing she would ask, "what do you want massaged?"* - Mon Nov 16 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: All of those are taken. - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: -mischan- - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then stepped towards his feet first and began to massage the nearest one. Taking her time to massage in a firm but gentle way with her extremely soft hands. Some would say that Yosuke was spoiling himself, taking advantage of Ume, and even a pervert for how he treated her and had her always pampering him. Ume just didn't care.* - Mon Nov 16 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) ran her fingers up his legs and back down to his foot, she didn't have to use lotions or oils due to how soft her hands were. It was like she was easily able to glide along anything with her body. She moved to the other foot then and continued the massage while watching him. "When will we do tests again?"* - Mon Nov 16 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to what he said, "yes I do want to train with you, I get bored in here only speaking to the plants." She didn't have a facial response to his question and moved up his legs to massage along his calves, and then thighs. She was working her way up pretty well and every time she massaged him she was getting better and better at it. She found a knot in his thigh at one point and then widened her eyes and rubbed it harder to see what it was because it probably hurt. "What is that?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked and then shrugged and moved on past it instead of messing with it because she didn't want to cause him pain.* - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had reached him groin and looked to him. "Do you want me to do that too?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at his groin and then moved past it for now since she figured a mess would hinder the full body massage. She massaged his sides and up towards his chest as she remembered licking and biting his nipples. Her eyes lingered on them as she thought about it but then she diverted them to other parts of his body.* - Mon Nov 16 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head to his question and then moved on to his shoulders and then arms. "I figured if I had to go out of the fort then you could  name me?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled back at him and then was massaging his hands gently with a bit of firmness. "What would you name this redhead?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thinks: A Thousand Questions. - Mon Nov 16 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) thought about it and then asked as she was trying to roll him over. "What does it mean?"* - Mon Nov 16 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Heh...that is certainly true then. - Mon Nov 16 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'm glad you like it. - Mon Nov 16 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) began to massage the back of his shoulders and neck with a bit more pressure than the front of his body.* - Mon Nov 16 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Is this normal? - Mon Nov 16 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Is what normal...? - Mon Nov 16 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Me massaging you so often. - Mon Nov 16 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Probably not by other people's standards.. - Mon Nov 16 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: But this might be 'our' normal. - Mon Nov 16 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh okay. - Mon Nov 16 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) moved her hands down his back so she was massaging his middle and lower back with a little more pressure than before since there was mostly bone here.* - Mon Nov 16 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) had of course laid next to him like she always did as he slept. Looking over to him as he awoke, also being naked of course. "Hello."* - Tue Nov 17 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) laid there as he rested his head against her chest, "Yes I know you do."* - Tue Nov 17 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Tue Nov 17 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: When do I ever so something fun? - Tue Nov 17 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I don't know. - Tue Nov 17 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: But. - Tue Nov 17 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 17 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Whn will the doctors come again? - Tue Nov 17 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: When* - Tue Nov 17 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: In a way. - Tue Nov 17 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: In a few* - Tue Nov 17 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I can call them now if you want. - Tue Nov 17 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 17 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) sat up on the bed naked after Yosuke kissed her on the cheek and looked up to the doctor. "No surprises this time," she didn't say it in a questioning manner at all.* - Tue Nov 17 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Tue Nov 17 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: That will work better. - Tue Nov 17 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) was surprised they had gotten something she could drink since that would be easier for her to process, considering when she ate the nutrients went to every part of her body that was present. Taking the vial and when it was told to her it would stimulate anger she looked towards Yosuke. The way he moved forward told her something might go wrong. "Do I need to lay down? Or... something?"* - Tue Nov 17 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) drank up the stuff and then sat there but nothing seemed to happen. "Maybe drinking it doesn't work?"* - Tue Nov 17 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then took the pink vial and swallowed it easily before handing back the empty vial. She felt dizzy suddenly which she didn't know what that was and laid back on the bed with a sigh. The sensation of the hormones going across her body and through it made her shudder and she peered up to Yosuke with eyes of longing. It was obvious that she was feeling the effects of the chemicals and slowly her hand reached out towards him. Course...that's when she started to turn pink all over.* - Tue Nov 17 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) tried to pull him in against her even as she was turning light pink all over her body. She had lost control of her substitution clearly and now was just a pink naked woman, weird. Pulling him in close to her she nuzzled her nose and face against his cheek before trying to kiss him with no care about the scientist watching.* - Tue Nov 17 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) kissed Yosuke deeper and then finally broke the kiss but kept her lips brushing against his as she whispered in a sweet endearing tone. "I never thought I could feel this way in a million years, here I am... laying here with you and feeling everything you feel for me. I love you, Yosuke." She couldn't -help- the words she was saying, even if she didn't really love him she thought she did.* - Tue Nov 17 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) nodded some and smiled as she kissed him again and rubbed her body against his in want of being as close to him as possible. "Yeah, silly... you act like you didn't know that already.~"* - Tue Nov 17 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) chuckled at him calling her the name he gave her. She spoke in a sing song whisper, "Your Chihiro.~" Then she kissed him deeply again.* - Tue Nov 17 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) allowed his tongue to travel past her lips and then groaned gently. Feeling how his tongue pressed against her own and past her lips she wrapped her arm around his torso to press herself as tightly as possible against him. She didn't have anymore words for what she was feeling.* - Tue Nov 17 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) could feel him growing hard between their two bodies but wasn't reaching down or anything like that, after all she wasn't lustful and for love all she really wanted right now was to kiss him and be close to him. Course that might be different for Yosuke as her kissing became deeper and more intimate.* - Tue Nov 17 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) was laying on the bed talking to the plants on a shelf directly above her head when more scientists than she had seen yet came into the room. They had tons of different tools and various types of chemicals with them and new methods of delivery. One of which was as far as a tub that looked big enough for Ume to climb into with large kegs of chemicals attached around the edges to fill it with.

Sitting up she looked at the scientists and then stared at the tub basin curiously, perhaps they found a better method than her drinking the serums. She questioned what was going on since Yosuke wasn't here but nothing was answered to her, the scientists simply told her to stay calm as they worked. A few of them had sharp objects and then would begin to cut away more material from her nude body and when she questioned why they needed more and so much they simply stated the last batch had been contaminated and could no longer be used.

Ume was fairly confused about everything going on since there were so many of them and guards standing outside the door peering in to keep an eye on if she might go haywire again and attack the scientists like last time. Once they had taken about three samples from her and asked her to switch back to her natural form rather than the red head beauty she morphed and then looked at the basin as it began to fill with a dark blue liquid brew of chemicals. "What is that?" She wasn't answered but instead guided to get into the basin, things were starting to get out of hand and Ume was worried about what they were attempting to do to her.* - Wed Nov 18 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was lowered down into the basin and then the fully bubbling heated chemicals began to seep into her body. The chemical was made to exhibit the emotion 'shame' within Ume's body and create a sensation that would remind her of past actions and possibly future actions.* - Wed Nov 18 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) could feel the shame begin to channel through her body. She looked around and then realized that all these people were looking at her while she was naked. Her hands came up to cover her body and her legs pulled in against her lower body to hide herself as she peered around. Some of the scientists rose their brows and wrote notes while others chuckled and whispered to each other while looking her over. They were mocking her, they were trying to make her feel ashamed. "I-i want you all to l-leave..." the scientists ignored her and two of them tried to pick her up out of the chemical bath and then held her standing there in the middle of the room as everyone looked her over in all her nudity as she dripped with the blue chemical.

Her head lowered down and she trembled as they treated her like a piece of meat to be inspected but luckily for her the shame didn't go much further than that so her past was safe concerning Ortho and Yosuke. Eventually it wore off and she was released as the scientist's prepped the next chemical bath.* - Wed Nov 18 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was forced back into the basin as a dark purple chemical was filled to nearly the brim. She was forced in and this time they hand cuffed her into the basin due to what they were going to be using on her. The serum being a mixture for 'cruelty' as they were trying all the tough ones first. As it began to sink into her body she could feel as it forced her to jerk her hand against the handcuffs, she knew how to get out of them but instead she began to curse the names of the scientists and tell them terrible things she was going to do to them when she got free. Some of them started crying or even left but the ones with more resolve stayed and examined her. Seeing that the effects were sticking around for longer they took her out of the basin and released her before rolling all the gear out and leaving until it might wear off. If it hadn't wore off by the next day they wouldn't care much and continue their research, mixing her emotions together in the process....* - Wed Nov 18 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had been left in her room to deal with her own terrible thoughts. She had ended up tearing apart her plants nigh all but one in her attempt to be terrible towards their spirits. She didn't regret it either as she stared at them and was being cruel to the last of the plants, even going as far as not watering it for the day or allowing it the UV lamp to keep it perked up. The scientists noted all of this down in their research and came in with another group of serums to be tested.

This time around there was a variety of screw ups, bad reactions, and duds, all ending up with in the end cruelty and hate sticking around. At this point she had to be held down and contained to conduct the experiments and it ended with her being restrained to the bed when they left so she couldn't try anything. They also changed out her door to be air tight so she couldn't get out through the cracks with any of her cells. Yes, they had figured out she could stay alive with a single cell through their research. They also had figured out that if she was only a single cell and that was destroyed it could kill her if she didn't have at least one cell left to regenerate. They had been testing with different versions of her from growing the parts they took off of her how to kill her in various ways.

Of course, Ume could feel all of this because they were growing her bodies into full corporeal form that could communicate.* - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had been enduring days on end of torture essentially. All the scientists were busy with her clones but every day on the dot they came in at the same time. She was planning on this in fact, waiting for the scientists to enter she flicked her gaze to the one that seemed to be in charge every day for the last few weeks. The cruelty and hate was still within Ume's body but it had started to wear off and she could sort of control it's bursts of aggression. Slipping her hands out of the binds on the bed since she could morph her body, she quickly gripped the scientist by the throat and pulled him down on top of her. The other scientists who were still wheeling in the basin with chemical kegs and such froze and some even fled the area. It seemed she was trying to fully devour the lead scientist without hesitation even while he was alive.

The struggling from him did nothing as she swallowed him down and his body was broken down into cells to mingle with her own. Rising from the bed, still nude of course, she flicked her gaze about at the remaining scientists who were calling for the guards. She rushed through them and through the halls. Being able to avoid them as her body broke off in pieces as they tried to grab her, she was only reforming what she could to stay put together and running as she searched for an area that was capable of being opened from the outside. Most of the doors she peered into the small windows had scientists or guards on the other side but finally she came to the cells of other patients and slipped inside the first sealed room. Locking herself inside with the patient of room thirteen...

No breathing was emitted, no adrenaline, only listening at the door in the nude as she held her hands against the door and her ear against the crack, even if it was sealed air tight. She could hear guards rushing by and for now she would have time to think of a plan on how to get out of here so she could find Yosuke. Turning slowly to look at what she had locked herself in the room with, her sunflower yellow gaze scanned the room over to see what was filling it's walls.* - Thu Nov 19 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sniffed the air and could hear him breathing. The room was white and bare except for the chains and Thirteen's own body. She slowly walked towards him keeping her footsteps entirely silent, even he would not hear them as she approached and then walked over the chain and behind him and then over the opposite chain and in front of him again. Of course considering she was nude if he was watching her he was basically going to see everything there was to see about her from top to bottom, but let's be fair, that never stopped Ume. 

She came to crouching in front of him with her legs only slightly spread and looked deep into his eyes as she thought in the back of her head what cruel things she could do to a chained up human. He didn't -feel- human though, something about him told her he was different. Then she looked at the black on the walls and sniffed again and walked over to one of the dried splatters. Staring at it and leaning in to inhale directly next to it before extending her long light pink tongue out and licking over the surface to taste what she believed to be organic material of some sort.* - Thu Nov 19 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked several times and her tongue made a weird smacking motion with no sound as she felt around the oily blood. She walked back over and crouched in front of him again, she crouched there in silence once again watching him without a word, studying him. She took note of his hungered state, she looked to see if he had been trying to get out of his chains, his cleanliness, all of these factors were being taken into account as she stared him down.* - Thu Nov 19 15:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wondered why he didn't speak. She leaned in further until she was only a few centimeters away from his nose with her own and stared into his eyes. Whispering out in the lowest whisper she could manage, "Are you human?"* - Thu Nov 19 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 's nostrils flared and there was cruelty in her gaze from the fact he hadn't answered her. She only let it reveal itself for a moment before closing her eyes and gathering herself. Opening her eyes again she looked upon him with the same emotionless expression as before. "No," she paused and pointed at the black blood. "That's blood, but not red... You aren't human... or at least you aren't a normal one." She looked him over again, "you look human, you do not taste human...." She reached out gently and touched his arm that was out stretched and a surge of chakra went through her as she copied him and then transformed into a mirror image of himself so she could understand what he was.* - Thu Nov 19 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) could fully understand him now and then morphed back into her normal self quickly and whispered in the same hushed voice. "You are human... mostly."* - Thu Nov 19 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I've never seen a human.... with so little expression. - Thu Nov 19 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times at him not enjoying being called human. "Do you wish to believe you are not human like me? With all things considered you are so drastically .... manipulated that you very well could be considered something else. Nothing I have seen.... or tasted."* - Thu Nov 19 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked at him not wanting to be categorized. "You wish to be alone? Not like anything else? Is that why you do not have any expression? Because those you see around you hold expressions?"* - Thu Nov 19 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "Do you have emotions and chose not to express them?"* - Thu Nov 19 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe. - Thu Nov 19 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if I told you, I'm in this very place attempting to gain emotions from lacking them entirely. - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That is suppose to be funny....right? - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It is.. - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You find things funny? - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No, I just know...That's how it should be. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's ironic. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, yes -thats- the word. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Emotions are funny.... - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought I would like them. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You thought? Has that belief changed. - Thu Nov 19 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ?* - Thu Nov 19 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was making strange hand gestures by now and touching the side of her face or combing her fingers through her hair occasionally while looking at him. Clearly she was starting to lose herself to this place. "They hurt, not just aquiring them but right now nothing would make me more satisfied than to cause you pain but that doesn't make sense. I don't know you, you are helpless.... chained, I do not like it very much."* - Thu Nov 19 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked at him and leaned in, "are you a captive? Is that why the chains? I am not a captive.... I don't think." She frowned slightly. "Yosuke has not come back to see me in a very long time, I worry where he might be, it grows to seem as if I am a captive..." She eased her brow and looked into his eyes. "Who put you in here? -Why- are you in here?"* - Thu Nov 19 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "you were born here yet you feel the drive to leave. You do feel emotion."* - Thu Nov 19 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you want to leave if you do not what lays outside of this place? - Thu Nov 19 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if the world is terrible. - Thu Nov 19 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if it burns. - Thu Nov 19 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if the world wants to kill you. - Thu Nov 19 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's simple. - Thu Nov 19 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll just kill it first. - Thu Nov 19 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Interesting. - Thu Nov 19 17:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What will you want to do when you leave? - Thu Nov 19 17:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't know. I don't intend to leave right away. - Thu Nov 19 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why is that? - Thu Nov 19 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There's much I can do here before I leave. - Thu Nov 19 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Such as? - Thu Nov 19 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Control my Captors... - Thu Nov 19 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Have my fun with them...Until I get bored. - Thu Nov 19 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....I see. - Thu Nov 19 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned slightly, "who all does things to you? You can't mean all of them in this building."* - Thu Nov 19 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't know their names. - Thu Nov 19 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They never told me. - Thu Nov 19 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How many? - Thu Nov 19 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I've been here for....Sixteen years. - Thu Nov 19 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Countless. - Thu Nov 19 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well.... - Thu Nov 19 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if I made things better for you. - Thu Nov 19 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And eventually got you the freedom to leave. - Thu Nov 19 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: When I leave? - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can't kill everyone though. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They are useful. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ... - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Some are okay. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I want to kill some too. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That'd... - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Fine...For now. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I ate the one hurting me the most a few minutes before coming in your room. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Should I not have said that? - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You eat people? - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think I can eat you though. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You taste different. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think you would make me feel slow. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) leaned forward and tried to lick his cheek, long and slow.* - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) did another silent tongue smacking and shook her head. "No, I don't think I would enjoy eating you. And that is a good thing or I would probably eat you now... you are so very helpless... and these ... chemicals inside of me are still insistant on causing you torture but I suppose I will get over them eventually, or perhaps they are going to stick around... I am not certain, the scientists have stopped answering my questions."

She flicked her tongue against her upper lip again, "You taste wrong... you taste like nothing I've tasted before... so many minerals, far too many minerals for a human..."* - Thu Nov 19 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked at him saying they should get her answers. "What answers?" She then paused as he spoke again, "Ume."* - Thu Nov 19 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It means plum. - Thu Nov 19 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked slowly once more and looked his chains over, "I know what they are doing to me, and what they plan. It is what I asked them to do but they have become... ruthless in their efforts with Yosuke no longer present." She then stood and looked at the binding on his left wrist and tested the metal to see what kind it was.* - Thu Nov 19 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood back and then formed handseals and through the ground of the room came earthen spikes that broke through the ground and thrust through a link in the chain, breaking it off. Another one also did so to the other side so that he only had the cuffs and a small length of chain links hanging off. "That is the best I can do without harming you. It likely will have alarmed guards though... so they will be here soon." She looked at the door, "I don't think I can break that door, it's air tight or I would be able to get to the other side... they want to keep me locked in wherever I go so they switched out all the doors in the building."* - Thu Nov 19 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked as she saw him stumble and without even waiting for him to ask she already had caught him in her grasp and held him up with her arm around his ribs and his arm pulled over her shoulder. "You can't do anything to the guards, you are too weak..... look at you. There is no need for acting out against them right now, I could easily act against them but I want to know where Yosuke has gone and so I'm going to use you as leverage. Do you understand?" She was already watching the door and reaching up towards Thirteen's neck with her free hand.* - Thu Nov 19 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) cannot feel differences in heat or cold so she didn't notice. As the door opened she looked upon the guards but there were no scientists present at the moment. She looked them over and instantly they were holding up their hands to show they weren't trying to cause any harm as she held her hand about the boy's neck. "Ume-san, why are you acting out this way. Are you unhappy with the treatments?" She squinted at them, they were being so...nice, polite even. It didn't make sense. She didn't respond to their questions and instead asked her own, "where is Yosuke?" Her grip tight on the boy's throat in apperance but not at all close to hurting him.* - Thu Nov 19 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) squinted, "I'm not releasing the boy until you answer at least one of my questions. Where is Yosuke?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) swayed back and forth and released the boy from her hold as she fell to her knee's. The last thing she had felt in front of Yosuke was love and currently she was feeling cruelty and hate...all of that was being channeled now towards Ortho. Her head was swaying back and forth as she trembled and tried to make sense of what the guard was saying. * - Thu Nov 19 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shot her eyes up to the guard that said they were at her service and her eye twitched. "You are at my service? Where were you when the scientists were shaming me... or when they were hurting me? When they were tearing me apart and cloning me? Where were you with all of that? I know Yosuke didn't approve any of that, he was always present for any of my experiments and they started to turn ugly when he wasn't there." She glanced over to the boy being held down roughly, "let him go."* - Thu Nov 19 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt her rage growing and had to stand up and walk in a pace around in circles. "Was the man I ate the one who told you that?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly and walked in a pace still as she could feel the rage boiling inside of her. "These damn emotions, why did it have to be these -right now-!" She screamed out as her hands came up to her head and she forced her head against the corner of the room for a moment trying to calm her hate for the situation. 

She then pointed towards Thirteen, "This boy, what is he doing here? Why was he held here since birth?" She was trying to keep it together so chose to focus on his issue currently.* - Thu Nov 19 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Tester. - Thu Nov 19 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What does that mean? - Thu Nov 19 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Experimental drugs... - Thu Nov 19 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Modifications.. - Thu Nov 19 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Stuff the Scientists didn't want Yosuke knowing about.. - Thu Nov 19 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...... - Thu Nov 19 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yosuke wasn't aware he -existed-? - Thu Nov 19 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: :N-No Ma'am. - Thu Nov 19 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ......right. - Thu Nov 19 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned heavily now and looked over towards Thirteen, "do you have a name at least?" She found it strange he hadn't said his name after asking her's. She was focusing soley on him.* - Thu Nov 19 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) narrowed her gaze, "right.... this is just....ngng... they aren't touching him anymore, not unless he wants something done to him. And why are they feeding him so poorly, and why is he chained? He's so skinny and in a air locked room and they see the need to chain him? Not only that but you hold him down after I released him like he was some threat!" She sighed heavily as she paced about in her nudity as always not caring about how they stared at her and found it hard to get around. "The scientists who work on him, how many are there?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head, "really.... a hundred.... a -hundred- people were torturing this boy and Yosuke knew nothing?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right... - Thu Nov 19 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The other ones, how important are they? - Thu Nov 19 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Guard: Only one is of general...'importance'.. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What is important about them? - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Guard: They head the Science Section, they're also one of the leading developers. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right right.... - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Put him under lock and key from now on. - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The others.... - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over at Thirteen, "let him kill them."* - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over towards Thirteen, "we will get you some food after you have done with them what you like, they won't be able to fight back. The guards will make sure of that."* - Thu Nov 19 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) twitched her lips to the side. "Because I just lost the only two reasons for me wanting emotions."* - Thu Nov 19 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards him, "I remember when I learned how to walk, it takes time." She said this like it was perfectly normal and soon after the guards returned with the scientists who looked terrified and were bound with arms behind their backs.* - Thu Nov 19 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you mind....If I take my time with this? - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn, I don't mind at all. - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you want me to leave? - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can stay. - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay, I would like to watch. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This meal will be my thanks to you. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This...-Feast-. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) bit down hard on her lip at what he said.* - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched and had trouble holding still through the whole ordeal. The guards had long ago stepped out and sat outside because the screams were too much for them. She watched from sitting on the ground and saw what he was doing to them but not understanding what he was doing since she had never experienced genjutsu herself. She was very curious now if it would cause her pain like the chemicals had but didn't voice this for now. She watched and watched until they were all dead and then looked to Thirteen as if for approval to eat them.* - Thu Nov 19 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) instantly darted towards the scientists and began her routine of widening her mouth like a constrictor and then swallowed the bodies whole one by one without altering her form at all. When she was finished she lay on the ground with a 'high' look as her lids were half open.* - Thu Nov 19 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I don't think I've ever eaten that much before. - Thu Nov 19 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) found the gesture of his hand on her forehead strange but didn't stop him. Her skin was of course unnaturally soft as always as she laid naked on the ground in the blood. How he was petting her hair also wasn't stopped and she found it interesting that someone with no emotions was enjoying taking part in petting another person, thing? Right. "Yes... now I have to ask you. Is there something you want from the people here to do for you? You said you didn't want to go immediately so what is it you want?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled some and peered up to him. "I said the same thing before I came here, so does that mean you will stay, at least until I leave this place? Apparently I own it now so we can leave whenever but.... it's faster if I stay here, that's why I haven't left." She smiled up to him more in anticipation that perhaps she had a new companion, Ume felt very lost for now. "I could get them to set up two rooms next to each other with a glass wall between? Tell them to bring you things from the outside that you want or might enjoy? The only thing I usually care about is plants... but I destroyed mine when I was upset.... I will have to get more. I like clothes too sometimes, my friends liked dressing me up."* - Thu Nov 19 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh and swimming! - Thu Nov 19 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared up at him in wonder, "You are able to read?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah...I wasn't always chained up like this. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They taught me to read and write. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Are you not able to? - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, what did you do that made them chain you up? - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: People always read to me. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: One of them....The one who was my care taker... - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: She angered me about Ten years ago...I don't even remember what happened. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I used that technique on her. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And she curled into a ball on the floor and never uncurled. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And I can. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It didn't kill them. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No my emotions are not real. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well... - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The 'fear' can cause them to seize. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Or have heart attacks. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I would like to experience this some time. - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You could die... - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I cannot die. - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What? - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't die. - Thu Nov 19 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared up at him as he pet her head. She wondered why he hadn't spazzed out about her softness yet like others do.* - Thu Nov 19 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The scientists said that I regenerate too fast to die. - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Regenerate...To fast? - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You want to stay in the same room as me though? That is okay with you? I thought that wasn't normal. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yosuke stayed in my room but he loved me. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Why wouldn't it be okay? - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's an emotion. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm...Really? - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Apparently the strongest one. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's when you would do anything for a person, even die for them. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Which... I'm worried is exactly what he did. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I believe pain is the strongest Emotion in that case. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Pain is not an emotion..... - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shuddered lightly remembering what the scientists had done to her.* - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It should be. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no it shouldn't. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ..just something they did to me. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I will have them put stuff in there for you. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Stuff? - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A bed, clothing, books, anything else that male's your age get. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You tend not to be picky when you spend ten years chained up and fed liquids. - Thu Nov 19 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Males my age? - Thu Nov 19 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We will get you lots of things to look at and choose from. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: When you don't like something we can take it away. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't need to ever thank me. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you like to go now? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh right. - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Does my nudity bother you like it does the guards and scientists? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I haven't decided. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And we can go. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood up and knocked on the door. The guards opened it and started to lead the two of them back to her room but they removed the cuffs from Thirteen's wrist's first. "Bring him lots and lots of food, and you make sure to bring him books, lots and lots of books, and clothes that aren't all white and boring, and also stuff that boy's his age like in the world. I don't know what, but think of something. Also bring me more plants, mine are dead. And next time the scientists get out of hand it will be one of your lives I take, along with their's." She looked at them seriously before walking the rest of the way to her room.* - Thu Nov 19 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) pointed towards the room off of her's which was connected from the inside. "Yes, go bathe if you like, you smell strange." She walked over and sat down on her bed and waited as the guards were going to get the most basic things first like a bed, clothes, and such for the boy. The other things would take a few days of course to aquire. "Nudity doesn't bother me, but I've been told I am rude and stare."* - Thu Nov 19 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and stood up to walk into the bathroom with him. As predicted...she stared -hard- at everything he had to offer.* - Thu Nov 19 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had stared at his groin for quite a while, then his ass, and finally the brand. She reached out and ran her fingers over the brand curiously before sitting on a stool beside the tub and watching him. "I am not a very exciting person in my own opinion, but many have believed me to be interesting. If I am alone I usually talk to my plants or just think. Course when others are around I usually do what they want to do."* - Thu Nov 19 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched curiously as he jumped and then already was trying to do what all the others did. "You do have some humanity in you then... you are trying to make me happy when it's not possible."* - Thu Nov 19 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head to his question, "no. Not at all, to give myself a scent I have to go through great lengths to make it stick."* - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "swimming, training, traveling, playing games, talking, sometimes they do pre-fertilization activities, they find those the most interesting."* - Thu Nov 19 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Humans call it sex. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What is it like? - Thu Nov 19 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To me, because I do not have a nervous system, it feels like a lot of pressure. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But humans enjoy it. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They seem more relaxed afterwards. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have to try it some time. - Thu Nov 19 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you will find someone to perform it with. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, Maybe. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What types of games have you played? - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Usually they have to do with the pre-fertilization. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes question games. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ...I see. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Question games? - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you have been locked in a room for a long time. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So that wouldn't really do much. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You also don't seem like someone who gets nervous by being naked  so.... these games are pointless. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We can probably make new games. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Any ideas? - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You seem to like giving pain but I can't feel pain. - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We will think of something that you enjoy. - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Sounds good. - Thu Nov 19 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Could I ask you a favor though? - Thu Nov 19 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Teach me, about your body. About you, and about the world/ - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ?* - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: About me and my body? - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down at herself.* - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yes.. - Thu Nov 19 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Your body differs from my own. - Thu Nov 19 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's because I appear female. - Thu Nov 19 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't really know much about my body. - Thu Nov 19 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I just know that they like touching me. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ..Interesting. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But we shouldn't focus on that. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
