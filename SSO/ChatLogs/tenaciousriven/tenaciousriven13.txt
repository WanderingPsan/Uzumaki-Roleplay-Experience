<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned around and felt her eye twitching as she looked around the room and they were all threatening each other. "SHUT UP!" screamed out in a manic voice.* - Thu Nov 26 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yet I captured you in my shadow. - Thu Nov 26 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Right, right. - Thu Nov 26 21:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: -- - Thu Nov 26 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt her body being tugged down by the chains. She was well aware of how Thirteen fought but that didn't stop the fact he had managed to come into control of her body. She struggled against the bindings and didn't understand why he had locked her down as well... she had never been under his genjutsu before but she knew it's full capability to the point of being able to kill a person from breaking their mind alone. She screamed out and struggled against the binds as she tried to force her hands together for the seal to break her chakra flow but it was no use, she couldn't get her hands together. 

"Thirteen! Don't you kill him, I don't want him dead!" She wanted to say something that would go against him being her 'owner' but she knew that would only enrage him more and he just might kill Hokori to prove a point to her. She only had to hope that her want alone for Hokori to remain alive would be enough.* - Thu Nov 26 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head down and fell silent as she was ordered to quiet down. She didn't want to do what he said in that instant but thought it was best if she keep herself under control or she might crack again.* - Thu Nov 26 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm more of a man that you'll EVER be. - Thu Nov 26 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Fuck you and your wannabe 'master' ass. - Thu Nov 26 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You will always be a better man than me. - Thu Nov 26 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Oh shut up. - Thu Nov 26 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Nice. - Thu Nov 26 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm no kiss-up like you. - Thu Nov 26 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I'm not a kiss-up? I earned my position. - Thu Nov 26 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: But that's how you want to be, that's fine too. - Thu Nov 26 22:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: + - Thu Nov 26 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked around the room as only her eyes could shift with her chin being risen higher and higher as the choker held her neck at the furthest it would stretch at the moment. She didn't choke or seem bothered by it other than the factor of degradation... She didn't want to look at Thirteen or Horoki. She didn't feel a reason to say sorry either though to Horoki because she legitamately couldn't feel it. She saw all the guards incapacitated and knew she couldn't stop Thirteen so she allowed him to have his moment... not like she could stop him. In the past she had wondered about his power over the mind and if it could control her, clearly she was wrong about Thirteen. He was not a good owner.* - Thu Nov 26 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Wow. - Thu Nov 26 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: That was pretty hard core. - Thu Nov 26 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt him touching her cheek and heard him speaking, she had no feeling to even be numb to the situation. She certainly had a few emotions and since he had not yet earned her 'love' he in turn had easily earned the 'hate' she had. Deep down she hated Thirteen now for stripping a potential friend from her... not only that? He had stolen everything from her. Not only what she owned, but Thirteen himself belonged to -her-. Everyone here belonged to her, they were essentially slaves to her will yet he had taken it all, all but her name on the contract. He might have the power to control her body from moving, might even pretend to be the leader right now but he would pay dearly in the future if he didn't play his cards right. 

She felt herself released and her body fell to the ground, she didn't bother to put in the little effort to stand. She rather just sit there on the ground, and all she had to say to Thirteen was simple. "You killed one of my friends...." her words were laced with hate but were also soft and close to her blank tone from when he first met her. She did not sound like Yuriko.. but instead Ume.* - Thu Nov 26 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He killed someone that was -mine-. - Thu Nov 26 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No one kills my friends unless I want them dead. - Thu Nov 26 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Thirteen. - Thu Nov 26 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked and when her eyes had reopened the focus was off to the side on the ground. She said nothing, did nothing, her expression neutralized and she removed all of her feelings down to only hate remaining in her gaze that she tried to keep off of him.* - Thu Nov 26 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) couldn't feel the pain but her head did turn to the side, Yori likely believed that she had really been hurt if he was paying attention. She drug her eyes up to look at him, "I wasn't speaking anymore. Yes..... I understand. Completely." Then her eyes looked away once more.* - Thu Nov 26 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) reached for his hand slowly and took it, it was easy for her to control herself right now... only because of the thoughts she was having for the future. She was probably going to give him one chance.... one chance to fix this, but if he continued on the path he was on she would have to end it. Even if it meant burning everything Yosuke left her to the ground.* - Thu Nov 26 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was led away.* - Thu Nov 26 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood inside the room as he told her to strip. She removed her clothing efficently, not with any sexual way or in a fast pace at all. She let them drop to the ground and walked over to the dirt and then looked at how he was sitting on it. She -really- didn't want to sit on top of the fresh sprouted babies.... they were barely getting growth to go to the surface. -His- weight was the problem, she knew he was crushing them under the ground...hurting them. She on the other hand was too light to do that, so she stepped up and sat in front of him with her legs folded under her bottom and hands in her lap staring down at her hands.* - Fri Nov 27 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) roser her head and eyes to look at him straight into  his gaze. "Are you giving me permission to speak on what you do not wish me to speak of ever again?" Her expression was completely blank outside of the hate in her eyes.* - Fri Nov 27 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ...Ume. - Fri Nov 27 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) continued to look into his eyes, "I think what you did was presumptuious and immature... you assumed something you didn't like happened, all because I asked questions of a guard I found to be my friend. Questions I have had since the beginning of taking a new owner. I was going to ask someone eventually, were you just going to kill whoever answered my questions? Even though -I- own them? I owned that guard and you killed him even though I didn't want him dead. I own everything here and you are taking it all. It was a gift from Yosuke to me, you are my owner...and I accepted you because I expected you to be a good owner. I gave you a -life-, I gave you -freedom- and you repay me with this. When you had me bound, I never thought you would do that in the way that you did, I thought you'd never use your power like that against me and then you directly did something I didn't want to happen and then showed your true colors. If there had been any guards in that room that were free of your power. I would have ordered you put back in your cell, not only for my own good but the good of anyone else I come to befriend or prefer to live. I was wrong to think you were human."* - Fri Nov 27 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) simply stated, "I think you are full of shit."* - Fri Nov 27 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard his words and wondered if it was true that he would give her this opportunity but she understood. "I accept...." her eyes focused on his own as she shifted and motioned over onto his lap. She didn't really know how he meant so she tried to look for direction on how to lay. Figuring he would help her she would then lay across his lap with her cheek against the dirt.* - Fri Nov 27 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) remained still as he felt over her curves. She still looked like Yuriko even as he had been refering to her as Ume. "Gives me a purpose.... takes care of me... makes sure I am 'right'... complete... trains me... anything that includes emotions... is new, so I don't know what to expect out of an emotion filled relation between owner and me."* - Fri Nov 27 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes as he started to touch her and she felt the shame growing and tried to ignore it and focus on her hate. She said nothing as he spoke and figured he would go about having his 'fun' with her body he enjoyed so much... after all it was made for -him-.* - Fri Nov 27 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt him applying the pressure but didn't open her eyes or even dare to move. "I am filled with too much hate to consent.... but I don't believe you will hold back either, I find you pretending to care about my wants a rather childish attempt to manipulate me."* - Fri Nov 27 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) simply lay there as she felt the shame flooding her as he pressed his finger inside of her. "You realize... that if you do not intiate ever, then it will never happen. I have no -desire- for those things, they are a human thing to enjoy."* - Fri Nov 27 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) couldn't hold back her body trembling as he did this, it was impossible for her not to feel ashamed of what she was allowing him to do when she hated him so much. Knowing he got pleasure mentally from what he was doing to her... not to mention her backside was extremely tight.... "What are you trying to prove...."* - Fri Nov 27 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) tensed as he forced into her so invasiley and another heavy shudder went through her body as she couldn't hold still now. Shifting uncomfortably atop his lap as she kept her eyes closed. "You -just- said you were trying to prove something to me by not doing anything with me... even though you are doing things to me as you say the words."* - Fri Nov 27 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shuddered all the while as he was pulling the finger out. When he finally had released her she stopped shaking and sat up beside him with her legs folded under her body, she felt violated but her expression remained neutral and her eyes hateful but the edges were showing her shame. "There would be no point to wait for sleep, I can kill you any time I want."* - Fri Nov 27 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Because an owner is not easy to find. - Fri Nov 27 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'd like to not lose another...even if it seems that I will. - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: After all this, I'm still your owner? - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There was a conflict...but I know that if I didn't have emotions, I wouldn't have cared. - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It would have been any other day. - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I might have even looked at how you were controlling me, and learned from it. - Fri Nov 27 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Instead.... hate began to cloud my mind. - Fri Nov 27 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You will not lose me, Unless you, yourself kill me, Yuriko. - Fri Nov 27 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Not anytime soon at least. - Fri Nov 27 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you want me so much..... - Fri Nov 27 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had lowered her head and wasn't looking at him. It was instinctual.* - Fri Nov 27 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Key.... - Fri Nov 27 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why didn't you listen to me when I asked you not to kill him.... - Fri Nov 27 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Anger. - Fri Nov 27 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Jealousy. - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He only talked to me.... - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't understand. - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I have talked to many people in this world. - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I felt like... - Fri Nov 27 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The cause for your curiosity, was him. That he was trying to steal you, when you suggest I allow him to take you outside. - Fri Nov 27 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He was the cause of my curiousity being displayed, but it was always there....  - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I just wished. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You named me a girl of a thousand questions for a reason. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You came to me. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I couldn't ask you... - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You could ask me everything. If you wanted. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I couldn't ask you if an owner says he loves you if he really means it. - Fri Nov 27 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And if an owner enjoys negative emotions for yourself if that was a bad or a good thing. - Fri Nov 27 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or that your owner demands you do something and take everything away from him... if that's right. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe I was wrong about the entire situation. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't have normal emotions even. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I had to see what a human thought. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah, but that's the thing. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned her head and looked at him with those hate filled eyes, "It doesn't matter anymore does it? Because you did kill him."* - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked back out in front of her, "also it irritates me that you are sitting on my baby plants... you are hurting them, that is very 'rude'." She thought she was using that word correctly anyway. "Are you really not pretending? It felt like how you acted out there when you were in control of everyone...when you killed him, that felt like the -real- you."* - Fri Nov 27 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why did he go sit all the way over there? Maybe I upset him. - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What feels the most right? - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That makes him killing the guard even worse. - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Domination. - Fri Nov 27 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I like the feeling....Of complete and utter domination of my opponent. - Fri Nov 27 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I also enjoy slow times. - Fri Nov 27 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Opponent.... - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you view me as your opponent? - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I do, at times. - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're someone... - Fri Nov 27 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I can never defeat. - Fri Nov 27 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No matter how hard I try, or what tactics I use. - Fri Nov 27 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That isn't -exactly- true...but I worry what he would do if he knew how to kill me. - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If you could kill me. - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or is it because you can't hurt me? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If you could hurt me... would you hurt me? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because, I can't hurt you, I can't kill you. - Fri Nov 27 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm so drawn to you. - Fri Nov 27 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I could die, could hurt... would you find me uninteresting? - Fri Nov 27 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or not have me as your d--....pet... - Fri Nov 27 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you, could die, and could hurt. I'm not sure, You'd be another human with Unique abilities. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Come closer, Yuriko. I won't bite. It was out of line, calling you my pet. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're my doll. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him and then stood since what he said was technically an order. She walked over and sat in front of him with her legs folded under her rump. "Why is pet a bad thing? I never heard that word used the way you used it before."* - Fri Nov 27 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And why do you recant it now? - Fri Nov 27 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) muttered, "I guess that is what I am besides a doll.... am I wrong?" * - Fri Nov 27 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had to lower her gaze when he looked up to her after those words. She rubbed her lips inward against each other and remained silent.* - Fri Nov 27 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: It feels like he already does a lot of that... at least some of it figuratively. - Fri Nov 27 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -omit- - Fri Nov 27 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and then looked up to him and moved her legs out from under herself and onto his lap.* - Fri Nov 27 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't really believe him but watched his hands on her legs and felt the pressure going on. "Am I still allowed to say whatever I want right now?"* - Fri Nov 27 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What would happen...this is just me saying a what if.... not that I want it or that it is going to happen. What would you do if I didn't want to be your doll anymore? If I wanted to take back what is mine... - Fri Nov 27 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him still, "a decision to do what?"* - Fri Nov 27 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To let you continue, or Leave. - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That is what you'd do? - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Leave? - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you really believe in that? - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you didn't need me. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or would you try to take over me. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: -Make- me do what you wanted. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You and I both know. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd want to do that. - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you? - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd want revenge, to hurt you probably. - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But at the end of the day. - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I know, I can't kill you, or hurt you So I'd like to say I'd think of a different way to protect my interests. - Fri Nov 27 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Such as? - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Sucking it up, no matter how long it took. Playing the part. - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Until an opening presented itself. - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that the answer you desired? - Fri Nov 27 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The only answer I ever desire is the truth. - Fri Nov 27 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And, what about my offer, Yuriko? - Fri Nov 27 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Which offer? - Fri Nov 27 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: From this point on, to strive to be the Owner you desire, and you to be the woman I desire. - Fri Nov 27 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To work past this. - Fri Nov 27 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: We can try. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I agreed to giving you a month. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Course... - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You could always just end up pretending.... - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A month isn't very young and then once that month is up you could change. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then a year. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Let's head back to our room. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ..okay. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: A year is no different - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He could pretend forever if he needed to...he said so himself. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was carried off and for now she was calmed and neutral but feeling strange... She had a few bits of dirt here and there from him making her sit on the dirt but that was it. "What is that?"* - Fri Nov 27 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him as he undressed and then frowned some, "you seem to keep forgetting that it doesn't give me anything to do these things..... it's all pleasure for you... so I don't see how this is owed to me."* - Fri Nov 27 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned and sat up with irritation, "it's agrivating that you think you can fix killing a friend of mine so easily."* - Fri Nov 27 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Because you took away any opportunity for me to learn from him.s - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: You took away that I might one day care about him. - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You took away that I might one day care about him. - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You took away that he had an emotion no one else has ever shown me and it was so calming and I wanted that emotion and he was the only one who had it. - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I understand a bit more now, - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him and then reached for his hand, she was acting like everything was perfectly normal.* - Fri Nov 27 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) when their hands touched a single cell that was not able to be noticed or sensed was transfered on his body, for safety guarentee.

She walked into the room with him as they picked up the water cans and she took it from him and then walked around the garden and began to water. "I don't name plants, plants do not require names."* - Fri Nov 27 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded faintly to him and had only looked up to him while she was nodding. She finished her half, of course her's was done perfectly, unless he mimicked her's then his wouldn't be as perfect due to lack of communication with the plants. "What are we doing today?"* - Fri Nov 27 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly to what he said while looking up to him, it was almost as if she was behaving -exactly- like he wanted without flaw now, when in the past her emotions sometimes made her misbehave. When he took her can she handed it off to him and switched on the UV light for the day. Stepping in front of him now, "I did still want to go see Amegakure..but if you don't want to do that after what all has happened then I will understand."* - Fri Nov 27 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "We can do those first."* - Fri Nov 27 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit, "I thought we were going to train and do the experiments first?"* - Fri Nov 27 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I figured you'd want to train outside, was I wrong? - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I was wondering if you wanted something to eat fist. - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: First* - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 27 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I'm not hungry. - Fri Nov 27 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well, first I'd like to show you this stance. - Fri Nov 27 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Think you're willing to learn? - Fri Nov 27 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Of course. - Fri Nov 27 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched but didn't speak up about them going outside. She lowered down and got into the stance that was rigid. She tightened her fist and rose it while her left hand moved back and was open. She didn't understand how this helps your attacks since she wasn't much of a taijutsu user but hey, always good to learn. She watched as he kicked upwards and then she did the same, she practiced it a few times over until she had a fairly good grasp over how to complete the stance.

She looked over towards him, "do you want me to try against you? Or continue like this?"* - Fri Nov 27 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards his order and then she shifted and continued to kick and punch as her body shifted faintly across the floor. It was an odd stance in her heels and dress. It made her look like some girl from a comic book who wasn't in their super outfit and was in their normal person persona.* - Fri Nov 27 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't seem phased at all, she was able to walk in heels with ease. She began to do combos of kicks and punches together as he told her to do and continued until he would stop her. She could go on for hours like this without tiring if he so wished it.* - Fri Nov 27 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stopped as soon as he told her to, she walked over to him and stood before him regardless if he was sitting on the floor pillow. Of course that probably meant he was easily able to see up her dress to the pink panties. She smiled faintly at his clapping and blinked slowly, "Yes, I know."* - Fri Nov 27 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged lightly, "I will learn whatever you teach me. It is up to you, Master." She had not forgotten what he asked her to call him in private.* - Fri Nov 27 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) reached out and took his hand as his was offered. She followed him as he led her to the room with her heels clicking gently against the tiled ground. * - Fri Nov 27 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked into the room and then sat on the bed as soon as he ordered her to. "Do you want me to join you?" She didn't want to join him but she was literally forcing herself to do whatever he asked for as long as it wasn't something she really didn't want to do.* - Fri Nov 27 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had approval not to go with him and so she laid on the bed and watched her plants listening to them and speaking with them in a faint voice. She had taken up to speaking out loud rather than telepathy due to her emotions as of late.* - Fri Nov 27 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up as soon as he asked her to get him some clothing. She walked towards the closet as her whispering to the plants had stopped and she looked through the clothing. Picking out a pair of dark grey slacks, a dark navy blue button up dress shirt, and a silver grey tie. She brought it to him and spoke up, "Is this okay?"* - Fri Nov 27 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes as he kissed her cheek and then she felt her hair ruffled and sat back down on the bed to stare up at her plants as she said nothing.* - Fri Nov 27 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded, "I know. When will the scientists come?"* - Fri Nov 27 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov 27 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded and waited for them to hand her a vial. She reached out and took the vial before drinking it. She sat there for a while but then after a moment her eye twitched some and she started to feel sickish as her hand started melting some. It was like her body was using the ability to hold together. She looked towards the scientists and then Thirteen in panic, wondering if maybe Thirteen had plotted this intentionally.* - Fri Nov 27 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank the vial if they poured it into her mouth since she couldn't hold onto it. It seemed as if the anti-serum only served to -speed up- the process.* - Fri Nov 27 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had the next serum poured into her mouth and it slowed down the 'melting' a bit.* - Fri Nov 27 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was given another anti serum and by now she was doing better and laid quietly with her eyes closed. It seemed that she had no energy at all but she wasn't melting anymore and was back to normal.* - Fri Nov 27 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) remained passed out it seemed, which was strange...because how can someone like her be passed out?* - Fri Nov 27 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly began to wait after her regeneration had completed. She opened her eyes and stared up at him without moving.* - Fri Nov 27 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Bad. - Fri Nov 27 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see, Do you wish to rest then? Or continue? - Fri Nov 27 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm not sure. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then....Let's continue. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm sure that was a faulty batch. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have them keep a few Vials of the anti-serum on hand. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can I stay laying down? - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're fine. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As long as you want. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: It's not like she can choke afterall. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov 27 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had the serum poured into her mouth but nothing happened as she lay there.* - Fri Nov 27 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank the serum, but again nothing happened.* - Fri Nov 27 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank the serum as it was poured into her mouth and then she waited and soon enough her expression began to soften and she turned her nose in against his lap as she slowly blinked and peered up at him. It seemed her eyes had softened away from their neutral or hateful look and into that of puppy dog eyes.* - Fri Nov 27 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nuzzled in against his hand as he pet her. "A-alright," her voice was hesitant and soft as she spoke. She hadn't been given the next serum yet but also likely wasn't going to resist since the scientists knew they could get away with it under this current submissive nature.* - Fri Nov 27 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up towards the scientists at his suggestion and nodded, "Oh, Okay." She drank it without resistance where as she normally wouldn't allow the crossing of serums without being forced. Soon enough the emotion of love had cast over her and she shuddered some as she looked around the room but wasn't certain what she loved in this room other than her plants. She stared back up at Thirteen but didn't feel love for him but it caused her to smile softly, since she was essentially 'filled with love'.* - Fri Nov 27 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: you keep stacking - Fri Nov 27 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head and nuzzled against his hand as he pet through her hair. When another serum was offered to her she took it without hesitation and drank it immediately before going back to nuzzling the hand petting her. She immediately cringed as the drug went into effect and pouted out as she pulled her legs up against her lower body "Nngng...W-why does it hurt?" She grumbled and turned her head down against Thirteen's lap, it didn't suffocate her since she couldn't breathe anyway as she moved her face back and forth against his lap. "Nngng.."* - Fri Nov 27 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned,"insides...my insides..." she groaned but it didn't seem any worse than a belly ache for a human by her groans and complaints. She stopped moving her head and simply lay there all curled up and holding herself with her face down.* - Fri Nov 27 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded against his lap as she lay there and if he simply continued to hold her it eventually would pass unless he intended to do anything else until the bad reaction passed at the designated amount of time.* - Fri Nov 27 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was given another serum once she was fine and laying back with the back of her head on his lap and staring up at him as she nuzzled into his hand. The serum did nothing it seemed to give her a jealous reaction but something did happen in the background of all of this.* - Fri Nov 27 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled wide to his compliments and tone and then instantly sat up some and leaned forward as she arched her neck back and parted her lips. Her eyes slowly closed and she aimed to kiss him with one hand running along his cheek and then up into his hair as she kissed him passionately, definitely different than she -ever- had kissed him. * - Fri Nov 27 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) broke the kiss and peered up to his eyes with her own heterochromic set without pulling more than an inch away from his face. Her lips wet with his saliva from how deeply she had kissed him.* - Fri Nov 27 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked up at him as her eyes were wide with admiration, "yes?" Almost perfectly on cue to ask what he wanted from her.* - Fri Nov 27 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned to the scienists as the gave her the serum and then she looked back to him and as she stared up at him her expression became more sure and less hesitant. She had been hesitant with her words before but now she was -proud- of what she had to offer the man before her. Even proud to be in front of the scientists this way.* - Fri Nov 27 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) arched her back with her hips pressed against him and a wild smile tugged up on her lips at the compliment. "I love the way you look at me when I look like this.~"* - Fri Nov 27 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was still partly laying down, with only her upper torso on his body really but against his own lower torso. She was slightly lower than him in head height as she stared up into his eyes. She felt him squeezing her rump through the dress and didn't stop him of course, her smile only grew wider with enjoyment of him enjoying her body.* - Fri Nov 27 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shifted and crawled onto his lap with her legs spread wide and was straddling his lower belly and hips. Her hands came to rest on his front of shoulders and collar bone but she was so light it didn't apply much pressure. She had her head lowered and was watching him like a hawk with a smile upon her face and extremely interested eyes.* - Fri Nov 27 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) chuckled girlishly at his statement as he felt over her body and she rolled her hips against his hands gripping her ass cheeks. "Are you sure it is heaven? Because heaven would imply that I'm good.~"* - Fri Nov 27 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thought on it, "Sometimes.~ But normally I am a good girl for my Master. Aren't I?~" She pouted gently playfully as she lowered her head, clearly she was proud of what a good girl she was.* - Sat Nov 28 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's hips shifted forward against him as he swatted her bottom and she bit down on her lip playfully. She leaned down and whispered as she nuzzled her cheek against his. "That would be for my Master to decide of course.~"* - Sat Nov 28 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt his hands running over her body and his lips on her collar bone. "What is my reward, Master?~"* - Sat Nov 28 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit as she stared down at him "Ooooooh?~ -Something-? -Meet-? Something not -human-?~" She was very interested now.* - Sat Nov 28 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip playfully once again and groaned out, "so then a surprise? Alright I will be good until then so I can get my reward.~" * - Sat Nov 28 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her hips against him more and leaned in to kiss him gently and then deeper with passion.* - Sat Nov 28 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shifted and pressed into his hand wherever it went. When his hand reached her neck she lifted her chin and parted her lips while looking down at him seductively. She clearly was very into her little show she was giving him.* - Sat Nov 28 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was...far from kissing him? She was sitting fully up as he had ran his hand over her body and up to her neck. She felt him stroking over her cheek and waited for him to order something or the like.* - Sat Nov 28 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rolled off of his body and then pulled off her panties out from under her dress and laid them where they fell on the bed cover. She then undid his buckle on the belt and pulled his pants down but not his boxers and rest on her knee's beside him looking down to his face in wait of another order.* - Sat Nov 28 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) listened to what he gave her as an order and she was hesitant and then diverted her gaze in thought. "I've only done that once before..." her smile quickly fading as shame crept into her mind. She tried to figure out what to do as she became conflicted. She reached out and began to rub over his length through the boxers as she thought and tried to decide what to do.* - Sat Nov 28 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) continued to massage and clearly she was very good at it from plenty of practice with others in the past. She decided it was worth it because it meant she was being good and doing what her owner wanted. He was her everything now so of course she would do it for him. Right? She kept it up for a bit more and then pulled down his boxers only enough to expose him before she straddled him again. She gripped his length and then peered down at him as she easily enough guided him into her slit and sat fully down all at once because she knew it would give him a great amount of satisfaction quickly.* - Sat Nov 28 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) began to rise and fall slow at first but then harder and harder. She didn't know of soft fucking since she had only had sex once and it was hard as it could get, harder than what a human girl her size could tolerate. She held onto his shoulders and back of neck and rode him as hard as she could while kissing over his body and finding his lips occasionally. She was relentless and moaned out even from her ability to make him happy, her sheer pride and submission easily visible from how much she enjoyed pleasing him.* - Sat Nov 28 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pretty much kept this up without tiring it seemed. She was going for the ultimate goal of making him orgasm, since to her that was the entire point of this action.* - Sat Nov 28 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) kept her hips moving until he had finished and then felt him holding her against his chest and it was around this time that she started to come down from her high on the submissive drug keeping her so obediant. She realized what she had just done and felt shame. Her eyes shifted but she was looking away from him so she only trembled against him.* - Sat Nov 28 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes as she heard his words. She didn't respond, only lay there for him to hold.* - Sat Nov 28 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sighed out and didn't speak for most of the time he explained. She then rubbed her lips together and spoke, "I know that you mean that... I do, but at the same time I know you mean it when you train me... I know you mean it when we water plants, I know you mean it when you degrade me, I know you mean it when you want to hurt me, I know you meant it when you held me within your power to control my mind.... Every case you have meant it, it's just that you change so much that you mean everything you have done." * - Sat Nov 28 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head against his chest, "you know that answer. You are Thirteen, you said so yourself before doing what I am not to speak of."* - Sat Nov 28 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose a brow, "does that mean you are removing your restriction of speaking of the incident?"* - Sat Nov 28 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) spoke up again, "and what if you change your mind again like you do commonly?"* - Sat Nov 28 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... Yeah but you know how you can be. - Sat Nov 28 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That won't go over well with you sometimes. - Sat Nov 28 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I know you can handle me, if need be Yuriko. - Sat Nov 28 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I need you, to be my Anchor...From this point on. - Sat Nov 28 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If I stray, to put me back on the right path. - Sat Nov 28 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O-okay. - Sat Nov 28 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What if.... I lose it? - Sat Nov 28 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes.... - Sat Nov 28 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes the emotions...they make me crazy. - Sat Nov 28 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll, be there to pull you back, if you need me. - Sat Nov 28 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You'll never be alone, I'll always be there for you. - Sat Nov 28 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What if you are your other type of self...and you enjoy it? - Sat Nov 28 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then at least... - Sat Nov 28 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: We'll be lost together. - Sat Nov 28 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...heh. - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That's romantic. - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I understood romantic! - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Ro-Romantic...? - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah! - Sat Nov 28 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head and looked at him, "I never understood it before."* - Sat Nov 28 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What did you learn? - Sat Nov 28 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That I'm more human that I originally thought. - Sat Nov 28 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Sat Nov 28 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 28 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What now, Master? - Sat Nov 28 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's gotten late now, I was thinking...We can head to Amegakure at dawn, if you still want to go. - Sat Nov 28 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, okay. - Sat Nov 28 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Although... - Sat Nov 28 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Nevermind... - Sat Nov 28 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Hm? - Sat Nov 28 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Nothing. - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Okay. - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Weird. - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He always speaks his mind. - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov 28 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You know... - Sat Nov 28 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I really liked that teasing attitude of yours before, You should do that more often. - Sat Nov 28 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I've never ....been like that before. - Sat Nov 28 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It suits you. - Sat Nov 28 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You could....Try it when it's just us, I'd like that, a lot. - Sat Nov 28 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But it's up to you. - Sat Nov 28 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked into the cafe and took a seat at a table. She minded her own business for now.* - Sat Nov 28 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had hair that was perfectly situated with no stray hairs, it seemed impossible it could be so perfect in the mountains. She has opposite matching heterochromic eyes with pink iris on the side of her head with brown hair, and a brown eye on the side with pink hair. Her eyes were wide and cuious as she looked aound and watched people. She was a young mid-teen with perfect fair skin and a very petite body with a nice sized chest to accent the small frame. To top it all off she was wearing -extremely- expensive clothing, fine leather gloves, a lace, satin, and suade dress with black stockings from the lower thigh down (Not to mention her dress is quite short) and upper-calf high boots that were pure creamy white with dark brown accent. She looked -perfect-, so perfect it was impossible to look as perfect as she did. Besides all that she wore no coat, nor carried one...despite the cold mountains.* - Sat Nov 28 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) did not have a single weapon or headband on her. She could see people looking at her but that was normal so she simply continued people watching without being able to hear them talking about her. She smiled faintly and looked to be confident while also keeping to herself.* - Sat Nov 28 09:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) caught two who were looking at her more than others, usually it didn't go past a few seconds. She stared at Sogeki and Akarui with a slight smile.* - Sat Nov 28 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Uh-oh. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had been about to continue her rhyme when Akarui came over and disturbed her focus. She slowly craned her head up to the girl, "Well hello there." Her voice was as sweet as honey laced milk as she spoke. Her smile broadening wide into the sweetest, most cheerful, and inviting grin a girl could give to a perfect stranger. "That's so very nice of you, I would love to join you. Though I am not all that hungry." * - Sat Nov 28 09:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched the girl run into the guy and rose a brow of sceptism. She stood up with grace and smoothed out her dress while stepping around the table. She walked between the tables with heels clicking against the hardwood, she looked Sogeki over with a long once over as she passed him before going to take a seat at their table beside Akarui.* - Sat Nov 28 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why do I go into these buildings with strange smells. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: It always ends up with people trying to feed me disgusting things. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head and gave Akarui a beautiful broad smile, "no thank you, I don't need anything, thank you for offering though." She wasn't aware of any game or change going on, can't she check someone out? Sheesh.* - Sat Nov 28 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh sake. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Maybe I could drink sake. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Sake makes me feel weird, I wonder what it feels like now. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: But I'm alone, maybe that's a bad idea. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No no, I won't dink. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Such a cute name~ - Sat Nov 28 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: She reminds me of like a perfect sister. . .if her perfectness wasn't kinda creepy. - Sat Nov 28 10:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: -0 - Sat Nov 28 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up and down Sogeki as he drank and then over to Akarui and looked her up and down in the same fashion. It was almost -violating- how he eyes looked at their bodies. "What are your names?"* - Sat Nov 28 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I wonder if the carpet matches the drapes. -omit- - Sat Nov 28 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose her bow at the word 'fanciness'. She kept her eyes on the bottle of sake. "Sogeki-kun and Akarui-chan," using only terms of endearment, even when she was refering to herself. "I don't believe I should take part at our first meeting, after all I am here alone. It would be unwise, don't you think?" Deep down though since he was offering something she did sort of want so part of her was inclined to accept but she was trying to hold back that side of her. It made her head hurt to supress the urge to give in...* - Sat Nov 28 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) notes that she has -zero- arm hair, if someone were to look closely at any part of her body? She didn't even have peach fuzz. The only hair that was visible was on her head.* - Sat Nov 28 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared at the bottle of sake, she wondered why he left it in front of her. Was it a gift? She stared -hard- at the bottle. "I am fom many places, I suppose the longest place would be Kirigakure." She was not aware of Kiri's current standing in this village.* - Sat Nov 28 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: She is talking strange. - Sat Nov 28 10:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook here head, "not exactly but a place nearby to there, I was vacationing." For someone as rich looking as her it probably wasn't that strange that she vacations near beaches and islands. She was still watching the sake but didn't look tense.* - Sat Nov 28 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I must have upset he. - Sat Nov 28 10:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him drink for the second bottle and rested one hand in font of the one he had sat before her but didn't touch the sake. "Yes, did I make you feel unpleasant? I didn't mean to, what was it I said?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (well... every now and then) - Sat Nov 28 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose a brow at his question, but she looked Akarui over and nodded to her. She didn't want to bother her if she was sticking to her own thoughts after all. Yuriko focused back on him and mimicked his look up and down taking in his body with another violating look. "Kind of, I have never been to Kumogakure before. So I wanted to come see it's mountains."* - Sat Nov 28 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Drink.. the sake. - Sat Nov 28 11:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) glanced towards Akarui as she decided to speak up again, "Mhm. They are SO BIG!" She sounded extremely enthusiastic. She reached out and and ran her fingers over the bottle of sake, feeling the warm radiating from it but not removing the cork. She flicked her gaze back up to Sogeki and started from where his torso was visible at the table's surface and up towards his eyes to linger there. She found this enjoyable only because she was well aware of the torment she was causing Sogeki now.* - Sat Nov 28 11:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head silently to Sogeki's question and then bit down on her bottom lip before reaching for the cork of the bottle and removing it. She brought the bottle to her lips and drink a large gulp of it's contents before making a disgusted face, likely the first bad expression they had seen from her.* - Sat Nov 28 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She is a savage amongst savages.. - Sat Nov 28 11:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat the bottle back down and rested her hand around the bottom edge. "Not long, I have to get back to my o-," she froze and was trying to think. "My only family member."* - Sat Nov 28 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: They seem to be having fun, drinking and such. . .maybe I should use this time to sneak away. - Sat Nov 28 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thought about what he said and picked up the sake bottle again and took another drink of the bitter hot drink. "It's ...alright, it's 'boring' a lot of the time. Not really wet, but there's an ocean, it's on an island."* - Sat Nov 28 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't bother to pick up the bottle for a bit, she wasn't a heavy drinker or a fast drinker so she didn't touch it again for now. Her hand rested on the table, appearing as if she was going to stop drinking. "....I mean, I don't know? I sit on a boat?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: They seem to be having fun, I think I am going to slip away. . . - Sat Nov 28 11:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noticed every facial expression he shown, she understood each and everyone...and that made he more dangerous than he assumed. "Why should it?" She stared at him hard with a serious expression in her gaze but a gentle and beautiful smile as if to say everything was normal. No, it is not... it's further out than that. Just in Water Country." She didn't touch the sake.* - Sat Nov 28 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noted she was ignored with words but she watched him intently and then looked back to the bottle of the sake. She looked up to the girl, "I don't like how it tastes either, but it makes you feel tingly."* - Sat Nov 28 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared at him with a soft smile that tugged up in a cocky grin on one side, "everything."* - Sat Nov 28 12:25:48 2015

She then heel shuffled her way with clicks over towards Akarui and hugged her from behind like she had done to Yuriko already. Her soft skin was that of something unimaginable, she literally would not have touched anything as soft as Yuriko's skin in her life, nor would she ever again if it wasn't Yuriko's skin one again. She nuzzled her cheek against her's as well. <This has to work, it worked on him.>* - Sat Nov 28 14:05:39 2015
