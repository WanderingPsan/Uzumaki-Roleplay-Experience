<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her lips together. "That is kind of you, you have shown more kindness than most have... but I have a few people who seem to like my presence, even if they move about the regions. I... hope that we can know each other more though... and meet in Konoha again in the future, you seem nice."* - Wed Nov  4 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to the girl and then glanced between the other female and then Sanoke who seemed to be done talking for the moment.* - Wed Nov  4 12:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: How rude, judging some off their skin color! Are, you saying I wouldn't be able to handle the cold just because I'm dark! - Wed Nov  4 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No! . . .Chikyu! This is like science. - Wed Nov  4 12:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: OH, becuase of my skin color is a fact I'm lesser at you in something? - Wed Nov  4 12:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 's skin was -rediculously- soft, it was nearly supernatural in sensation in fact. "I don't get darker, ever... I think? I don't think I am a mutant... what is wrong with my skin? It can't be this color?" She wasn't a fan of him touching her and a flick of energy had spread through her cheek as he touched her but nothing happened outwardly.* - Wed Nov  4 12:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You keep talking about skin color and how strange she is! - Wed Nov  4 12:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked him up and down as he continued to massage her cheek, she wasn't used to this type of... personal space being invaded nor affection. "He's not upsetting me.... not like commenting on my skin color could upset me at all." She was unaware he had been able to see her chakra, but what she had done had been an instinct she couldn't help.* - Wed Nov  4 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Chakra? - Wed Nov  4 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) paused for a moment in confusion and then recalled that Marrisa had used that word. "Oh chakra..." she diverted her gaze, "I didn't do anything."* - Wed Nov  4 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: TIts rude no matter what, to say someone weird or abnormal because of their skin color. My dad told me to respect all kinds of people, especially as a man to a woman... Well that part doesn't work really anymore, since he learned I was a girl.. But the rest of it still stands! - Wed Nov  4 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched Sanoke carefully, perhaps she hadn't of let him touch her.* - Wed Nov  4 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: How the heck am I supposed to know? - Wed Nov  4 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked several times at how he was acting, was this normal when you said sorry? She swallowed slightly and hesitantly spoke up in a hushed tone, "yeah...it's okay."* - Wed Nov  4 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was uneasy inwardly by Sanoke's eyes. As Chikyu had wrapped her arms around them both another burst of chakra where they touched would be seen by Sanoke before dissipating just like before. She lowered her head knowing he had seen it and remained silent. "Its....Ume."* - Wed Nov  4 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Cool. This shit is weird. Hrm. . . my instincts say. - Wed Nov  4 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: To see how far it can. Do I harass her? - Wed Nov  4 13:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And you had to do it someway. It's not like you're self sustaining. - Wed Nov  4 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) eyed Sanoke carefully. "I was ... a begger."* - Wed Nov  4 13:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had slowly walked into the 'mansion' and peered over at Tetsumi.* - Wed Nov  4 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to him, honestly she had gotten lost in this giant village and had ended up wandering in here. "This is.... the leader's building?"* - Wed Nov  4 20:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are there only little cactus's in this village? - Wed Nov  4 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No other plants? - Wed Nov  4 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I doubt he doesn't like you. It takes a lot for the geezer to dislike you. Mhmm. - Wed Nov  4 20:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) peered towards Yan as he left, then towards Marrisa and Ketsuki. "I hope to see you both again soon. Perhaps your leader will be more willing for me to enter the village next time if I seek to learn from you once more, Marrisa?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: So civilians are not welcome then. - Wed Nov  4 22:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: She left before I arrived. - Wed Nov  4 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: A boy named Yan very much so wants you killed, his lust for your death, and that of a woman named Katsune is so strong I believe he might go against orders that you are protected. - Wed Nov  4 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: So much so that he tried to have me interrogated after finding out I had seen you in the past as a bystander when you attacked Kirigakure. - Wed Nov  4 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: No one suspects I have association with you though. - Wed Nov  4 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm tempted to ask you to push your luck with going back and subtly gather more information. I want to know the next time Yan leaves the village. - Wed Nov  4 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He must die. - Wed Nov  4 22:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: He was my information that she had spread the rumor. - Wed Nov  4 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. With Lera blaming me and Yan, a ranked Sunagakure shinobi, backing her.. this may lead to war. - Wed Nov  4 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We can definitely use this, but it's a risk. - Wed Nov  4 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A simple letter from a random person stating they heard of Katsune's location and detailing her location. - Wed Nov  4 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Instead, it's my location.. - Wed Nov  4 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: If I were to go back.... I would need a reason. I gathered one reason, one of their leaders decided to train me but if I came back so soon the leader of the village might assume I never left... He said he would punish me. - Wed Nov  4 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no that'll be too ris-. - Wed Nov  4 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Is my luck truly dying out so fast? - Wed Nov  4 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: She was the one who reminded Yan that you are not to be touched. - Wed Nov  4 22:22:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, sure. Okay. Anyways, Marrisa couldn't help you gather a passport in and out of Sunagakure. We use this to our advantage. A few letters to draw her out for your sake will be sufficient. - Wed Nov  4 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: You know her? - Wed Nov  4 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I do. - Wed Nov  4 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Should I stay away from her? - Wed Nov  4 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: There's.... there's a problem with a letter.... also - Wed Nov  4 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) rubbed the back of her head, "Marrisa knows I can't read."* - Wed Nov  4 22:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, get your teaching, - Wed Nov  4 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: So....the letter issue? - Wed Nov  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alll that I'm thinking is risky.. - Wed Nov  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But, plausible. - Wed Nov  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) smiled faintly and lowered her head some so her hat hid away her expression, "Do you still think me a flower?"* - Wed Nov  4 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Pft. - Wed Nov  4 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) reached for her katana slowly and unsheathed it as she stepped before him. Flipping the blade so the hilt was towards him she gripped his hand if he allowed it and held the hilt in his hand forcibly. Course he could overpower her if he wanted to, but she tried her best to insist. With the blade now between them she peered up at him so that they were eye to eye. Slowly she raised the blade so he was prepared and watching every moment to see there was no trick. She then attempted to force him to stab her through the 'heart'. * - Wed Nov  4 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) continued as she forced him to stab her through the chest and she simply stared into his eyes. With the blade still in her chest and all the way through out the back she said very seriously. "I am a tree, not a flower... I may not carry much skill, but some things about me just cannot be denied as attributes of a tree rather than a weak flower for you to protect."* - Wed Nov  4 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) 's face was blank and then she cocked her head to the side innocently at his reply. "I will settle for that," she stepped back with a gasp as the katana was pulled from her chest leaving Ortho holding it's hilt with blood soaking the blade. She had intentionally forced her 'blood' to appear red for the benefit of not shocking him further.* - Wed Nov  4 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Please don't tell anyone what I showed you....  - Wed Nov  4 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No.. need to worry. - Wed Nov  4 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) examined him closely stepping forward again past the blade so she could watch his reaction. The wound that was beyond her clothing had entirely healed and there was very -little- blood. "This bothered you, does it.... make you find my strange or dangerous? It really only makes me.... fortified."* - Wed Nov  4 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "I am confused, you killed many people."* - Wed Nov  4 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) looked at him with doubt, "you really believe all those people were deserving?"* - Wed Nov  4 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Then why did you allow me to guide your hand. - Wed Nov  4 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Vulnerability? - Wed Nov  4 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head to the side again, she was trying to understand.* - Wed Nov  4 23:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I am a preacher of my beliefs, but I didn't believe until it was too late for me to dig my way out of the hole. - Wed Nov  4 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thought on this, "I didn't mean to cause feelings.... I just had to show you. You wouldn't have believed me simply telling you."* - Wed Nov  4 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head, "I have trouble understanding all this.... but.. maybe we should let it rest for now and go back to see Index."* - Wed Nov  4 23:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood at the edge of the riven and began to slip her dress off till it fell to the sands beside the river and she was only standing there in her new bra and panties.* - Thu Nov  5 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) turned around to look at Index confused why he suddenly wanted to leave, "But I thought you had no morals?"* - Thu Nov  5 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Can get in that's. - Thu Nov  5 03:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over at Ortho, "I thought skinny dipping was naked?"* - Thu Nov  5 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He looks different... - Thu Nov  5 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had caught a glimpse and then stared at her still underwear covered body. Then over towards Ortho and back at herself, he was in the water by now but it still was interesting. She then reached towards her panties and pulled them down with a small crouch, at first nothing strange would probably be noticed. Then she reached back behind her ribs to undo the bra hooks as it fell away and then it would be very obvious what was strange about Ume while nude. Her breasts, while as beautiful as they were, held no nipples or aerola's. Her cleft also had no, line which to show a crease of her sex, instead it was perfectly smooth like a doll's. Further, she had no markings anywhere on her body and looked extremely soft, she didn't think any of this was strange and so started to slowly walk into the water. To her knowledge she looked how she was suppose to.* - Thu Nov  5 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) slipped down into the water since Ortho hadn't freaked out about her form, not that she was expecting anyway. She stared at his scars though and then looked down at herself, wading through the shallows over to him she looked him over and then spoke in a hushed tone, "You look different than me."* - Thu Nov  5 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) pointed towards the scars for a moment before running two fingers over the closest one on his chest. She found them rather fascinating. Afterwards she looked...lower.* - Thu Nov  5 03:35:28 2015
