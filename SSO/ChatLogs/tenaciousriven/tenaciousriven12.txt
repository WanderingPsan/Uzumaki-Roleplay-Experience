<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That would only explain why you are being so cruel. - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll never hate you. - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just don't see a point. - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why did you have to kill him.... - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He came here looking for a fight. - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He got one, he's dead. - Mon Nov 23 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You couldn't just beat him down and kick him out... you had to kill him. Kill him knowing what would happen to me. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You -had- to of at least thought about it once. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What would happen if I was left in that place without him. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What the scientists would do. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Endlessly. That's why I stayed my ass here and away from him.. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He came here.. to my place.. to my home.. looking for a fight. - Mon Nov 23 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're considering what I could've done.. have you thought about what -he- could've done..? - Mon Nov 23 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) screamed out in rage and full of manic emotion, "YOU'RE IGNORING WHAT I'M SAYING!"* - Mon Nov 23 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is that where we're at now? - Mon Nov 23 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just give me a simple yes or no. - Mon Nov 23 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Nngn - Mon Nov 23 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) reached out and held her head, she could feel the emotions taking over and it hurt quite a bit. She groaned and held her head as her hair was ruffled. "They did things to me, they cloned me! They tried to steal things from me while torturing me! They made me feel pain!"* - Mon Nov 23 13:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned from his words and dropped her hands to her side as she felt shame coming over her from her hate for him. "I don't want you dead.... most of me doesn't, these emotions want me to kill you... kill you because the last time I saw Yosuke I was feeling love.... why couldn't you have been there... you were suppose to visit... you didn't come." 

She shuddered in her fit of emotions and tried to regain control. "I didn't come here to kill you... or even have this conversation... I just came to get his body to put to rest, it's obvious we are through. Now that I have felt love, I wonder if you ever did love me like you said or if I was a place holder. It feels like more and more everyday that I was keeping you company only as a way to tame your depression and anger. And now... if you hadn't killed him.. if someone else had and I came out here, I would be loving you...rather than hating you." She twitched as her emotions were trying to take over again, "I have to leave...before I try to attack you, I can't be near you."* - Mon Nov 23 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) swayed as she twitched occasionally. Her fingers could hardly stop moving as she fell to her knee's and slumped her shoulders forward in bad posture. Her body shook as he shouted at her and she didn't understand how he could say such things. "I never gave him what I gave you, I resisted countless times to what he wanted because I wanted to know if you were still waiting. I asked him day after day to find out if you moved on and I couldn't help feeling the love towards him, it was forced upon me by the chemicals and he was -there-. I know he probably tried to keep you away but you knew that would happen, you knew how much he wanted me. I couldn't help my design, I was meant to have an owner and he became that owner, the two of you were always so determined for me to be human but I'm not! I'll never be human, I'm a nothing, no scent, no organs, no blood, no true face!" She panted heavily as she was pulling at her hair again and holding her head tightly with small screams every so often.

She reached her hands down and dug them into the grass as she tried to stop herself from rushing towards him to claw his eyes out. "Even if you didn't know where I was, did you look? Did you try to find me after he died? Did you think I purposely stayed away after he died because I -wanted- to?! They locked me up! They didn't even tell me for weeks on end that I owned the place, they tried things that were never permitted by me or Yosuke and you didn't even think about it? All because Yosuke told you that he had me?! You assumed that I gave in to his lust and love and whatever he wanted just because I was away, you lost faith in me. I can see it in your eyes, you never looked at me this way before! You never looked at me without emotion, I gave you emotion even when I couldn't show any myself and now we have flipped!" She groaned agagin and then struggled to get up before falling once more to her knee's. She was trying to get away from him, trying to leave before cruelty and hate could take over.... the emotions that had gone deep into her system and were the most potent of all of her current permanent emotions.* - Mon Nov 23 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) screamed out and rose to her feet like a new found energy was growing inside of her. As he said those things about Yosuke and the games and had started to say something else but hadn't gotten it out, about how she had rewarded Yosuke. She darted forward towards him with intent of what looked like to be just simply snatching him by the shoulders. She was easily able to reach him unless he had moved quickly, she didn't have any weapons on her, and he didn't know majority that she had learned but he knew she couldn't die... At least he assumed she couldn't from past events.

With all her energy she had charged towards him and all of her focus had been planted on him. She was determined to make him pay one way or another for what he said, and she wanted some answers from him. She wanted him to shut up and just talk normally, she wanted to see the way he looked at her before all of this. Before Yosuke and the experiments, she wanted to feel his love like she had hoped to feel. Most of all she wanted to kill him...and she didn't want to kill him. Everything was back and forth and topsy turvy within her mind.* - Mon Nov 23 14:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) managed to have her fingers graze down the front of his body as he fell. She walked across the cobble stone and stood over him as the cell on his body rapidly began to expand and surround him. It began to drain away his chakra and store it within it's own cells as the face of Ume was formed next to his shoulder and staring at him in all white. Yuriko stood over him and with a heeled boot on either side of his body and stared down into his eyes that were trying to come back into focus.

"Answer one question.... do you love me, in any way at all." 

She waited, and the chakra continued to drain at a slow rate for now and he was still capable of breathing.* - Mon Nov 23 14:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly, getting the answer she had hoped for deep down under all the hate. She felt her head spin and she crouched down over him and reached out for his cheek gently. "I told you before I left.... that I would be back to tell you what you so desperately wanted to hear. I mean it when I say this, I love you." She paused as she stared at his closed eyes and the face of a man she hoped to be with until the end. "But I also hate you because of what you have done. For that, we can no longer be near each other. I fear if I see you again I will end your life... and your life is too precious to me to take away." She rose and as the young looking girl walked away, the spore clone surrounding his body shrunk and then left him, falling to the ground and leaving him free. She had nothing else to say.* - Mon Nov 23 14:45:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....? - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The Gezo has Yosuke. - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ...I see.. - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I almost killed the friend who killed him. - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But I decided to let him live. - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to Thirteen and spun around, "do you like my dress?"* - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I like it because it matches my hair and eyes. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And it's fancy.~ - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) spun around a few more times making her dress twirl.* - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards him and followed after him. She was wearing heeled boots which she seemed to walk perfectly in, along with a set of black plastic pearl shaped jewels around her neck. She also had on black gloves that made her fingers look extra slender and long. "If I ever see him again though, I told him I would kill him."* - Mon Nov 23 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) settled down onto a bench when they entered the cafeteria. "I will kill him, as I vowed to him. Just as I told him I loved him, but also hate him."* - Mon Nov 23 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: look at menma] - Mon Nov 23 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: we are on a time limit] - Mon Nov 23 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him, "oh I thought you liked reading to me." She then looked him over as he thanked her, "Why are you saying thank you?"* - Mon Nov 23 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times staring up at him, "you don't have to thank me." She scooted closer to him as his arm went around her.* - Mon Nov 23 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged some, "I don't care right now... my day was eventful already."* - Mon Nov 23 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded to what he said and held still as he leaned against her head. She wasn't sure what he was doing unless he was trying to smell her, which she had not scent.* - Mon Nov 23 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took his hand and stood up. "It's up to you, once again... you really should learn to stop asking me until I have more emotions." * - Mon Nov 23 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared at his lap as he sat down, she hesitated for a moment before going to sit in his lap. She said nothing and only nodded to what he said about her learning the technique.* - Mon Nov 23 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked over the flip book and then tapped her lips. "Can I use the ocean like I did with the dragon?" She looked out towards the water and then shifted a bit on his lap and folded her hands into seals and then thrust both her hands out with fingers spread wide. She held them out for a long time as chakra flowed out of her hands and into the water but nothing happened for a long period of time. Her body began to tremble as she focused and nothing occured.

She huffed gently and lowered her hands to her lap. "Erg..." She formed the handseals again and thrust her arms out. This time the water began to rumble and boil some. She could feel the chakra trying to mold and slowly the water sloshed back and forth against the banks. Eventually she had small waves going but they were petite and barely went a few feet up the beach towards their position.

As she was getting the hang of things, her body shifted and then she flowed her chakra out and this time a medium sized wave was formed. It was getting very close to getting the two of them wet but she didn't mind it any, the thought of Thirteen didn't cross her mind either because she was so focused. 

With another few tries she eventually had a large wave grown. "Look!" She said excitedly and was struggling to hold it up in place above them. In a matter of moments she lost control of it and it came crashing down over them and likely pushing them back against the cliffs. It wasn't a giant wave so really it was like getting splashed and soaked on a water ride at a theme park.* - Mon Nov 23 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked back at him and she then absorbed the water on her body and was dry instantly, course her clothing wasn't though. "Mhm... fine, are you?" She looked him over and he looked upset with her.* - Mon Nov 23 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and began to strip off her clothing piece by piece. She laid them all out against the cliffs and then came back over to him. She -was- a little nervous about being naked outside with him this time, she had been feeling pretty shameful lately... and currently she suddenly realized...<why did I take off my clothes when he told me to?> Her brow folded and she stepped back a half step as her hands were held over her petite breasts. She looked conflicted and was trying to figure out what to do.* - Mon Nov 23 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: The whole reason I lost him was because of this.... - Mon Nov 23 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned her head away shamefully as he gripped her wrist and she resisted a small amount to him pulling her hand away. "I... I don't know... things that -he- said made me.... self conscious of showing myself to others... it got me in trouble, I lost him because I did these things with Yosuke..." In the back of her mind she was being reminded. <But Thirteen is your owner, your -real- owner. He isn't playing pretend like the others, he really does own you, he doesn't want you to be human. He's the right one.>* - Mon Nov 23 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she listened to him. He was deepening the impact of him being a master, he was talking like an owner...what she expected from an owner. She turned her head towards him but didn't raise her gaze, "yes, Thirteen."* - Mon Nov 23 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him and her lips twitched to the side some before going into a purse as she lowered down to a kneel on the sand in front of him. She wasn't sure about how he was treating her at the moment, it was much further into his demanding attitude then she thought he was like but it was reinforcing the ownership treatment, so she could not reject it.* - Mon Nov 23 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her chin a bit higher even with her lower lip quivering slightly in fright of the situation making her feel degraded, "Y-yes, Master."* - Mon Nov 23 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded her head hesitantly, "yes, Master..." She inhaled and exhaled out as she leaned forward and because he said to use her mouth she didn't try to use her hands to grab him. She instead shifted so that her lips were just under his head and then licked along it making the length sway gently. She did this a few more times before catching the tip with her lips and beginning to suck strongly in a perfect suction that couldn't be attained with a human mouth. She moved deeper and deeper until she had took him all in and then started to bob her head back and forth as he had taught her to do. Any skill that had to do other than that which was experienced she did not have. She did however use her tongue in a back and forth swirl across the underside of his shaft.* - Mon Nov 23 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was trembling as she sucked him off, her body shaking as her hands rested on her bare thighs from embarrassment of what he was making her do. She didn't understand why she was so embarrassed and was growing upset that this emotion had stuck around when all it had brung her was embarrassment and shame! 

Her eyes closed as he stroked through her hair and she continued to base out with her lips brushing against his lower abdomen and upper balls from how easily she could pleasure him. There were some benefits to her not having a gag reflex after all...* - Mon Nov 23 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's hands rose up at his command, even if it was laced with a sweet tone, she slowly started to massage his balls in a delicate way since the orbs felt soft and tender and likely easily could be hurt. She didn't know what to do with them so she simply continued to massage them as she sucked deeply and looked up to him since he had spoken to her, she didn't answer him... * - Mon Nov 23 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) tried to divert her eyes but only looked away for a second before staring back up at him in embarrassment as he complimented her. She felt dirty...for the first time ever. She knew it was impossible for her to actually be dirty but he was working the sensation out of her. She bobbed her head back and forth rapidly to the point that her lips were causing a squelching sound from his precum dripping from her lips.* - Mon Nov 23 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stayed deeply sucking on his length until his climax had ended. Then she pulled back and dropped her hands back to her thighs and lowered her head down as she remained on her knee's. She stayed silent while trembling softly on the sand in the nude.* - Mon Nov 23 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and then sat down on his lap in a straddle. Due to how she was sitting his still hardened length was pressed against her sex and against the bottom curve of her ass cheeks against her ass's crack. She looked up to him warrily.* - Mon Nov 23 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded towars his question as she watched his hands gripping her hips. She kept her gaze down but he probably could see the deep shame in her eyes even as she was totally and completely loyal to his commands.* - Mon Nov 23 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt him pulling her in and she instinctively shifted her arms up to wrap behind his neck as her chin rested on his shoulder. "What would you like me to say, Master?"* - Mon Nov 23 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes as she rested against him, "ashamed...."* - Mon Nov 23 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly shook her head.* - Mon Nov 23 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head and leaned back to look at him but her eyes were shifting away every so often.* - Mon Nov 23 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't do it like that, again. But I do, enjoy that closeness with you. - Tue Nov 24 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you know why I even had a desire to that that, Yuriko? - Tue Nov 24 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's okay that you did it like that. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are my owner. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And...no I don't. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because, when I see my precious doll, It's hard not to play with her. - Tue Nov 24 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And don't worry...Once your emotions are fully developed... - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It'd be completely different. - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because I love my doll, that I do these things. - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You love me? - Tue Nov 24 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head to the side.* - Tue Nov 24 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled towards him and bobbed her head in a nod some, "Then see you can do whatever you want because you are my owner, Master."* - Tue Nov 24 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit as he asked her to make the decision. She glanced at her clothing, "do I get to put my clothes back on if we go inside?"* - Tue Nov 24 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit, "I can't do that though."* - Tue Nov 24 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't get the urges like you do. - Tue Nov 24 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll tell you when. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You have experience. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to see what you've learned. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh you mean what I did with other people? But I just let them do things to me. - Tue Nov 24 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't do things to them. - Tue Nov 24 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are the first one to have me do things. - Tue Nov 24 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded and stood up to walk over and started putting her clothing on if he permitted her to do so. "We can go back inside, Master."* - Tue Nov 24 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked into the base with him holding his hand and then walked towards the room. "Yeah..."* - Tue Nov 24 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged gently, "I just want them all so that it can be over with."* - Tue Nov 24 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank down the serum but nothing happened.* - Tue Nov 24 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the vial and then drank it down. Soon after she felt the effect coming in lightly and the scientists started to do some tests. "Oh, she had this before with another. She is going to be feeling these effects for a few days at the least. We can stack on top of this one if you want to but it could cause it to be more permanent than it already was. Yuriko was already glancing up at her plants and focusing on them since they were what she cared about most in the room, sadly Thirteen wasn't on top at the moment since she hadn't felt love for him yet.* - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly turned her head and smiled up to Thirteen as he handed her the next vial. She wasn't sure about stacking but trusted him because of her current emotions. Taking the vial she drank it down and waited. She inhaled and her eyes widened suddenly as she stared out for a moment in a trance before going to sit on the bed and then stood up again and started to walk around the room looking at everything she could find.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You may release him. - Wed Nov 25 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as her lips widened up in a dropped jaw of surprise. She wanted to jump up but didn't and remained sitting next to Thirteen. "Oooooooh, I like him."* - Wed Nov 25 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: He is quite interesting, isn't he? - Wed Nov 25 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Wow he makes things really fast. - Wed Nov 25 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) simply sat there as her head was touched and rested on by the hand. She stared at Hokori wide eyed and wondering at why he acted the way he did. Perhaps it was an emotion she hadn't tried yet!* - Wed Nov 25 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You two are free to do as you please, for the rest of the day. - Wed Nov 25 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Hm, Yuriko. - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: What types of plants, would you like to plant? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Succulents.~ - Wed Nov 25 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that your favorite type of plants now? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Or do you just enjoy saying it? - Wed Nov 25 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Both? - Wed Nov 25 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This.. is going to get annoying.. - Wed Nov 25 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Quick.. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: When do I get to eat real people instead of these ...petri dish things. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Whenever you decide. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat at the conference table in the meeting room staring down at a few of the flip books to explain jutsu she was learning that Thirteen had drawn her. She was looking over several of them and following what they required. Mostly she was trying to learn the handseals better... especially for water dragon.* - Wed Nov 25 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was actually looking at pictures, so every so often she would flip the book so that the image was moving making a rustling sound. It seemed she was doing this with all of the books, and repeating it several times with each one. It seemed she did this for -hours-, and eventually she looked up directly towards Horoki, with no sense of boredom in her visage. Her heterochromic gaze blinked a few times but was trained on his position. "You stand there all day like when I lay down when people are sleeping. Do humans get bored of just standing there?"* - Wed Nov 25 11:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noticed how he didn't look towards her like the other guards did, normally even when they didn't need to... the guards -always- looked at her because she was nude quite often. She stood up with silence and walked over in her heeled boots to his position and stood directly in front of him. She had to stand on her tip toes to get a good look at his lower face since he was looking up to the ceiling and she was a mere five foot. She hated being so short...but it was what was asked of her by Thirteen so shall it be. "Hmph," huffing out gently as she reached out and poked his chest once and then twice. "You are different than the other guards."* - Wed Nov 25 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) craned her head to the side as she lowered back onto her heels. "Domina?" She had never heard this word before.* - Wed Nov 25 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "Oh... because I own this place?"* - Wed Nov 25 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need you to act that way, I don't care about respect. I can't care, you know that right? You heard what I am like? I won't need respect until I get more emotions. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's pointless. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and formed an 'o' with her lips in curiousity of his words. "You seem to be what humans call noble. Is that right?"* - Wed Nov 25 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and then whispered the word 'selfish' several times over. "I don't know that word very well, what does that emotion mean?" She was trying to learn and was using him as a conduit. * - Wed Nov 25 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly and then started walking around with her heels clicking away. "Selfish, selfish, selfish. What other kinds of selfish are there? Is that the only kind of selfish?" She was trying to apply the word to situations of her past.* - Wed Nov 25 11:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked back over to him, "is an owner selfish?" She stared up to him in wonder, so far she didn't think that 'selfish' was necessarily a bad word, she was just trying to find the right location for it in her memory.* - Wed Nov 25 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and leaned in looking up at him as she stood on her tip toes, "You are like the others then. Only few can be an owner, yes?" She was beginning to understand, yet that didn't seem to frighten her about the prospect that a bad person had to be an owner.* - Wed Nov 25 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stepped back away from him as he said those words, it instantly reminded her of her first owner, and Master. "But....there are owners who don't throw away their dolls?" She sounded worried for a moment as she was peering up to him. The fact that Thirteen had been taking everything away from her to be his yet her name still remained on the deed was starting to trouble her faintly because what if her usefulness ran out? He enjoyed her company, at least he said he did, she had even set him free... surely he was -greatful- for that?* - Wed Nov 25 11:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || That was all it needed, him saying those things to make her spring a gear. She walked over and sat down next to the bookshelf on the ground with her legs laying out along the floor and her dress  spread out over her upper thighs. She reached up to her hair and was forcing her hands up and squeezing her head as she whispered to herself. In all truthfulness she looked like she had just had a psychotic break... * - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I won't sit on a shelf, he won't put me there. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat him if he puts me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Even if he doesn't taste good. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat anyone who tries to put me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No shelves! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No other dolls! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No dolls, no dolls, no dolls. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Little boxes all in a row... - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Dollies dusty...dust--dusty..dust dolls dusty. - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared off at nothing and rocked slightly as she held her head in her hands and ruffled her hair into mahem. "Nng..." she heard his words but it didn't change her thoughts all that much. "I'm suppose to have an owner, can't sit on a shelf... can't be left in dust... no dust..no shelf... no dust...no no..." She whispered some as her eyes closed and she lowered her head closer to her chest as her legs pulled up against her chest. Course this was unlady like but when did she ever care about lady like? Heels of boots were pressed against her back of thighs and rump as she leaned her forehead against her knee's. 

"Not a manipulator, can't manipulate... suppose to find the right owner, owner stays... owner keeps... owner isn't suppose to leave. I don't leave, why the owner leave? No no... no dust."* - Wed Nov 25 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stopped rocking and listened to him now at what he said. To her, what he was suggesting was a game. That would keep her owner busy... he might punish her more though for going against what he says but it would keep him interested. To her bad reinforcement didn't mean a person would leave, it was just if they got 'bored' with her. She rose her head and looked over towards him in understanding of what he had stated. "I cannot just stop being a doll, I tried that. I pretended to be human, it didn't work. I cannot be human..." 

She lowered her gaze some, "but I can play that game. I can play the manipulation game, I can try that." She looked out across the area imagining what Thirteen would do the first time she went against what he wanted. He wouldn't make the scientists hurt her, right? That would be the furthest she would think as a punishment... she didn't want that. "What if to everyone else you are the one in charge...but you really aren't in charge because you have an owner?" It was fairly obvious who her 'owner' was considering who she spent so much time with, plus Hokori would be well aware that Yosuke was deceased as did everyone in the settlement so the likeliness that he was her owner was slim to none.* - Wed Nov 25 12:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) listened to his words and his whisper, it was impactful but she knew this type of thinking was dangerous. "What if I do what you say.. and I get locked up and the scientists hurt me again?"* - Wed Nov 25 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: The guards didn't stop it last time... - Wed Nov 25 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: It went on for weeks. - Wed Nov 25 13:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Filled with lots of water. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They are all puffy. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And soft. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: The irony of this all.. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Right then.. - Wed Nov 25 13:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll take your word for it. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So what do you think I am? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Ehh? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Oh.. What you are..? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: That's simple. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: You're a 'unique'. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think that's a thing. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Want to make a bet? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A bet? - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that like a game? - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ...I suppose so.. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I like games, okay. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. I bet you I can show you visual proof of a 'unique'. - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But. - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: How? - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't understand the concept of a bet.* - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't think too hard on it.. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. accept. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and looked at his hand. She liked taking people's hands but usually it wasn't guards. She took his hand with her gloved one and let him lead her away with her bare socked feet lightly padding against the tiled flooring.* - Wed Nov 25 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had never had someone cover her sight before. She stopped walking in her caution as the much larger man tried to guide her into the bathroom but soon she walked again. Hesitantly taking steps forward as he made her step up to the mirror.The parts of his hands that were uncovered would easily feel how unnaturally soft her skin was upon her face. When he removed his hands she looked at herself and then jumped back into him some. She wasn't used to mirrors, the most she had seen was blurred images of herself through metal or the likes since she rarely had a reason to ever be in a bathroom or in front of a mirror. "What is that?" referencing herself.* - Wed Nov 25 13:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I see why.. she calls herself succulent.. - Wed Nov 25 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She's.. soft.. - Wed Nov 25 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to herself again as he pulled her back and held her in place. She looked over her features and then began to wonder what the other persona's had looked like in comparrison to this. "I'm so....pink," whispered out as she stared at herself and slowly started to smile.* - Wed Nov 25 13:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly to his words and then bit down on her lip as she reached up and ran her fingers over her face and then through her hair. She was admiring herself fairly heavily and turning her head to the side as she stared at herself. Soon after though she turned to face him since vanity was an emotion she hadn't experienced yet. "I understand, it doesn't matter what I am." She stared up to the tall man with a bright smile that was genuine. "None of the other guards talk to me like this."* - Wed Nov 25 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) craned her head to the side at him saying that again. "What does that mean? More than a cute face and conflicted conscious? And what does having balls mean?"* - Wed Nov 25 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And morals are good to have? - Wed Nov 25 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared at him and slowly blinked every so often, "being human is complicated...isn't it?"* - Wed Nov 25 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I think I'm glad I'm not human. - Wed Nov 25 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I would be dead if I was human, probably. - Wed Nov 25 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I'll.. take your word for it. - Wed Nov 25 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared up at him, she had no sense of any awkwardness from staring so she simply stared.* - Wed Nov 25 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: How determined are you to gain these.. human.. characteristics? - Wed Nov 25 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sniffed the air to take in his scent as she watched him, "I'm going to get emotions. That's all. I have an owner and once I get emotions I am complete."* - Wed Nov 25 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned slightly at his question, "of course it's what I want. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. Others want it for me too but this is what I want... course, after feeling some of the emotions... I grow tired of them. Some of the emotions are painful." She lowered her head slightly.* - Wed Nov 25 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) parted her lips as he lifted her chin. It was instinctual as most who lifted her chin like that were about to try and kiss her. It wasn't like she -expected- him to do so but it certainly looked inappropriate how she had opened her mouth slightly as he held her chin in his grasp. "I don't think I will ever be in control of these emotions, the ones that linger cloud my mind and make me do foolish things."* - Wed Nov 25 14:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) saw the look in his eyes and understood it to be an emotion. She tilted her head slightly and lowered her chin to a normal level. Her lips now closed as she wondered what he was feeling. As he was still speaking she reached up and gripped his jaw with her entire hand gently while looking at his eyes. "What was that, I don't know that one," she couldn't understand that emotion since no one had ever looked at her like that before.* - Wed Nov 25 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times in surprise and lowered her hand back down to her side. "No one's ever looked at me that way... is that all it is? Care?"* - Wed Nov 25 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why has no one else ever looked at me that way? - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There are those who said they love me. - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is love not care? - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Love and care exist together, yes.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love is more.. complicated.. than that.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Love looks more.... painful. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: This looks calm. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Love looks like it eats the person up. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: As for why no one else ever looked at you that way.. They probably mixed it with love and it came out --- - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It -feels- like it eats you up. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, love can do that.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) squinted some and looked to the side in thought.* - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That was the one I looked forward to. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But then it felt fake. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love is the easiest to obtain, but hardest to uphold. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It is also the easiest to alter.. no matter what your intentions are. - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Easy to alter? - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love.. goes by interests. If you love something and lose interest in them, you're naturally going to lose your love as well. - Wed Nov 25 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like an owner that puts a doll on a shelf? - Wed Nov 25 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It can be compared to that, yes.. but it's more genuine. Once you truly have interest in something or someone and gained the sense of love for them, you'll always have some form of that 'love' in you for that specific thing or person. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not you placing it on a shelf to add in some collection, but it's something that helped you mold into what you are.. or can be. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like Ortho and Yosuke. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) wasn't really talking to him but was talking to herself and tapped her chin some.* - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Uh, sure.. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I understand. - Wed Nov 25 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Good, good. - Wed Nov 25 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I've never talked to a guard this long. - Wed Nov 25 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I've become a therapist.. - Wed Nov 25 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't know what else to say and continued to stand in their -too- close position and stared up at him.* - Wed Nov 25 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: So, um.. - Wed Nov 25 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't feel anything in that moment so she was just watching him. Usually humans came and went when they pleased and didn't just stick around to stare at her so she thought everything was fine.* - Wed Nov 25 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You can ask me anything. - Wed Nov 25 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..What is it that makes you okay with being a.. 'doll'? - Wed Nov 25 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It is part of me. - Wed Nov 25 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I am made to have an owner. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I only recently became a doll though. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It was something I never heard before. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: My owner says I am his doll. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I guess I can understand that it's 'part' of you, but I'm still not sure if you're telling whether or not you're 'okay' with it. - Wed Nov 25 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) darted her eyes to the side.* - Wed Nov 25 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes it feels different than what I expected. - Wed Nov 25 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no...it's okay.. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe...don't tell him. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: We talked about this. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: What you and I discuss will only stay between us. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... - Wed Nov 25 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If.... - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I ended up on the shelf. - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....meaning... - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I was put back in the room and locked up again. - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would the guards stop it? - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Most likely not, but I'll resign from being a guard and be sure to take you out of that room and off of that shelf. - Wed Nov 25 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you make sure he's put in a room if he does that to me? - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: This...it isn't all his... it's mine.... Yosuke gave me it. - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But he's my owner so I let him have it. - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If he tries to lock me up I want him put back in his room. - Wed Nov 25 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I assure you.. if he tries to do such a thing, he'll be place in a special room. - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't...let him find out. - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He wouldn't like this. - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He would punish me. - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Punish you..? - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: In what way..? - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt like she shouldn't have said that and started to look nervous. She backed away from Hokori now and brought her arms up around her torso in a hug.* - Wed Nov 25 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) muttered and used her socked feet to swish back and forth against the tiled floor. "He makes me feel ashamed."* - Wed Nov 25 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard and saw the anger and tried to step back away from him again. "Of... of stuff... he has me do... makes me do things that are degrading so that I feel ashamed since that's the only emotion that I feel upset about."* - Wed Nov 25 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she looked up at the guard. "B-but.... but I need an owner, he's my owner. He is suppose to punish me when I'm bad."* - Wed Nov 25 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Right? - Wed Nov 25 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked solumn as she sat on the cushion with no shoes on and her dress a bit wrinkled in places from the extended wear. "It was.... interesting," she didn't really want to talk about what was on her mind. She wanted him to just look over it and think it was a trivial matter.* - Wed Nov 25 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pointed over behind the desk beside the bookshelf where she had left her heels. She looked at the bag in front of her curiously and then looked up to him.* - Wed Nov 25 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times as she had opened up the bag and saw the shorts and shirt. She was confused as she looked at the clothing but then she saw the seeds and dropped the clothing all together on the floor. "Babies!!"* - Wed Nov 25 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded some and then paused and ran her fingers over the cover of the packages. "Thirteen.... you wouldn't get a new doll and replace me... would you?"* - Wed Nov 25 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared at the ground as he hugged her. "Are you a good liar? I've met good liars...how do I know you are telling the truth?"* - Wed Nov 25 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned to look him in the eyes, since she had been studying such things in the past about what different emotions look like on a person she was very in touch with what they were feeling. She was looking for honest love, care, or lying, and ruthlessness... She was looking to understand what he felt for her in this situation.* - Wed Nov 25 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched his gaze and saw the love but did not see the care she was looking for in particular. "You do love me... so then can you tell me why you punish me? I want to understand why an owner must punish their doll."* - Wed Nov 25 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: What if.... I don't shine for you.... will you put me back into the room and lock me up? - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Never. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Will I ever, imprison you. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And you're already shining for me, Yuriko. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you enjoy punishing me - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *? - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As much, as I hated doing that mentally, forcing you like that. Phyiscally, it wasn't the same,  As it brings me pleasure. But....I believe, it'd feel greater. If we wanted it to occur, in that moment. Not of punishment, but if feeling alone. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Huh? - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But you liked holding me down. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And you smiled at making me feel ashamed. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I enjoyed it...Feeling in control. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But that gaze in your eyes, It didn't feel 'complete'. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...You could tell that I didn't like it? - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I mean... not 'didn't like it'... - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But.... just. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You weren't. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The shame feels... - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not good. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry, Yuriko, I would....like to make it up. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Some day. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: When you're ready. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned slightly, she was unsure why he was so willing to change when he was so stern before. She felt it was a test.* - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was sort of confused since he was showing so much emotion lately when he said he didn't want emotion, he said he only wanted her to have them to understand them. He was seeming more and more human to her... She sighed out and nodded to his words.* - Wed Nov 25 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him and then took his hand and grabbed her bag in the other hand to take with her.* - Wed Nov 25 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at the box with a little greenhouse set up. She looked back at him as he mentioned her removing her clothing and she wondered why he had bought her the clothing if he didn't want her to wear them. "You...don't want me to wear the clothes you got me?" She stared down into the bag, honestly she wasn't looking forward to wearing them since she didn't like pants but at the same time she wasn't so certain about being naked after the things she has been thinking about as of late.... this shame emotion was a real bitch.* - Wed Nov 25 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly to his words and slowly began to strip off her clothing. It was obvious she was feeling embarrassed but did it regardless because it ws his order...even if he didn't exactly demand it.* - Wed Nov 25 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked nodded to what he said and then she walked over and crouched beside him looking down at the dirt. "How do you do this? I have never planted anything."* - Wed Nov 25 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked as she watched him, planting was so simple. She took a bunch of seeds and started to poke her finger around in the dirt and place them around in a manner she knew would be best for the plants because of past plants talking to her! She was having a good time now as she crouched and stood, moved, and shifted... She did this several times as she walked around the garden planting the seeds. When she was finished she took the watering can and gave the perfect amount of water, it seemed like she had a natural green thumb. Once the watering had been done she then stood and flicked on the UV lamp over the garden and smiled down towards it with dirt covering parts of her nude body. "There, grow babies grow!"* - Wed Nov 25 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: . - Wed Nov 25 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had been staring at the dirt for a long time. She then looked up towards Thirteen and whispered, "They are starting to sprout!"* - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked over and sat down next to him, "if I decide to go outside, do you think it would be okay if I took a guard with me so that other's think I am safe. I don't want to show how I can fight if I can avoid it."* - Thu Nov 26 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt his arms around her and thought about it. "You and Yori both have important responsibilities, I figured you'd want someone less important but still tough to go with me." She shrugged some.* - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) twitched her lips to the side some at him asking the question this way. "I thought Hokori might be good.... He talked to me when the others guards never talk to me and he seems interesting. I like how he thinks different."* - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her lips together a bit and closed her eyes, "we talked about some stuff like how I am unique and should be proud of it. And he taught me that a pansy isnt always a flower but said the other guards are pansies without balls."* - Thu Nov 26 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) is luke warm all the time, she is neither hot bodied, nor cold. "I don't think he does necessarily, but I think he is."* - Thu Nov 26 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards what he said, she decided another guard going with them wasn't a problem because they probably would be a 'pansy' anyhow. "That sounds fair, Thirteen."* - Thu Nov 26 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't move, or even change her expression, nor open her eyes. "What curiousity?"* - Thu Nov 26 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: .....if I answer that will someone be punished? - Thu Nov 26 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you don't answer, It may be you. - Thu Nov 26 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....yes he did. - Thu Nov 26 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to know, exactly, what was said. - Thu Nov 26 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He wasn't really telling me things, I was asking questions so I could learn.... - Thu Nov 26 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Such as? - Thu Nov 26 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He told me in a general sense. - Thu Nov 26 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I asked him about owners and dolls. - Thu Nov 26 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then I asked about love. - Thu Nov 26 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then he told me sometimes owners put dolls on shelves and get new dolls. - Thu Nov 26 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Which was true. - Thu Nov 26 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: My first owner did that. - Thu Nov 26 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he showed me a mirror! - Thu Nov 26 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I am very pink. - Thu Nov 26 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded firmly.* - Thu Nov 26 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he taught me about pansies and what 'having balls' means... to have courage. - Thu Nov 26 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 26 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 26 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Did you like what you saw? - Thu Nov 26 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, a lot. - Thu Nov 26 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 26 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm glad. - Thu Nov 26 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Because, I love what I see. - Thu Nov 26 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you upset with him for talking to me? - Thu Nov 26 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't think talking to me was a bad thing. - Thu Nov 26 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says:  I don't enjoy the answers he gave you. - Thu Nov 26 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But. - Thu Nov 26 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't keep you from having your own friends, As long as you don't allow them to sway your thinking. - Thu Nov 26 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko. - Thu Nov 26 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm going to ask you a question. - Thu Nov 26 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want you to be completely honest. - Thu Nov 26 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How do you feel, about me, with your current set of emotions? - Thu Nov 26 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is it hate? - Thu Nov 26 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you despise me? - Thu Nov 26 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Have you formulated an opinion? - Thu Nov 26 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I like you...but you worry me. - Thu Nov 26 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Explain. - Thu Nov 26 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Worry me that you will put me on a shelf or lock me up and worry about when you degrade me. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That it is wrong. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But I don't know if it's really wrong. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or if a person with morals just thinks it's wrong. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I am still uncertain of morals. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Sit on my lap, Yuriko. - Thu Nov 26 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at his lap and then shuffled over to sit on his lap while she was nude. Her eyes stared off at nothing as the fact she had just said what she did, he was now asking her to sit on his lap.* - Thu Nov 26 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head towards his question, "not the lap sitting...what you had me do outside... near the ocean..how you told me...how you pulled my hands away when I was embarrassed and smiled like you liked making me uncomfortable."* - Thu Nov 26 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You are lying...... - Thu Nov 26 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Lying...? - Thu Nov 26 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why are you lying. - Thu Nov 26 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I could see how you enjoyed it. - Thu Nov 26 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: The moment hadn't started. - Thu Nov 26 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why do you feel the need to lie to someone who isn't human. - Thu Nov 26 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Do you want the truth, Yuriko? - Thu Nov 26 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Is that what you desire? - Thu Nov 26 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: I -enjoyed- it, Oh so much. I felt...Powerful...Strong...In -control-. - Thu Nov 26 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Holding you down, and doing what I wanted to...Your beautiful petite body, That closeness. - Thu Nov 26 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: It was like a drug. - Thu Nov 26 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Knowing this do you feel better? - Thu Nov 26 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that, What you wanted to know, Yuriko? - Thu Nov 26 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That I -enjoyed-, every second of it? - Thu Nov 26 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned her head away and trembled faintly on his lap. She was feeling more and more naked with each statement he made.* - Thu Nov 26 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as he began to feel over her body and then gripped her neck and bit down onto her shoulder from leaning over. She held completely still and stared from the corner of her eyes towards him. "i... it just... makes me feel...strange... like you -want- to hurt me even though you cant."* - Thu Nov 26 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was a little worried and honestly trembling heavily now as he toyed with her. She felt his hand press between her legs and force her head up and to the side. Her lips parted slightly instinctually as she felt him behind and under her. She wasn't sure if she should try to stop him... what would he do if she tried to stop him? She decided to test the waters. "Y-you like this.... a lot...w-what if I asked you to stop?" She was just wanting to see how he might react.* - Thu Nov 26 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) wasn't sure how to react as his words only confirmed her suspicions. She sat in his lap shaking drastically now in fear as her eyes downcast and she tried to lower his hand against his hand holding her neck up and extended.* - Thu Nov 26 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: On second thought, Yuriko. - Thu Nov 26 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As much as I'd like to, show you how much....Your fear, excites me. There's work we need to do first. - Thu Nov 26 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stepped out of the greenhouse room, entirely nude.* - Thu Nov 26 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly walked out completely silent without a word and stepped in front of him. She didn't have breathing to be necessary so that was another sound to make the silence. He likely only knew she exited due to the door making sound...now there was no sound as if she had left our was only closing the door of the greenhouse. She stood in front of him peering him over and staring at the edge of his tattoo.

Yuriko's bare body was fair, not a scratch on her of course... She also had high set breasts with perky pink nipples along with a smooth camel toe cleft. She continued to watch him waiting for him to open his eyes, she wondered why his eyes were closed and ignored her nudity.* - Thu Nov 26 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't seem to care that he was distraught or staring at her body for now. She simply stared up at him, "you can ease into it... you don't -have- to call me Yuriko either." She paused, "I got my owner to approve you coming out of the base with me as long as there is a second guard." She was speaking as if she wasn't naked at all.* - Thu Nov 26 08:38:49 2015
