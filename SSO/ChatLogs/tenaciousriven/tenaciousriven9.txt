<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was laying in the bed with him if she remembers right. She does not sleep but she kept her eyes closed until he might move enough to tell her he was awake.* - Thu Nov 12 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) opened her eyes nearly too soon after he had opened his own, there was no sleepiness present as she looked at them. Peering down for a moment to see how he was laying on the bed with her. "Did you sleep well?"* - Thu Nov 12 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded a short nod softly, she said nothing for the moment.* - Thu Nov 12 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: What did you, do while I was sleep? - Thu Nov 12 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I laid here, because  you were holding me. - Thu Nov 12 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I know. - Thu Nov 12 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you would have minded. - Thu Nov 12 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Would I? - Thu Nov 12 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Let's see. - Thu Nov 12 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) started to pull away so that he wasn't against her chest with his head and flush with her body.* - Thu Nov 12 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) motioned back against him.* - Thu Nov 12 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about it and then looked up to him, "I am not used to making these sort of decisions, when I don't know what to do I go to another village. People find me, they tell me what they want to do, and I end up doing them."* - Thu Nov 12 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times at him offering her people to eat and then that caused her to force out a fake chuckle because of the grim humor surrounding it.* - Thu Nov 12 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stopped her laughing and answered, "I still was never taught how to swim. I always have to stay in the shallows... but why are you okay with taking me outside?"* - Thu Nov 12 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A friend that isn't allowed to leave for four years? - Thu Nov 12 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked at him with a thin smile.* - Thu Nov 12 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ....I guess that's so, but when life gives you lemons....You throw them away, because it didn't give you sugar. - Thu Nov 12 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ---Bad joke, Not just in taste, It was horrible. - Thu Nov 12 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I don't get it. - Thu Nov 12 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: What I basically meant was... - Thu Nov 12 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: This isn't the best of situations. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: But we can take this time to make it sweeter by doing something else. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: More enjoyable. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) knew what he really meant after that.* - Thu Nov 12 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: So...What would you like to do? - Thu Nov 12 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Learn to swim like I said. - Thu Nov 12 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood up and walked over to him after climbing off the large comfortable bed. She reached out to take his hand for him to lead her, she was only wearing the sun yellow dress, no shoes, nothing else. She really didn't care either that she wasn't wearing anything else. Truthfully, Ume could be naked all the time and not care.* - Thu Nov 12 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked out to the beach with him and looked around, "This is a lake? It looks like an ocean." She sniffed the air trying to see if she could smell any mineral salts to get an idea what was up with it.* - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over at him, "Yes, I can...well sort of...I can hear whispers."* - Thu Nov 12 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked at him weirdly, "What's a swimsuit?" She was already starting to pull the dress off over her head. The first thing being shown was her long legs and then her sex, followed by her slim belly and then breasts before the dress was fully off.* - Thu Nov 12 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had watched him undress the entire time, when he finished she nodded and began to walk into the water.* - Thu Nov 12 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) turned to face Index and held her hands out to him. "While you were gone for those three days I was thinking, is your name really Index? It's a word for something other than a name."* - Thu Nov 12 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about his name as she was pulled deeper into the water. She kept her head up but didn't understand why, if this is how people swim she had to learn how to swim like them too. She was pulled around in the water assumably. "Yosuke... that name is better, why do you call yourself Index? It's like how I make a persona?"* - Thu Nov 12 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) did what he said perfectly, she didn't have balance problems like humans could have. It was as if she was a natural at it, very similar to how she was so flexible in matters in the past or how she was so reflexive when he startled her in the street. "So does that mean you have acted differently than you really are ever since I met you?"* - Thu Nov 12 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't stand on the tips of her toes, she stood normally so half her face went under water. She looked at him with eyes barely above the surface like a creeper. * - Thu Nov 12 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood on her tip toes then bounced up as she tried to do what he said, it wasn't perfect and she bounced up and down under the water and then above but after a good ten minutes she got it and was treading water.* - Thu Nov 12 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Move them h--oh. - Thu Nov 12 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded with her chin hitting the water and did what he said, she did move forward but she also ended up going downwards under water rather than remaining afloat.* - Thu Nov 12 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stayed above the water now but she looked at him curiously, "why do I have to stay above the water?" She was watching him as she tried her first few feet of swimming with his aid.* - Thu Nov 12 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and continued to let him guide her around. "So you don't remember anything about how you used to be?"* - Thu Nov 12 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt him release her hands and now she swam fairly well towards him before shifting to treading water right in front of him. "Does that mean some of the things you have said or done in front of me were lies? You are a better liar then I realized."* - Thu Nov 12 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But...how can I decide what is a lie or not from you? - Thu Nov 12 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I suppose..Through interacting and doing things. - Thu Nov 12 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then you can formulate your own thoughts on whether my feelings, what I've done and said are lies. - Thu Nov 12 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you said that it was a persona. - Thu Nov 12 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then...How about I show you the real me? - Thu Nov 12 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That would be good, if you want to. - Thu Nov 12 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was pulled up and in against him as her nude body pressed against his own so he could... pretty much feel every part of her. She looked up into his eyes with her sunflower yellow set in surprise. "You've never loved Katsune then?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded some to his words, "How long have you known Katsune?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't stop his hand, after all she wasn't like other girl's but she knew he wasn't supposed to be touching her there likely, it was like some of the pictures in the plastic book. "That's all? You've barely known her longer than you've known me."* - Thu Nov 12 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) peered downward, she understood what it was but simply looked back up at him. "Because you were happy?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was extremely light, he would easily be able to manuver her and get her atop him while floating. She would remain laying on top of him and wasn't sure why he had done this but perhaps it was comfortable for him? "Are you yourself with her?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded against his chest, "why would you change yourself for someone? Just be yourself, if they don't like that then you shouldn't be with them. I say that but I change myself all the time to suite people's preferences in my looks and fake personality, but I suppose I am an exception because for now until your scientist's change me ... I am blank."* - Thu Nov 12 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought on this and nodded, "The second one, the first time you saw what I really am on the outside was when the scientists were there. I guess I acted mostly like myself too but the female was bothering me so I guess meaner than normal."* - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about that last comment. "You like girl's who are aggitated easily? Does that mean you like when I threaten to kill the scientists?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him as she could feel how his sex was pulsing with heat between them, she appeared unphased. "What does Katsune look like? Does she look like a bad girl?"* - Thu Nov 12 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes and laid her head on his chest, "Do you like me because I look like her?"* - Thu Nov 12 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned, "you are lying."* - Thu Nov 12 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought it over with her eyes still closed, "if I was human I expect this would have drastically upset me."* - Thu Nov 12 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged atop him which made her entire body move because of how she was laying, likely giving him 'issues' below. "No need to remember, but it does put into perspective how you act around me, and I suspect if your scientists do give me feelings it might hurt me later. Course that is years later, maybe it won't."* - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled then, "you remember the girl that you killed me as? Her name was Ajisai, she was a hot head rude samurai." She chuckled lightly, "I tried to play a game with Ortho where I pretended not to be Ume and he was trying to figure out if I really was Ume or just someone he saw similiarities in, I went as far as to drink sake. It was terrible, course you knew I didn't like it. That time was the only reason I was willing to drink it when we played the second game."* - Thu Nov 12 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about that personality, "I liked her better than Owari. Owari was... well a beginning... a new beginning. I even named her The Beginning of the End... but Ajisai was fun, she didn't care what other's said and was only nice or respectful when it suited her. Owari was almost always nice with a cursing habit. Hard to uphold with all the people I ran into that knew Ume." She was just talking to talk but now quieted. "Would it be easier for you if I changed what I look like? So that I don't look like Katsune?"* - Thu Nov 12 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) opened her eyes and looked at him, "Do you want me to stay looking like her or change?"* - Thu Nov 12 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then closed her eyes and began to concentrate. "Close your eyes," was pretty much ordered to him. She wanted it to be a bit of a surprise to see how he might react. She began to morph atop of him regardless if he closed them or not. Soon enough a much more busty red head lay atop him with her same very pale skin but with fairly pink lips, red eyes, and red hair with brigh blondy orange highlights within, it was short but not as short as Owari's had been. She was also about the same height as before but much curvier.* - Thu Nov 12 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded after peering down at herself, "Okay you can open."* - Thu Nov 12 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked with her lips forming an 'o' as she looked at him. "Take it you like this look?"* - Thu Nov 12 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled warmly, "I'm glad you enjoy it." She was silent and then laid her head back down on his chest and adjusted herself atop him since his bulge was digging into her, of course it didn't hurt but it was strange feeling from the pressure. "Will Katsune come visit the fort?"* - Thu Nov 12 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded some, "are you doing alright?"* - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: N-Not quite... - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I-I'm...confined. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Confined? - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm just laying on top of you. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And you put me here. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: N-No...In...m-my boxers. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's a problem? - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rolled off of him into the water, "I don't know why you allowed yourself to suffer then."* - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-You won't mind...I-If I t-take it off? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...why would I? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared hard.* - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked up to his eyes, "oh it is? I didn't know that."* - Thu Nov 12 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that why you always look away? - Thu Nov 12 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and then forced herself to divert her eyes to the side.* - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked back up, "Oh. I didn't know there was a 'too late' for that." She looked back down to his 'problem' and then back up to his face. "What does that mean?"* - Thu Nov 12 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Mornin'....Ume. - Thu Nov 12 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lay there on the bed, had he slept in the room again?* - Thu Nov 12 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: sleep* - Thu Nov 12 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The scientists never came. - Thu Nov 12 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 12 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do you want to...Start with that today? - Thu Nov 12 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You said you had something to show me or tell me today. - Thu Nov 12 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: O-Oh yeah. - Thu Nov 12 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Remember...The problem I had...in the water yesterday...? - Thu Nov 12 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 12 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Not really a problem. - Thu Nov 12 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It was....a stupid idea...To begin with....It's really embarrassing to think about it...Let alone ask.. - Thu Nov 12 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....  - Thu Nov 12 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Speak. - Thu Nov 12 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I was wondering...If next time...You could 'help'...M-Me with it.. - Thu Nov 12 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at him, "do you think I don't know what that is or what it entails?"* - Thu Nov 12 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him carefully, "You don't intend to let Ortho visit ever."* - Thu Nov 12 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you though? - Thu Nov 12 20:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why is that? - Thu Nov 12 20:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I wasn't trying to tell you to stop. - Thu Nov 12 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was trying to get you to understand your own actions... and what they could do. - Thu Nov 12 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You seemed like you wanted to repair things with Ortho before, at the very least for me... but now you are doing things that would make Ortho hate you. - Thu Nov 12 20:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: But you'd prefer if he was here, wouldn't you? - Thu Nov 12 20:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I just want to live in the -now- with the person beside me. - Thu Nov 12 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head, "can you find out if Ortho went back to Marrisa?"* - Thu Nov 12 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I can. - Thu Nov 12 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think the scientists should get to work. - Thu Nov 12 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: A...Alright.. - Thu Nov 12 21:02:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...you don't have to leave? - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned at how he was acting.* - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and went over to the cabinet. She pulled off the red dress and she hadn't had any undergarments on because honestly she didn't like wearing them but out in public she thought it was a necessity since Yosuke had made her wear them. Pulling on the hospital gown she walked back over and sat on the bed next to Yosuke.* - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) saw the new doctor enter and blinked a few times, "You aren't the doctor from before. Yes, that's fine." She liked how this one acted though and simply watched her and waited.* - Thu Nov 12 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) laid back onto the bed with her hands at her sides, palms down, against the comforter. She stared up at the ceiling for a moment before aiming to watch the woman carefully.* - Thu Nov 12 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt the hand but nothing cold since she couldn't feel cold. When the woman told her to take a deep breath she looked at her strange, "I do not need to breath nor cough, I do not get sick."* - Thu Nov 12 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rose up and flipped over so she was laying on her stomach with her head off to the side to still watch the doctor. "No, I can control every part of me at the same time."* - Thu Nov 12 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) waited while feeling what she was doing, "No, not until they are fully formed into an entity, but I can feel them. I can feel the sample I gave away."* - Thu Nov 12 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 's hair would appear very real.* - Thu Nov 12 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt her ass spread and remembered what this meant to people like Ortho and Yosuke. She turned her head to look at him while she spoke to the doctor, "it isn't real hair, it is part of me. I've told the other scientists several times that I am all one thing, nothing else, just one thing." She would have a tight little pucker that was porn star beautiful, all thanks to a magazine she looked at, not to mention her vagina also was the 'perfect pussy' and bare of course. When the doctor asked another question that was similar to the question about saliva she sighed out which by what she said earlier clearly was faked, "No I do not."* - Thu Nov 12 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rolled over after a glance at Yosuke and stood up at the edge of the bed and put her feet together for whatever the doctor wanted.* - Thu Nov 12 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was being groped all over but didn't mind. She wanted to get to stuff that actually would be working on her to have emotions but she supposed this might help figure out what she was. "Will this all help to find out what I am? Or is it just strange tests that humans do?" she bent over to touch her toes perfectly without any issue or bend of the knee. Her ass high in the air and of course her sex being revealed to Yosuke openly.* - Thu Nov 12 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about it, "technically I can but it takes more energy and energy production and cell production takes time... I wouldn't be able to do it instantly and freely. Once the mass is created it also can't be reduced again, it would have to be compressed which takes even more time. Every time I make myself shorter, usually I compensate by adding features such as larger chest or behind or thicker legs to make up for the height difference to equal out, I do not like to compress as it's energy wasteful."* - Thu Nov 12 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) simply watched the woman, "both, I can turn myself whatever color I want." She then looked the doctor over wondering when the real science shit was going to happen.* - Thu Nov 12 22:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right.... - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over at Yosuke with a half lidded look.* - Thu Nov 12 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat down on the bed, "why are these scientists working so slow?"* - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So they are idiots in other words? - Thu Nov 12 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If they haven't seen anything like me shouldn't they be in here twenty four seven poking and prodding me? - Thu Nov 12 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That's what i expected. - Thu Nov 12 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Maybe they should be, but I trust in their process. - Thu Nov 12 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...you control them... make them work faster. - Thu Nov 12 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 's face folded into a frown, "I rather it be two years than four..."* - Thu Nov 12 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: At least not for me. - Thu Nov 12 22:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So are you going to get over feeling bad for saying and doin things you want? - Thu Nov 12 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I think I should...Feeling sorry for myself isn't the best feeling. - Thu Nov 12 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....why do you feel sorry for yoursellf? - Thu Nov 12 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Because...I feel like I'm becomming a being...Of Desire. - Thu Nov 12 22:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched as he sat her hand on his thigh and was stuck in a moment of thought. Did she really want to do this? She then peered up to Yosuke, "Did you find out anything about Marrisa and Ortho?"* - Sat Nov 14 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded with her hand still on his thigh.* - Sat Nov 14 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shifted close over against him so they were thigh to thigh, her hand still resting on his own.* - Sat Nov 14 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt him pull her in and the kiss pressure on her shoulder, she said nothing because she honestly wasn't sure of all this.* - Sat Nov 14 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I want to care but I don't. - Sat Nov 14 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I won't force you....If you feel like you shouldn't... - Sat Nov 14 01:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I mean I want to care that Ortho will be hurt.... - Sat Nov 14 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Can we...wait...just to see if he moves on possibly? It's only been... a few weeks. - Sat Nov 14 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: The dice one right..? - Sat Nov 14 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh I thought you did things when I roll. - Sat Nov 14 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) leaned forward and then licked from below his belly button up to as high as he had lifted his shirt. He tasted a tiny bit salty...* - Sat Nov 14 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Chest...Wild card.. - Sat Nov 14 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over at him quietly after having sat back up.* - Sat Nov 14 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched his hands go to her chest and licked over her lips while breathing a bit heavier to simulate pleasure. She had been watching others how they acted and while he was groping her she did this to add effect to his arrousal. After he had pulled away she picked up the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) made a weird face and looked at him. "Are you going to freak out if I lick your foot?"* - Sat Nov 14 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ..Will you take off your shoe? - Sat Nov 14 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can lick your shoe...but.. you were weird about it last time. - Sat Nov 14 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ....Would you...prefer I did? - Sat Nov 14 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's your choice. - Sat Nov 14 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: His foot would taste good though.... - Sat Nov 14 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: His stomach was good tasting.... - Sat Nov 14 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) crouched down low and licked his foot from toes to ankle like she did to his stomach in a slow manner. When she sat back up she looked entirely unphased, in fact her tongue was tingling at the taste, she realized this was dangerous to be licking him so much... he tasted good.* - Sat Nov 14 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at him after he rolled the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To what? - Sat Nov 14 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) found it boring also to poke a leg, but then again poke could be very risky with some things but the areas he chose just didn't fit well with it.* - Sat Nov 14 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Hm.... - Sat Nov 14 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I don't know actually...After the next round...Want to mix the choices up a bit? - Sat Nov 14 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sure. - Sat Nov 14 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rolled the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Chest...rub.. - Sat Nov 14 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) leaned closer to him and realized she was really far away facing him. She scooched over next to him and then reached up his shirt unlike he had done because he had moved his clothing every time for her and she wouldn't have minded if he did the same to her but he just hadn't. She used her fingers to trail up his chest and began to rub slowly and then deeper as she watched him, it was something similiar to a massage because she really didn't know what she was doing.* - Sat Nov 14 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: That feels nice? - Sat Nov 14 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) whispers: Y-Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) continued on for a while before slowly lowering her hand back to her lap.* - Sat Nov 14 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...But you said you were going to change that. - Sat Nov 14 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: That's true... - Sat Nov 14 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: While we're at it...Want to re-arrange the rolls completely? - Sat Nov 14 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Well namely...The body parts and a few actions.. - Sat Nov 14 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sure. - Sat Nov 14 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Stomach...To...To...Crotch... - Sat Nov 14 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And...Face....To lips? - Sat Nov 14 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sat Nov 14 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I have a question. - Sat Nov 14 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Huh? - Sat Nov 14 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I've wondered this for a while. - Sat Nov 14 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You and Ortho are very strong, and even if I don't fight hardly ever you are both clearly much stronger than me but neither of you have just -taken- what you wanted from me. I am unsure why. - Sat Nov 14 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: That's.... - Sat Nov 14 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Not as rewarding. - Sat Nov 14 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It's more interesting to chase,....The hunt. - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But then I would have to act like prey. - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do I act like prey? - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You're unique...But...It wouldn't be exciting... - Sat Nov 14 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Or fun. - Sat Nov 14 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: If we forced you. - Sat Nov 14 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Or if I did at least.. - Sat Nov 14 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This thought had grown quite strong especially at the ocean. - Sat Nov 14 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This thought grew very strong, especially when we were at the ocean. - Sat Nov 14 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It grew strong in the ocean...? - Sat Nov 14 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...when you had your problem. - Sat Nov 14 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You didn't act. - Sat Nov 14 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You could have. - Sat Nov 14 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I could have...Yeah...But I didn't like the thought of forcing myself on you. - Sat Nov 14 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I would have to have feelings to reject it right? - Sat Nov 14 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Or feel wrong? - Sat Nov 14 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It felt wrong for me. - Sat Nov 14 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sat Nov 14 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What other things are you changing on the game? - Sat Nov 14 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Uh... - Sat Nov 14 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: R-Ready to continue? - Sat Nov 14 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 14 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Foot rub. - Sat Nov 14 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) craned her head, "like the chest yeah?"* - Sat Nov 14 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: U-Uh...Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then shifted in front of him and lifted his foot as she started to massage his right foot along the arch. She wasn't being rough but if she saw he wasn't responding much she would apply more pressure but assured not to hurt him, not that she could hurt him if she wanted to.* - Sat Nov 14 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This doesn't bother  me, when do you want me to do it? - Sat Nov 14 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Hm...Who knoes~. - Sat Nov 14 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What did you roll? - Sat Nov 14 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...you changed poke. - Sat Nov 14 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Hm..? - Sat Nov 14 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Wait...what. - Sat Nov 14 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You changed other things but not poke. - Sat Nov 14 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) squinted.* - Sat Nov 14 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ---Yeah I'm stupid. - Sat Nov 14 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Slipped my mind for a moment.. - Sat Nov 14 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Make it.... remove clothing for that area - Sat Nov 14 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down at herself, that meant pulling her skirt up high.* - Sat Nov 14 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched how he was reacting, learning from it in fact. She could practically hear his heart thumping even. She took the dice and rolled them making sure to keep her legs fully exposed and directly beside him, the teasing factor that her pussy was almost exposed likely playing tricks on the man.* - Sat Nov 14 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn... - Sat Nov 14 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) twitched her lips in thought and then slowly rose his shirt, she wasn't going to tell him what she was going to do. She wanted to see how he acted when it was unexpected. As his chest was revealed to show his nipples and the definition of his shape she ran her fingers gently over his pecs and then brushed her finger tips over his right nipple and then down along his abs before leaning in and sucking at his nipple with a small bite that might be nearing the edge of too rough depending on what Yosuke liked. She hadn't meant to....it was just growing so tempting to feed and he tasted so good so she had chosen to taste him again. Her tongue lapped over the sensitive area before licking across his chest to the other one as she had to practically sit in his lap to get to it as a tiny sighful moan sounded in appreciation of his taste.* - Sat Nov 14 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: More pressure means gasp. - Sat Nov 14 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) pulled away from him and licked over her lips. "Was that okay?"* - Sat Nov 14 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Lick...your leg. - Sat Nov 14 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him curiously.* - Sat Nov 14 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat there as he licked up her inner leg. He would easily be able to see her smooth white sex as he traveled up but she said nothing but increase her breathing the closer he got to her high inner thigh.* - Sat Nov 14 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) reached out for the dice regardless if he was still holding her leg. She rolled them to see what was next.* - Sat Nov 14 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Nnngn.... - Sat Nov 14 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Becoming hard to control. - Sat Nov 14 03:47:50 2015
