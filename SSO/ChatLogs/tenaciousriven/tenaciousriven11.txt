<br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: So what do you do, besides talk to plants when alone? - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...just think. - Thu Nov 19 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You used a Ninjutsu to break my chains earlier...Are you a shinobi? - Thu Nov 19 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, shinobi's like teaching me. - Thu Nov 19 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How do you know what ninjutsu is? - Thu Nov 19 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Books. - Thu Nov 19 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that how you learned how to use genjutsu? - Thu Nov 19 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yes and no. - Thu Nov 19 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) simply sat there watching him.* - Thu Nov 19 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded while staring straight at his groin and then looked up to his eyes. She stood up and walked out to find his bed on the other side of the room from hers, clothing for him put in the closet next to her own, and huge trays of food laid out for him of all types of cultures, there was no alcohol.* - Thu Nov 19 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat down at the table across from him and watched him eating, but then wondered if that was rude and looked at the fresh plants that had been brought it and began to speak to them telepathically.* - Thu Nov 19 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was sitting at a table just like thirteen was so they had chairs at least. When he patted the ground beside him she cocked her head and then went and sat on the floor next to his chair. It wasn't weird to her because  of who she was. "No it doesn't hurt."* - Thu Nov 19 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stood up as he  pulled her and she sat on his knee, of course this meant her sex was against his thigh. "No, I don't feel pain. Not when I'm normal, but the scientists made me feel pain once with chemicals. I just replicate my cells and change them rapidly."* - Thu Nov 19 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Not that I'm aware of. - Thu Nov 19 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you don't eat food, does your body need supplements along with the bodies? - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't -need- the bodies. I crave them. - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm...Almost like a treat? Or dessert? - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you think you can help me train? - Thu Nov 19 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes probably. - Thu Nov 19 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tell me about your past? - Thu Nov 19 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What about it? - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was born two years ago. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well... 'born'. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was made. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Like I was...? - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn..no. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think you started out human. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You were born. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know how they made me. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And I never was little like humans start. - Thu Nov 19 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You were created to this size? - Thu Nov 19 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was sitting in front of her plants, in silence. Eyes closed and chin lifted as she sat there in all her nudity and spoke with them.* - Fri Nov 20 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) opened her eyes as he touched her shoulder, not the least bit surprised by him sitting next to her. "How did you know they talk to me? I didn't tell you that."* - Fri Nov 20 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just how they feel right now. - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They don't like being in here...but I try to make them as happy as I can. - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You run this place, you could take them outside couldn't you? - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes but I brought them in here to keep me company. - Fri Nov 20 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's true. - Fri Nov 20 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well what are you in the mood for today? - Fri Nov 20 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought I would let you decide, and we could give the experiments a rest for the day...so you can recover. - Fri Nov 20 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd appreciate that. - Fri Nov 20 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You said yesterday we could make our own game. - Fri Nov 20 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Any ideas? - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I am not very good at ideas. - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Why not go swimming or something of the sorts? - Fri Nov 20 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn...no, no swimming today. - Fri Nov 20 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Fri Nov 20 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What would other people have been asking you to do? - Fri Nov 20 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ..I don't know. - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why are you concerned about other people? - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's a good question. - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't know why I'm concerned with them. - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Would you like to plant a Garden at some point? - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That would be nice. - Fri Nov 20 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't mind him sitting like this at all. She turned her head to look at him from the side as he questioned her. "Yes, travel...talk to people... some people liked to teach me."* - Fri Nov 20 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down at his hands resting below her fake belly button. "Taught me ninjutsu, how to fight...stuff like that... none of them taught me how to read, they liked reading to me."* - Fri Nov 20 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded as she stared up at the plants and wondered if he knew what he was doing since he didn't know what sex was or if he was just following human instincts. It was going to be interesting to watch him and how he behaved. "I would like you to read to me...teaching me also would be good, I like learning."* - Fri Nov 20 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "They have only read me lessons, not stories. I would like to hear stories." She now was staring down at his hands in wonder.* - Fri Nov 20 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to his question. She watched his hands move, but his scars were not interesting to her as she had already seen them, she was interested in his actions.* - Fri Nov 20 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched his hands and could feel his heart racing. She knew what was happening and could tell by his pauses he was getting confused. Nodding along to his story she listened intently and was already learning since she didn't know that many people couldn't use chakra.* - Fri Nov 20 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) listened intently but was watching his hands move over her thighs and wondered when he might figure out where to touch and when he might figure out why he felt the way he did.* - Fri Nov 20 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: OP - Fri Nov 20 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) found this story extremely interesting and his hands were forgotten as she turned her head to watch his eyes and lips as he told the story.* - Fri Nov 20 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) could feel the pressure against her 'sex' but said nothing and didn't react to his touches like might be expected. She didn't want to give him any context clues, but wanted him to figure out what he liked and why he liked it. "Did they like her performance?"* - Fri Nov 20 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched his eyes and the confusion mixing with lust. "Is that the end?"* - Fri Nov 20 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to his question. * - Fri Nov 20 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) turned and faced her so her legs were now on the outside of his rather than the inside like they were before when she was facing away from him. This meant of course her legs were spread small amount directly in front of him.* - Fri Nov 20 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked at his eyes and where they went over her body. She could tell he was learning, and the fact she could learn while he was learning was interesting to her. When he looked up to her she craned her head to the side, "What is it?"* - Fri Nov 20 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't mean to scare you. - Fri Nov 20 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I-It's fine... - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: My body... is acting weird... - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: My heart....is racing. - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It feels....hot.... - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you like it? - Fri Nov 20 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I....think so.. - Fri Nov 20 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to...touch you....And to have you touch me....Is that...weird? - Fri Nov 20 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Im confused how you can already come to this conclusion when you have never seen a female body and were locked away in that room. - Fri Nov 20 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's weird.... - Fri Nov 20 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It feels....like....like... - Fri Nov 20 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Instinct maybe...? - Fri Nov 20 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can touch me. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You already were. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't feel anything though. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you can't hurt me or make me feel positive like you feel. - Fri Nov 20 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Can't feel....anything? - Fri Nov 20 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I don't have a nervous system. - Fri Nov 20 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I feel pressure, that's it. - Fri Nov 20 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked several times as he so forwardly pushed her back onto the floor and climbed atop her. "Because you are human," that was the only answer she would give him. But she added on, "at least in this aspect it seems." She smiled faintly in her faked way and waited to see what else he would do. He seemed fairly agressive, but she wasn't worried about him harming her.* - Fri Nov 20 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt him running his hand over her body and then when he looked into her eyes and demanded essentially that she not call him human she nodded against his lips. "Okay, you aren't human," the pressure didn't hurt her at all.. but it showed her how serious he was.* - Fri Nov 20 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wouldn't taste like anything at all, he would just feel the softness of her skin. She lifted her chin and turned her head away so he had more room to roam with his tongue and wondered what he was doing, none of the others really did anything like this. She found it interesting...* - Fri Nov 20 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) felt the bite for sure and watched him from the corner of her eyes. She felt him moving her body to his whim and found it interesting how he didn't care about her feelings she lacked or could feel because he just -wanted- to do this. The others were not this way and she kind of enjoyed that she didn't have to tell this boy what he could and couldn't do since he just did what he wanted. The others were always trying to make sure things were okay...and right now the fact she didn't have emotions, sort of was nice.* - Fri Nov 20 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched curiously as soon as he shifted downwards. She saw how he started out slow and then got more intense about it. She could feel how aroused he was from the pressre to her inner thigh and it was very... interesting to say the least. "Uh....are you...enjoying yourself?"* - Fri Nov 20 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him go back to sucking the nipple and when he started to move lower with his face she was surprised, no one else had done this. Though when he spoke up it broke her out of her learning trance. "It's more interesting when I let you see what you want to do and try things. I've never met someone that didn't know what to do." She continued to lay still on the ground for him with only her head slightly lifted to look at him. She watched intently, not scared of if he would grow angry that she wouldn't help.* - Sat Nov 21 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) could only feel when his tongue and fingers touched her. She remained still and listening out for him as her toes curled and uncurled as her legs rested across his back from laying over his shoulders. Her gaze watched his head shift around and she was going to eventually tell him what to do if he couldn't figure it out. She wondered if all this licking actually pleased him, since it did nothing to her. He clearly had an oral fetish of some sort...* - Sat Nov 21 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you like licking me? - Sat Nov 21 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I figured it was something only for human females since no one else tried this. - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I.... - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Think so. - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) decided to give him a little bit of guidance, "take off your shorts."* - Sat Nov 21 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wouldn't tell him anything else and only watched him.* - Sat Nov 21 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was truly wondering how he was figuring all of this out. She didn't resist him taking her hand and wrapping it about his manhood, she held onto the length even after he removed his hand as his hips moved back and forth and she was surprised at his deduction skills. It was as if he was instinctively aware of what to do even though she wasn't a human, and he claimed not to be. * - Sat Nov 21 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched his pleasure the entire time in wonder and when he told her to sit up she sat up almonst instantly. Looking over to him curiously all the same at what he had planned now.* - Sat Nov 21 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....you want me to eat you? - Sat Nov 21 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked confused now.* - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No.... - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want you to try....sucking like I did your breasts.. - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) formed an 'o' with her lips in realization and then opened her mouth wide and leaned in before forming a tight suction. She could easily morpher her mouth to fit his girth and length easily and down her 'throat' he went as she sucked away and stared up at him wondering if this was enjoyable, why hadn't the others had her do it?* - Sat Nov 21 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: . - Sat Nov 21 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was laying in her own bed staring at the ceiling while thinking about the story he had told her the night before.* - Sat Nov 21 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "no, I'm thinking about the story you told me. It isn't one I thought was possible. I learned quite a lot from it." She would have said thank you, but didn't think it would matter to someone like him.* - Sat Nov 21 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) let him rest his head on her chest, assumably. "Apparently, when there is something that isn't human but looks human and something that probably is human who denies being human." A sly smile tugged at her lips.* - Sat Nov 21 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards his comment, "we can go outside now if you'd like." She stayed silent for a while, "I honestly hadn't taken you outside because I thought you might run away.... I don't feel I own you like how the guards said I do but.... I would like someone to talk to here, and you are interesting."* - Sat Nov 21 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to his reply, "we can take it slow... you decide when we go out, and where we go. I have never really walked anywhere but the halls of this building so I don't know if you really want to go searching through rooms, it might end badly."* - Sat Nov 21 12:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked, "that is up to you, you said you didn't feel whole. I will... probably continue to seek my emotions because it means making me whole, even if they will probably hurt me more than benefit me now with my two friends gone."* - Sat Nov 21 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned, "no you have to decide what you want because then they will just do whatever they want. They get out of hand, they did it to you for all these years and they tried to do it to me as soon as Yosuke was named dead."* - Sat Nov 21 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded towards him and wrapped an arm around him as he moved in against her side. "You are free now, we are only staying here because we want to stay here. Right? Remember that, Thirteen.--" She cut off and thought, "do you not want a name? Like a human name?"* - Sat Nov 21 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times at him asking her to name him, "Sure... I'm good at making up new names. I have to have new names sometimes. I've been Ume... Ajisai.... Owari...Chi--" she cut off as a flash of the emotions she felt before clouded her mind and she zoned out staring at the ceiling. She had just stopped.* - Sat Nov 21 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) eventually whispered, "Chihiro..." She didn't say anything else or look at him.* - Sat Nov 21 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) couldn't be comforted, her mind was splitting just a tiny bit between love and hate and cruelty. She couldn't stop thinking about Ortho and Yosuke, what it must have looked like for him to lay there dead and how Ortho had done it. She wished she could have been there to see... there was part of her who enjoyed the image but another part of her who was hurt by seeing the two she cared about most destroying each other, two brothers. Soon enough she turned to look at him, "I'm surprised you aren't staring at the plants since you've never been outside. Do you not find them interesting?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe we should go train... - Sat Nov 21 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You keep saying that so I feel you are unsure of yourself. - Sat Nov 21 15:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you want to go outside? - Sat Nov 21 15:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Then lets go. - Sat Nov 21 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) jumped up and went to open the door. It was no longer locked from the outside and she opened it up, ready to go out into the world buck naked.* - Sat Nov 21 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well don't go having a panic attack. - Sat Nov 21 16:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) took his hand and began to lead him through the large fort up to the surface to go outdoors towars the ocean.* - Sat Nov 21 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) remained silent and held his hand, the tightness of course not bothering her as she waited and watched his reaction. She already was speaking to the plants in the area.* - Sat Nov 21 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) noddedto what he said, "it doesn't really end, nope." She wasn't sure what else to say since he was holding her hand so she didn't move.* - Sat Nov 21 16:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know how to swim. - Sat Nov 21 16:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... you do a lot of leg kicking and arm swooping stuff. - Sat Nov 21 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Leg kick...swooping...? - Sat Nov 21 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't understand - Sat Nov 21 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'll show you...but you should be careful because I can just show you I don't know how to teach you like they did.  - Sat Nov 21 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked out into the water and then began to swim around with her legs kicking and arms gliding through the ocean water.* - Sat Nov 21 16:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) paused in the water and began to tread water while looking at him. "How about you just don't go too deep?"* - Sat Nov 21 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Uh....That works... - Sat Nov 21 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) swam about and then neared him and took both of his hands to make him more confident. "Yeah, I know...but now you are free, you can see anything you want. The world is yours to see."* - Sat Nov 21 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Good. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 21 17:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) pulled him up the cliff and then laid back on the grass beside him on her back. She closed her eyes and listened to him speak. * - Sat Nov 21 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled some as he sat on top of her stomach and started to question her, "no the seasons change. It gets cold, hot, warm, cool...snow, rain, wind."* - Sat Nov 21 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You will just have to experience them, I don't know how to describe them how you will experience them. - Sat Nov 21 17:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, sometimes it's brown. - Sat Nov 21 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Really? - Sat Nov 21 17:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If we train together...What kind of stuff will you show me? - Sat Nov 21 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you want to learn? - Sat Nov 21 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Everything! - Sat Nov 21 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh.. - Sat Nov 21 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well.. - Sat Nov 21 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yosuke left me some stuff behind to learn... - Sat Nov 21 17:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Really? - Sat Nov 21 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 21 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to... - Sat Nov 21 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was surprised about how he was acting. "I have been wondering," she felt him hugging her tightly and simply continued to speak. "Sometimes you seem... 'mean' and demanding. Why are you like that and then like this?"* - Sat Nov 21 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) reached down and held his shoulder down tightly like he had done to her the night before. "Like this, and then you told me what to do very seriously."* - Sat Nov 21 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about his response, "so you don't feel like acting that way except when you -really- want something to happen?"* - Sat Nov 21 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) released his shoulder and simply lay there under him. "It's interesting....I find it interesting."* - Sat Nov 21 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you mean? - Sat Nov 21 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: What does that have to do with what we are talking about? - Sat Nov 21 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, there is nothing. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And even what I know I won't tell you. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....You..know stuff? - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Watching you is entertaining. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Entertaining...? - Sat Nov 21 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Sat Nov 21 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched his hands move over her body and how he pet her, she never had anyone who enjoyed it so much. Nodding slowly to his words, "Yes, I will... but you will have to go places I want to go to."* - Sat Nov 21 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared back up at him with her pink and brown eyes. "You changed the topic, why?"* - Sat Nov 21 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I find it interesting when you do those things. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We don't have to talk about it. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can just....do them. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't stop you from talking about it. Not if you want. - Sat Nov 21 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need to talk about it. - Sat Nov 21 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head so he can kiss her neck easily. When he told her to lay atop him she sat up and climbed atop him before resting so that her arms were holding her up some, "I don't weight very much...but I don't know if you want me to put the weight I have on you or not." She stared down at him, "you being mean or demanding aren't imperfections either."* - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) released her arms but she hardly put anymore weight on him than she already was. "Nope."* - Sat Nov 21 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably bad ones... - Sat Nov 21 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rested her head against his chest as she felt the pressure from him forcing her hips down and then how he kissed her cheek. "You don't ever need to thank me."* - Sat Nov 21 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared off over the grass as he pet her head and groped her, "why do you do that? Pet my hair? No one else did that."* - Sat Nov 21 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "you can't make me uncomfortable, at least not yet." * - Sat Nov 21 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit and looked up to him, "You want me to have emotions?" She was curious quite a lot by this fact, more curious than she ever had been. * - Sat Nov 21 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked as she stared at him and then whispered, "you want me to feel the bad emotions too?"* - Sat Nov 21 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't understand them without feeling them. - Sat Nov 21 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to what he said and then to the second part she growled slightly, "No, I like whatever I am. I want to understand it."* - Sat Nov 21 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) did not understand very much at the moment.* - Sat Nov 21 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I like what I am but I still want emotions. - Sat Nov 21 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So ....I still want to be something more. - Sat Nov 21 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There's a difference between trying to change your race, and trying to aquire something to better yourself. - Sat Nov 21 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I see. - Sat Nov 21 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Ume let's go and train for a bit? - Sat Nov 21 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess. - Sat Nov 21 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought she had already answered this question before and stood up and then looked to his hand before walking forward towards the fort. "It is cruel, dangerous, corrupt, just filled with pain... I haven't seen anything good come out of it yet other than the people."* - Sat Nov 21 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sighed out gently in thought, "something called the Gezo." She watched him dressing and wondered why.* - Sat Nov 21 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "I don't know, I just know they run things." She followed him into the room and watched him begin to dress. She was curious what he was doing, "What...are you doing?"* - Sat Nov 21 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked in shock as she watched him take charge. "I...uh.." she didn't know how to even reply at first at the sudden change. "You aren't going to kill anymore of them are you? Yosuke left them to me." She twitched her lips some and then watched as he finished dressing himself. "Yeah, I'll have the one outside look into it." She looked over to her vast closet of all kinds of clothing from casual, combat, to fancy wear. "Uhm... sure."* - Sat Nov 21 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared at the extremely professional looking outfit. "Ive never worn anything like that before... I will wear what you want. Why do you want me to wear something?" She had always walked around naked in here.* - Sat Nov 21 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) frowned, "but I just eat them if they betray me, they know that."* - Sat Nov 21 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought on what he was saying and stared at the outfit. "Why is it so plain?" She sighed out and then started to put the boring outfit on he set out for her. She had never worn -pants- before, only dresses.* - Sat Nov 21 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat the clothing back down and walked over to the closet with him. "I never choose my clothing, if you want me to wear those I will...."* - Sat Nov 21 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: .."This is your time to tell me what you want*" - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked over his selections, "I've only wore dresses and I don't like the undergarments."* - Sat Nov 21 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and nodded before trying to take the dress from him to pull on. After she was in the dress she shifted to look over at him.* - Sat Nov 21 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He's using different pronouns now. - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: 'our' - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: 'we' - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and took his hand as she lead him out of the room and told the nearest guard to look into the Gezo while they headed down to the research department.* - Sat Nov 21 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit as he mentioned recruiting. "Recruiting who for what?" She was now as lost as him, she didn't know where she was going.* - Sat Nov 21 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wondered how he knew they had an army since she didn't get it. Maybe he was more intelligent and was reading into things he had seen around the base. "We...have an army?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to him as she held onto his hand and was assumably led into the room. She knew there had to be more than a hundred guards, she had seen more than that when Yosuke brought her in but said nothing.* - Sat Nov 21 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to Thirteen to continue, she wasn't even sure what they were going to find..or what she should look for. Her gaze traveled over each person in the room and her hand holding his gripped lightly.* - Sat Nov 21 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He seems to know what he's doing. - Sat Nov 21 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was pulled along as Thirteen progressed further. The blood made her hungry and she inhaled deeply and her eyes dilated as she watched. It was obvious that the emotions of cruelty and hate were surfacing as she watched Thirteen and began to smile wide. She said nothing, did nothing... as long as the scientists did what they were told.* - Sat Nov 21 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) quickly shot her had out as she spotted the needle. All of her focus was on the scientist now and she gripped his throat tightly enough he couldn't breath. "If you don't want to know what it feels like to be eaten alive... I suggest you drop that and gather your notes for Thirteen." She squeezed tighter until he would release the needle, if he would.* - Sat Nov 21 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) 's eye twitched as they were called freaks. She was growing irritated and nodded as she released his hand and started to walk towards the scientist who dared call them freaks.* - Sat Nov 21 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) growled as she approached him and took ahold of his shoulders before widening her jaw and beginning to swallow him whole from the head down. She easily did so in a few minutes time. Panic was expected but after she had finished she turned to look over towards Thirteen with a demonic gaze of enjoying the kill she just had. "Get to work.... he asked for the notes, give them to him. Yosuke left me ownership and you will do as we say."* - Sat Nov 21 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) had her fists clenched, usually eating sated her but the hate that was inside of her wasn't allowing her to feel refreshed. "Nngng..." she felt the pressure of the kiss on her forehead and nodded sublty as she blinked in a slow manner. It was obvious how on edge she was at the moment.* - Sat Nov 21 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head at his question, "no...not hungry...ngng.." She twitched some and growled lightly as she tried to keep under control and shot ugly glares at a few of the scientists.* - Sat Nov 21 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked with him, gripping his hand whether he took her's or not. She was glaring at everyone who crossed her vision other than Thirteen. When they were about to her room she looked at one of the guards. "Find me the papers Yosuke left behind showing I am owner of what he has... I want to know everything."* - Sat Nov 21 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko, why the sudden desire to know everything? - Sat Nov 21 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sat down beside him and stared at the wall as her rage continued on.* - Sat Nov 21 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I've wanted to know...but wasn't in a hurry. - Sat Nov 21 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You were interested. - Sat Nov 21 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Plus...some of the emotions are sticking. - Sat Nov 21 23:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There's some stuff you should hear. - Sat Nov 21 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Go ahead... - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The scientists, were working on a way....To replicate your regenerative properties... - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ................. - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They had clones of you made in the labs. - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Shut it down. - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's not all. - Sat Nov 21 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They were planning to use several others like myself as the testers for their new drugs. - Sat Nov 21 23:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tunnels beneath all the Villages? - Sat Nov 21 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It seems they were working on a system of tunnels beneath the villages...This project looks like it's planned for over ten years til completion...? - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: All of those are fine...except the testers if you want them to stop that. - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just...to do with me.... - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They can't steal my abilities. - Sat Nov 21 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No one can have these abilities. - Sat Nov 21 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There...was one file about me. - Sat Nov 21 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They intended to make me a weapon. - Sat Nov 21 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have them shut down the project regarding your DNA..But they....How? - Sat Nov 21 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They were suppose to just find out what I am...and give me emotions. - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's it... - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How what? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that even possible? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Have you ever heard of -humans- replicating abilities? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Through science? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....I don't know. - Sat Nov 21 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm only two years old.... - Sat Nov 21 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: T-Two!? - Sat Nov 21 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes I thought I told you that. - Sat Nov 21 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You d-didn't. - Sat Nov 21 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yeah. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was made. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I knew you were made...Just not how long. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I have Yosuke's will...Do you want me to read it to you? - Sat Nov 21 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yah. - Sat Nov 21 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) listened to the entire message and then stood up and screamed at the top of her lungs as she grabbed the chair at the table and threw it against the wall. Screaming again as she flipped the table and tried to gain control but it was no use. In the end she ended up on the floor holding her head in her hands and making a growly whining sound.* - Sun Nov 22 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) soon quieted from the petting, simply sitting there and staring at the ground.* - Sun Nov 22 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) now had her head laying on his lap and stared off at nothing. "I can't think about that right now...I don't want to think about killing the only other person I cared about...."* - Sun Nov 22 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) could never get tired of something so he probably did so till he fell asleep. When he woke she was laying on the floor staring at her plants and speaking to them for her mind to calm. She knew he was awake because of the plants, "you didn't have to stay with me... you could have kept reading."* - Sun Nov 22 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched as he returned and sat back next to her. She felt weird still clothed but it was what he wanted for now. "I don't know... I probably should do the experiments again but I feel like the scientists will either be agressive and try to get back at me or be too scared to come up."* - Sun Nov 22 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) immediately reached back and undid the zipper and pulled the dress off and tossed it across the floor. She turned over so she was laying on her back and staring at the ceiling. "Reward them how?" feeling much better now that she was naked.* - Sun Nov 22 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah... we could do that... - Sun Nov 22 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then after the party is done, we can easily have them come up here, to my calculations. - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The question is what do we do while that occurs? - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged against the floor and closed her eyes, "you want to train... I will train you."* - Sun Nov 22 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "I don't know, maybe outside if you want to learn anything like I used in your cell before. That can really ruin the building if I use it in here too much."* - Sun Nov 22 11:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) would easily be able to be carried by him but she stood up and followed after him. She had grabbed a few scrolls from Yosuke's supply also...* - Sun Nov 22 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was surprised he carried her but said nothing. When they were outside she unraveled one of the scrolls as he was still holding her. "What kind of thing do you want to learn?"* - Sun Nov 22 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and looked through a few of the scrolls. She didn't focus on him setting her down since she wasn't worried about being dropped. "Do you know something called "Interrogation jutsu?"* - Sun Nov 22 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) spread the scroll out for Interrogation for him to read.* - Sun Nov 22 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) listened to him reading to her and was laying on her belly beside him on the grass. She formed the handseals and then focused her energy and instead of using it on him since she had an idea he was too intelligent for her to do this too, she instead did it to a flower nearby. Of course this worked, it had... stuff... yeah we are going to pretend this works.* - Sun Nov 22 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) folding her hands into seals again as he rubbed his hand over her back and tried to console her it seemed. He was so kind in ways but others demanding, it was confusing to her but interesting. She practiced the jutsu a few more times before looking over to him. "Is there anything else in there?" * - Sun Nov 22 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are any of them genjutsu? - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tree Binding Death, and Genjutsu Release. - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I have Kai. - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see, Do you wish to learn the other one then? - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Er... - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you learn it. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And I learn a element one. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: .....thats... - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A lot of seals. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah it is. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh...okay. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I heard it's powerful. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then started to do the handseals but had to ask him a few times to read them off to her. She wasn't near as smart as him and so she had to have help since she couldn't read the scroll, he probably could make it easier if he drew them out for her but that's if he could even draw. She did this over and over with all of her focus purely on trying to learn the handseals alone.* - Sun Nov 22 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) watched him as he drew the pictures, curious as to what he was doing and how he was doing it. She then saw the finished result and began to fold her hands into the seals again to get used to them. She began to memorize the seals now and sighed out as she started to form the water chakra within her along with the seals to get a feel for it. She wasn't releasing anything just yet, instead she focused on the ocean in front of her and it rippled and bubbled occasionally from her manipulation. * - Sun Nov 22 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her eyes some and then folded her hands again into the seals. Soon she had enough understanding of them to begin flowing her chakra out easily enough into the water. It began to morph and form as she tried to control it. The head of a dragon appeared and she was certain that she would have it soon enough.* - Sun Nov 22 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) sculpted the chakra and head of the dragon into a neck and then further more into something much larger. She could tell it was starting to form well but was soft around the edges and lacking control over the dragon's movements. The water beast simply was sitting still atop the water's surface.* - Sun Nov 22 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) now tried to mold the chakra in a way that would have the dragon turn it's head. She reached her hands up into the air and shifted her fingers as her hands rotated and she attempted to turn the head. Staring towards the dragon as it turned to look to her and then bowed it's head. She continued to manipulate the dragon and had a bit of trouble making it move all that much but it seemed she was getting a better hang of it.* - Sun Nov 22 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) having never controlled this much water before, it was putting quite a strain on her chakra. Soon enough the dragon rose out of the water and walked across the grass as she rolled over onto her back to stare up towards it's great features. The dragon wa slow moving due to her low control so it was loosing water occasionally in little flood zones.* - Sun Nov 22 12:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't know why he was so happy but then looked him over, "so... how did you do it? You learn very fast..." She looked him over as she rolled back onto her stomach. * - Sun Nov 22 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "are you done learning for now?"* - Sun Nov 22 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I believe so, do you intend to? - Sun Nov 22 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To continue that's. - Sun Nov 22 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No I can stop. - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you want to do? - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: See you keep asking me what I want to do... - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But the thing is. - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't actually care. - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The little emotions I'm gaining are on and off. - Sun Nov 22 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then. - Sun Nov 22 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want you to, Tell me everything about you. - Sun Nov 22 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Everything. - Sun Nov 22 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're keeping away. - Sun Nov 22 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Not telling me. - Sun Nov 22 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to know it -all-. - Sun Nov 22 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Keeping away? - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well...I don't really know what I'm keeping away. - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you have certain questions? - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can't die, But can you use your powers on others? - Sun Nov 22 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can heal you. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I can't keep you from dying if you are dying. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How does that work? - Sun Nov 22 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I tear off a piece of myself and put it into the wound. - Sun Nov 22 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I can't stop illness I don't think. - Sun Nov 22 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How fast does it work? - Sun Nov 22 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Depends how bad the wound, do you mean for me or for others? - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Both. - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: For me, if I'm 'killed' then it takes several hours... if I'm blown up... a few days. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If it's just a normal wound that wouldn't kill someone then it takes a few minutes. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: For other's if they are seriously wounded it takes a few hours usually. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To fully heal. - Sun Nov 22 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you don't have to worry about getting hurt. - Sun Nov 22 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have to be sure to keep you by my side then. - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What do you know about Sunagakure? - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't like Suna.... - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The people were nice but the leader is mean. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I think I'll kill the leader then. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He only let me stay TWO DAYS?! - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He was so rude. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you don't like him. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: He can die. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I warned him too. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I told him one day I would be useful but he didn't listen. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If you want him dead. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged.* - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, this position felt different than any she had experienced before. "I talked to people, watched them spar... I never went back mostly because there is a man there I'm suppose to stay away from."* - Sun Nov 22 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: A Man? - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He could -see- me. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He could see what I was I think. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And he touched me and apparently that was bad. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Because he knows seals. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How did he touch you?---Seals? - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And it was dangerous if he finds out what I am, but the way he looked at me seemed like he knew. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah he has 'fuuinjutsu' and he touched my cheek. But he was rubbing it a lot but when he touched me I copied him and he saw me activate the chakra. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he was looking at me.. -very- unnaturally. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Could you show me his form, Later? - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to have the scientists, continue building tunnels beneath the Villages, If that's alright with you. - Sun Nov 22 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, have you been to any other villages? - Sun Nov 22 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Konoha. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Ame. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Kirigakure. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about his questions and shrugged lightly against his chest with the back of her shoulders. "They all were interesting... Kirigakure was where I spent most of the time, Ame... were -really- interesting. A queen and a guy who was very strange, a guy named Sado who wore a tiki mask and talked like a poet. Konoha I liked because of the tree's but I learned there the most. They are nice people who share a lot."* - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The people in Suna just liked my skin.... - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They talked about it a lot. - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How white I was. - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess because it's hot there I should have been burning they said. - Sun Nov 22 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shifted onto her side and then moved to lay against him with a leg draped over one of his and her arm across his chest with her breasts against his side and likely with her under his arm and head resting on his shoulder. "I think her name was Astero or something like that. I didn't get to copy her though. She liked me -a lot- because I was so nice to her, it was kind of fun to pretend being so polite to someone so 'entitled' as she acted." She thought on his question afterwards, "it's peaceful, lots of nature, not many buildings... hardly any pollution."* - Sun Nov 22 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled wide at what he was saying and part of her was enjoying laying here speaking to him. "Yeah, Konoha I like the most because I go to talk to the tree's. They are the oldest tree's I have ever seen." She smiled some and then remembered something, "Oh! The thing I liked most about Suna is they had weird plants. Yes, that was the best thing." She then thought about the fun comment again, "well not 'fun' but you know... it was the most...not boring?"* - Sun Nov 22 15:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shrugged lightly, "Yeah I suppose it would." She stared back towards him and thought back to the plants. "They are called 'succulents' and are sort of strange... some have thorns and some have pretty bright flowers, everything else is very dull colored."* - Sun Nov 22 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes while he looked at her, "I usually just ask them about the weather, how the sun is... we talk about the soil... things like that. Plant things." Shrugging gently.* - Sun Nov 22 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) paused a while as she spoke with the grass, "it's not very warm today... and the cloud cover is making it feel hot but not in a good way." She shrugged, "that's what they say."* - Sun Nov 22 15:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded some but shook her head, "they don't need help, it is natural for them." She clearly didn't feel sympathy for the plants even if she enjoyed speaking to them.* - Sun Nov 22 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head to look up at him while he ran his hand over her curves. "We could look for them, and if we like them then we can let them out like you are. If we don't like them..." she shrugged, "leave them there."* - Sun Nov 22 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thought about his words as he played with her rump and said nothing for a long while. Soon enough she spoke up, "very different I assume....I feel like a different person when I feel just one."* - Sun Nov 22 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't know what a barrier canopy method was but simply nodded towards him. "If I don't want to train you... then you can just make me train you, with your shoulder pushing and demanding." She nodded with her eyes closed.* - Sun Nov 22 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was very flexible because of what she was made of so what he attempted was easily accomplished with zero resistance. Her leg now was draped so her foot was over the other side of his body an her leg high up on his belly. She found this to be yet another very strange position to lay in. Opening her eyes and staring own at it and how it looke, it made her curved hip high in the air and her groin spread quite a bit. As he made the flirtatious comment Ume looked back up to him with an 'o' for her lips. "Would I?" She really didn't know.* - Sun Nov 22 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) didn't move her leg as he released it, seemingly she wasn't going to move it unless he moved it again. If he still rolled over after she hadn't shifted her leg then she would be forced onto her back and staring up at him. Staring up at him with her pink and brown gaze. "Why is that?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as he ran his finger over her face and down across her lips. When he held onto her throat and was explaining she rose her chin in a mock imitation of what someone would do when their throat is held tightly and stared up to him with their forehead's pressed together. "Does that mean you want to own me too?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) was impressed by the level of emotion he was showing that somehow remained so cold. As he told her exactly what she was her demeanor was shifting and she wasn't sure how to respond as he tightened his grip on her throat. Of course, she doesn't breath so this did nothing to harm her but the way it looked was utterly sadistic... "Doll? What does a doll do?" She didn't even know the word since she hadn't been around children.* - Sun Nov 22 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) stared up to him as he explained what she was to be. The way he was feeling over her body only showed his passion for his words and she nodded against his hold on her throat. "Does this mean you are my owner?" She hadn't had a -real- owner since the one who created her abandoned her. She felt a type of... completion of a goal that she had been trying to play off with the other men she knew since they didn't like the idea of owning someone or something that could speak.* - Sun Nov 22 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, to her that was impossible. She might live forever but he certainly wasn't going to, as much as he denied being a human she knew he was to some extent but she merely nodded. "Alright."* - Sun Nov 22 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) kissed him back as she had learned in the past. She was quite good at it... but allowed him to lead the kiss and invade her soft mouth. It wouldn't be a kiss like he could experience with any other kind of woman, since she had no saliva but her softness made up for that... The pressure between her legs was felt an she was certain he was going to enter her but had no reason to stop it.* - Sun Nov 22 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) wouldn't break the kiss until he had, then she rolled over onto her side and against him in the same position she had taken earlier with one leg over his own. She looked up to him and thought of what he said she didn't respond, only nodded.* - Sun Nov 22 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times at what he said and then she swallowed hard. "I um... I would like to retrieve his body...." She shifted her gaze away. "I like the name though..."* - Sun Nov 22 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) turned her gaze away as he said he was going to come with her, part of her worried that if he was there and she grew upset that he might kill Ortho... or end up dead himself from attacking Ortho. She remained silent on that but listened to his question about the money. "I haven't decided."* - Sun Nov 22 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded to what he said, "Like what kind of businesses?"* - Sun Nov 22 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly against his shoulder as he pet over her rump, it was clear he could get whatever he wanted from her, with little effort.* - Sun Nov 22 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times at him and didn't catch on at all. It went way over her head.* - Sun Nov 22 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked down to his cock and then up to his face. "Oh," she sat up and stared down towards his cock. "What do you want me to do?"* - Sun Nov 22 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) looked up to Thirteen, "should we go back to the base?"* - Sun Nov 22 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you want to do a few more tests before we start looking through some of those rooms? - Sun Nov 22 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably a good idea. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you going to do any? - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I wouldn't know which ones to do? - Sun Nov 22 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noticed that they didn't have the basin with them and that relieved her... Apparently that was too serious of a method of enforcing the emotions into her body. She looked at the different emotions and looked at him, "you pick."* - Mon Nov 23 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: OOMG - Mon Nov 23 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank the vial and sat there for about fifteen minutes but nothing happened.* - Mon Nov 23 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) drank down the vial and then squirmed a bit after a few minutes. She looked around and then down at her nude body and up to the scientists and Thirteen. Her thighs pressed together tightly and slowly she started to cover herself. "E-erg...." she shifted uncomfortably on the bed and wasn't sure what to do. "This one is weird...."* - Mon Nov 23 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) fidgetted and looked around nervously, a few of the scientists were enjoying the fact she was embarrassed since they had shamed her like this before. It was making her remember and her head lowered down as she muttered out, "I..I want some clothes..."* - Mon Nov 23 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head at the meal comment, "I'm not hungry.." She took the dress and started to pull it on. Once the dress was on she felt a little better but still out of it and curled up on the bed watching the scientists, feeling their judgy gazes!* - Mon Nov 23 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked at his hand on her hip and she wasn't sure how to feel about it at th emoment. When he complimented her it helped but she stared up at him and remained curled up lightly. "I feel like I shouldn't be naked...why?"* - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) added on in a whispered embarrassed way, "I -like- being naked."* - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit on her lip shamefully and then nodded and pulled the dress off to be naked beside him. Curling up next to him, she was going to have to get used to it, but his words were helping her calm the shame to a subconscious level.* - Mon Nov 23 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times up at him and curled her face in against his chest, "Mngng... you're embarrassing meeeeeeee.~"* - Mon Nov 23 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she looked up at him, "but you don't want to feel emotions...I did this?!" She sounded panicked.* - Mon Nov 23 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) grumbled lightly, "why do I have to get dressed you just said I didn't have to."* - Mon Nov 23 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and took his hand, she headed out the door wherever he was leading her.* - Mon Nov 23 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: W- - Mon Nov 23 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He didn't tell me that everyone is going to be here. - Mon Nov 23 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Yuriko, if you get nervous, you can lean on me. Stand behind me or beside me, It's your choice. But I'm here for you, zone out the rest of them. - Mon Nov 23 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || As soon as they were walking out the door from the hall to walk into where -everyone- was meeting she froze and pulled back on his hand. "Nng... e-everyone?" The petite girl trembled in her nudity as she peeked around the corner to see how many people were in the cafeteria. "Y-you didn't say.... -everyone-." She heard his whisper and then slowly walked out as her head hung low and all of her fair skinned nude body was in easy few of any who looked. She looked rather peculiar besides the fact she was nude because of her heterochromic gaze of one pink and one brown eye, with her hair being the opposite colors on each side with brown hair on the pink eye's side and pink hair on the brown eye's side of her head.* - Mon Nov 23 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the shirt carefully and then tugged it on and sat down beside him as he towered over her and gave the speech. She never let go of his hand as she listened.* - Mon Nov 23 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) simply looked from Thirteen out over the large audience.* - Mon Nov 23 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was listening to Thirteen but by now she was staring at the ceiling and it looked like she wasn't listening at all.* - Mon Nov 23 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Family. - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head to look towards Yori.* - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: If I fail? I will take direct punishment. The leader, will decide what punishment should be given to me.  - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I eat people who I punish. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Then I will be eaten. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stated this very simply as she stared at him. When he said he will be eaten she blinked a few times before looking up to Thirteen and whispering.* - Mon Nov 23 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I like him. - Mon Nov 23 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: OOooouhh.~ - Mon Nov 23 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat up straight so she had a good view of what was going to happen.* - Mon Nov 23 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too bad I don't want to eat you, I bet you taste good. - Mon Nov 23 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked him over up and down. "Mn."* - Mon Nov 23 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: . . . .Okay then.  . - Mon Nov 23 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: It will be done. - Mon Nov 23 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shook her head in a soft manner.* - Mon Nov 23 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tell me of your abilities, Yori, Your past and your motivation. - Mon Nov 23 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I can manipulate shadows. My past mostly consists of my father constantly yelling at me, telling me to better myself. To non stop train. My motivation, is so that I surpass not only my fathers expectations. But also yours. - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Manipulate...Shadows? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And surpass my expectations? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You flatter me. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I try my best. - Mon Nov 23 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm looking forward to it. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The rest of your day is to yourself. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You start tomorrow. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was looking out over the water with her eyes closed. The first notable thing about her would be the half bubble gum pink, half chocolate brown hair she had. Another notable thing was the extremely nice looking dress she wore, it looked quite expensive, and lastly from behind it was noted she was very short, a mere five foot. Turning about as Ortho approached, but before he had spoken, Yuriko turned to face him and had a blank expression as her heterochromic gaze of pink and brown stared upon his figure. She looked him up and down to take in his form and then stepped forward a single time so she was off the shoreline and on the grass.

Clearing her throat lightly she then spoke up in a very feminine tone that was sweet to the ears, it seemed everything about the girl was sweet except for her eyes. Her eyes looked cold and menacing deep inside. Her aura also was disrupted in a way that shown a mixture of sweetness and cruel hate. "I'm here to retrieve Yosuke's body."* - Mon Nov 23 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's gloved hands slowly clenched tightly at what he stated about Yosuke's brains. She turned her head to the side some and tried to calm herself as she hadn't wanted to hurt Ortho, she intended only to come here to retrieve the body. When she spoke her voice was strained both in rage and sadness, "I'm the only one of his 'girls' that mattered... or have you already forgotten how to see through my exterior, Ortho." She was staring him down and it was clear in her eyes that she hated him for what he had done to Yosuke. Honestly... he wasn't going to be able to tell who she was by looking at her, or reading her chakra, or even looking at her emotions... he would have to -listen- to her words spoken to get a hint of who she was.* - Mon Nov 23 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: An actual.. tone in her voice..? - Mon Nov 23 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Looks like those scientist aren't completely full of bullshit. - Mon Nov 23 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) simply stared on in the same demeanor, "I came out early....because of what you did. I inhereted everything from Yosuke, so I am in control."* - Mon Nov 23 13:05:29 2015
