<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled wider and looked away from him now and out towards the valley with a heavy fake sigh-- course to him it sounded like a sigh of passion.* - Thu Dec 10 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ........ - Thu Dec 10 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Unexpected...answer - Thu Dec 10 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is it? - Thu Dec 10 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: No...I..just...didnt...know...what to say.. - Thu Dec 10 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I..do not...share that...view of..the world... - Thu Dec 10 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What view do you share? And why...are you...talking...like ...this. - Thu Dec 10 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ..... - Thu Dec 10 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I...am...not..good....around people.. - Thu Dec 10 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Some might say I'm not good with people either, but I don't talk like a robot. - Thu Dec 10 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I never was good around people but I am learning. - Thu Dec 10 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It is hard to learn with so many new things in the world, sometimes things are not the same always and they change. - Thu Dec 10 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Also lies make things difficult to learn properly. - Thu Dec 10 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: The...more things change....the more they stay the same.. - Thu Dec 10 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What..is your name? - Thu Dec 10 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked back at him and then rose in a likely too graceful manner for someone wearing heels on a steep slope. She walked over towards him and smiled warmly, "Yuriko-chan.~"* - Thu Dec 10 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) craned her head to the side at what Akito had said and then hummed gently in thought. "I don't normally spar...."* - Thu Dec 10 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmm, why do you assume I am a fighter?~ - Thu Dec 10 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: A....female...of your complexion....could not..survive out in the world...unless...you knew how to defend..yourself. - Thu Dec 10 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: My complexion? Hm....  - Thu Dec 10 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Perhaps perhaps.~ - Thu Dec 10 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yes... you..are..a rather..frail..looking..female... - Thu Dec 10 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I would...like to see...if what I think...is correct.. - Thu Dec 10 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmmmmmmmm.~ - Thu Dec 10 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What do I get if I do good? - Thu Dec 10 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I..cant..offer..much.. - Thu Dec 10 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What...could..you..like? - Thu Dec 10 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn..... I'm not certain, what do you want if you win? - Thu Dec 10 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Nothing...I do not...seek for...anything... - Thu Dec 10 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm.. okay... - Thu Dec 10 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But what if I hurt you... - Thu Dec 10 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know when to stop. - Thu Dec 10 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Then....it is...my own...fault.. - Thu Dec 10 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but I might kill you. - Thu Dec 10 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ..... - Thu Dec 10 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Will...you now... - Thu Dec 10 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So when do I know to stop? - Thu Dec 10 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If...I collapse...stop.. - Thu Dec 10 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Thu Dec 10 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) skipped out to the middle of the area and stared over to him. "You want to start?~"* - Thu Dec 10 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) noted how far away he was and she was going to have to rely on her sight to focus on him since she didn't have any plants on the training field which was a bit of a bummer. She shifted into a more animalistic type stance, her body took on the looks of someone who relied on what they saw and felt rather than what they strategized. Her eyes watched him like a hawk and now she was narrowing in on him with her focus. 

Her hands thrust together in a single clap and a surge of powerful chakra was being formed in her belly. Within an instant a wave of water was coming his direction from her mouth spewing forth with clearly little effort on her part.* - Thu Dec 10 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rose a brow at the use of lightning being formed and shot through the water. She watched the powerful mixture and then laughed out in a manical manner as she let the water slam into his body of a swirling vortex wave with the lightning coursing through it. The lightning -did- get conducted all the way to her from the vortex being spawned from her but for some reason? She seemed entirely uneffected by it! The shocker!

She rushed towards him right behind the vortex as she released it, not desiring to hold it longer than necessary as she crouched and slammed her fist against the ground as a great mud river came over the cliffs behind them and went downhill at a faster pace than normal due to gravity pulling it, using her arms she controlled the mud to flow into the electrified water so it would become a rapids of mud and water to rush over Akito. Course the electricity and mud weren't going to mix well and likely by that point had nulled each other some but hey, that's clashing for you. The main point was to overwhelm Akito greatly while he was stunned.* - Thu Dec 10 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times as she forced the mud away to see Akito laying there. She walked over towards him through the mud and stared down at him before placing her heeled foot on his chest lightly and wiggling his body back and forth to see if he was alive. Course if he woke up he was going to have a straight shot look at her panties. "Mister Akito-kun?"* - Thu Dec 10 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *Her panties were pure white and silky - Thu Dec 10 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) wasn't pressing down hard at all and she is very light so mostly it was just a light pressure if anything. She examined his body and hummed gently, "you aren't entirely human, are you now Akito-kun?~" She pulled her foot away after a few more rocks back and forth and stared down towards him as he lay on the ground.* - Thu Dec 10 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) reached out and grabb his hand fully with her extremely soft hand, she would not be shocked.* - Thu Dec 10 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Y-You..are not...human..either.. - Thu Dec 10 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) snickered and bit down on her bottom lip. She knew what he was trying to do since she could feel the chakra he was sending through her body at a constant rate. She pulled him up, but she wasn't the strongest body wise so he probably would have to put in some effort himself.* - Thu Dec 10 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I am not human. - Thu Dec 10 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was much smaller than him, he nearly would probably force her back and onto the ground---in fact yes, that is what happened. She fell to the ground and grunted a bit in a fake manner. "U-uh, I don't know what I am, what are you?"* - Thu Dec 10 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) grumbled a bit and felt how he was laying atop her with his heavy weight but it didn't seem to bother her any as he laid atop her very small and soft body staring up at him with wide curious eyes. "No, I don't know what I am at all, I'm trying to find out though.... I don't know because my maker left me, he didn't want me anymore."* - Thu Dec 10 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Ma..ker? - Thu Dec 10 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Thu Dec 10 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you okay? - Thu Dec 10 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yeah... - Thu Dec 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Pain... - Thu Dec 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Nothing..more..than pain.. - Thu Dec 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't sound okay. - Thu Dec 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No problem, just doing my job. - Thu Dec 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Can... - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you going to keep laying on me? - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You take- - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Oh... - Thu Dec 10 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I think he's the first person not to be astonished how soft I am... maybe he can't feel? - Thu Dec 10 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and looked down at her dress that was covered in mud. She shrugged and looked down towards him, "what were you asking?"* - Thu Dec 10 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Can...you...take me...to my home.. - Thu Dec 10 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I..am rather..weak at the moment... - Thu Dec 10 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit, "I'm not very strong..hm... how can I do this..." She hummed gently and tried to pick him up but it was helpless, he was much too big for her. "Uh..."* - Thu Dec 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) put his arm over her shoulder and then frowned a bit and shook her head. "Okay... hold on... I can fix this, I think I hurt you pretty badly." She looked up to him as she paused, "Uh...close your eyes..okay?"* - Thu Dec 10 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) tore one of her fingers off and it turned into a small ball and she held it against his lips. "Eat it... it won't taste like anything and it will fix you." It wouldn't feel like flesh, it would feel like gum with no taste at all.* - Thu Dec 10 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What...is this? - Thu Dec 10 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's finge grew back and she waited as he would be entirely healed of any and all wounds he had to perfection.* - Thu Dec 10 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A secret.~ - Thu Dec 10 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head to the side and reached up to run a hand over his scars, "I guess it doesn't fix old wounds... I never tried to see if it would heal old ones."* - Thu Dec 10 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt her hand stopped and rubbed her lips together watching him coyly, "why don't you let me touch it?" She was merely curious.* - Thu Dec 10 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Because this is something that now many people have seen. - Thu Dec 10 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: More or less touch. - Thu Dec 10 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down hard on her lip while staring at his scarred face, "so then why have you shown me?"* - Thu Dec 10 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Unintensionally. - Thu Dec 10 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....so then you won't let me touch it...yes? - Thu Dec 10 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Hmm. - Thu Dec 10 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I will- - Thu Dec 10 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You won. - Thu Dec 10 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Go ahead. - Thu Dec 10 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But you don't -want- me to touch it. - Thu Dec 10 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It does not matter. - Thu Dec 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You won. - Thu Dec 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Will you answer me? - Thu Dec 10 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) waited with her hand held still up near him but not touching him as she watched his eyes to see his true want on the subject.* - Thu Dec 10 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Particularly no - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: But you won - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You get to have something you want from me - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lowered her hand, "I do not make those who I enjoy the company of do what I want... that is reserved for my enemy."* - Thu Dec 10 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I see. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Would you care for something to drink? - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sake? - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I only drink sake. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Sure. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I think I have some in my house. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded and had noticed he stopped speaking in a manner that was choppy, it was easy for her to pick up on since she studied people almost naturally. Nodding with a faint smile, "okay.~"* - Thu Dec 10 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Woah, this is like the biggest house in this village! - Thu Dec 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked around his house but didn't seem to mind that it was dirty though it was an interesting sight to see. She was used to things being -extremely- clean, not that she cared either way how they were. She had never had cold sake before, though she shrugged faintly as she sat down at the table and looked inside the cup, regardless if it was dirty or not she wouldn't care much. "I've never had it cold before," not that it being cold would matter... it felt the same to her regardless.* - Thu Dec 10 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) had been about to drink from the cup when she saw him not drink from his own or even pour any for that matter. "You do not want any?"* - Thu Dec 10 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her lips together in thought and then took only a few seconds to understand. "You don't eat or drink around people then?" She sipped the sake slowly, if it was poisoned she would not notice.* - Thu Dec 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowy as he spoke and she sipped the sake some more, "do I not make you feel weird anymore? You have stopped speaking like a robot."* - Thu Dec 10 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) snickered a bit at what he said and drank again from the cup. "I wouldn't say we are equal on that but I suppose we are closer... I am just good at pretending." She could feel a bit of her in the back of her mind twitching a bit as her hold on sanity was beginning to slip again. Brushing it away she shrugged some, "I have learned a lot but part of humanity being forced onto me has also broken me some... I didn't know that humanity was broken."* - Thu Dec 10 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Are we speaking about humanity as a whole or the humanity that you keep inside you? - Thu Dec 10 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I did not say that we are something alike not fully. - Thu Dec 10 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I have some sort of humanity left as I do not transform when I need to. - Thu Dec 10 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... well both I guess? Humanity is different than what I thought is all. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So you are human most of the time? - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yes. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I chose when I can transform. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I can chose when I can change back. - Thu Dec 10 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If you are done with the Sake in your cup you can get more. - Thu Dec 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If you are done with the Sake in your cup you can get more. - Thu Dec 10 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked down at the nearly empty cup and finished it then sat the cup down, "no... that's all. Sake makes you feel tingly."* - Thu Dec 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Tingly? - Thu Dec 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What do you mean by tingly? - Thu Dec 10 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like numb and falling over and stuff. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know you very well so I shouldn't drink that much. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Drunk? - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You mean you get drunk? - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yes, that. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: New word. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: There is nothing word with that. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: wrong* - Thu Dec 10 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It is something normal that happens. - Thu Dec 10 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes but it makes a person weak, makes it so you can't control chakra properly. - Thu Dec 10 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Does it? - Thu Dec 10 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Some people benefit from being drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...they do? - Thu Dec 10 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yes. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: How? - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Maybe you have not gotten drunk enough. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: They tend to be unpredictable. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but how? - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This just sounds like a trick to get me drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Their movements become faster and unpredictable. - Thu Dec 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: They attack allies and foe alive. - Thu Dec 10 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Because they cant distinguish them. - Thu Dec 10 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Oh. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think that would work for me. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I become slow and fall over a lot and things. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You do not seem to be very well versed in taijutsu are you? - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not really no. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I see. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: So ninjutsu is your thing? - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Lots of chakra stuff. - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I can sense that you have a high amount of chakra. - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Makes sense. - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes I do.~ - Thu Dec 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) swayed a bit back and forth, it seemed even the little bit of sake was enough to get her buzzing lightly.* - Thu Dec 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Now or the beginning? - Thu Dec 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: The beginning. - Thu Dec 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Somewhere new Gezo. - Thu Dec 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I have nothing but- - Thu Dec 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Gezo huh? - Thu Dec 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But not -in- Gezo. - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Last time I told people they freaked out. - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: The Gezo are not well liked by the shinobi - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, I know... they are not liked by me either. - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Why is that? - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They abandoned me. - Thu Dec 10 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Pitty. - Thu Dec 10 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: 'Flawed'. - Thu Dec 10 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What is there 'flawed' about you. - Thu Dec 10 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I wanted to be human. - Thu Dec 10 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You are. - Thu Dec 10 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm not human... but I certanly tried to be. - Thu Dec 10 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Have you seen yourself in the mirror? - Thu Dec 10 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: --- - Thu Dec 10 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stopped swaying and looked away as one hand came up to her head rather swiftly, fast enough she knocked over her empty glass and cringed while holding her head. "Nngng..." she looked as if she was having a traumtic flash back or mental break down as her body trembled and she tugged at her hair with both hands now. "Nng... s-shatter... no mirror... no mirror..sh-shatter... break it... b-break break break....no no...no mirrors...no..."* - Thu Dec 10 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ...... - Thu Dec 10 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) cringed and shook her head as her eyes shut tightly and she slumped down against the table while holding her head. Shaking her head to what he said as she tried to overcome the mental trauma forcing her to relive bad memories. She hated when this happened, not to mention he had sprung her -worst- traumatic memory as she tried to recover... it was evident she was going to be like this for a while.* - Thu Dec 10 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: 'we were having such a nice time too!' - Thu Dec 10 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shivered under his hand as she jumped a bit but there was no collection of chakra found. In fact her aura read that of someone terrified, utterly broken. She heard his words and whined out as she tried to nod a few times. "J-just... J-just a word? N-not... r-r-rreal .... not r-real?" She trembled harder and whined out again as she pulled her legs up onto the chair under her bottom. She was starting to calm some but it was clear this was very hard for her to recover from so easily.* - Thu Dec 10 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lifted her head while he was petting her and she looked up at him with eyes of understanding his situation but in the same she was conflicted since to her the word 'monster' and 'freak' were something to be -proud- of. "It isn't the image I see... it's the mirrors themselves... I used to look at myself and find beauty in what I saw but now I can't stand to look at myself... someone took that away, he used it against me." She sighed out and looked away some as he was stroking her extremely soft hair. <He used to stroke my hair too...> she forced that thought away and closed her eyes. "Mirrors are just an object... not the thing that broke me.. just a tool he used." It seemed she was more so talking herself down now rather than informing Akito.* - Thu Dec 10 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him change and then smiled weakly, "mine is not such a simple fix as overcoming a bad situation, he broke my mind... -literally- broke it."* - Thu Dec 10 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: How. - Thu Dec 10 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You think my mind and body were not broken? - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I...don't think you understand. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: My body was the first to break. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked away.* - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He was trying to kill me. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Then my mind followed shortly after. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I should be dead. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't die. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Hmm? - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I was human I'd be dead. - Thu Dec 10 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So he took what he could... which was my mind. - Thu Dec 10 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The small bursts of sanity are hard to hold onto. - Thu Dec 10 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: No one can take your mind from you. - Thu Dec 10 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Even if they can. - Thu Dec 10 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That is what makes you, you. - Thu Dec 10 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... I was very different before. - Thu Dec 10 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That was in the past. - Thu Dec 10 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) began to transform into an entirely different person, white alabaster skin, long dark purple hair, no flushed cheeks, bright yellow sunflower eyes, and she was much taller and shaped more like a woman than a teenage girl.* - Thu Dec 10 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) lowered her head down and stared at her hands with a weak smile, "I've had so many faces and names... but Yuriko stuck the longest... because he forced it onto my mind. You say it's the past and that I'm Yuriko now, but am I really? I can be anyone I want to be but because he broke my mind I want to continue to be a doll... even when I hate it."* - Thu Dec 10 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times as her head was risen and out of reflex her lips had parted slightly and then she quickly forced them shut and diverted her eyes in shame. It had looked -very- sexual and she couldn't stop the basic instinct she had when her chin was lifted in that manner. Nodding her head against his large hand she sighed out with lack of breath. "Yes, I understand..." with that she reverted back to Yuriko's appearance and looked up to him with her heterochromic gaze.* - Thu Dec 10 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes as she watched him go back to his seat. She hadn't expected that proposition from -him- of all people. It was like she was a magnet for men to want her in one way or another. She shook her head, "I won't be anyone else's doll.... I'm done being owned, I thought that what I needed was an owner from the very beginning of ...since I can remember, but after being used... three times it's my time to be in charge. I have a home, I have those who depend on me... even if that might sound crazy because of what and who I am but they do trust and ... we are our own monsters and we are proud of it."

Pausing she smiled faintly, "I never took you for someone who would want a doll, that is a little curious of you, Akito-kun.~" Teasing as she thought about his offer and there was a deep tempation to accept but she knew it was not in the right interest to accept his offer for now.* - Thu Dec 10 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) squinted at him, "did you trick me?"* - Thu Dec 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I think he just tricked me. - Thu Dec 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You can look at it that way. - Thu Dec 10 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Or you can look at it as I said some things that helped you get better in your moment of need. - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Also I was serious. - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I don't make propositions I dont want to do. - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Which is why I gave two options. - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Instead of just one. - Thu Dec 10 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Dec 10 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay then... I suppose that's alright. - Thu Dec 10 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stopped squinting and thought for a moment on things, "your home doesn't look like a place you bring people? Why are we here other than the sake? Or do you not want to be around people?"* - Thu Dec 10 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You are the second person I have openly talked to in this village. - Thu Dec 10 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Also the first one to visit my home - Thu Dec 10 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Who is the firs-oh. - Thu Dec 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I got my ass kicked so I needed to go somewhere were there wouldn't be anyone else. - Thu Dec 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) snickered lightly.* - Thu Dec 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: The first person was the Raikage. - Thu Dec 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And even then. - Thu Dec 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It isn't this open. - Thu Dec 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Ooooooh tease-kun. - Thu Dec 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why so open with me? Because I am a monster?~ - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yeah. - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I told you. - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: We are somewhat alike. - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think you are a monster. - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I've seen much scarier things. - Thu Dec 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I've -done- much scarier things. - Thu Dec 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I've also done some questionable things. - Thu Dec 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: But other people are quick to judge what they dont understand - Thu Dec 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Why do you think I hide my face under such a high collar? - Thu Dec 10 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Fear? - Thu Dec 10 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: No. - Thu Dec 10 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That's what I thought before. - Thu Dec 10 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I hide i- Hmm. - Thu Dec 10 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Well now that I think about it. - Thu Dec 10 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I do not remember why I began hiding my face in the first place. - Thu Dec 10 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It does not matter I guess since it has become a custom - Thu Dec 10 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why hide though? - Thu Dec 10 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Now. - Thu Dec 10 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Unknown. - Thu Dec 10 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Like I said. - Thu Dec 10 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I have growned acustomed to it. - Thu Dec 10 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I do not know how to say it. - Thu Dec 10 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: But it is the same - Thu Dec 10 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: as putting your sandals on in the morning - Thu Dec 10 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... but that isn't normal to me... nothing is really 'normal' to me... I suppose... maybe experiments...that was pretty regular for a while. - Thu Dec 10 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That is were you are wrong. - Thu Dec 10 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What you do on your day by day is normal for you. - Thu Dec 10 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "I suppose... my normal is rather sporadic then."* - Thu Dec 10 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You see there are many things that you don't understand it seem - Thu Dec 10 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hey... lets get out of the house. - Thu Dec 10 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You go on ahead. - Thu Dec 10 09:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pursed her lips some embarrassed, "did I upset you?"* - Thu Dec 10 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly with wide eyes and then stood up. She paused for a moment before going over towards Akito and trying to give him one of her classic hugs. A nice warm inviting and tight hug with her cheek nuzzling in against his neck.* - Thu Dec 10 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: As long as you do not bring any other people into this place. - Thu Dec 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled wide and stood back up, "thank you, Akito-kun.~ I will see you again soon."* - Thu Dec 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: .. - Thu Dec 10 10:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) wasn't bothered by it.* - Thu Dec 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yuriko dear your back, good - Thu Dec 10 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly as she walked into the room, "I thought about what you offered... I want to know... if you promise you aren't going to try and break my mind."* - Thu Dec 10 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What will I owe you if you do this for me? - Thu Dec 10 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Your hand... in friendship~ Maybe like a daughter I never had~ - Thu Dec 10 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... I don't really know how to be a daughter... but I can try to be a friend. - Thu Dec 10 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thats all I really ask... now let us begin - Thu Dec 10 10:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked around the desk and sat down in the assistant chair beside Rias.* - Thu Dec 10 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) as Rias attempted to enter her mind she would find that even if a connection was created she could not see anything... it was a like a white sheet.* - Thu Dec 10 10:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) couldn't hear any of the thoughts that the girl was having in her mind either strangely. When she boke the link, Yuriko did not look tired at all as she SHOULD look. "Sense? No."* - Thu Dec 10 10:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched people in the cafe and simply eyed and listened in on the people. She sipped her sake as slowly as possible and her gaze fell on two she had seen before in passing, but there were several others who were regulars of this cafe she knew and so they weren't paid anymore attention than the rest.* - Thu Dec 10 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit as she heard a word she didn't understand. <What's a knitting?>* - Thu Dec 10 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and sleuthed slowly across the room with her heels making no sound as she intentionally walked on her toes. She peered over Ziare's shoulder at his lap to see what he had.* - Thu Dec 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That is not making clothing. - Thu Dec 10 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hm. .N-Not that I was hoping you were making something originally. . . - Thu Dec 10 11:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit and started to put together her mistake, by this point she was leaning so far over Ziare she had ended up with her head between the two other's and a pursed 'o' on her lips of realization. Not a sound, breath, or smell was able to be sensed... perhaps if they were sensors they would sense her extreme amounts of chakra.. or perhaps they would see her? * - Thu Dec 10 11:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked further in silently and then wrapped her arms around Nigen's shoulders and neck so her arms were hanging down along his front and she nuzzled in against his cheek and neck with her soft skin. "Mmnnnnn, I missed you SO MUCH!" Her voice going higher pitched at the end of her sentence in enthusiasm.* - Thu Dec 10 22:26:33 2015
