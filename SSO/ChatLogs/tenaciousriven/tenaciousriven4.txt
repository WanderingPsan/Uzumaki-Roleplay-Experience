<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't joke when it comes to business. - Fri Nov  6 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) for the first time ever started laughing.* - Fri Nov  6 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I told you I'd only take that position when I was ready. - Fri Nov  6 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're ready now. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets go. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Ortho. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not going to lead a village when I can't even defend myself. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .... - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Speaking of. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Will you two excuse me? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to speak with my sister dearest alone. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) walked South.* - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I assume we'll finish this conversation afterwards? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Care to explain what Ortho has in mind for me? - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know, but I think you should do it. He knows what is best for you. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And it's what you want. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Your laughing said otherwise. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Because it was 'ironic' after the effort he put in to take Kiri, he gives it to you. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Plus. I can't defend and lead a village if I can't protect myself. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I refuse to be a figure head. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: .... why? - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you don't need to be physically strong to be kage and rebuild the village. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd simply be a stand in for Ortho. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Even if you were, it would be helping him and Nina. Do you want that? - Fri Nov  6 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm unsure what I want anymore. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well I think you should do it. - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? And why is that? - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Honestly... I don't think you belong out here. You belong in there... and you have a dream to be the kage, and I think if you have the opportunity now you should take it. If you don't, maybe the opportunity won't ever come along again. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You will have help. - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Again. - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Kirigakure needs a leader, and you are the only one with the inspiration to rebuild it. - Fri Nov  6 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It'd make me but a figure head. - Fri Nov  6 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) turned around to face him, "and maybe inspiration is all that village needs. I'm asking you as someone from Kirigakure, do it for the people who live there....who aren't shinobi. Just like me, who are starving and injured because of the raider attacks that no one takes care of and allow to go on. They need leadership, even if that leadership is under prepared."* - Fri Nov  6 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "Ortho didn't kill the kage, and there have been other attacks on Kirigakure." She stepped forward and reached out to place a hand on his shoulder. "You think that it matters if you can be beat on your own, but that isn't what it means to be a kage. A kage bings a village together and makes them strong as a unit. You just show them the direction, with them beside you... you -are- strong." A tiny bit of energy went through her body as she stood there, and soon after she lowered her hand from his shoulder.* - Fri Nov  6 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) smiled lightly, "I'm giving you the point of view as a civilian of Kirigakure. Not a view you can have of your own as a shinobi, I bet you don't even remember being a civilian."* - Fri Nov  6 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you... human? - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Of course. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you sure? - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just. . .different. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: At least. - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I can say at one point I was. - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you aren't anymore? - Fri Nov  6 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Fri Nov  6 02:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I never met anyone different...so ...I thought I could tell you. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't tell anyone though. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And. . .do tell. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: How aren't you human? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm uh.... - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't die. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Technically. . .I can't exactly either. . .if I maintain. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) shook her head, "I don't eat, drink, sleep, anything. I was ... made."* - Fri Nov  6 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I told you why I told you.... because you are like me. Different. - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Who made you? And what are you exactly then? - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't tell you what I am.... - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I .... I don't know. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know what I am... or who made me. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I assume. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's nature related. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What? - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... I guess... I thought that was just something I was good at and everyone else was bad. - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not exactly. - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Normal people can't talk to plants. - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So will you take it? - Fri Nov  6 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Depends. - Fri Nov  6 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Are you going to be around as well? - Fri Nov  6 02:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...You are saying that's Ortho? He didn't kill the Mizukage from what I'm aware. - Fri Nov  6 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: It's what everyone said. - Fri Nov  6 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: She never arrived in Suna after we evacuated. That's why i've come, but I have reason to believe she may be tied with Ortho... - Fri Nov  6 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: He was just here and I let him pass. - Fri Nov  6 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Any reason for that? - Fri Nov  6 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I gave it Nina. - Fri Nov  6 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Being, Violet was basically a mother to her. - Fri Nov  6 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I figured she should be the one to bury her. - Fri Nov  6 03:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't really know...probably because all we were ever taught was how to pick up trash, chase dogs, clean steps, and dig holes. - Fri Nov  6 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh and how to build houses. - Fri Nov  6 03:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Nah. After looking around in the village, I just became aware of everything and looked at the signs that we were supposed to head to Sunagakure. - Fri Nov  6 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: Do they think I'm a traitor or a spy? - Fri Nov  6 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oh. So the person that killed the Mizukage was never caught? - Fri Nov  6 04:21:07 2015

She notably watched the Mizukage escorting the two girl's out and honorably bowed to the man. * - Fri Nov  6 06:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) wrinkled her nose up and sneared her lip up at his distasteful attitude. "I'd ask for forgiveness for our moment of greeting being disturbed, Mizukage. Clearly though, this man doesn't deserve forgiveness from anyone. She didn't have a reason to glance to Nina as she left so her turquiose eyes remained trained on Ketsu. "The names Ajisai anyhow."* - Fri Nov  6 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) pursed her lips in an 'unimpressed' expression. "So what if I do like sake, doesn't mean Ima share any with you. Tch.." She bowed gently to the Mizukage again, "Pleasure to meet you Mizukage Jehan, I'll be seeking out some sake since it's on the brain now. He didn't bother me too severely, looks like that child has more to worry about than I do." With that last comment she brushed some of her musky looking hair back behind her left ear and turned to leave the area after a final look between Jehan and Ketsu.* - Fri Nov  6 06:55:34 2015

She squinted at him and drank down the rest of the sake. She did -not- like what it was doing to her. She felt.... out of control of her cells and it was an odd tingling sensation. "I don't think samurai drink with shinobi, at least not unless they are holding discussions for peace."* - Fri Nov  6 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) shrugged, "I didn't say we wanted peace, I said those discussions are the only time we would drink together. So stay on your side of the table, mister shinobi."* - Fri Nov  6 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) rose her brow and didn't understand what he meant. "What do you mean?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and then straight up threw her empty sake cup at his stupid forehead.* - Fri Nov  6 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Uhuh. - Fri Nov  6 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) gestured her hand for a waiter to bring her another cup and to clean up the broken one behind Ketsu.* - Fri Nov  6 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Two, I've only been a full samurai for a couple of years. Before that I helped around the temple. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Quick reply.. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Come over here.. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) scowled, "Fat chance."* - Fri Nov  6 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider the chance to be on a diet.. - Fri Nov  6 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) didn't get the joke and stared at him for a moment before standing up. Hand went to the hilt of her katana and she extracted it. Sitting down on the cushion beside him she placed the blade across the table with the sharp edge towards his chest as she held onto the hilt and stared at him.* - Fri Nov  6 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) gripped the hilt tighter, "what do you think you are doing? Do you have a death wish?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) didn't know if she should continue the facade any longer. He was pushing limits but she decided there could be one or two more steps taken. Suddenly she jerked the blade up and pressed the sharp edge against the front of his neck as she breathed heavily. Imitating adrenaline pumping through her body quite well... after all she had seen plenty worked up, it wasn't that hard.* - Fri Nov  6 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Being that I have paid for the mansion to be fixed, I'll be there if you need me. - Fri Nov  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) inhaled sharply as he easily stopped her attempt to simply threaten him. Her eyes dialated and she panted heavily at the sudden threatening tension. She said nothing and looked him straight in the eye with a defiant look.* - Fri Nov  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Let go of me.... - Fri Nov  6 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) said in a demanding tone, "Yes, you -will-."* - Fri Nov  6 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) grumbled and turned her head away from him. Waiting.* - Fri Nov  6 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: How do I keep pretending, I don't want to deny him this. - Fri Nov  6 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) sighed out as he neared her lips, "You win," mumbled out. She stared back at him in wait of what he wanted to claim.* - Fri Nov  6 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) felt strange as he made this action, some type of happiness or satisfaction had sprung from him lightly teasing her with the kiss. When he pulled away she peered up at him and wondered why he wasn't speaking, happy he won the game, or why he was still holding her so tightly against him. "What is it?"* - Fri Nov  6 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) closed her eyes for a moment as he kissed her cheek and then adjusted herself on the cushion as he turned back towards the table. "Thank you, but I wish I hadn't had to drink that sake...it made me feel weird."* - Fri Nov  6 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) rubbed her lips together, "tingling... I have never tingled."* - Fri Nov  6 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: And it tasted terrible. - Fri Nov  6 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think I will.. - Fri Nov  6 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) rolled her shoulders back and lifted her chin to show of her form. "Do you like my new body?"* - Fri Nov  6 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) leaned forward to whisper beside his ear so they were cheek brushing cheek. "I...need you to help me figure out the parts I am missing... I want to be ... whole." * - Fri Nov  6 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) nodded, "And uh... the chest part you said."* - Fri Nov  6 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) nodded and then stood up, she was still in her mimicking ways with this new form so the entire way out she was chewing on her lip as if nervous. She kind of found the whole new body and personalities fun.* - Fri Nov  6 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) blinked as she looked down at the magazines, "What are those?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Those clothing don't look very useful for warmth. - Fri Nov  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: See.. something you know you don't have..? - Fri Nov  6 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit, "Why do they have buttons on their chest? What is the purpose of that part?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) knew she probably couldn't get aroused but it was a missing part. She placed her hands on the table and closed her eyes as she began concentrating and channeling chakra through her body. Cells multiplying and shifting as her body morphed under the clothing. She was silent but jerking occasionally until finally she fell still and opened her eyes to look up towards him. "Okay. What else was I missing?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes and leaned forward. She was extremely curious about this now, "It's.... so detailed..."* - Fri Nov  6 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head and then nodded. She bit down on her lip again and then held her palms against the table again. This time it would take longer but only a few seconds more, it would seem as if it took the same amount of time really. When she was done she looked up to him and nodded. "Maybe we should check for anything else?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I meant check the book but.... - Fri Nov  6 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) blinked quickly a few times, "Oh okay." She pulled her katana from her side and then started to untie the dress wrappings and let it fall away to the cushion below her. Now only sitting in one of the many assortments of panties and bras Index had given her. Only a brief pause and she started undoing the bra to reveal smaller breasts than the last time he had seen her nude, and now they held aerola and nipples, though they were ...still the same color as the rest of her skin really, she couldn't help that. Following with her panties and shoes which shown the cameltoe look that she hadn't had before, of course she had no hair. In fact she never had hair anywhere on her body but her head, it was pointless and delayed cleanliness.* - Fri Nov  6 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) peered over his shoulder as he was trying not to look at her for the last portion of undressing. When he got to the part where a girl was bent over with a man behind her she widened her eyes and started to understand how their fertilization works. "That thing, I don't have that. What is that one for?" She was speaking general but then realized there was a lot going on with this page and so she pointed right to what she was speaking about. Le asshole. (sh)* - Fri Nov  6 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you need another one? - Fri Nov  6 09:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I can't feel pleasure... - Fri Nov  6 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) twitched her lips to the side, "okay." She concentrated for a bit but it took hardly any time this time around. She looked back at him. "Is anything else missing?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) didn't look freaked out, she looked like she was concentrating, learning, trying to soak it all up even as she sat beside him naked without any nerves at all. When he had spoken up again she peered up at him. "Yeah I think that was all."* - Fri Nov  6 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hm... he's acting like Index was. - Fri Nov  6 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) leaned in closer to him to test the waters and see what reaction she might get. Watching him intently.* - Fri Nov  6 10:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) narrowed her gaze and instantly shot forward. Granted...she isn't fast -at all- but she tried to get closer to the two while avoiding the air bullets being sent out. "Stop this! I don't know what just happened between you two but you are friends... to some extent. Get past your differences, both of you are better than this."* - Sat Nov  7 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Erg, Ortho, why aren't you listening... - Sat Nov  7 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) tightened her fists in a bit if irritation at they weren't stopping. Emotion seemed to be forcing her to act and speak which was strange for her. She didn't understand it truly. Rushing forward still, she had never stopped running, the female tried to get between them. A dangerous attempt but she hoped if she was between them then they might pause or hesitate for a moment to listen. "Whatever happened between you two can be sorted, you just need to stop attacking and speak! You can't talk it out before you kill each other? What is one conversation compared to losing a friend forever that you -do- care about?! Or losing your own lives! Or both!"* - Sat Nov  7 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) kept running forward! Clearly they weren't listening so she wasn't speaking anymore, she simply was aiming to become collateral damage between them, HOPING they might stop or consider what they were doing.* - Sat Nov  7 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) *Ortho broke off into a full sprint, aiming to close the distance between him and Index. Another set of handseals were woven together and his chakra rapidly kneaded within his stomach. Just as he puckered his lips to expel the jutsu he prepared Ajisai stepped right in the crossfire. It was one thing to launch jutsus at him from a distance to get him to stop, but even he had boundaries to not harm Nina and Ajisai when they stepped head first into the line of battle.

Ortho's frame stopped, his eyes momentarily transitioning from Index to the pale skinned female. It rests on her for a few seconds before panning the area for Nina. His anger was clouding his mind, but these two females in his life were acting as a united ray of light piercing through. His fists clenched and he placed his focus back on Index, saying nothing.*) REPOST* - Sat Nov  7 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) sighed out, relieved, she ... swore she actually felt adrenaline for a moment but decided that was crazy. "Please... just talk... if you have a good reason to kill each other then have at it, but at least talk it through first."* - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) felt anger for a split second before it was gone again. "Stop it! You are talking about things you don't even fully understand Ortho! He misses Katsune, he hasn't seen her in a long time! And even if he goes and tries to run back to her, wouldn't you end up doing the same for your spouse?" When the fireball had subsided she stepped out in front of the mud wall being formed, knowing full well she was going to take a hit from the wind attack. She knew that mud wall probably wasn't going to hold up but hopefully she could dampen the damage that would come to Nina and Ortho. As she stood there looking up towards Index, she looked saddened almost. 

Just as the wind attack struck her body and began to spray red gushes across the grass between herself and Index, he would be able to see it like an illusion fading away. The green hair, the facial features of the person she was disguised as changed back into her original self as if she had been a henge of another woman. Ume stood there with back pressed against the mud wall and being ripped to shreds by the extreme attack of wind. The gore was intense, and sprayed out around the area, as her sunflower yellow eyes peered up towards Index she looked disappointed in him. "Was it worth the lust for death? Now you have it, I hope you learn to cherish him... he really is your brother. I hoped you would have seen that." With that, Ume's eyes fluttered shut as she coughed up a tiny line of blood that drooled down her pale chin and dripped to her chest. All that life both Ortho and Index had seen in her, seemingly vanished in a single strike, stripping away someone they had hoped to care for years.* - Sat Nov  7 01:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) || As Ortho sat over the corpse, slowly there was movement forming from it's location. The spores inside of her body were regenerating and likely with him unable to notice for a long while as he sat there grieving his lost love, Ume was being brought back from death's bed. 

Soon enough eyes opened, everything was still splattered in the fake blood and she peered up towards Ortho. Seeing how he was so saddened by the loss of Ume, she didn't know it was going to have this heavy of an effect on him. Her shakey hand reached up towards his cheek trying to brush over any scratchy five o'clock shadow he had going on.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) smiled weakly, "No need to be sorry, I did what I needed to keep you alive." She groaned slightly as her body was shifting and trying to morph into a new identity before she wanted it to. "Who is still with you?"* - Sat Nov  7 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) sighed out, "hush, you didn't fail me. Index failed... he couldn't resist, even when it came to harming me. You at least had the sense to step away from us, he didn't care. Not until he already had seen what he had done to me." She sighed out and closed her eyes, "you don't want Nina to know I'm still alive... yes?"* - Sat Nov  7 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly, "I'm still too weak... perhaps, after I change you can carry me back as someone you found left for dead after you buried the body? D-do you have any Kirigakure headbands?" She was already starting to change, her dark purple hair shifting towards white and her features changing as she spoke.* - Sat Nov  7 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thought for a short moment, she had been thinking about this for quite a while as she tried to regenerate for the last several hours. "The beginning of the End.... Hajimari Owari.... Owari...yes..."* - Sat Nov  7 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) weakly smiled, "not ..dying, sort of sucks...Hah..." She smiled wider as she laughed some. Her body felt extremely tired.* - Sat Nov  7 05:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) was passed out it seemed, and looked worse for wear by the looks of her facial features and body over all. It looked swollen as if she had been seriously injured in the past and was still recovering.* - Sat Nov  7 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) woke up as all of this was going on, groaning faintly and speaking out with a very soft whispy voice. "Where the hell am I?" Clearly the soft looking female had a bit of a tongue on her, mixed with the fact her haircut was rather edgy for someone dressed like herself. She was a walking irony...* - Sat Nov  7 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Did you really think I was dead? - Sat Nov  7 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes.. and no. I knew you can't die, but that doesn't mean I take joy in seeing your lifeless body.. - Sat Nov  7 06:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So that's why he felt it was wrong... - Sat Nov  7 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) nodded slowly, "that... is honestly the stupidest fucking thing I have ever heard as a reason to kill each other. I -died- over vagina?"* - Sat Nov  7 07:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) wasn't sure how to respond at first, she stared at the pillow under her arm and thought. Speaking out in a hushed voice, "The last thing I said to him...well before all that mess, I told him I was going to talk to him. We were going to talk in depth, as friends.... he was worried that I wouldn't want him to know me. He just wanted a friend, it.... he was sad."* - Sat Nov  7 07:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Whenever you feel up to it.. - Sat Nov  7 07:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) blinked, "it makes you walk on water too?" She was fascinated like this. It didn't make scientific sense to her at all. She folded her hands into the seal and tried to walk forward but only managed to splash some. She then mumbled to herself at how impossible this must be and that Ortho was just tricking her mind somehow. She then tried again and after a few more tries began to get it. When she finally had it, her dress was soaked and she was staring at Ortho like 'that was stupid'. "Okay.... so that one wasn't as fun to learn as the other ones."* - Sat Nov  7 08:58:52 2015
