<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) gripped his arms and shift as she was held up, it was extremely easy to catch her due to her light weight. "Alcohoooooooooooooooool."* - Sat Nov 28 16:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was bent at the hips so her dress was up a bit and exposing anyone in the hall behind her to her panties and short slender legs. She stumbled around holding onto his arms as she tried to balance in the heels. "I-i-i-iiiiiiiiiii-i-i-iiiiii uhhhhh wait what was you askin'?" She blinked a few times and then shook her head hard back and forth with her pink and black hair flying around. "Nngng, better. Right, I went to Kumogakure! I never been to the mountains before, and then I made some friends! And we drank some sake, I haven't had sake since coming to the island. It was fun! And guess what!" She struggled to stand fully up and then wrapped him in a tight and warm hug before rubbing her cheek against his neck and goaning happily. "I am the best hug giver, EVER!"* - Sat Nov 28 16:32:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mngng. - Sat Nov 28 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nuzzled up against his hand as he pet her with complete happiness and pride. She was easily pissed up and nuzzled in against his chest, it was obvious she was in a -really- good mood. "I met a male who was really nice, he was jealous of how rich I was! I felt bad for him so I gave him a 'loan' I don't know what that means but it got him to take my gift, he wouldn't take it without it being called a loan. What is a loan?" She stared up at him with a pout on her bottom lip.

She continued talking without pausing long enough for him to respond, he was probably having to speak over her. "I got to see the giant mountains but I didn't get to go find plants. I was people watching! And you know what?! It's cold there! People were wearing jackets and there was snow!" She had a giant grin on her face as she finished. She couldn't think of anything else right now and let her head fall back with her mouth open as she started to make an 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhh' sound while staring at the moving room as he carried her.* - Sat Nov 28 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: OH RIGHT, I got called crazy. - Sat Nov 28 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That was funny. - Sat Nov 28 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) widened her eyes, "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh." kicked her feet back and forth as he was carrying her into the room and shut the door. "You've asked me about snow before remember! Cold, white, and flakey! Falls out of the sky and it lays all over the ground! Silly Master! Heheh." She giggled girlishly as her voice wasn't distorted at all with her head hanging upside down. "And yeah, funny. It's funny because to be cazy you have to have emotions and that means my emotions were noticable! Hehehe, so I did it! I did good!" She felt herself laid on the bed with her legs hanging off and her dress likely rose up high just below her panty line. "Hm hm hm.~" She rocked her head back and forth with her eyes closed.* - Sat Nov 28 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: So Zeno you're about to head out? - Sat Nov 28 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -mischan- - Sat Nov 28 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) listened to him speaking and held he feet still as he removed her boots and kissed her feet over her stockings. She started to kick the points of her feet gently after he sat beside her and peered up to him. "Yes I love them, well.. One feels sort of funny. When someone tells me to do something I have to think really hard about it to stop myself if I don't want to do it because of other emotions. That is sort of strange, I didn't know that you needed so much balance... and shame is sort of bad but sometimes it fits."* - Sat Nov 28 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stared up into his eyes and rubbed her cheek against his hand. She sighed out gently, "it's there... but this new emotion makes it easy to push away." * - Sat Nov 28 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) didn't really want to move. She lay there all spawled out with her legs hanging off the bed and just kept her face in his hands. "Mngn... Master, can you do think you do to a doll that you haven't done before? I want to learn more about being a doll." She knew exactly what she was doing, and honestly? If he was focusing on her he would be able to tell she was being mischevious.* - Sat Nov 28 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you do things you do to a doll that you haven't done before?* - Sat Nov 28 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) shrugged gently and shifted on the bed some, "I don't know.~ Whatever you have wanted to do to your doll that you haven't done.~ You talk about dressing me up all the time and things like that. I don't know.~" She giggled in a silly manner.* - Sat Nov 28 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt her dress slowly being stripped off of her in a way that tugged at every part of her body as he removed it from her person. She watched him while this was going on and felt the kisses to her shoulders. "Yes, I remember, are we going to play dress up, Master?~" She was still fairly drunk so she wasn't moving more than she had to. Under her dress she had innocent looking pink and lace panties and bra.* - Sat Nov 28 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt him kissing over her body and she held still with her head only shifting occasionally so she could watch him. She felt her bra removed and shifted a bit so her arms felt back hard on the bed with weight as if she really was a doll. Course it wasn't going to hurt her so what would Thirteen mind? She lay there with her arms sprawled out as he licked over her soft nipples and trailed down her body to assumably remove her panties. "Does it feel good on your tongue, Master? You like putting me in your mouth."* - Sat Nov 28 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt all the kisses but it didn't give her tingles, then she had a -great- idea. She sat her upper body up but then felt dizzy. "Ngng.. I had an idea, Master! What if when you are doing things to me like this you describe what you are feeling to me as you are doing them? Then I can maybe enjoy it too through... the emotions?" She wasn't sure if that would work or not but thought it might be worth a shot, because who doesn't get worked up from dirty talk? 

She watched as he licked over her clit and outer lips in a single long lick. She could tell how much he liked it and wanted to know what he liked about it. When he gripped her shoulders and she was flipped over she was disoreinted for a moment and groaned with a small squirm as her hips raised up and her ass circled in the air a bit directly near his face. "Nngng, so much spinning," right after he comment she fell onto the bed with a slip of her knee from the dizzy spell.* - Sat Nov 28 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) || If she had a heart it would have skipped a beat.... She froze all movement as she listened to him while he was parting her cheeks and looking over what she had to offer. It wasn't like he hadn't seen it before but he was getting a -really- close look now. It was like she had a porn star pussy and ass, but hey...thats what you get when you use a porno mag as your reference for what to look like. She looked back to him and stuttered out, "I-i-i don't know if the talking was a good idea." She could feel her emotions going crazy and she was feeling the shame, pride, love, and submission at at once. She rubbed her lips together and shuddered a single time after she had spoken up. As she began to feel the pressure of him licking around her slit and then stick his tongue into her his metaphor was strong in her mind and she actually -jumped- when she felt the pressure.* - Sat Nov 28 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was staring at the wall before her as he stated these things and she was growing more and more flustered as he spoke them and trembled and twitched with each little tongue stroke and poke. She didn't know what to do since she had never felt ..... something when being touched. His words were doing the work and she gripped the bed sheets hard and her toes curled under as she felt him 'adventuring' inbetween her cheeks. "Th-that... I.. never... I.... M-master? I.... I feel strange... " She bit down hard on her lip and had to lay her head down. Was it the alcohol or his words? She felt tingly from the things she was hearing that cooresponded to what he was doing to her body.* - Sat Nov 28 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) squirmed from his touches now as she could feel the stack of emotions driving her crazy. "I.. so many... s-so many emotions... how can y-your words do that to me? It's making me... f-feel so... violated... and I-i like it...." She shuddered again and looked over her shoulder back to him and her eyes looked to be wanting and submissive but a little scared from her emotions currently. It was the perfect submissive expression to give to a Master.* - Sat Nov 28 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) listened to him and then gulped heavily and nodded. She felt herself being rolled onto her side and she watched him as he rose her leg up to the top of his shoulder and began to insert his tip into her pussy. She bit down hard on her lip and decided to use the new words she had learned some time ago that Thirteen had never heard her say. "Are you going to put your cock inside of my pussy?" The words sounded extremely dirty coming from a voice and tone as innocent at her's.* - Sat Nov 28 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) trembled drastically after she had spoken, especially when he forced all the way into her so quickly. She gasped out and bit down hard on her lip as her hips swayed forward some and then back as he based out inside of her. She was shocked that this meant anything to her, but everything he had been saying earlier was really getting to her. "C-can you keep telling me things, Master?"* - Sat Nov 28 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down hard on her lip and moaned out not in physical pleasure but from the emotions breaking her mind quickly from all of them clashing together. She didn't  understand them so it was certainly.... splitting her mind. She then begged out faintly. She felt her emotions overwhelming her and she knew that it was effecting his standing with her overall...hell, the fact she was allowing this to happen.... it was nonsense. Deep down her hateful side knew that... 

"M-master... can you tell me... w-what else you like about d-doing these things to me? B-besides you feeling aroused? D-do you enjoy making me squirm when I c-can't feel or be hurt? D-do you like the s-slim chance you can make me feel -something-? L-like how I feel righ tnow... I-i'm so nervous, I-i... I feel s-so out of control.~" She moaned out again and rubbed the side of her head against the comforter.* - Sat Nov 28 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard all the moans and sexual comments he was making. She could tell he was enjoying it and then at some point during the entire bout of sexual exploration. She bit down on her lip and then looked up towards him and struggled out her next words through heavy emotion written over her face and in her eyes, not to mention her tone.

"I love you, Master."* - Sat Nov 28 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) parted her lips and instantly leaned upwards with her extreme flexibility to kiss him back passionately with the love she was feeling for him. Course there were many factors on how he had earned those words, was it legitimate how he earned them? Probably not... but he had gotten them out of her. She was a weak doll beneath him and only trembled from the emotions wracking through her mind.* - Sat Nov 28 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned out into the kiss and he would have to break it if he wanted to breathe. She kept up the kissing until he couldn't take it anymore and then she licked over her lips to taste his saliva soaking her lips and tongue. "Mng... M-master..."* - Sat Nov 28 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) laid on the bed as her leg fell to her others as he pulled out of her and she was instantly clean already. She moved closer to him and draped limbs and half a body over him as her head rested on his shoulder. Her drunken state had disappeared...* - Sat Nov 28 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard what he said and then peered up to him, "would you like me to go get you your coffee, Master?"* - Sat Nov 28 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... - Sat Nov 28 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: H-how? - Sat Nov 28 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) felt shamed for not knowing how to shake her hips.* - Sat Nov 28 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood up and then tried to shake her hips back and forth while watching her hips from the front as she walked. "Like this?" She had it pretty well down...but it wasn't great. She went to get his coffee and then came back still swaying her hips.* - Sat Nov 28 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) huffed at the panties but took them and put them on. She then followed him out of the room.* - Sat Nov 28 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took that shit off.* - Sat Nov 28 21:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked over to Yori with a large smile.* - Sat Nov 28 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Can Yori have a hug? - Sat Nov 28 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Not a special one, a normal one is fine. - Sat Nov 28 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: There are special hugs? - Sat Nov 28 21:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) walked over towards Yori with her smile widening as she held her arms out, and it looked like she was trying to get him to hug her.* - Sat Nov 28 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) hugged him tight and warmly, some might even say she had the best damn hug in the universe. She rest her head on his shoulder and nuzzled her cheek in against his neck instinctually. When she did this, and anywhere else he felt her skin, he would find that she was -crazy- soft. She was the softest thing he had ever touched, not only that...but she is the softest thing he will ever touch -ever-.* - Sat Nov 28 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pulled away and walked back over to Thirteen with a tiny giggle and a giant smile. She looked like the happiest girl in the world, which didn't make sense consideing how she normally behaves. She pulled herself up onto the desk and sat beside Thirteen and leaned her head against his shoulder as he drank his coffee. Her legs kicked back and forth slowly as she watched Yori. <I love hugs.>* - Sat Nov 28 21:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Because I am a very curious cat.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took a few steps forward more and then leaned forward as she bent at the hips. Of course that probably gave Thirteen a view under her skirt as she propped herself up on her elbows. She stared at the boy with her heterochromic gaze, she looked similiar to his age. He wouldn't be able to notice any scent on her person at all... which was abnormal, nor did any part of her body have hair on it that was visible other than the hair on her head. "Is that a good enough answer?"* - Sun Nov 29 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked over her shoulder and hadn't seemed phased by Kida commenting on her tits. She looked back towards the boy before her at the desk, "he does that, wouldn't you? But that isn't the focus of this conversation, sly-chan.~" She widened her lips up into a sweet endearing smile. "How many people are with you that kicked everyone out of here?~"* - Sun Nov 29 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I thnk I'll have a little fun with these two. - Sun Nov 29 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Good thing I swiped these from Shiro last night. - Sun Nov 29 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) heard him propose a game and then bit down on her lip hard and groaned out in what sounded like pleasure at the mention of a game. "Ooooooh, I LOVE games.~ Especially dice games with questions.~ I'm not sure that goldylocks-kun will want to play though.~ Perhaps it can just be you and me?~ He can watch and learn, he's never played before. Only fair, an equal side on each team.~ Unless you are hiding someone away?~" * - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: My room mates are away, at least two are. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then we can play, just you and me, Sly-kun.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Besides, one would probably attack, another would probably..Hm..What would she do? Eh. Well, let's just say I'm one of the calm ones. - Sun Nov 29 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Good good.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I do like calm. - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So Goldylocks, not joining? - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm not much of a fighter after all.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) pused her lips a bit, "what were the uncivilized things you thought of?" She reached out to take her dice.* - Sun Nov 29 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You know, sex, bodily injury, etc. - Sun Nov 29 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: OOooooh.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: About the sex at least. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Silly me.~ - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But let's not dwindle on what my horrible punishments were. What's your idea? - Sun Nov 29 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmmmmm.... the person who doesn't want to answer has to do something the other person wants them to do. But if you refuse to do the action then the game ends.~  - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Neither of us want the game to end. - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright then. - Sun Nov 29 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So it's easy to assume we will be reasonable, while still testy.~ - Sun Nov 29 04:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Damn, forgetting my own rules. - Sun Nov 29 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: We have none. - Sun Nov 29 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm...Me personally, I suppose I'd agree. After all, you can't rule a village with only a handful of people. You need money and trade.  So I'd say yes. - Sun Nov 29 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: To keep the village prospering. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But she abandoned it. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: More like she got kicked in the head, then fled out of embarassment. - Sun Nov 29 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Besides, I never heard of such a term for villages. I thought if you took the leader out, or if there were no leaders, it's free reign. - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are cheating.~ - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The people who run a village do not actually -own- it. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The daiymou owns the village. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Aah. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why I am also willing to help pay to build this village up for both your benefit and mine if you chose to stay. - Sun Nov 29 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I see. Then I guess I can talk to the others about this. - Sun Nov 29 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) notes that because Ichiro just walked in that direction and how Yuriko is leaned against the desk that he probably can see her pretty pink lace panties and her fai toned ass cheeks.* - Sun Nov 29 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmph. - Sun Nov 29 05:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Why did you personally come here? - Sun Nov 29 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) chuckled as she toyed with her dice. "Because the person I inherited this land from was special to me, and they wanted something to come of this land in the future."* - Sun Nov 29 05:39:12 2015
