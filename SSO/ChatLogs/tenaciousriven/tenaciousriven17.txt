In the future maybe I will need something that both your group and I will need. Such as this situation with going to Kirigakure, I'm willing to help to benefit me in the future. - Mon Dec  7 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Basically a silent investor and possible partnership in .... actions later. - Mon Dec  7 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: For this you will be from Takumi no Sato, a small village that is non shinobi oriented. They will think you are there to sell goods, I have a caravan waiting outside Amegakure for you to complete the look. Getting into Kirigakure isn't all that hard. - Mon Dec  7 03:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked between the three and if there was no objection the guard would unseal a small kit and begin to go to work forging the fake papers for the three. When he was finished after a long process later he handed each of them their papers with a fuuinjutsu formulated picture to match their identification of their choosing (depending on if they were going to change their appearance). "If you wear masks then you will be realized to be suspicious, vendors don't wear masks like dirty thieves."* - Mon Dec  7 03:33:45 2015
