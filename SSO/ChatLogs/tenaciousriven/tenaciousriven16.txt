<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down hard on her blood coated lip and ran her hands up her torso and moaned out at how Eiyu had reacted. "You want to play? I haven't played in -such- a LONG tiiiiime.~ Course if you are bluffing we can still have that nice conversation about a deal?~ It's all up to you tease-kun.~" She had decided he needed a new nickname, after all.. someone -willing- to play with -her-? She was excited.

"I hardly ever get to play... No one wants to play with such an unbreakable doll, perhaps it isn't fun?~" She groaned again and neared the male slowly as she had done so before, it looked like she just wanted to hold onto him again like she was doing before. The clone behind her was entirely ignored.* - Thu Dec  3 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Eiyu. . .Don't do it. - Thu Dec  3 07:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sighed out with irritation that he was stepping back but once he had summoned a creature her eyes widened before she even saw the creature and a very polite and sweet grin came upon her face as the toad stared down to her. The toad would feel something about her that he likely wouldn't communicate at first to Eiyu but would have a type of respect for Yuriko. He would actually be -charmed- by her presence but was still skeptical of her due to what she had done in the presence of Eiyu, him being the contract holder. 

She curstied and then smiled up to the creature. "Oh look, he brought someone else to the tea party, such a handsome guest indeed.~"* - Thu Dec  3 07:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sighed out at how Eiyu had gone away and then she pouted out. "No fun... I liked your handsome guest...why did you have to send him away?" She pouted heavily looking as if she was about to cry, her eyes becoming big and puppy dog like as she wiggled her hips back and forth.* - Thu Dec  3 08:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) turned to the clone as it tapped her on the shoulder and she clung to the clone but she wasn't an idiot...she knew she couldn't eat the clone and instead was pressing her breasts against his belly and her face against his chest as she shuddered with unhappiness. "I was just trying to make a deal, then he wanted to play? Why did he run away from me?! I thought he wanted to play? No one ever wants to play with me!" She sounded partly hateful and partly saddened.* - Thu Dec  3 08:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) continued to shudder and 'sob' into the clones chest but no tears fell as she held onto the clone as she 'cried'. Lifting her head she looked up to Takuma and felt her bottom lip trembling, "Y-you think? Bu-but I wanted to make a deal with him... W-where did he go? We were gonna play!"* - Thu Dec  3 08:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) released Takuma and made her way back to Eiyu again slowly. She seemed -determined- to hold onto the person she was speaking with. The process cycled back to her trying to wrap her arms up and around the back of his neck with her body pressed against his and the dark red blood drying on her neck and breasts, most that had been on her face had been licked off.* - Thu Dec  3 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Won't you make a deal with me? Or are you going to keep trying to play, Tease-kun? - Thu Dec  3 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Bingo.~ - Thu Dec  3 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was very aware of her surroundings, how she was aware was completely unknown to the two in front of her but even as she was leaningon Eiyu she pulled away for a split second as chakra built up within her body and then she spat out a large torent of water that completely -obliterated- the fireball and likely the clone. The fireball would sizzle out like a match being blown out and the clone of Takuma would be entirely removed as an issue. 

Humming out she looked back up to Eiyu and stood on her tip toes to inhale deeply and take in the kage's scent. "Where were we, Tease-kun?~" She only had wanted to stop the attack of the fireball, she didn't even know she was going to take out the clone but hey... two birds with one stone and all.

"I would like to make a deal concerning your prisoners who need....disposed of. As you can see, I have quite the appetite.~"* - Thu Dec  3 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was apparently talking to a old piece of stool on the ground... Yeah, poop. She walked over towards Takuma again and looked at his bandaged arm and wrapped her arms around the back of his neck. "Now then... I know you might not like me all that much for what I did but if you and I make a good deal maybe I can fix it for you?~" She hummed lightly and ran a finger along his jawline seductively as she leaned in to her lips being just an inch from his own.* - Thu Dec  3 09:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) giggled slightly and then spoke up again as she kept her face close to his own so he could smell the blood from his shoulder. "A deal where we discuss a new ...disposal system for your prisoners you normally execute... well course you can execute them but I prefer them -alive-... after all you did get a little...'taste' of my appetite."* - Thu Dec  3 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down on her lip -hard- at what he said and groaned lightly in pleasure. "See, I knew I would like you.~ Such a good idea.~ Now then, do we have a deal? I get your prisoners for execution and I don't eat anymore of people in your lovely mountain village. Hm?~ --oh yes, and I'll fix you up nice and proper.~" She wiggled her hips back and forth as her dress swayed and a light giggle sounded.* - Thu Dec  3 09:08:16 2015

Then he would feel something lukewarm against his shoulder wound and she held it in place as his wound would start to feel -amazing- and as if it was regenerating at a rediculous rate. None of the normal side effects of shinobi healing were present, and when she was finished she pulled her hands away and then spoke up with a smile on her face. 

"You can look now," if he did look at the shoulder he would see that there wasn't a -single- scar left. It was perfect, if he ever had a scar there before the bite? It was also gone. The skin and flesh was flawless and there was no pain. If he attempted to have this tissue analyzed by a doctor later he wouldn't be able to figure out what had caused it at all. It was untracable.* - Thu Dec  3 09:39:50 2015

When she saw his heterochromic gaze her eyes widened and she smiled wide, "Ooooooh, someone like me.~" She blinked her pink and brown heterochromic gaze and then looked at how his hair was evne like her, Yuriko's being half pink half brown on opposite sides of the eyes. (So that pink hair is with brown eye, brown hair is with pink eye)

She then peered towards Yori, "what was his mutation and number?" She slowly walked towards the leashed and jacketed boy who looked rather young to her. She pushed forward until her nose was nearly touching his own but not quite all the way against him. "Hello there,~" She waited for the information before saying more.* - Thu Dec  3 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled nice and wide with a bit of a crazed lookin her eyes. Whispering out, "sixty nine...." then giggled lightly and spoke up gently in a warm and probably too friendly tone. "I am Yuriko-chan,~ This is my base--but Thirteen runs it right now. The scientists were being very very bad and put you down here without permission so I am going to take you out if you are a good boy, are you a good boy?~" She hummed gently and wanted to touch him but she knew it probably was dangerous. Against her instincts she reached her right hand up and ran it over the burned side of his body along his cheek.* - Thu Dec  3 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Yuriko has definately changed. - Thu Dec  3 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) bit down hard on her lip when Nine spoke of leaving her a nice shade of black. "I'm sure you'll find that hard to manage with someone like me, you can try all you like but if I let you out of this room and chains you have to understand if you hurt anyone else who is part of our group or this compound without good reason then I will have to put you back into your cage. You have to understand even if I don't like being an owner of others, I -do- own you and Thirteen is over you. We are the only two you have to listen to and the guards might try and keep you in line if you do something bad but...yeah... if you are a good boy then you don't have to worry.~" She ran her hand up through his hair and ruffled it before releasing her hand from his person. It likely could be noted by the boy, if he had feeling in his burnt cheek, that her hand was -extremely- soft. He probably has never felt something so soft in his lifetime or ever will feel something as soft as her skin again.

When he stood she stood and took a step back as he began to flame up with steam and then the flame burst out on the straight jacket. "OoooooOooOO.~ I like you Nine-kun.~" * - Thu Dec  3 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: U-uhm. - Thu Dec  3 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He's like you. - Thu Dec  3 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm.. he was in a cage too but now he uh. - Thu Dec  3 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) paused out of no where and stared off at nothing as a flash back and crazed moment came over her. Her eyes looked crazed and hatred filled as she tried to come back to reality.* - Thu Dec  3 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and craned her head back towards him and almost as if nothing had been wrong she continued speaking. "He run the base for me because I don't know enough how to do everything! I'm just a silly doll so I sit and watch him do the important stuff. Heh.~" Something about how she had said that sounded forced and practiced as she turned to look to Yori and stepped back out of the way. "Can you let him out now, please Yori-kun?~"* - Thu Dec  3 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Thanks. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: So why are you letting me go again? - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Other than wanting to hurt people. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Becauuuuuse.~ - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't like that they locked all of you up and lied to Yosuke. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And you are similiar to me! - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So more friends like me. - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you human? - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmmm? - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) leaned in closer and stepped next to Nine as she stared up at him.* - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Heh. - Thu Dec  3 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Lets go! We have more cages to open! - Thu Dec  3 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) spun on her heel and that's when she spotted Thirteen and froze with wide eyes staring at him.* - Thu Dec  3 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Mmkay. - Thu Dec  3 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly lowered her ehad and then moved through the door past Thirteen. "That's Thirteen, Nine-kun."* - Thu Dec  3 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: hold on he has to log in - Thu Dec  3 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yori, who is this next room? - Thu Dec  3 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: One is in this room, and two is in the other. - Thu Dec  3 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Dec  3 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: One and Two.. - Thu Dec  3 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Twoooooo more people.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yay.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times after the door was opened by Yori and she stared in at the child. "Hm?" She slowly walked over in her heels and then crouched down in front of the boy with her head craned to the side. "You don't look like you belong in here..." he looked so -normal-.... and not at all scary, everyone else had been chained up for being dangerous in the other cages.* - Thu Dec  3 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a bit at the crying child. "What's your sister's name? You are one right?~" She reached out and pet over his hair slowly to try and calm him. "Shh shh, no more crying now. Crying is for the clouds."* - Fri Dec  4 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled wide and nodded as her hand lowered back down, "yes I am going to get you back to your sister because I am letting you out.~ I own this place now and the scientists were bad bad people who hid you away! We are going to make sure you are released and we can all be friends! We won't keep you away from your sister ever again as long as you are a good boy.~" She pat his head again before standing up and reaching an extremely soft hand out to him. "Are you ready to go tell your sister, Thing one?~"* - Fri Dec  4 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) took the boys hand while he was stumbling about. "Mhm.~ I ate all the bad scientists, now only the nice ones who do what we say are here.~" She then led him out of the room and into a hall that was long and white with tiled flooring and numbers on each door. On his door was the number '1' in black, she lead him to the next room down the hall, assumably with everyone else following (They were getting a pretty large group now) to a room with the number '2' upon it's face. 

"Ready?"* - Fri Dec  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stepped inside the room and released the boy's hand, she expected he would rush over to her side and Yuriko slowly walked forward and then crouched in front of the girl. "Ooooooh, a girl! Hello there.~ I'm Yuriko-chan, Thing Two.~" She wiggled her hips back and forth and bobbed her head from side to side. "We are going to let you out okay? That way you can be with your brother and be happy and we can all be friends but you have to promise to be a good girl, if you are bad then things will go badly and we will have to put you back into the cage! So behave like a good girl and everyone can be happy.~" She nodded some and reached up to remove the muzzle, "Do you understand Thing Two?~"* - Fri Dec  4 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) became very serious as she leaned in and pressed her nose against the girls and spoke in a terrorizing and menacing voice. "Now you listen here, either you can be a good girl or I leave you in this room to rot... or I can eat you. Which would you prefer? Be with your brother and free, rotting, or consumed alive?" Her eyes were crazed and shown no mercy at all for the child. 

* - Fri Dec  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Oooh, this flowers got thorns~ - Fri Dec  4 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ----------------Nngng..f-flower. - Fri Dec  4 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Flowers and trees....f-flower... - Fri Dec  4 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was going to prove a point. She felt the nose rubbing against her own and widened her eyes at the weird shown of defiant affection. Her lips pursed and then she leaned in and whispered into Two's ear. "So that we are clear... if you try to be a bad girl I will eat your brother bit by bit..finger by finger..slowly in front of you and then I will eat you just as slowly to assure you stay alive till I finish off your soul. Do we have everything clear?~" She smiled cheerfully as she pulled back and then stood up an began to free the girl from her restraints entirely. God help her if she tried -anything-. Course it was a small room...those who were watching probably could hear the whispers.* - Fri Dec  4 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched the change occuring and their conversation and dispute, as it all was figured out and Two was left in control a wide smile pulled at her lips. "OoooooOoOOo,~ so much fun! You are going to be such a good friend to have! Woooo, let's go Thing One and Thing Two, Nine-kun, Yori-kun,--" she cut off when she saw Thirteen and smiled weakly, "Thirteen.~" Then she continued on to the next room that had a number '12' on the door in black.* - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) opened the door and her, Yori, Nine, Two, and Thirteen all stepped into the room. She made her way with clicking heels over to the male and crouched down in front of where he was sitting and blinked a bit as the only light in the room was coming in from the bright white hallway. "Hello there, Twelve.~ I am Yuriko-chan.~"* - Fri Dec  4 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) brought herself down to eye level and pressed her nose against his nose without any fear of what he might be and stared deeply into those purple eyes with her pink and brow hue's before whispering to him with no breath parting her lips.

"Would you like to be free?"* - Fri Dec  4 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) watched him as her soft nose pressed against his own and she looked to the side at his hands reaching for her neck. A giggle sounded and she wondered what he had done if he was able to reach. "I am not playing games, but you seem to be playing dead.~ I am here to free you, become a free man and be joined with us." She waved her hand back over her shoulder to the others, "if you are a good boy and don't do things unless they are necessary or I or Thirteen says it's okay. We killed all the scientists who did this too you.~ I didn't know they were doing this and I have made it a little mission of mine to free all who are willing to be good so we can be a little rag-tag team of monsters together in harmony. Do you like the sound of that?~" She nuzzled her nose against his own as her eyes slowly blinked and the anticipation of his response was killing her. He was far more intelligent it seemd than the others she had released...ever since Thirteen.* - Fri Dec  4 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) hummed gently and leaned in to whisper against his ear with her lips brushing against his earlobe and curve of cartlidge. "Then I will either leave you here... or eat you up till there is nothing left.~"* - Fri Dec  4 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Well. - Fri Dec  4 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: That's fun. - Fri Dec  4 03:05:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: That's always cool. - Fri Dec  4 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) giggle and then began to release him from his chains with the key. "Good good.~"* - Fri Dec  4 03:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, they are terrible people and they steal each other's dreams and GOBBLE THEM UP! - Fri Dec  4 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) huffed out with distress, clearly why she wanted to be here was vindictive in some way, but granted she was insane... perhaps she read something in a book and it upset her about Kirigakure. She reached out and touched Yori and then Twelves shoulder, a small surge of chakra occured but it was entirely untraceable and what had happened would seem like she was giving some sort of odd comfort rather than anything jutsu based.

She turned and walked forward as she swayed her hips and approached the four guards. "Hello there,~" her hands behind her back as she approached and was swaying in such a way that it made her appear to be just a lovely noble rather than the handseals she was folding behind her back. Soon enough a jutsu was formed and she then used the water nearby from the ocean and had caused a giant wave that washed out the main gate area. The four guards were slammed against the concrete walls and wooden gates. Their bodies mangled in a matter of seconds as they lay dead on the ground. 

"Ahhhhhh, this is going to be a lovely visit.~" 

(have enough stats to one hit kill them)* - Fri Dec  4 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) smiled a maniacal grin and ran her fingers over her lips as she looked at the broken bodies. "Oooooh, I want a snack but I should wait for someone more tasty... I don't like my food soaked, I like it marinated.~" She clicked her heels against the cobble stone path and waved a hand above her head for them to follow as she entered through the gates and stepped over one of the broken bodied corpses. "What shall we do first?~ Ideas anyone?~"* - Sat Dec  5 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) headed through the main street, due to the area and it being so close to the gate there was hardly anyone on the way but the occasional C or D rank shinobi. She ignored them and allowed the others to do as they please. (Make sure to use specific numbers on how many killed so i can keep count) She approached the market place and hummed lightly as her hand ran over the face of the village map. "Eenie, meanie, minie, mooooooo.~" her finger poked all over the map as she sang the song and finally landed her finger on the market place on the map. 

"Oh that was easy," peering up at the market she saw before her back down to the map and then back up to the market. "Okay then,~ Start the chaos~" For now she hung back, wanting to see what the others would do when given freedom.* - Sat Dec  5 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Poison.. - Sat Dec  5 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Need to be careful with him. - Sat Dec  5 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly turned to look at the two approaching as if too smoothly on cue, her doll like features were freakishly perfect and her heterochromic gaze and hair mismatching on each side as she looked Geo and Anguo up and down. "Ooooooh, you two look a little more interesting.~ Hello little children," She reached a hand up and ran it over her lips and down her chin and then neck. The 'doll's' crazed eyes bore into their souls and gave off an aura of utter insanity.

"Have you come to play with us?~"* - Sat Dec  5 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) hummed some and ran her hand down her cleavage and then dropped it to her side. "We are here to play of course, silly willy.~ Everything needs to stay lively, after all it IS this village's moto to spawn chaos is it not? Peace is not permitted for Kirigakure! Your past actions have shown that clearly!" Yuriko kept her focus trained and split between the two so that it wasn't at it's highest level of concentration but able to balance between the two boys. She shifted in her standing of such a delicate doll and into a position that looked to be aggressive in nature. All sanity was forgotten --then again, she didn't have any~--- and she looked to be relying on what she could see and feel around her to react.

The most alarming thing being that he was holding a handseal. With a quick drop of her body she crouched, and likely ended up flashing those in front of her with her pink panties --but who is thinking about that right?--- Her palm touched the ground and with that a sudden burst of chakra flowed out of her body and through the ground as four giant spikes formed around the two boy's, mainly in front of them, to try and block them off from advancing further. She expected the others in her group to act.* - Sat Dec  5 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh yeah suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure, just stand there and look cute Yori-kun! - Sat Dec  5 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: I just came here to have a good time. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: And honestly. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: I feel so attacked right now. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: These people didn't even say hi. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Demanding pricks. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Roses are Red. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Violets are Blue. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: We've gotta do something. - Sat Dec  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sighed out as she saw the mist coming over the area and she darted back as it was spreading out. Course she was a bit slower than the jutsu but given how far away she was, her darting back gave her some time to get out of it's range effectively. She wasn't sure what it was but she knew it couldn't be good if it was accompanied with a handseal, plus she swore she had seen something similar to the semi transparent mist before in her time. Her eyes immediately darted up to the person on the building as if she was all to aware of his presence. Three was enough to handle but she was concerned how long it was taking to kill them since apparently her team decided just to STAND THERE rather than do anything like they did with the others (NPC's), excluding Twelve. Her gaze flicked about the area and seeing how close Yori was she stood on standby watching to see if she needed to activate something in his aid.

Just to be safe she sank down through the ground as it turned into a liquid form before solidifying again as she was hidden away beneath the earth entirely as she monitored the fight. She was tired of these teammates of her not making decisions on their own, just because she acted like she was the boss doesn't mean they can just stand by and look pretty! She waited and lurked while moving back forward beneath the ground.* - Sat Dec  5 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: so iwatobi's attack and anguo - Sat Dec  5 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was monitoring from below the ground. When she was 'informed' of the attack on the two she was trying to protect she immediately liquified the ground above her head just enough so that she had the ability to control techniques above the ground. Her head was still under ground but she was looking up 'through' the liquid even if she couldn't actually -see- with her eyes she was somehow able to keep tabs on what was going around upside. 

While the incoming attacks of fireball, shuriken, and the bite from the alligator beast were coming in she had activated a sudden burst of growth off of Twelve and Yori's bodies. This would not cause any visible chakra for some reason, so sensors were blind to it's activation, but as the growth replicated and surrounded their bodies it was obvious that it was some sort of white foam type of blob clone with a head of a blank female head next to their own. 

When the fire ball came towards Twelve it would have licked and burned some of the white mass but it instantly regenerated again, Twelve was only in jeopardy of being burned on his head, hands, and lower legs. As for Yori, when Iwatobi tried to bite down into him he would get a mushy bite of the mass but it would simply squish in his mouth and be unable to reach down to Yori's body. Then again... some of the shuriken PROBABLY hit the boy before the spores could properly protect him.

As the army of five hundred arrived, it was easily noticed by Yuriko due to her ability to speak and communicate with nature. This entire time and even now the plants in the area were conversing and whispering to her through telepathy. She had been using the information they provided to be aware of locations and otherwise plan her attacks the best she could. 

------
Strategist turn (This is round three of attacks)
------

She shifted under the ground and gripped onto Yori's ankle before ripping him underground with her and beginning to swim through the ground as the surface rehardened and she was trying to leave the area as quickly as she could under the cover of the army now trying to surround the people in the area. (Swim speed under ground is 9)* - Sat Dec  5 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: eh like probably 10 tiles would be enogh to claim you were like out of our range of knowing you were here - Sat Dec  5 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Fuck that nigga Rich, you see that Dragon fam? - Sat Dec  5 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) liquified the ground above her head and Yori's in the midst of the army being blocked off by Rashomon. Once Yori was tossed up into the fray of his army (Which followed his and Sixty-Nine's orders of course), she closed the earth again and swam under the ground towards Twelves position. Swimming right under the Rashomon gate, once she had reached twelve she opened the liquid ground under his body and he dropped down into her hands to be safe underground---hopefully.* - Sat Dec  5 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: no\ - Sat Dec  5 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) swam under the ground towards the troops once more to joint them. Instead of coming above ground though she stayed swimming below them to leave the area. She knew Thirteen was dead but honestly? She was going to kill him anyway, so it hadn't bothered her much, the only thing that bothered her is that she wasn't going to get to eat his body. 

As she swam from the area she had managed to put more room between her and the army as she left but keep close to them a few yards ahead. She wanted to be further out of combat with the injured Twelve but still close enough to aid if she was needed. 

(Second use of strategist, so double tile movement)* - Sat Dec  5 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) gathered the troops and all of the people who lived in the base to the cafeteria, thousands of people were present as Yuriko made an effort to tear off part of her body and then placed it ove the third degree burns on Twelve. Within a matter of minutes his wounds were -entirely- healed and he was perfectly find once again, it was a flippin' miracle.

She stepped up onto the little stage and spoke into the microphone. "I know some of you were loyal to Thirteen when he took control over me. Know this now, this has been my base since Yosuke passed it down to me... never again will someone own me as he did. If they try? They will die just as he did. It is the dawn of a new era, an era of the monsters... not the monsters who use and abuse those around them but the monsters who are -unique- to this world. The monsters who are special and stand out and make this world something special to live in. We aren't like Thirteen, he was a flaw... a number that needed erased. If any of you dare to try my patience with his regulations or his desires... if you try to overthrow me because he was the leader and I let him die, then I will devour you." Her menacing aura filled the room as she looked over the thousands before her and knew good and well she could kill all of them with ease... it would just take time. 

The spores that were protecting Yori and Twelve had returned to a single cell by now, completely untraceable or noticable by them or anyone else.* - Sat Dec  5 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ...He wants to be experimented on? - Sat Dec  5 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) glanced down before her speech as he questioned her about treatment but she said nothing on it for the moment and then finished her speech. She dismissed the general populace and then had people bring food to the troops who had gone out, of all kinds and flavors. She herself sat there without anything in front of her and stared across the room at the many faces she now controlled the lives of once again. "You are welcome, I couldn't let you die... you came back to the base after being gone for so long...and you are my friend, monster or not." She thought again about what he said, "why is it you want to be experimented on?"* - Sat Dec  5 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked the boy up and down as he spoke those words and thought on it. When he mentioned Hokori she closed her eyes and sighed out with a bit of pain and turned her head way from Yori's position. "You couldn't have done anything, that was my fault... I should have had safety percautions in measure before then... I shouldn't have hesitated later when he ... did things to me... and then broke my mind because I hesitated." She paused for a long moment and then began to smiel brightly and looked over towards Yori. It seemed everything she was just talking about was forgotten or ignored. "He was a disease."* - Sat Dec  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) 's smile faded some, "not like mine...but we can look into it.~"* - Sat Dec  5 04:27:31 2015

If she was examined closely it was noticed she was perfect in every way, except she only had hair on her head, none on her arms or even peach hair on her face. She ordered a sake and poured it slowly while waiting for the cup to cool. She didn't bother to look at the other two in the shop.* - Sat Dec  5 07:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sat her sake down and then stood up and swayed her hips back and forth as she walked over with heels clicking and spun around in the stool between Nigen and Saika. She came to rest gracefully with her elbow on the counter and fingers propping her jaw up to stare deep into Saika's eyes if she dared to look to the side. If the girl continued to try and get up, a very soft hand was placed on her middle of back to force her back down onto the chair, but more so guiding not -forceful-. If Saika resisted then she would easily get up.

"Do you want to be my friend? I'm Yuriko-chan.~"* - Sat Dec  5 07:38:40 2015
