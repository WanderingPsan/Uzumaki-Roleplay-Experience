As soon as she had reached his position she had aimed to slam into his body to knock him to the ground from her sheer momentum (Since she weighs hardly anything) and then her mouth opened wider than humanly possible and aimed to bite down over his entire shoulder cuff and a bit of his upper arm and muscles leading up to his neck. The burning sensation would immediately begin at a rather slow pace as she locked onto his body. (6 tile speed)* - Wed Dec  9 05:29:48 2015

Of course because she was thrown over his shoulder with her billowy dress, her panties were easily visible to Sogeki, Akito, and Eiyu. They were lacy booty shorts in hot pink.~* - Wed Dec  9 05:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If thats what you want. - Wed Dec  9 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: The situation at hand is complicated and I understand the views of you both. Whether or not the deal was made with you, a deal was made at Takuma's expense. The fixing of his arm for the prisoners we have. Now, of course the logic that -you- didn't make the deal with her can be applied, but I feel as though if we grant her the prisoners that are already deemed 'dead', there is no problem. - Wed Dec  9 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And quite honestly we, as Kumogakure, have a lot of those prisoners. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not saying we give her people that are waiting for trial, but the ones that have been trialed and got all the chances they can possibly get.. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Takuma's arm.. is a fair deal. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The way I see it is. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: She had no business for injuring him anyway. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Thus healing him was expected. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's along the lines of. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Me punching someone in the jaw, and then trying to fix it and demand money. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: But if a treaty was made between Takuma and Yuriko on that matter, resolving it before the deal was made.. then the whole situation is nulled. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It's using locked evidence in a case.. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was being a good girl and being quiet while Sogeki spoke for her.* - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'm.. stupid for doing this.. but.. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Do it.. at my expense, Raikage. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow her the death-ridden prisoners and I'll personally keep an eye on things. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can understand if this was to help you. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was having trouble holding her tongue.* - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It is.. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But why would you go out of your way to help her when she's cased nothing but trouble? - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Because I made a promise to her.. and to myself. She doesn't know the promise but I'm a Savage of Kumogakure.. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: My word is my bond. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You are my Chuunin. I leave this dispute in your hands. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Gratitude. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The second. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You try to kill my shinobi. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: *Sigh* - Wed Dec  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nevermind. - Wed Dec  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned heavily and didn't move, simply watching Eiyu.* - Wed Dec  9 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You have what you need. - Wed Dec  9 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) sounded extremely somber and sane in the next moments that she spoke. "You realize that your shinobi Takuma saved your village two years ago when I made that deal. I threatened to eat the chilren of your village and I was prepared to do so. You saw a glimpse of my power and you saw how your own summons didn't even dare touch me, so before you try and make threats towards me again? Just remember if I wanted to I could have this entire village on my dinner table. you look at me and doubt my power and my resources because I look like an idiotic crazy child, when really I can become your worst nightmare. I happen to like this village, don't ruin that, Eiyu Minatabi."* - Wed Dec  9 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I wait two years to collect on the deal and this happens. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I was so kind. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Kindness gets you no where. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly walked towards Eiyu and glared up at him, "try me." She had nothing else to say, she knew he couldn't do anything to her, by how he had acted in the past with how she completely breaks down his attacks it was obvious she was not scared of him at all... in fact? Fear didn't even reside in her mind, it had been left out of her experiments.* - Wed Dec  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) ignored Eiji in terms of response, she had no reason to speak to him.. thus far he has ignored her and so she ignored him. He was simply another shinobi and she was used to them trying to protect their kage. "Eiyu Minatabi, our deal is broken. Your village is no longer in my favor." She backed away to leave, his decision had been made by his silence. He didn't want to play her game? That's fine... she will bring all the games to him. She'll bring the fucking circus.* - Wed Dec  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: See ya. - Wed Dec  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) continued to walk away as Sogeki commented about beating a weapon. "Not only a weapon, but a weapon that isn't human...and can't die. Good lucky, your village will burn." She continued on her way out casually, she had come here hoping to enjoy some conversation with Sogeki and Eiyu and have a nice snack to initiate her deal but it seemed that after the war Eiyu grew some balls and lost some change in his head.* - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No-one cares, talk is cheap. - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This girl.. did not just say... - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Wait, wait, wait. - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: In the name of all that's Savage... - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: We just going.. to ignor- - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Not being human and can't die is a pretty fucking big deal..? - Wed Dec  9 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm the poison king, how the hell do I- - Wed Dec  9 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Like this isn't even- - Wed Dec  9 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ..wow - Wed Dec  9 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Like... - Wed Dec  9 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood a few feet from Eiyu and peered up at him waiting for her answer on if he was going to follow through on the deal or not.* - Wed Dec  9 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stuck her tongue out at him looking rather pleased, "That's all I ever asked for silly Tease-kun.~"* - Wed Dec  9 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) frowned as he tried to leave the area. She stepped in front of him again and peered up at him with big curious eyes, "just like that? You aren't going to spend any time with lil ol me? I'll even call you Eiyu-sama.~"* - Wed Dec  9 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) leaned in and wrapped her arm with his own and wiggled back and forth with her upper body in a slow sway. "What do you want to do? I do many human things for entertainment."* - Wed Dec  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) was peeled off of the man and then she widened her eyes and started to run after him. "Eiyu-sama! Wait for me!" She easily would catch up to him, she is faster than he is.* - Wed Dec  9 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: --- - Wed Dec  9 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: How did you-.. - Wed Dec  9 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why are you running? - Wed Dec  9 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) cocked her head far to the left curiously.* - Wed Dec  9 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mnnnn try me?~ - Wed Dec  9 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: For one. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You remind me of someone who died.... - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't know why, but you do... - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It makes me anxious. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Brings back bad memories. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... oh. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is it my looks? - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Who was she? - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't know what it is... - .. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'll tell you a secret.~ - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: She was a fr- ..Hm? - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) stood on her tip toes to whispere against his ear but she could barely reach and any breath he SHOULD have felt, wasn't present. 

"Maybe it was me? I have been many people in the past."* - Wed Dec  9 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) slowly backed away from him, she could hear the pain in his voice. Her happy go lucky attitude was entirely gone as she shook her head and backed away. Her face crumpled up and she really didn't enjoy what she had done just now.* - Wed Dec  9 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked away as he had said thank you, she was very confused and reached up to hold her head. "I just thought it would be funny... I didn't know..what... I didn't know...you...would..Nng.." She felt her eye twitch and she looked away as she tried to gain control over her darker emotions.* - Wed Dec  9 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) struggled inwardly with her mind and was trembling for a moment before he gripped her small wrist and easily pulled her in against him. He'd be able to feel just how soft her body was as he held her and how small... a mere five foot in this form, it really put into perspective how crazy it was how dangerous she could be. She shuddered against his much larger body and then wrapped her arms around him and nuzzled in against his chest as she started to give him her classic best hug in the world, though because he was so tall she was unable to nuzzle his neck like she did most people.* - Wed Dec  9 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) groaned lightly in response to him picking her up and then she lifted her head to look up to the man. "I didn't mean to upset you..." She wasn't sure what else to say, she wasn't used to saying sorry.. she had only said it once before and meant it. His thank you still wasn't understood and she was trying to figure out what he was doing and why.* - Wed Dec  9 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to him as he backed away, "I... I scared you off didn't --" she cut off as he kept walking, she wouldn't force him to stay if he really wanted to leave.* - Wed Dec  9 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: lol - Wed Dec  9 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: -omit- - Wed Dec  9 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) came in not paying attention and smacked into Rias, because of this she likely fell back onto the floor because of how small and light weight she was.* - Wed Dec  9 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) looked up to the Hokage and reached up for her hand to be helped up, it would be extremely easy to help her up because she felt like she was nearly as light as a feather, FREAKISHLY light. Her curious wide eyes stared up at Rias as her extremely soft hand was taken and she stood before the taller girl. "Woops,~" it could easily be noted that her hand was so soft it was likely the softest thing Rias has ever felt or ever will feel again.* - Wed Dec  9 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) nodded quickly a few times and then shook her head afterwards to the second question. "No no, not hurt... I was just... yeah I don't remember what I was doing."* - Wed Dec  9 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times, "I told you I'm a foreigner."* - Wed Dec  9 09:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I mean I guess I did live here for a while. - Wed Dec  9 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The kage was Zeus. - Wed Dec  9 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I don't think I've ever seen a woman this tall before. - Wed Dec  9 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Oh I see but you are a foreigner... so what land do you hail  from? - Wed Dec  9 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) thinks: Maybe I need all the villagers here to wear shoes that give them height... I will call them heels... - Wed Dec  9 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mnnnnn, like originally or now? - Wed Dec  9 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) thinks: Oh my god this girl creeps the fuck out of me.... - Wed Dec  9 09:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not -in- Kirigakure though. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Well no that's not right. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) tapped her chin in thought.* - Wed Dec  9 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Where is Gezo? - Wed Dec  9 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's near there. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know the name of the land. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No one here talks about it. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: ... G-Gezo? - Wed Dec  9 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Your from the Gezo? - Wed Dec  9 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Nooooooooooooooo silly.~ - Wed Dec  9 09:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Oh.... I see - Wed Dec  9 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) leaned in to whisper in the woman's ear but she had no breath to brush against the girl's ear. "Don't worry I don't like them either.~" Then she pulled away again.* - Wed Dec  9 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well your welcome here, but I would prefer you not leave... We are on high alert from  Kumo... they might get bold - Wed Dec  9 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No one is going to harm me, silly kage-chan.~ - Wed Dec  9 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: I hope not... as long as your in my village I want to protect you... - Wed Dec  9 09:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) blinked a few times and then said a random number. "U-uhm... I'm.... sixty five?"* - Wed Dec  9 09:41:32 2015
