He raises his arm, allowing the snakes to lift Jirun off the ground. At that point, with relative ease, Ortho side steps to rush of mud and slams Jirun neck first against the ground.

Just as Ortho landed on the ground, since he deactivated the lightweight jutsu, he'd slam his palms on to the ground. As a result, a quick earth dome would erect from the ground and attempt to imprison Heiwa.* - Mon Nov 16 05:13:10 2015

"Fuck," he thought. "This kid's genjutsu is superb.. I can't.. break out of it by normal means.. What the fuck am I going to do.."

Ortho's body went limp, causing him to trip over. His head is turned to the side and his eyes fixate on Heiwa.

Just then, as he tapped into his hidden network, his body began to transition. His skin became scale-like and his chakra bank completely reboots to accommodate his transformation. Still, however, the most he did was sat up while acting as though he was still bound. In turn, his transformation breaks the Genjutsu.

I was thinking about what you said," he starts. His voice was leveled and his expression was bland, as casual as possible. "The talk didn't really ruin the good mood, but it was an eye opener. Maybe you and I can, while hiding it in public, could get past that.. friendship.. standard."* - Mon Nov 16 07:48:28 2015

"Clothes are banned in here."* - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. "Come here."* - Mon Nov 16 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hands immediately went to her hips, gripping the tail of her top. He starts tugging in opposite, unsnapping the buttons. He looks up at Eri, giving her a plain stare; no expression on his face. "You seem to learn the best when naked and cold," he states in a casual tone, as if he wasn't undressing his prodigal student. "Good for the both of us. No?" By this point, Ortho would have unclasped all the buttons and pull the shirt off of her. He moves back down to her hips, grabbing the waistband of her skirt and tugging it down.. slowly.* - Mon Nov 16 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Nngn... - Mon Nov 16 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stares intently in Eri's eyes, keeping his bland expression up. He starts to maneuver her under her skirt rather than trying to pull it off by the waistband. His hands glide to her lower back then trailed down before taking a nice squeeze of her rump. "If anything I'll make you learn the hardest techniques in the cold then give you some leniency with the lesser jutsus." His voice was still casual, real straight forward and to the point. "What do you think?"* - Mon Nov 16 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to gently squeeze and fondle her cheeks, separating them every now and them before pushing them back together. He gave her right cheek a few taps, not hard enough to exactly hurt her but leave his hand print there. Throughout the entire thing he kept a straight face, casual, look. "Have you ever thought about getting into Genjutsu a bit? Just enough to break out of it and execute some?"* - Mon Nov 16 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glides his hands down more until he was at the back of her thighs. By doing this, her skirt was pulled down due to his forearms, stripping her of the clothing half way. He glances down in between them and takes a quick look at her crotch, making it seem like it was completely professional to do so. Once he looked back up at her she could see that his expression didn't falter. "How does Fuuinjutsu sound? Hell, even Medical Ninjutsu?" He lifts one of Eri's knees off of the couch a bit --- seeing as though she was straddling him and her knees were on the sides of his lap. He pulls one leg out of the skirt by raising it and pushing on the clothing, repeating the same thing for the other leg. Now, she was in whatever undergarments she had on.* - Mon Nov 16 08:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reached up to her shoulders and grips her bra straps with two fingers on both hands. "There are a few jutsus in the medical arts that can be used for offense. Of course it'd be more a Taijutsu enhancer, but it's good for on the spot surgeries or last resort type thing." He glances at Eri's breasts, mentally and lustfully enjoying what he saw. Still, however, he keeps a straight face and leveled tone as he spoke. He inches the straps down her shoulders, unclasping whatever hooks and knots he needed to for it to be slipped off her body. "Does that spike your interest a bit?"* - Mon Nov 16 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "And what about the Fuuinjutsu? It ties into summoning for the snakes, but you could seal a good amount of things into scrolls if you go about it logically."

With Eri's bra now off he'd bring his hands to her chest, gliding his palms down a bit and cupping her breasts. He squeezes slightly, using his thumb to graze over her nipples. "If anything, just the basics of Fuuinjutsu are all you need. Get a few scrolls, keep them on you at all times, and use them when you need to improvise. What do you think?"

Ortho changes the grip his has on her breasts, going from cupping her entire breasts to using his thumb and index finger to lightly pinch her nipples. All the while he keeps his gaze on her, making sure his expression and tone of voice remained the same.* - Mon Nov 16 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: God why does he have to -touch- me while talking like this. - Mon Nov 16 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) heard Eri's complaint of his way of teachings. He even took things into consideration and came to a decision. He simply blinked once and returned his straight gaze to Eri's eyes. He caresses her breasts with one hand while running the other down her body. "Maybe if I showed you some clear seals and what they can do in the heat of battle it'll help you sway your mind to a side. No?" He intentionally verbally disregards Eri's words, all the while maniacally planning to send her overboard. With one of his hands trailing down her body, Ortho would eventually make it to her fabric cover mound. He cups it with his entire hand while using two fingers to lightly press into her hole --- going as far as her panties will allow. "If anything I'll just make one scroll for you to carry around that has a bunch of stuff inside. Different seals on the scroll that tells which discharges what."* - Mon Nov 16 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded as well. He continues to stroke her, flicking his finger while they exit and enter her hole. "Good, good. So recap with me; Genjutsu is up for grabs, Medical Ninjutsu is a no and Fuuinjutsu is a 'if'. Right?"

Ortho uses one of his fingers to pull away her panties a bit, exposing one of her lips to the cool air a bit. "If you have any ideas, let me know. I'm open minded." At this point Ortho would pull his two fingers out of her hole, graze over the exposed lip and enter her completely, setting the panties off to the side.
* - Mon Nov 16 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It wasn't a hidden fact that Ortho was turned on by this all. His cock was fully erect and begging to be released from the cage of a pants that he wore. Ortho continues to play with Eri's outer lips, using his other hand to slyly pull down his zipper. "It's fine. Maybe a bit of activity can get your blood going. When last have you done physical work?" Normally Ortho would smirk at that question, but he made sure to keep a straight face and flat tone. He fiddles with his boxers a bit until he was able to expose most of his length. He pats down the puff around his shaft and allowed his entire member to reenter the outside world once again.* - Mon Nov 16 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: if she wants to - Mon Nov 16 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised Eri up a bit, pulling her closer in the process. He inches her down a little lining himself just so the tip of his cock separated her lips a bit. "I liked that idea of you being a scout.. Maybe I'll try to help you learn how to sense.. I started the training for it.. but haven't finished. Forgive me." He looks up at Eri, keeping everything regular. The real fucked up thing he did was intentionally tense his cock, making more blood rush to his member and causing his head to enlarge slightly; all to tease her and make her feel every pulse. "You're not mad at that, are you?" He didn't know whether or not Eri would succumb to the feeling and push herself down so he can enter her completely so he held a firm grip on her hips to prepare to keep her at her current spot.* - Mon Nov 16 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) finally decided that Eri had enough. He turns his head slightly, bringing his lips to her ears and whispers, "I love you." His tone was the same and his expression was unfazed. Everything was just one big professional meeting by the way he was talking and looking. Just as he said he loved her he'd inch her down more and more, entering her extremely wet pussy. By time he stopped he was only half in and he was intentionally pulsing his cock back and forth in her, making sure to keep her at that point --- just in case she tried to go down further.* - Mon Nov 16 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had a firm grip on her and sensed that she was ready to pull up. He'd allow her to do that, but first gave her a physical ultimatum. He'd pull her down more on to his cock, basing out then let go. Whether or not she decided to come off would be at her own will action wise.* - Mon Nov 16 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) grips her hips again. The hits on his chest weren't light, but they weren't heavy. They were, at most, able to cause a bruise or two; nothing he can't handle. With the grip of her hips he'd begin moving her up and down on his cock, easily sliding in and out of her. "I'm not asking you to say it back. I rather you know now than continue this just sex and friendship thing. You said that it's best to say things from the get go the other night, right? It'll only make us come to a decision and whether or not the other person comes to terms with what is said."

Throughout that entire speech he continues to have her ride him. He felt that her lust wanted it and he knew his lust wanted it.. now it was time for their minds to come to a midpoint.* - Mon Nov 16 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took the hits, accepting them with no rebuttal. She sobbed and sobbed, only making it a bit harder on Ortho to continue his invasion of her pussy. Still, however he kept it up --- he even went as far as picking the pace up just a bit. Not enough to turn this into only a fuck session, but to allow all emotions and lust to pour out. There was silence from Ortho through her hysterical crying, but her allowed her to ride things out; both sexually and emotionally.

To make matters worse, Ortho's emotions were overflowing at this point. Yes, he used her wonderful pussy to distract him to all ends, but his emotions and pushed back thoughts got the best of him. Telling her that he loved her was more than just something he held back because of the Sex and Friendship thing, it was something that he had to assure himself of. He knew that he already lost someone else he loved to the person he trusted the most, so having someone else that gave him that feeling all over again and allowed him to feel that the 'love' was more than just phase of his mental progression. It was more than just him allowing good pussy, cute face and soft breasts cloud his mind.. It was something he honestly thought about, believed and felt like he had to admit.

Yes his timing could've been better in the aspect of them having amazing sex, but it's that amazing sex that started this relationship between them. It was amazing sex that was rooted and had a stem of memories and emotions pushed back even further. It was as if every thrust he made pushed her memories and emotions back while every back stroke she made on the cock pushed back his memories and emotions; this amazing sex was the root and surprisingly Ortho wanted that amazing sex to bear ripe fruit in the near future.

He continues to raise and lift Eri on his cock. He was sexually intact and involved, but just like Eri his emotions led to tears beginning to seep from his eyes and trail down his face. All the while he kept up the illusion that he was so professional while fucking his, now, vulnerable student. Still, the tears showed his own release of emotions.* - Mon Nov 16 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Their bodies continue to slam into each other. It was apparent that their sexual natures were overcoming their emotions, even if it was for the sake of relieving themselves of their frustration. They were at the point where finishing up was a must, not matter what.

A low groan comes from Ortho. Despite the constant tears flowing down his cheeks and his own chest heaving just a bit in alliance with his release of emotions, he couldn't help but let her know what he was feeling around his cock was heavenly. Her juices and tightness was the perfect mix, and in a completely chaotic manner their emotions seemed to magnify the sensation. If anything, since Ortho was truly a psycho in some areas, him saying what he said made this sex 'feel' better externally.

He groans again, noticing Eri take the initiative of swaying her hips to accommodate his cock. He wasn't going to leave her to do all the work so he'd lean back more into the couch so they laid more into an angle, giving both of them leverage to move their hips in rhythm and slam into one another. Eri's stimulation of kisses and nibbling caused Ortho to groan yet again, something that she was bringing out of him the more and more they fucked.

By time the third groan came Ortho and Eri were staring holes into one another. Their eye contact was intense as usual, but this time around it was overly intense. Emotions were involved this time around and even if it was hatred and love mixed together with the spice of lust, it was just right for this moment and this moment only. He stared at her with the want to just let her know what was what and just to let her know that if push came to shove she truly wasn't the one transitioning. He noticed how his world was shifting in counter of what it was rotating before they met. He noticed how everything he said and do ended up with her  on his mind as if life was nothing but one big Cause and Effect paradox. Things were changing no doubt, and as long as Eri was involved in some way Ortho was able to accept the outcome.* - Mon Nov 16 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't know why it surprised them when their lips met. It felt different, it tasted different and it just sent shivers up his spine. None of this was a bad thing, but it didn't feel the same. His eyes widen and his heart jumped, this kiss was blowing him away and he didn't know why. He didn't know why this kiss was just something he felt like he could take. He was able to face the deadliest of enemies head on with no hesitation, but this kiss was forcing him to succumb to its effects; and even that he was sure about.

This kiss was more than a kiss right now. In his mind, this kiss was a connection that he was only one to possibly feel. The kiss given was passionate and the kiss returned was just as emotionally involved. Ortho and Eri locking lips the way they are now was destroying Ortho on the inside and just the reasoning that he so direly begged for couldn't be found. The kiss was something that could possibly destroy Ortho if Eri so well pleased.

His eyes slowly lower until it was finally shut, but not even that could hold back the downpour of tears that came from him.* - Mon Nov 16 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||
Was there even a point in denial now? Like.. was there even a point to deny anything about this situation? Emotions were involved, lust was the instigator and confusion of both their mental standing point was the fuel to their caravan of potential love.

The release of this orgasm is going to be their ending. They've pushed each other off this cliff with held hands and attached groins with no thought of backfires. They've done everything they lustfully can to send each other over this cliff and didn't bother to think about what would happen once they were on the ground. Were they going to be mush and splattered bodies, or would what they're feeling emotionally be their parachute? What was to come of this all and what would happen if everything worked out during their orgasm?

Their bodies slam against each other with no remorse. Still, however, Ortho took hold of her hips and leaned forward just a bit. Their lips locked numerous of times, just to depart and regain their visual battle. With Eri's hips gripped he'd add to her efforts and make every thrust count. His jaw creeks open just a bit and an actual moan, for the first time ever, was released. His cock stood to maximum attention with blood endlessly rushing through his length. The head of his member nearly doubles in size as the main vein within bulges even more.

"Together," he whispers in response to Eri as he leans in more to make their lips meet. He clenched pussy aiding in his discharge. At this point all caution was thrown out the window and landed in the trash can. He releases another moan as his eyes, after meeting with Eri's one last time, shut and he releases everything he had for her.

At this moment, the release of his fluids was the release of everything he had held in thus far. At this moment, the release of his fluids was the representative that Sex and Friendship was just that they couldn't live by anymore; whether this be their last time or not.. this release, to Ortho, was worth flipping the script and telling Eri the truth..

He loves her.* - Mon Nov 16 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||
There was no going back now. There was panting, lingering groping and recollection of emotions --- the recipe to a fulfilling orgasm.

Ortho's hands move from Eri's hips down to her rump, going back to the basics of just lightly squeezing and enjoying her body. His cock was still twitching inside her and their juices were barely able to seep out of them. From the looks of things they've fallen off the cliff and landed safely --- or so they thought.

Ortho was well aware of what happened and quite frankly Eri wasn't the one to be blamed. Caution was thrown out the window and the pitcher was Ortho; he could easily be identified as the culprit. Eri was going through too much emotions to even begin to understand what he allowed him to do, so it was just a matter of what fate had in stored. Responsibilities are responsibilities. A little Ortho or Eri running around wouldn't be bad, but the timing of them running around could be.

A sigh is released from him as he continued to caress Eri's butt, repeatedly squeezing and groping absent mindedly. His gaze is set on the ceiling and his mind began to wonder. He didn't know if Eri realized yet and he was just mentally prepared to hear the words that he suspected was coming. "Fuck you Ortho. You tricked me into this. You said just Sex and Friendship. Now you release in me and force me to be with you because you may have gotten me pregnant." Even worse.. "I'm living with the child. I want nothing to do with you and I want my child to have nothing to do with you."

Great.. just great.

Ortho remains silent in wait. * - Mon Nov 16 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head, "yeah.. sure."

He glanced down for just a bit, narrowing his eyes on the fluids that seeped out of Eri. He didn't say anything or even make a facial expression toward it. Externally he remained completely oblivious to what just happened, but internally he was anticipating everything. Eri's stumbling didn't fall on blind eyes, nor did her reassurance fall on deaf ears. Still, however, he stood to his feet, with more ease than Eri was able to, and trailed after her. He knew their destination was the bathroom and he knew that the bathroom was far away, but each step her took closer seemed to be in reverse. His mind was so far gone that anything he physically did felt like it was in slow motion.

In reality, even with Eri's odd walking, they made it to the bathroom in no time --- this place really wasn't that big. Ortho gently took Eri's hand and decided to guide her into the tub before turning on the water. Luckily, as he did so, the bottom faucet for the shower was where the water source came from so when he did adjust the pressures and heat she wasn't splashed by a surprising downpour of coldness. Ortho allows her to stand there as he fixed the water up to be warm enough for her. Once things were right he'd pull on the top showerhead's trigger and make that the source of water. Afterwards, hesitantly, he'd wait for her to step under the water pressure before joining her in the tub. * - Mon Nov 16 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in on what she was doing. She was completely under the water so whatever tears that poured down her face would've gone completely unnoticed. Still, however, he took notice of how hard she was scrubbing. Her skin was turning red and just the way she scrubbed made Ortho look away.

To him, whether it was true or not, her scrubbing could've signified something. Worst case scenario: what just leaked out of her moments ago. She wanted that feeling out and off of her so the scrubb-

Yes, this is farfetched, but how else could he explain the scrubbing? He kept his gaze elsewhere, only looking up when it was his turn with the bar of soap. He bites down on his lower lip, saying nothing to Eri in the process. If anything, the look in his eyes was becoming voider than before.* - Mon Nov 16 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's shower was a bit more relaxed.

He accepts the rag and soap from Eri, only nodding in gratitude in place of verbal communication. He soaps the rag up before placing the bar back in the little dish attached to the wall. He runs the rag over his body, starting with his neck and going down. He scrubbed, yes, but it was nowhere near as vigorous as Eri's scrubbing. There were some parts of his body where he did scrub with much more efforts, but even then his skin barely turned red. Nevertheless, by time Eri was done drying off, after washing her hair and all that good stuff, Ortho was just standing in the down pour of water.

His gaze was on the showerhead, but his mind wasn't currently with his body. His hair fell back away from his head and hanged down to his shoulders and his body just remained still for a few moments. He gathered as much of his thoughts as he could before slowly shaking his head and turning off the shower. He squeezes as much water out of his rag as he could before hanging it in the necessary place. At this point, instead of completely coming out the shower, he'd simply reach out to where the towel rack was and grab what was there. He does a quick rough draft of a drying off, not caring for damping the floor at this point.

It wasn't until Ortho finally stepped out of the tub when he noticed Eri, after finding what she was looking for, using eye drops. One thing he enjoyed about Eri was that she knew how to put things back where she found them --- he didn't have to explain his slight OCD to her. When she was done he'd walk out the bathroom, still naked, and head to the bed room. There, he'd go to his one closet and open the doors. He grabs a black pair of boxers from the inside drawers and puts them on. He only grabs one roll of bandages just to wrap around his tattooed arm and left everything else there. His weaponry, arm guards and usual battle attire was left behind.

Ortho finishes getting dress. He wore a black version of Eri's sweatpants, boy version as well, that sagged just slightly below his boxers' waist band. He puts on a black tank-top and a black pair of closed toe shoes. By time he was done getting dressed he'd walk over to where Eri was he just looked at her, using that look to ask if she was ready.* - Mon Nov 16 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took Eri's hand into his grasp, accepting her offer with no hesitation. Still, the quietness reigned over them. Just before they left the house their hands broke away and returned back to their own persons. It didn't bother Ortho at all; if anything it gave him a sense of semi-closure. Even then, however, he was still a bit wary.

Their stroll to the first food joint was quiet. The walk was a bit fulfilling for Ortho --- he usually took walks when he had a lot on his mind. Of course weed and sake would be involved, but this'll do fine. By time they actually reached to the shop he'd allow Eri to take whatever seat she'd like, knowing by now from their little dates here and there that she was picky about that.

By time a waiter showed up and Eri did her act, Ortho follows up with his. "Just get me the usual. Eggs, bacon, pancakes and the finest sake we have." Ortho's voice was a bit more demanding than usual, along with more soft. It was apparent that he had things on his mind, but it could've easily been mistaken as a teacher thinking about his students' progression. Hell, if anything, it could've been the village leader thinking about the villages' progression.

Ortho coughs a bit, clearing his throat once the waiter left. He glances at Eri for a bit, lowering his eye lids a bit. "Coffee doesn't get you hyper?"* - Mon Nov 16 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans back in his seat. His sets his gaze on the table between them and sighs. He didn't even know how to reply to her statement so he just panders on it for a bit. A good minute pass before he glances at her again for just a second before looking back down.

"It's something that shouldn't be considered lightly.. from the person that's saying it.."
* - Mon Nov 16 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked up, a bit in shock. Again, he didn't know what to say. Both their emotions were running wild and for him to just reply to that on the spot was a bit hard.

"I.. I guess it's hard to hear it from me then.."* - Mon Nov 16 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: It's just.... - Mon Nov 16 14:18:27 2015
