<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thanatos(DhatBoiNick) didn't know if he was alive anymore. His chest was heaving and no matter what he did, his lungs couldn't take grasp of enough air. His pursuit after Suitengu, the boy that wore the Hokage's attire, was no less than strenuous. Cuts and bruises riddled Thanatos' body, as the three man haul-ass group came to an abrupt halt. "W-Wait.. Let me c-catch my breath"* - Sun Oct  4 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thanatos(DhatBoiNick) was thirsty, almost naked and banged up; no matter what anyone says, tears deserved to be shed. Those tears, however, weren't coming from Thanatos. Yes, he felt like crying from the overwhelming sensation he had, but he wasn't going. He was amongst other males and quite frankly, the way he was raised, a show of tears is a show of weakness. Still though, what the hell was going on? One minute he's chilling in the Hokage's mansion sipping on some Apple Juice, next minute he's miles away while the entire village is potentially half destroyed. There better be some jutsu scrolls as a reward for not dying from all this.* - Sun Oct  4 00:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thanatos(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes fixed themselves on Takeda.* - Sun Oct  4 01:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I-I don't really...do that kind of thing... - Sun Oct  4 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thanatos(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes wandered off, fixating themselves on Reisen's frame. He didn't know whether or not she too originated from Konohagakure, but a quick scan of her visual presence should clarify that; if she was wearing an official Konohagakure headband. He remained quiet for the most part, not wanting to start a conversation with a stranger and possibly disclose information he shouldn't.* - Sun Oct  4 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't lie, felt like a little bitch. Reisen, the female, took it upon herself to provide the first verbal acknowledgment between the two of them; was that not the males' job? A sigh of disappointment came from Ortho as he placed his focus within Reisen's eyes. "Names Ortho and you?"* - Sun Oct  4 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a nod; there being nothing else he could do. Ortho's examination of Reisen continued, and nothing about this process was modest. If anything, Reisen could possibly feel his eyes grope her body from head to toe as he soaked in what he saw. He was surely an observant person, and it may be that trait that possibly saves his life someday. The sight of a Konohagakure headband put Ortho at ease, his mind switching from a "let's not communicate with the outsider" mentality to an "alright, she's safe" mindset. "I see you made it out of Konohagakure safely. You and a few others are the only ones I've seen thus far. It's a pity how something so sudden and tragic could happen."* - Sun Oct  4 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Sun Oct  4 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't exactly the type to smile, or show any form of emotion, but after these recent events he felt like a slight crack of his lips wouldn't hurt. It was visible that he attempted to place a smile on his visage, but it just couldn't fully develop. Nevertheless, the tone of Ortho's voice altered substantially. It went from a dark, deep, tone to a mellower, nonchalant, tone. "Right, right; maybe it's comedy that could be named the remedy of our uneasy minds. * - Sun Oct  4 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had already noticed that Suitengu wasn't present currently, but he wasn't worried. From what was discussed earlier in the day, after fleeing the Tragedy of Konohagakure, Ortho was confident that Suitengu didn't go off and get himself into trouble. Still, however, his absence was rather random and unexpected; two elements that should never mix after events that recently took place. For the most part, Ortho remains calm and nonchalant, not allowing the worried state of Reisen to alter his own mood. "I'm sure he's off gathering his mind to catch up to the recent happenings. He'll be back shortly."* - Sun Oct  4 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Some think the best when they're alone and have no distractions. - Sun Oct  4 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Give the boy a few to regroup and settle himself. - Sun Oct  4 04:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a few steps back, allowing Reisen and the boy to have their moment. There was no need for Ortho to interrupt that.* - Sun Oct  4 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So...I didn't catch your name... - Sun Oct  4 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) has been minding his business since their arrival in Amegakure. There was no reason to mingle with anyone, communication was on a minimum. It's for that one reason why Takeda's approach slightly annoyed Ortho; it was obvious that the male wanted to be left alone, but Takeda decided to make small talk. Still, however, Ortho understood that people handled tough situations differently, so some leniency was given.

"Name's Ortho and you?" His voice was calm and collected, each syllable tied into one another whilst being dragged on slightly.* - Sun Oct  4 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || That was truly a good question. How was Ortho doing? After the episode of destruction with Konohagakure, the home of Ortho, what could be described as the young lad's mental state? Hell, what could be described as his emotional state? From the looks of things, the male was perfectly fine. Compared to the exhausted state he was in after barely escaping Konohagakure, Ortho couldn't be better. There really wasn't a set of words that could be mashed together to effectively describe Ortho right now.

"I've been neither bad nor good. And yourself?"* - Sun Oct  4 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. He didn't know whether or not Takeda was about to go into some emotional depression, but Ortho was the least likely person you'd want to look to for comfort. You had better luck at venting your heart out to a rock and get sympathy rather than Ortho. It wasn't that the guy had no feelings, but a show of affection was a show of weakness. If anything, Ortho chose to bury his feelings, that way when it comes down to it no one can effectively use his emotions against him in battle. It was a dog-eat-dog world and Ortho refused to be the lesser of the dogs.

"Standing around here is going to get us nowhere. I requested a spar when we first arrived, but apparently you don't do those. I'll have to progress by my lonesome until Suitengu shows up once again." Ortho's voice showed that he was metaphorically finger pointing. The fact that advancing themselves was more of a necessity than ever and Takeda was either too shy or too scared annoyed Ortho greatly. He wasn't about to force the guy into a fight so Ortho simply kept himself to himself.* - Sun Oct  4 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't feel as though there was a reason to be skeptical of Suitengu's wellbeing. Surely if Suitengu was in danger he'd evacuate just as fast as he did when Konoha was in the midst of destruction. If anything, Suitengu would be even fast since he didn't have two bodies holding him back. A simply shrug was provided to the worrying demeanor of Takeda, nothing else for Ortho to do.

"I'm sure he's fine."* - Sun Oct  4 16:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't have time to waste. Haste was the key element within this shinobi world, and despite his lack of physical speed Ortho was the sponsor of it. With Hideki closing in, Ortho strings a strings a succession of handseals together. His chakra, from within his stomach, kneaded itself and slightly thickened to take a water based form. Afterwards, with Hideki closing in rapidly, Ortho would pucker his lips and allowed a small passage in the middle of his mouth to release a powerful torrent of water.

Normally, a shinobi would be done after performing such a jutsu. However, Ortho wasn't. With the torrent of water raging toward Hideki, Ortho would follow up with another stitching of handseals. Within his body his chakra began to knead and violently vibrate, causing an electrical surge. Once the handseals were completed, Ortho would extend his arms and allowed his palms to release a powerful rush of lightning to merge with the water.* - Sun Oct  4 20:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) figured that standing by idly wasn't getting him anywhere. He was recently exposed to the true hardship of being a ninja within this shinobi world, and quite frankly he refused to be a bitch. Ortho takes a single step forward, allowing a string of handseals to stitch together at an impressive pace. Whilst doing so, a large amount of chakra within his stomach would knead and mold itself into liquid.

Ortho pivots forward, dashing as fast as he could away from any immediate human contact. Upon doing so, after creating enough distance between him and any others, Ortho puckers his lips and readies himself. Just as his last step was made, he'd use the opposing foot to stomp hard on to the ground and launch his entire frame into the air. Afterwards, while using the kneaded chakra from within his stomach that turned to water, Ortho would unleash a wide spread torrent of what.

In succession to the torrent of water, the mere Genin would continue on with a follow-up jutsu. The necessary handseals was strung and the proper amount of chakra was kneaded. Instead, however, of his chakra thickening slightly to form a liquid, it vibrated vigorously to create an electrical surge. By time his handseals were completed, and his descent back to the ground began while the torrent of water continued to rush from his mouth, Ortho would extend his arms and allowed a flow of electricity to merge with the conductive element.

Once Ortho managed to firmly plant his feet back on the ground he looked off at the damage he did. It was a medium sized pool of water that was riddled with electrical pulses, all created within mere seconds. Still, however, this didn't suffice the needs of Ortho; in his mind, a small pool was nothing more than a cup. A grunt of disapproval came from the young lad as he began to prepare for his next regimen.* - Sun Oct  4 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) says: Maybe I'll get you some Mochi instead. . .Suitengu, I'll be back to change myself around in fasion from Amegakure really quick. . .Alright? - Sun Oct  4 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Use whatever you'd like. As long as you don't thrash the entire place. - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: By that I mean the entire village. - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: ....Right. - Sun Oct  4 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a stand once more, allowing his mind and chakra flow to center themselves. A slow intake of air aided in his efforts of concentration as he began to slowly weaved together handseals. Within his stomach, a steady stream of water began to fill; said stream being spawned from a set chakra bank. By time his handseals were successfully woven, Ortho would pucker his lips once more and prepared himself.

Rather than jumping into the air, Ortho snapped his ankles shut whilst using the ball of his heels to pivot himself backwards. This time around, with caution, Ortho would arrive back in the midst of the group. A torrent of water would rush out of his mouth, shooting of in any direction his head was poised two. With that fact in mind, Ortho would make an effort to slowly lift his chin and slowly lower it back, giving the torrent a rainbow-like effect as it down poured a few yards away.

With haste, and with the torrent of water continuing to surge from his mouth as he slowly lifted and lowered his chin, Ortho would string a different succession of handseals together. This time around, in contrast to the water that filled his stomach, his chakra instead vigorously pulsed and sparked an electrical surge from within. That surge was immediately conducted throughout Ortho's arms just as the handseals were finished. An outstretch of his two limbs were given and the electricity roared from his palms; the end result being the merging of the two elements and the enhancement of the conductibility of the lightning.* - Sun Oct  4 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained stationary; Suitengu's skeptical look no surprising him in the least bit. This was the shinobi world and they were both ninja's trying to strive and always see a tomorrow, maybe that's why the word loyalty echoed through everyone's mind. Ortho was never the submissive type. No matter what life laid out before him, he either stepped over it or stomped his way through. In this case, as a show of pride and loyalty to the cause known as Suitengu, the lad that took it upon his self to save another that was half-naked, Ortho bites down on his tongue to prevent and rebuttal and simply kneeled. "Forgive me if I said something wrong.."* - Mon Oct  5 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) lowered his head, continuing to bite down on his tongue. Within his mind, once the excess arms were retracted and Suitengu reached into the pouch on his side, Ortho truly believed that his life was over. He honestly believed that asking for any form of knowledge with such a low price tempted his fate and Suitengu had pronounced himself to be the Grim Reaper. A slow intake of air was sounded as he waited to be struck, but instead an offer was displayed and words of gratitude were heard. With a lift of his head and an examination of the scroll before him, Ortho stood to his feet and supplied Suitengu with a nod in response to the final statement. "Understood." With that being the only reply, Ortho would take grasp of the scroll place it within his own pouch.* - Mon Oct  5 00:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arm went slack. Once again his own little sister treated him like he was a brother; all he wanted to do was assure her wellbeing and self-progress. A steady sigh came from Ortho as he panned his eyes over toward Sabo. "Do you really think we'd tell a complete stranger whether or not we know someone..?"* - Mon Oct  5 01:00:35 2015

A quick survey over the males being didn't hurt anyone, and from the looks of things Suitengu was willing to provide information to Sabo. A slight smirk formed on Ortho's face as he folded his arms across his chest. He remains quiet; there was no reason to speak.* - Mon Oct  5 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't really have any comment on Marrisa's weeping. What could he even say or do to comfort her at this point? The only show of either he's ever done was for his little sister, and even then he didn't do a good job. Another audible sigh sounded off from Ortho as he slowly shook his head and tried to rid the sight from his memory.

The young Genin would dig into his universal back pouch and take grasp of a single scroll, unraveling it upon pulling it out. His eyes began pondering over the content, briefly skimming what was written on the inside. For the most part, Ortho figured that it was some form of self-duplication technique, an exertion of chakra that molds into a replica of the user. It's also a single handseal jutsu. For the most part, by just skimming, Ortho figured that the jutsu was relatively easy.
 
After placing the scroll on the ground in front of him and sitting down with his legs folded, Ortho started the process of intently reading the content inside. "Alright so the first thing is to get a constant flow of chakra going; might as well use the same handseal to activate the jutsu to concentrate." As he said that, the proper handseal was formed. His posture tightens, causing him to sit upright. A slow, audible, intake of air signaled to mental concentration he was undergoing.

It didn't take long for Ortho to get a comfortable flow of chakra going. Hell, for the most part, it was relatively easy. The only problem Ortho had been to keep that exactly flow going for the entirety of his meditation. Still, however, taking grasp of the method was easy going.

After feeling his way through the meditation, Ortho would slowly open his eyes and allowed his mind to steadily accept the new imagery his visuals provided. The last thing Ortho wanted to do was break his concentration. With mental caution, Ortho would lean forward slightly and continued to read through the steps the scroll provided. Now that his chakra flow was under his complete control, the next thing the scroll advised was to distribute it outward in steady chunks.

By the way this scroll described this process; it seemed as easy as breathing in an open field. When Ortho went to make an attempt at such, he found that that wasn't the case and he should punch whoever made this scroll in the face; the distribution of his chakra, whilst keeping up the steady chakra flow, made things all that more difficult. Not only did he have to expand the chakra flow while providing a steady output, but he had to make sure the output followed the same course as his main branch of flow; that was what gave the shadow clone its own chakra network.

The process was no less than strenuous. From having to restart his concentration after accidently breaking it to figuring out the pace he had to follow just to make the distribution successful. Now, he wasn't a prodigy, so the overall difficulty was that of an average shinobi trying to make ends meet. Luckily, however, Ortho had a rather studious mind within his cranium. After a few trail and errors, the basics of the distribution was in his gasp.* - Mon Oct  5 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: But they could also adopt a way to counter that sword. Knowing you have the greatest sword amongst the land will make others assume you're a swordsman.. and take a long range approach. - Mon Oct  5 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I think it's better for people to not know you and what you can do, rather than have them fear your abilities. - Mon Oct  5 04:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes pand over to Takeda, narrowing a bit as the male examined the weapon.

"It's a gunbai; given to me by Hideki."* - Mon Oct  5 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, fuuton is aided by ti. - Mon Oct  5 15:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So you know this Hideki well then? - Mon Oct  5 15:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What you saw was as much as I know. He asked for a spar, I accepted, we only went one round and he stopped due to some Baen person showing up. - Mon Oct  5 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Strange how he gave you his weapon if he didn't know you... - Mon Oct  5 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Maybe he just saw something in you from your spar...even if it was just a short spar... - Mon Oct  5 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That, or he simply doesn't know how to manipulate the wind element so he gave it to someone who can. - Mon Oct  5 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess thats also a factor...Still kind of strange in any case. - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's focused shifted away from Takeda. The questioning and skepticism about the Gunbai and the reasoning behind the Gunbai was truly understandable; maybe it was the fact that Ortho found being interrogated to be extremely annoying why he was displaying such an angry demeanor. Clearly, from looking at Ortho, the anger wasn't pinpointed toward Takeda, but in a general basis.

"I suppose you're right. Still though, would you have questioned a gift such as this that could potentially further your fighting capabilities?"* - Mon Oct  5 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Of course not, I'm just interested in exotic things and was trying to make small talk I guess. - Mon Oct  5 16:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself toward Suitengu and extended his hand. Within his gasp was the shadow clone that the was provided to him; seems as though Ortho managed to learn the technique.* - Mon Oct  5 21:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I have a simple answer for that. - Mon Oct  5 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I don't have one. Perhaps I'll make my way to Kumogakure, or maybe find some other land too linger in. - Mon Oct  5 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Why. Does sitting here make you uneasey? - Mon Oct  5 21:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) says: Suitengu. . .We do have all that money. . .We could create some sorta place to stay. - Mon Oct  5 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: As much as I like training...I also like to have...something to train towards... - Mon Oct  5 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm just a bit...uncomfortable with sitting around here...not knowing what to do. - Mon Oct  5 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as his focus set on Reisen. Something that always puzzled him was why this female treated Suitengu like a small child. Yes, the boy was young in age but he was a ninja within the shinobi world; would babying him not end up in the lad becoming soft? A slow shake of his head is seen coming from Ortho as he rolled his eyes, keeping his thoughts within his mind. Suitengu was someone Ortho respected, and maybe Suitengu just wanted that mother-like relationship with someone to ease his own internal pain and stress.* - Mon Oct  5 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That is a simple D-Rank jutsu. - Mon Oct  5 21:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I learned the first one you gave me, I just gave that back to you. - Mon Oct  5 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I haven't really got around to the other one yet. - Mon Oct  5 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked toward the female, momentarily sizing her up. With a slight shrug of his shoulders and the unfolding of his arms from across his chest, Ortho would supply her with a nod. "Sure, why not."* - Mon Oct  5 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) allowed Reisen to lead him into the hospital, understanding that there wasn't any other place to seat them. Upon arriving, Ortho would unhook the buckle that tied his body to his Gunbai's strap. He places the weapon to the side of his as he takes his seat and leans back into the chair, placing both his hands in his pants pocket; he was in his usual nonchalant posture. "Not really much to smile about, honestly. I also rather not talk unless I'm directly spoken to; many people get themselves in trouble for not doing the same."* - Mon Oct  5 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arm raised and he takes grasp of the cup. Instead of bringing it to his mouth to take a sit, he instead places it on his lap while keeping a firm hold; last thing he wanted to do was waste what little money they had by spilling the drink. Ortho's head would turn slightly, allowing his peripheral vision to focus on the female beside him. "No emotions, no pain.."* - Mon Oct  5 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but release a single chuckle as a smirk formed on his face. His body shifts a bit, allowing him to face the female a bit more; a clear sign that this conversation sparked some form of interest. "That's a rhetorical question, yes? Does it truly require everyone to care for everyone..? If you care for a single person and know within yourself that you truly can protect them for what this shinobi world have in store, do you really feel pain?"* - Mon Oct  5 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk faded. The mention of Suitengu didn't really anger Ortho, but he did take notice of how Reisen clung herself to the boy. By no means was Ortho jealous, just a bit skeptical how something so intense could form so quickly.  Hell, in anything, Reisen could consider Suitengu more of a spouse than anything; Ortho wasn't going to question it --- out loud. There was no real reply to what Reisen just said so Ortho simply raised the cup of sake to his lips and took a single sip. Following the sip was merely two words, "I see."* - Mon Oct  5 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't going as hard on the sake as Reisen. He takes a subtle sip of his sake and looks down at his lap, giving an obnoxious chuckle. "Right, right."* - Mon Oct  5 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, hearing the sentimental words from Reisen.  "You're going to get yourself hurt."* - Mon Oct  5 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The offer of a hand had much more meaning behind it than Reisen could understand. It wasn't that Ortho didn't want to accept the offer, but his pride wouldn't let him. His eyes focused on the gesture for several seconds, it was clear that he was stuck. Ortho bites down on his tongue and slowly rose to his feet, taking Reisen hand by the wrist and gently lowering it to her side. "Dealing with me will cause you pain.." With that being said, Ortho would grab after his Gunbai and strapped it to his back, waiting for Reisen to make the initial steps out the building.* - Mon Oct  5 23:35:40 2015
