<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || It wasn't in Sogeki's current instincts to kiss back. If anything, he was so out of it that the kiss may have easily been ignored all together. Still, however, Akarui made her point clear. After all this, she managed to drill through his clouded mind and register everything she was saying into his head. The kiss being the tool that led to everything else being inputed.

He stares up at her as his eyebrows arch in a bit. A look of both confusion and.. understanding.. plastering itself on his visage. There was obvious confliction of what his mind and heart wanted, the two battling since the second he first attempted to commit suicide. Now, when he thought everything was fine, the depression only seeped back into his head and his him hard --- like a train hitting an infant that crept on to the tracks.

It wasn't that Akarui wasn't someone he looked to once upon a time, it's just the fact that the way things played out only forced Sogeki to come to the decision he made. He was so indecisive that it 'will' end up in someone else being hurt --- Akarui in this case.

"I.. get it," he mutters as he looks up at her. He blinks a few times and slowly shook his head. "I.. understand.."* - Thu Dec  3 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's intentions was never to hurt anyone. All he wanted was for everyone to be happy --- everyone being Kariudo and Akarui. Before he showed up they seemed to have a pretty decent frienship, now they don't even talk. His priority was set on making sure they came to mends but everything turned sour. He made mistakes, Akarui made mistakes and Kariudo made mistakes, there was no way around what's going on.

It's true that Kariudo was there for him when it mattered the most. It's true that, if he had to decide from just feelings alone, Kariudo would be picked. This wasn't about feelings though, it was about way more. It was about sanity and mental strength; something Sogeki was lacking greatly in. It was about understanding; something Sogeki couldn't get people to grasp at all. He wanted to be selfish for once, but his morals and self-worth, the little of both he has left, couldn't allow him to do that. The most he could do was come to the decision, before this talk with Akarui, that suicide was his best bet to rid himself of the stress and depression --- along with ridding Akarui and Kariudo of him.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Love is a word that is often used too loosely. It's not a matter of using it it when it's necessary, but trying to manipulate it's sincere meaning to cure your own selfish desires. When Akarui of all people says it, he's inclined to believe it. He's inclined to register it and he's inclined to fully grasp the concept behind each letter used to form that one word. He slowly shakes his head.

His soul didn't want to believe her. His mind and heart did, but his soul was in denial. After all of this she was willing to admit such a thing? After all this she still wants to uphold that feeling for him as if he was of any worth? As if he was someone that deserved to be loved? Hell, it could've been Kari and he'd be inclined to believe it completely.. but Akarui was different. Akarui was more closed out and hesitant with everything she said and did, but here she is saying it with relative ease. He slowly shakes his head.

Why did it feel so weird? Why did it feel like everything came crumbling down and the understanding of what he's doing is only tearing Akarui apart. He wanted to make an attempt to cure the pain in everyones' heart and make everyone happy, but it all backfired before he could even make progress. This is paining him and destroying him more than what he can ever physically do and he knew that this form of pain he can't get rid of --- not even in death.

He stares at her and nodded his head. He wouldn't dare say it back to her while he's in this conflicted state. At most he'd just take her hands, grip it and nod his head. He was clearly at a lost for words.* - Fri Dec  4 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was at a lost for words. The promise could be granted and kept with ease, but a little part of him knows he may have destroyed Akarui..

That.. was something he could never forgive himself for. He watches her walk off until, eventually, he lower his head and finally silently cry.* - Fri Dec  4 00:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reached behind his back and take grasp of an arrow. He gulps from anxiety and shook his head, fighting back the potential guilt he may face once busting through this door. He paces forth and drove the arrow into the keyhole then backed up, forming a single handseal and allowing the explosive tag that was wrapped around the arrow to ignite and combust, destroying the lock that kept the door from opening. From there, Sogeki would walk in.* - Fri Dec  4 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's first sight was of a lifeless Akarui. He body was hanging from the ceiling by a rope and her neck. Almost immediately tears start to flow down his face. He stares at her body and bites down on his tongue, trying his best to not break down mentally, physically and emotionally.

Instead, he steps more into the house and head for Akarui's Corpse. Once there he'd lift her body even more off the ground and have the rope around her neck to loosen from the lack of stretch. By time the rope was up over his head, he'd throw her over his shoulder and carry her off.* - Fri Dec  4 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't believe this. Why did it all uncoil to this? All his efforts to make everyone happy, all his efforts to just keep things neutral and to allow all hate and depression to become void was in vain.

He places the ground, gently laying it parallel with the shore. There, he'd sit next to it and look up at the sky. There weren't any tears flowing from his eyes, but the look of guilt and sadness was clear --- it was his fault at the end of the day..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus wasn't on any arrival, nor did it matter at this point. He just sat there with his head raised and eyes fixed on the sky.

He felt guilty, angry, confused and everything else that wasn't a synonym to happy or happiness itself.. Nothing was making sense to him right now.* - Fri Dec  4 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Why did she say you were going to do things with her? - Fri Dec  4 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: She wanted public show of affection. I couldn't just.. shoot her down.. so I agreed that if it'd make her happy I would comply. - Fri Dec  4 03:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Were you really only trying to make her happy... or did you want to do things with her..or be with her..but I was your first choice? Just like you were her first choice? - Fri Dec  4 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: My goal was to really make her happy.. Attraction on an emotional level wasn't there.. No feelings.. - Fri Dec  4 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) got quiet for a second. His eyelids lower a bit and rested his chin on his arms.

"Oh," he says in a hushed tone. Her saying that him harder than everything else that has been going on. "I.. don't blame you."* - Fri Dec  4 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't even have to turn his head to feel her glare. He shifts his head and placed his forehead on his arms and just sat there.* - Fri Dec  4 04:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: From who. Little ol' you? - Fri Dec  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raised his head and smirked a bit.* - Fri Dec  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Pffft. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh, lil ol' me who kicked your ass. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Keep playing it may be the reverse. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh really huh? - Fri Dec  4 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yup. - Fri Dec  4 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grew wider. He shifts his body and pounces toward Kariudo, immediately going for her top set of arms and grip her wrists. In a swift movement, he'd place more pressure on her right hand, tugging it so she would be flipped over on to her stomach.* - Fri Dec  4 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: Do I even want to know.... - Fri Dec  4 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) acted quick. They've been through this before and Sogeki wasn't going to get his ass handed to him again. With her top set of arms grasped, he'd raise up slightly and place his right knee at the small of her backs. He's extend her arms tot heir full wingspan and pullt hem back slightly to render them useless.

Of course, in the process, she managed to get some blows in on his ribs. This time around, however, he wasn't going to just try and tank them. He was going to do his best to not get hit.* - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't notice Akito, too busy.* - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: F-fuuuu - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oi! You're cheating! - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: ...... - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: It seems it is....what the fuck are they doing? - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) inched himself back just a bit more while changing his grasp from her wrists to her complete hand. The knee that was at the small of her back would slide down to her butt so she can apply just a bit more pressure without having to worry aobut snapping her spine. "Aww, come on.~ Alls fair in love and war.~"

He pulls more on her arms, trying to make more of an arch to her posture to leave the other arms useless* - Fri Dec  4 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Just gave her an opening. - Fri Dec  4 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Take it.. - Fri Dec  4 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: They appear to be fighting. - Fri Dec  4 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) wasn't on games this time around. Kariudo took the bait and Sogeki was going to act accordingly.

She raised her curvey hips and sent him off balance, forcing both his knees to now be on the ground. With his hands still making an attempt to grip her hands, and them failing miserably, Sogeki rolled. He was doing his best to evade extreme damage --- her punches, force wise, was weak.. but where she hit was deadly.

By time he was to roll, if he was successful, his left hand would suffer the effects of her pressure point assault. "Fuck.. You have to teach me how to do that," he says as he makes to his feet with a dangling arm.* - Fri Dec  4 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) begins to flash his arm back and forth. He paces himself back a few more feet to make room between them, knowing that close range battle with her, while he was holding back, would get him whooped. Instead, with his good arm, he'd reach behind him and pull an arrow out of his quiver. "You act like I only use my arrows though, 'babe'.."* - Fri Dec  4 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) brings his arrow to his face and watched a trickle of the purple poison drip down. He continues to flash his arm's feeling back and smirked even wider. "So.. Ready for round two?"* - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: She cant go on much longer. - Fri Dec  4 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took a step foward. "Oh come on. It's not -that- bad.~"* - Fri Dec  4 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) used his, once numb, arm to reach for his bow and pull it over his head; he usually carried it around his body so his hands were free at all times. His eyes set on Kariudo as he brought the arrow and bow togetherm, taunting her. "You told me to give you my worse though, Kari!~~"* - Fri Dec  4 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: in the anime - Fri Dec  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: ..... - Fri Dec  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: You dont see that every day. - Fri Dec  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) wasn't going to be a push over this time around. He got his ass handed to him last time for holding back; this wasn't going to be the case this time around.

His eyes narrowed in and he focuses his sensing ability. The manifestation of chakra made him react; he refuses to deal with those webs again. He dashes off to the side in an attempt to evade the web aimed for his bow. In turn, if he was truly lucky, the secondary set of webs would hopefully be evaded as well. While on the move, he'd prepare his bow and arrow, aiming it at Kariudo's left thigh.

Upon doing so, he arch his elbow and shoulder back, the one that had the wire and arrow gripped. At the right moment, he'd extend his index and middle finger, releasing both objects and sends the arrow soring. His intention wasn't to drill the arrow through her thigh, but to make the poison tipped weaponry graze against her skin and cause a small cut.

[13.3 Reflexes, 21 / 2 = Speed of Arrow, 16 Attack Speed for how quick I can launch the arrow.]* - Fri Dec  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus became more broad. His smirk faded and he sighed. He straps the bow back around his body and paces to Kari, taking her by her upper body clothing and hoisting her up and over his shoulder. Just then, as if seeing a ghost manifest before him, he stares at Akito. "Yo'.."* - Fri Dec  4 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ....... - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah. So uh.. - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) paced to his house.* - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: What the shit are you doing... - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Give me the freaking antidote. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I never restocked on my antidote.. It's in my house.. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Sheesh.. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So attractive. - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes, kari. I -have- antidote. - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) walked  up the mountain.* - Fri Dec  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) flops her down ont he bed with attitude and walks to the kitchen. "I'll be right back, ma'am."* - Fri Dec  4 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) went to work. He gathered a bowl, filled it with water and set it off to the side. He reaches above to the cupboard above the sink, pulled out a few ingredients and steadily mixed them together. All his containers were rigged to dispense the proper amount of each material needed, wanting to make sure he didn't add too much of once substance and have to waste time trying again. He goes into the fridge, after mixing in what he already poured into the bowl of water and takes out the key component, something he's not going to disclose ever. He poured the purple substance into the bowl, uses a spoon to mix it then crouched down to the bottom of the sink and takes out a syringe.

At this point, he'd tip the needle end of the tool into the antidote and suck up the liquid. There, he'd walk over to Kariudo and, with one hand, tear her pants a bit. He aims the needle just above the cut and squeezed down on the opposite end, injecting the antidote to the wound. "There," he says bluntly. He slowly ejects the needle and walks back to the kitchen. "It's a stronger dosage so you should be able to move sooner than last time."* - Fri Dec  4 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .............. - Fri Dec  4 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) heard her complaining and internally sighed. He slowly shook his head, rolling his eye to and from the kitchen. He walks back his his living room, slash bed room, and reaches under the bed. There, he pulls out a box and opens it to reveal a bunch of rolled up paper-monkey. He takes grasp of one roll and place it beside her. "Right," he says in a hushed tone. "There you go. Buy your outfit and don't worry about me having to poke you with needles."* - Fri Dec  4 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || He walks to the other part of the room, got a chair and carried it to the side of the bed, seating himself and kicking the box back under the bed.* - Fri Dec  4 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, sighing a bit. He runs his hand over his face then turns to look at her. "What.. do 'you' want? Like.. I told you what I wanted, but what about you?"* - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Can you answer me? - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'd like for you to answer me. - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not 'down'.. - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. wish I could do better. - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...but we were having fun... - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) really didn't want to spoil the mood. He was truly having fun as well, but he was getting attached too quick and he wasn't even sure what 'they' were. He was serious at the moment, but there was still a hint of 'goofy' in his attitude and words. Like he was fighting it back just to talk about this, but it was starting to be more and more apparent.

"I'll go back to beating that ass later.. Just let me know where we stand.. or even if I can consider you mine just a bit."* - Fri Dec  4 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked at her and smiled a bit, biting down on his lip harder this time in an attempt to hold it back. He reaches for her hand, but then remembered how she felt about physical contact. Instead, he palyfully nudged her a bit to make her sway a little, nothing to send her flying.

"I just wanted to make sure I didn't screw this up,-" he just caught on to what she said. "The.. rain country..? And three times back and forth?" He was a little bit shocked.. and grateful. He returns the soft smile to her and nodded a bit. "I'd kiss you if you weren't such a sore loser."* - Fri Dec  4 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked and leaned in. He keeps his eytes focused on hers, puckering his lips slightly and turning his head to kiss her cheek. Just when he was to make contact, he give a grin and slowly shake his head. "I want to kiss you when a 'maybe' or hesitation isn't there.. I'll work my way to that little by little."

He pulls his head back and just squeezed her hand gently, satisfying himself with just that.* - Fri Dec  4 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked even wider. He was going to toy with her endlessly now.* - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides. - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You probably like it better with an arrow to your neck - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leaned in quickly, swayed his head to the side and kissed her on the cheek. It wasn't a quick peck, but actually something that lasted a while and had passion behind it. Within him he knew about her little.. despise of affection, but he couldn't help himself. He broke the kiss on her cheek for a second then gave her a second one that was more of a peck and leaned back.* - Fri Dec  4 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked her up and down, examining her frame. Normally someone would be put off by her arms, but strangely enough he really wasn't bothered by them. What he really was bothered by was the fact that she had a great shape and he had to fight back temptation. She'll easily see him checking her out and chewing the inside of his lower lip. "So uh.. How soon you have to leave again..?"* - Fri Dec  4 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) set his gaze on her face and rested it there. He smiled at the thought of her possibly relaxing with him for a few days, already making plans to make things fun for them both. When she mentioned her third eye he'd actually smile even more, slowly shaking his head as he responded.

"Because I remember you calling yourself a freak. I don't view you as such and if asking you 'yo what is that eye!?' make you feel like that, I won't be able to forgive myself. So I vowed to make you bring it up and we'll talk about it when you're ready."* - Fri Dec  4 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm comfortable with who I am, Sogeki... I'm just a little surprised you like me regardless of these.... loks. - Fri Dec  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: *looks. - Fri Dec  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) decided to ignore the fact that she called herself a freak again. Naturally he'd want to rebuttal and make an attempt at telling her otherwise, but the mentioning of her accepting the fact made him not bother. Instead, he'd look at the third eye and examine it for a few seconds.

"That's actually pretty cool. Does that give you better eyesight or something? I might just teach you how to use a bow and arrow just to pu that eye to use."

He specifically said that first bit in response to her curiosity on why he liked her regardless. Sogeki wasn't the type to judge for what makes someone different. -Everyone- was different, and technically.. with the broad statement of 'different', that makes everyone the same.* - Fri Dec  4 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) listened to her explanation and nodded through it all. He was actually interested in the eye. He didn't want one for himself, but still it looked pretty cool. If anything, he'd want to test out his abilities against it.

He smirks a bit and pouts, turning his head away from her. "I would've had to zap you then!~"* - Fri Dec  4 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked down at her and couldn't help but smile. He wanted to just climb in the bed with her and wrap his arms around her. A sigh came from him and he slowly shook his head. With his free hand he'd snap his thumb against his middle finger and spark an electrical surge. From there, he'd hover his hand over her arm and just make the sensation enter her. He didn't make full contact to zap her, but just gave her a taste.* - Fri Dec  4 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) hovers his hand up her arm and closes in on her shoulder. He watches her expression as if he was actually trying to experiment. "What do you think?"* - Fri Dec  4 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was acting a bit selfish right now. He wanted to see if he can get a certain side of Kariudo to show herself she he'd glide his hand back down her arm and inch it lower and lower until he was over her thigh. "Because I don't see a reason to go all out against you," you whispered. His eyes follow his hand and met her face every now and then, looking for some form of.. excitement.* - Fri Dec  4 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lowers his hand on to her thigh little by little. Eventually, once physical contact was made, he'd keep that exact flow of chakra going. He wasn't out to hurt her at all, just wanted to, selfishly, know if he could at least get her aroused. The only thing she'd feel is that rush starting in her thigh and slowly traveling up her body. "No. Never that.. I just don't want to hurt you."* - Fri Dec  4 08:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) became hesitant. He wanted to caress her body to his heart extent but he just froze. On top of that, what Kari just said caught him off guard. He frowned a bit and looked at her. "I do?"* - Fri Dec  4 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: ..Well.. - Fri Dec  4 08:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's chakra begins to slowly fade. He stares at his hand that was placed on her thigh and shrugged a bit. "The stupid thing I did.. or tried to do to.. I see your point."* - Fri Dec  4 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gently squeezes her thighs and looks at her with a smile. "Stop doing that.~"* - Fri Dec  4 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) inched his hand up her thigh and around her, heading for her most curvey area.. "I'm being a bit selfish right now.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) retracted his hand and laid it on the side of the bed. "..Sorry.." He sits back in the chair and looks away. "Really.. sorry. Won't happen again."* - Fri Dec  4 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: OCARE - Fri Dec  4 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Shhh. - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No harm. - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: And all I did was turn over onto my back when I got uncomfortable. See? No harm done. - Fri Dec  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) doesn't say anything. He leans forward in the chair, places his elbows on his knees and lowering his head. With his face still in his hands he'd continue to rub.* - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lowered his hands and turned his head to look at her. He had one brow raised.

"How do you do that?"* - Fri Dec  4 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .....Eh? - Fri Dec  4 09:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: But... you know I think when you almost hurt me it sort of acts like how normal people get when they are nervous and want someone to touch them. I thought that was weird... it seems like the same feeling I've read about in books. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was caught off gaurd. "Nervous-.. touch them-.."

He thought about that for a second. "I mean.. yeah you can piece that together.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:46:14 2015
