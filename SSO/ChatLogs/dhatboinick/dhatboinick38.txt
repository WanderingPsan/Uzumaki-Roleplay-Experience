<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Sun Nov  8 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls his right arm out of the water and reaches up the bank for his bottle of sake. All this casual talk and intercourse made him forget the liquor part of the swim. "Tell you what. Maybe at a later date we can focus on your goals that you're able to pick. You're a weapon, okay, but every weapon is unique. Choosing your goals and your progression is what will make 'you' unique." Ortho brings the top of the bottle to his mouth, grips the cork with his teeth and yanked his arm back. A 'pop' was sounded and the smell of the strong sake filled the immediate area. "Of course, if it's something that isn't appealing to you, you can always say 'No Ortho, I don't want to do that'."

He brings the bottle to his mouth again, taking a gulp. A grunt escapes Ortho as he glances at the bottle. He brings his right elbow up and back, resting it on the bank so keeping the bottle out of the water wouldn't become a strain.* - Sun Nov  8 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks for a while, saying nothing in the meantime. Of course, in the process, silence filled the air. Ortho bites down on his lower lip; it was clear that the request had him speechless. Deciding his path was relatively easily, but to suggest what another person, or thing, can do to forge their own is hard. He could just have her use the wind he creates while trailing down his path, but that wasn't exactly fair for her.

Maybe that's what all this about. His determination to help her progress through 'life' as more than just a weapon is probably why he chose to treat her so.. humanly. It wasn't exactly fair for her to walk the ground of this shinobi world thinking that she was some tool.

Ortho slowly shakes his head, using the arm that was still wrapped around Owari's waist to gently squeeze her a bit tighter. "How about.. your goal is to find your own way? To not be looked at, by yourself or anyone else, as a 'weapon'. The 'creation' aspect of you is similar to our 'creation' aspect. We all are created, just you weren't 'born', just 'formed'."* - Sun Nov  8 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ....not...exactly the same. - Sun Nov  8 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kisses the top of Owari's head. He didn't know why, but it just felt.. fitting at this moment. He brings the bottle of sake to his mouth once more and takes two sturdy gulps before placing his elbow back on the bank. "Can't lie; I'm a bit anxious to see you walk that path, haha. It'll be different seeing someone reach for that metaphoric 'brace ring' rather than sitting around and waiting for orders."* - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods. "Soon you'll be complete.. I promise you that."* - Sun Nov  8 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. He places the bottle of sake up on the bank then altered his position underneath Owari. He hooks one of his arms behind her knees, after unwrapping her legs from around his body, and carries her to shore.* - Sun Nov  8 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: If you has asked me a few hours ago to walk, we'd have a problem. - Sun Nov  8 08:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Eww, we're not in a relationship. You're a liar. - Sun Nov  8 23:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolls his eyes.* - Sun Nov  8 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm so very jealous. You pick up a pen and write, so very much accomplishing. - Sun Nov  8 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What's next, you're going to be a artist? - Sun Nov  8 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just like you hold everything against me, I'm going to start doing the same thing. - Sun Nov  8 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I say bout.. - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh. - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe ten? - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Fifteen? - Sun Nov  8 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'll have one, because I'm not a jackass like you. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Perfect siblings. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Too bad you're more focused on hating me than working together. - Mon Nov  9 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Working together? That's actually a nice idea. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah. Right. Until I can't put my full attention on you, then you go and fuck around with my bestfriend. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And pull the "i was lonely" card. - Mon Nov  9 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't even know who your best friend is.  - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You were never -around- to tell me. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Was.. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But hey. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How was I supposed to know that. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I barely talked to him. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But when he was around we had bestfriend times. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: More than you, anyway. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet you kissed him. Then he goes around gloating he fucked "Ortho's little sister" around Sunagakure. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ever since he and I fought in Kirigakure. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Smart, Nina. Smart. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe you shouldn't have fought then, smart ass. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That little 'games' he play is just a hit list. - Mon Nov  9 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe I shouldn't have fought? He attacked me. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Or were you too blinded by Ortho Hate - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: To see that? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And then when we calmed you both down, what happened? - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You shot a fireball at him. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Instead of calming the hell down. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Mon Nov  9 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nina allows to throw a fit when shit don't settle for her. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But when Ortho gets tired of something and throws a fit. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He's wrong. - Mon Nov  9 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yep. - Mon Nov  9 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Anyway, stop fighting and lets "work together" as you suggested. - Mon Nov  9 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're too conflicted for us to work together. - Mon Nov  9 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well when I suggest something and you try to deny it like that. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Then yeah. - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just like when I say something and you're quick to jump down my throat? We have a love-hate relationship as siblings. Organizing a way for us to "work together" will have us argue. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Instead of thnking about "working together", we just do it. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No questions asked, just actions. - Mon Nov  9 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, but that'd be better with practice and talking. - Mon Nov  9 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What we do while working together is fine, that can be discussed. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But to sit down and talk about feelings, hate, love, all that mess.. no. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No thank you. - Mon Nov  9 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But... - Mon Nov  9 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down at his little sister, giving her a gentle and sincere smile. "I've yet to tell you that I'm sorry for never being there. So, I am truly sorry Nina." He extends his arms, not waiting for Nina to comply, and takes her in for a hug.* - Mon Nov  9 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh how sweet. - Mon Nov  9 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's body was squeezed, causing his lower back to release an audible crack. "O-Ohkay!" Ortho yelps as he placed his hands on Nina's shoulders. Suddenly, two snakes extract themselves from his sleeves, wrapping themselves around Nina. With relative ease, Ortho would raise his arms and, within Nina bounded, lift her up off the ground. "Why do you insist on ruining the rare moment of me trying to apologize?" The snakes continue to coil around Nina, making sure to restrict her arm and hand movements.* - Mon Nov  9 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why did he do that? - Mon Nov  9 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Why are Nigen's friends so. . .  What's the word. .? - Mon Nov  9 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirked as well. The two snakes retract back into his sleeves, slowly lowering Nina. This time, however, Ortho would place a hug on Nina, but while keeping her arms to her side. "Now is that so hard, Nina?"* - Mon Nov  9 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened.

"Funny. You smell like to cans of 'what the fuck' and 'why?'.."

He releases Nina, going back to his same 'hands tucked in his pockets' posture.* - Mon Nov  9 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"It's that same desire for entertainment that gets you in trouble and have rumors started about you. Instead of asking me, why not walk up to her, like the friendly person you are, and introduce yourself?"* - Mon Nov  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Well..what to expect...from today.. - Mon Nov  9 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, remaining quiet from where he was.* - Mon Nov  9 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: My name is Nina, mhm. - Mon Nov  9 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's focus shifted abruptly, setting upon Nigen. A nod of acknowledgement was given as he turned his head back to Nina and Owari.

"Yes, I'm fine now. A moment of emotional distress that I plan to never make happen again."* - Mon Nov  9 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: You shouldn't run away from it.. - Mon Nov  9 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's no that I'm running from it, I'm acknowledging it and making sure it's never happening again. - Mon Nov  9 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Well, how are you going to make sure that it never happens? I hear you're protecting Shine-chan. - Mon Nov  9 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Extra weight won't help you.. - Mon Nov  9 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Shine-chan? - Mon Nov  9 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glanced back at Nigen, giving him a confused look.* - Mon Nov  9 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Ah..that's what I've decided to call Owari.. - Mon Nov  9 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Ahh, ahh. - Mon Nov  9 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That is very much true. - Mon Nov  9 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Now who is this..little de--boy? - Mon Nov  9 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Mon Nov  9 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks at Nina, bursting out in laughter.* - Mon Nov  9 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: HAHAHAHAH! - Mon Nov  9 01:10:24 2015
