<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ortho. - Sat Oct 10 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow out of skepticism. "What eyes..?"* - Sat Oct 10 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) extracted his hands from his pockets as he eyes began examining Angetsu. In all honesty, now that Ortho thought back on the question provided, he knew that he misunderstood exactly what was asked; but it being a riddle was still realized. A simple sigh escaped Ortho as he smirked and nodded his head. "Let us begin then." Ortho's body pivots backward, furthering his distance between Angetsu and himself. Upon doing so, with a quick succession of handseals, Ortho would begin kneading his chakra. Afterwards, by time the handseals were completed, he'd spark a flame within his chakra bank and exhale a massive fireball toward the dual sword wielding male.* - Sat Oct 10 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The combinations continued. The launching of the fireball wasn't just to max his own sight of Angetsu, but to mask Angetsu's sight on him as well. With that in mind, after forming a single handseal and spawning a Shadow Clone to the side of him, he'd complete yet another series of signs. Upon doing so, after dashing into the general direction of Angetsu, Ortho would allow his chakra to vigorously vibrate within his body. Once close enough, while keeping some form of distance between them, Ortho would unleash a surge of lighting forward.

Now, one would say that the lightning would be negated by the wind. This, however, would be true if the Shadow Clone that was made beforehand didn't do what it did. In retaliation to the wind, the clone would weave together its own combination of handseals before unleashes a second fireball jutsu and use Angetsu's own wind against him.* - Sat Oct 10 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The clone dispersed with relative ease, and it was for that reason why Ortho was notified on where Angetsu was. With haste, and no remorse, the Uchiha began his next combination of handseals. Each hand sign was formed and weaved with such grace and speed that it could be blind to the naked eye. The kneading of his chakra was quick and efficient as it flowed out of his body relentlessly. With that, after the handseals were completed, Ortho would slam both his palms into the ground. As a result, a multitude of earth-based spikes would protrude from the ground in an attempt to capture Angetsu; rather than piercing through him.  Afterwards, after snapping his knees shut and straightening his legs, Ortho would pivot into the air.

Yet another succession of handseals was woven and his chakra began to vibrate unforgivingly against itself. From the upper regions of Angetsu, once Ortho stretched his arms out and pained his palms toward Angetsu, a massive array of lightning would rain down.* - Sat Oct 10 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The battle between Ortho and Angetsu was getting intense. They were perfectly negating each other and showing that their abilities were second to no one, a feat that was surely commendable. The manner in which Angetsu slipped out the earth spike trap was unique, and it is for that same reason why Ortho had to follow it up. An attempt to negate Angetsu's wind was immediately made. With the forming of several handseals and unleash a fireball, Ortho would clash his jutsu with Angetsu's.

Meanwhile, while the power struggle was happening, Ortho would form yet another series of handseals and allow another shadow clone to spawn next to him. Since they were in midair and descending rapidly, the clone would haste itself by kneading its own chakra and unleashing a devastating earth flash.* - Sat Oct 10 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || This is where things got technical. Angetsu was coming in hot pursuit and Ortho, the original, had little time to react. It is for that reason and that reason only, why Ortho threw himself into the oncoming coming. Meanwhile, behind Ortho, the clone wove a set of handseals together and unleashed a river of mud toward them both. The original Ortho would wrap his arms around Angetsu and attempt to alter their positions so Angetsu would take the blunt force.* - Sun Oct 11 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was getting fed up of this spar by now. It seemed as though Angetsu was able to negate everything dished at him, be it physically or not. A grunt of annoyance came from Ortho as he stood to his feet as well and folded his across his chest. Ortho's chakra bank was literally fine; the amount he had was amazing. "I can finish him off right now, but I'm not going to stoop that low.."* - Sun Oct 11 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well, firstly the Raikage sent me a letter, asking if I wanted to buy the troops. And so I told the Raikage I would, however in return the Yondaime Raikage asked for a treaty, to which I said I'd do one. - Sun Oct 11 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: All through a bird. - Sun Oct 11 18:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What the shit. - Sun Oct 11 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: She's got a giant with her. - Sun Oct 11 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So you don't know his name, haven't met him in person, and just accepted thousands of troops into your village on the pretense of a "treaty". - Sun Oct 11 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Don't even know the guy. - Sun Oct 11 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Kumogakure is known to make retarded decisions. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Genesis wanted to take my spot aswell as the next Raikage. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And it seemed other people didn't really think I was strong enough to lead the village. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well then.. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoshiko(BigBootyJudy) says: What now? - Sun Oct 11 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: back intot he village. - Sun Oct 11 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sun Oct 11 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: ..Meh. - Sun Oct 11 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Sun Oct 11 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) simply sighed, pacing himself toward Hideki and into the village.* - Sun Oct 11 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: The only one left. - Sun Oct 11 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh. - Sun Oct 11 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Of course, Ortho stood off by himself.* - Sun Oct 11 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So anyone know what that was all about? - Sun Oct 11 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm going to be completely honest. - Sun Oct 11 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, lowering his head and momentarily closing his eyes. "I say we take out the new Raikage and have one of the members of your little clique reign as the leader. At least you know that none of them will betray you in the end."* - Sun Oct 11 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You missed the fun. - Sun Oct 11 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) supplied a shrug. "I never said anything about attacking right now. Deal with your village affairs then think about the possibility. You stated that the new found Raikage offered you some troops. Either he, or she, knows you're a former Kumogakure Jounin, even if it was for a small amount of time, and she wishes to use you.. or she's genuine. We both know how 'genuine' is when it comes to high stake situations like we are in now.."* - Sun Oct 11 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's like trusting a hungry lion when you're getting attacked by a hungry cheetah. - Sun Oct 11 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: One of them is going to end up eating you. - Sun Oct 11 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ....... - Sun Oct 11 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Aren't you suppose to be in Kumogakure, Kuro? - Sun Oct 11 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) opened his eyes and looked up at Kuro. He unfolds his right arm, raised it and opened his palm; blocking her face from view. This was the ultimate sign of disrespect.* - Sun Oct 11 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. - Sun Oct 11 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm traveling with Misa. - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ........... - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Why not do one of those. - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Arranged marriages? - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You're the Hokage. - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hideki, who is this individual? - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: The Hokage marrying the Raikage? - Sun Oct 11 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Arranged marriage? - Sun Oct 11 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: That'd be interesting to see. - Sun Oct 11 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. Well I'll be traveling the world. I want to see things in a bigger picture now. - Sun Oct 11 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Travel safely. - Sun Oct 11 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm going to spread my teachings, while continuing on with my training.  - Sun Oct 11 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Marrriage... - Sun Oct 11 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Usually secures an alliance. - Sun Oct 11 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Unless the wife ends up being a vixen. - Sun Oct 11 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Also, who is the new Raikage, and why did Kenshin attack the village? - Sun Oct 11 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: My eyes burn. - Sun Oct 11 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood up straight, allowing himself to push off of the tree slightly. His eyes begin to pan over Kuro's frame, soaking in what visuals he can to depict the possible abilities this fellow ninja possessed. A chuckle that showed a sign that Ortho wasn't impressed with what he saw was given to Kuro as he slowly shook his head. "Are you supposed to be some form of humanoid safe haven..? Or possibly one of those pacifists that don't seem to be just that --- a pacifist. What I say, what I do and what I think is no concern of yours. If I choose to spit in your direction, you will accept it and you will ignore it. Why..? Because what I do is none of your concern. If you have a problem with it, do something about it."* - Sun Oct 11 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: . . . Yeah.. - Sun Oct 11 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: He's one of her family members. - Sun Oct 11 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: It's those people... - Sun Oct 11 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Who stab the tenketsu system. - Sun Oct 11 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: .... Hmm. - Sun Oct 11 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's gaze immediately altered. Ortho did nothing in retaliation to Hideki's approach, but the snakes was something that he to get used to. Nevertheless, with him now bound and Hideki choosing to single him out from the two in the argument, Ortho simply shook his head. "I don't get it, Hideki. Is this supposed to be some form of tough love or something..? Or am I truly that much of a pain in the ass to you..? Or, let me guess, that guy over there has some higher standings in your mind since you know him better or longer..? I said nothing to him, nor did I even acknowledge his existence before now; after you and I were having a casual conversation. I'm wrong for continuing the discussion he started..?" Ortho begins to chuckle, his chest slightly heaving and retracting as the snake continues to restrict his body. By now, Kuro went on with his monologue. "No one gives a fuck." That was the only reply the male got from Ortho. Afterwards, the young Uchiha would set his eyes back on Hideki. "I get it now, guy. I truly do."* - Sun Oct 11 19:29:04 2015
