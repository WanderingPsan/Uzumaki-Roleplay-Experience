<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood stationary, hands tucked away in his pants pockets and his back leaning against the statue behind him. His head was slightly lowered with closed eyes, but spectators could tell her was obviously awake.* - Wed Oct 28 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) *Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Chi's approach was much more than seductive. It could easily be labeled as mesmorizing, and in turn Ortho granted her with a smirk of approval. Blood surged down to his member, forcing it to stiffen in lust and cause a tent in the frontal part of his pants; still, however, he wasn't fully erect. By time Chi was within arms reach, she made the unique request.

Ortho was a man that kept his word, so the request didn't fall on deaf ears. As a result, with no words said, Ortho took the sports bra by the front and, with a single pull, ripped it off of Chi. Once her breasts were exposed and the view of her nipples was made, Ortho wasted no time in cupping them whilst placing her nipples in between two fingers. He squeezed tightly, a bit more than what he'd usually do due to the knowledge that Chi enjoyed pain.* * - Wed Oct 28 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Despite his line of sight being hindered due to his closed eyelids, Ortho was aware of his surrounds. Not to the point where he could detect the launched salted nuts, but to the extent where he was aware that another being had traveled into the courtyard and stationed themselves a few feet away. In turn, once the edible salted nuts made contact with his upper chest and shoulder, Ortho simply raised his head slightly and opened his eyes. Upon seeing Chi, he'd smirk slightly and slowly shook his head.

"If you wanted my attention, all you had to do was call my name."
* - Wed Oct 28 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckles a bit, slowly shaking his head. "Cute, Chi. Cute." With that, he'd lower his head once again and close his eyes, not expecting any more antics from the female.* - Wed Oct 28 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: She really loves her nuts - Wed Oct 28 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was officially getting bullied by Chi. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing due to the humor behind the scenario. Once the nut, this time around, connected with the side of Ortho's head the male released another chuckle before opening his eyes to look at Chi. "Keep playing, you're going to waste those." Ortho pushed himself off of the statue and attempted to sidestep Violet. His path was to the inside of the academy, ready to explore. If Chi attended him, then the travels would be all that better. * - Wed Oct 28 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's movement was halted by Violet. He was beginning to wonder when Nina was going to be mentioned, and in turn he'd slightly look over his shoulder. "Doubt is often mistaken for accusations. This is the fourth time I've shown up here and you remind me that I am Nina's safe keeper. I am free to roam as I please due to the fact that Nina is off training with Fujitora, along with Lera's presence with Fujitora as well. Ease your mind, drink some sake and smoke a blunt. Worrying will only kill you faster than the life of a Shinobi would."* - Wed Oct 28 15:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head whilst listening to Violet's words. "As I said, doubts are often mistaken for accusations. If you were any ordinary person.. I'd see your life claimed by my hands. In the end, however, I understand your love for Nina and I shall respect your supposed motherly affection toward her." Ortho had nothing else to say to Violet, so his attention shifted to Marrisa. "Hello."* - Wed Oct 28 15:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands into his pants pockets once again, keeping his eyes fixated on Marrisa. "You coming to train as well? Chi and I are heading inside."* - Wed Oct 28 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) figured Marrisa fell asleep so he continued on into the academy.* - Wed Oct 28 16:07:15 2015

The way Ortho remembered: Kuro interrupted a conversation between Hideki and Ortho. In turn, Ortho threw straight logic and truth at Kuro. As a result, Hideki saw fit to punish Ortho rather than punishing Kuro for his intrusion. At this point and time, Ortho wanted Kuro dead. Ortho wanted Kuro to suffer and beg for his life by the hands of the person he screwed over second handedly. Still, though, Ortho wasn't going to act upon that want.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And that, despite all that, I do wish for a friendship with you and Chi. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You two show potential, and I wish to invite you two to an organization I am forming. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The details of the organization is what I wanted to discuss in private with you. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Uh huh. Most of that was driven by Chi. I wasn't even sure what was going on the majority of it. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Then let's go. - Wed Oct 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Yeah, now she wants to talk in private. - Wed Oct 28 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lead the way then. - Wed Oct 28 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: followed close pursuit. - Wed Oct 28 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) followed close pursuit.* - Wed Oct 28 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, I'm going to be blunt and honest. - Wed Oct 28 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to destroy this shinobi world and rebuild it with a new ninja system. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to take away all funds that the Gezo makes by helping local Blacksmiths, Armorsmiths and Tailors enhance their business. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to politically and economically destroy the Gezo. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: This sounds familiar. I think he was speaking of it with the girl earlier. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From there, I wish to take each village system and crumble it down to my feet. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: May I ask a question? - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head. - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What is the Gezo? - Wed Oct 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The Gezo Empire and the Gezo's are a mass of higher ups. They are the ones the legal Kages of each main village go to for aid. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Weaponry, Clothing, Food, everything. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to cut that out. - Wed Oct 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We, as Shinobi, shouldn't resort to going to some freak Empite to aid us. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We should be able to look to our own and trade money for services. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hence why I wish to find a Blacksmith, Armorsmith and Tailor. - Wed Oct 28 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Weaponsmith* - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Makes sense. It sounds like they just benefit greatly from us while giving minimal in turn. - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Exactly. - Wed Oct 28 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Once the Gezo Empire has no influence on us, I will then look to politically destroy each village. - Wed Oct 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to eradicate the idea of different villages, and make it all one entire world. - Wed Oct 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm not sure about your final point. I feel like diversity has to exist in the world to some extent. It'd be hard for one body to rule over the entire world. - Wed Oct 28 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Diversity will exist in everyones mindset, that is a given. However, that doesn't require a village being stronger than the next and have the next village afraid to interact with the rest of the world. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sunagakure, right now, is the strongest village. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everyone scurried to Sunagakure when Konoha and Kumo were destroyed. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What's the point in Sunagakure having so much armed forces? - Wed Oct 28 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I feel like maybe cutting down the number, but leaving at least two or three would be the best move. That way trade can still exist. Equality needs to be present as well. - Wed Oct 28 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Trade can still be made, but at a country level. - Wed Oct 28 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So much focus has been put on individual villages, that the remaining country have been neglected. - Wed Oct 28 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Take out these villages, expand the shinobi across their respective country. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow them to explore and enhance their will from a young age.. that way heartache is lessened in the future. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The more you experience at a young age, the less likely are you to be the next 'villian' of the shinobi world. - Wed Oct 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's always the shinobi that experience heartache when they're big and strong that end up destroying things. - Wed Oct 28 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Perhaps, but do you really think all combat can be abolished? - Wed Oct 28 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course not. Diversity will still exist, but a higher level of understanding will also be made. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Understanding leads to sincerity. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sincerity leads to compassion - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Compassion leads to love. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Love leads to true peace. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Love leads to betrayal. - Wed Oct 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: In some cases... - Wed Oct 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I can not deny that, for it is a factor in some cases. - Wed Oct 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But if the love was real, then even the mistake of betrayal could be forgiven and worked through. - Wed Oct 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Perhaps. Honestly i'm willing to give your idea a shot, but I can't deny my skepticism. If I join your organization what will my duties entail? - Wed Oct 28 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well. I wish to sway your mind from the fact that I intend to only use you for sexual purposes. I find you attractive, yes, but business is business. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: In turn, I will continue to hunt down a Taijutsu specialist and have them train you. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No matter the cost. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Loyalty. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just to know that any information you get about this organization stays within this organization. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Fair enough. - Wed Oct 28 22:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd probably rather not know what that seal entails. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I've read about some of those things...they're pretty formidable. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The hinderous of you speaking information. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: In any way, shape or form. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's what I figured. - Wed Oct 28 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So I must ask... - Wed Oct 28 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Why me? I'm just a freshly promoted genin with little to no skill in anything. - Wed Oct 28 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That goes back to what I said before. Allow people to experience the true shinobi life at a young age, then later in their life they'll be prepared for everything. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not only that, as I stated earlier as well, I see potential in you. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: How large do you intend on making this organization? - Wed Oct 28 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A handful. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe four or five. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's small. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Counting Chi and I that's three others... - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd assume your girlfriend is in. - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: SO that's one other... - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: The anbu member you were with earlier? - Wed Oct 28 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not allowing Marrisa to join the organization. - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like I said, this is strictly business. - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh? - Wed Oct 28 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doing business with loved ones and family will result in destruction. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I do not know the ANBU Agent from before. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I met him when I found you in front of the Academy courtyard. - Wed Oct 28 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I see. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Also, once again, I wish for there not to be any.. awkardness.. between you and I. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What happened after the training the other day will stay between you and myself.. - Wed Oct 28 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Should probably stop brining it up then. - Wed Oct 28 23:08:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's nice. - Wed Oct 28 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I openly told her. The truth and all. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Probably why she always gave me that look. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She thought you and I had intercourse, I assured her that we didn't. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No penetration, in any form, was made. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah let's uh...not. - Wed Oct 28 23:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Have any more taijutsu you can teach? - Wed Oct 28 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not at the moment. - Wed Oct 28 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Suiton or Doton? - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes. I have scrolls on those. - Wed Oct 28 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Unless you wish for a one on one lesson? - Wed Oct 28 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's your choice. - Wed Oct 28 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'd prefer one on one. - Wed Oct 28 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. When do you wish we start? - Wed Oct 28 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Whenever is good for you. - Wed Oct 28 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. Find Chi and I'll train you both. - Wed Oct 28 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) granted Chi with a nod. Slowly, a smile crept on his face, but was soon extinguished once he remembered that they were here to conduct business. The subject at hand was training, the organization talk would have to wait until he was able to get alone time with Chi. He didn't want Chi to feel obligated to say anything whilst Mana was present, so Ortho placed that in the back of his mind. "Alright. I'm aware that Mana wishes to learn Doton and Suiton. What do you seek, Chi?" * - Wed Oct 28 23:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have something to teach you both. - Thu Oct 29 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets get going. - Thu Oct 29 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood up once more and paced himself toward the exit.* - Thu Oct 29 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Let the training begin.

"Alright, let me start with Mana this time around. The jutsu I'm going to teach you is pretty basic." Ortho raised his arms to chest level and began the process of slowly weaving together a set of handseals. "To perform this jutsu, you must allow your chakra to center within your stomach and thicken it slightly. Upon thickening it, allow it to take the form of liquid." Following that brief lecture, Ortho would do just as he instructed. He allows his chakra to knead within the pits of his stomach and thicken to the point it hydrifies. Afterwards, which he felt was common sense; he'd pucker his lips and launch the quick torrent of water forward. "The rest, you figure out."

Ortho's attention went to Chi. "This jutsu is higher in skill rank than that of Mana's." Once again, the male brings his arms to chest level and weaved the necessary handseal. He kept the pace slow for Chi to watch. "Rather than allowing your chakra to liquefy, you instead allow it to swell. From there, you use a second load of chakra to flick and ignite the chakra you first handedly kneaded." Ortho's demonstration kicked off there. As he instructed, his chakra would swell and ignite. He turned his head away from the two females and allowed a massive fireball to be spewed out. "And the rest.. you can do on your own."* - Thu Oct 29 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself over to the body of water, slowly forming a string of handseals. After making sure Mana caught a good look, Ortho begins the lecture. "Alright then. This time you're not going to expel the water from your mouth. Allow your chakra to seep into the body of water before you and slowly manipulate it. Upon doing so, extend your arm and use that as a magnet for the chakra filled water. This jutsu requires you to keep complete physical contact with the prison." As instructed, Ortho acted.* - Thu Oct 29 00:36:41 2015

Rather than expelling the gust of wind from your lungs and through your mouth, you'll instead allow it to escape your palms." Once the handseals were completed, Ortho would clamp his palms together.

"Basically I wanted to fill you in on what I've been trying to accomplish. Long story short: I'm forming an organization that has a purpose to start a business. This business consists of a few regular Shinobi, one Tailor and one Smith. Said Smith is able to create Armor and Weapon. Once both the Tailor and the Smith get skilled enough, I seek to have them create items and clothing for the shinobi world.

In turn, if all goes to plan, I wish to run the Gezo out of business. If you didn't know, the Gezo Empire is who the Kage's of each major village go to for stuff. Weapons, Armor, everything. Once we run the Gezo out of business, I'm looking to reshape the Shinobi world."* - Thu Oct 29 01:50:56 2015
