<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The guards thing around the village, I agree.. - Fri Nov 27 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: But personal guards 'just' for her..? - Fri Nov 27 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) whispers: You're probably gonna' foster some rebellious thoughts though. - Fri Nov 27 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That's excessive.. - Fri Nov 27 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: There are no personal guards are here. I'd probably recommend the Raikage to have about, two guards tops around her. - Fri Nov 27 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's... still excessive. - Fri Nov 27 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tell you what.. - Fri Nov 27 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Plant a spy.. - Fri Nov 27 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) points to himself.* - Fri Nov 27 07:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You're not even going to consider..? - Fri Nov 27 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: Aren't you fresh out of the academy? - Fri Nov 27 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That's the best part about 'me' being a spy.. - Fri Nov 27 07:25:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: You know. . .Once a spy always a spy. . How do I know, you won't try and sneaky shit? - Fri Nov 27 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Because I'm still a 'little kid' you can kill at any time. - Fri Nov 27 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: I haven't determined your skill set, so I can't really say I could kill you at any time.  - Fri Nov 27 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I hate bitch boys.. - Fri Nov 27 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: Have some confidence in yourself there, Alberto. But, I refuse. There will be no spying. - Fri Nov 27 07:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) whispers: Yo why you so against him getting some game, Takuma? - Fri Nov 27 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: I'm not yo. - Fri Nov 27 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: I even offered the man my condoms. - Fri Nov 27 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm going to go find the Raikage. - Fri Nov 27 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yo, Eiji. - Fri Nov 27 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: What you want? - Fri Nov 27 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Nevermind. - Fri Nov 27 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: And now they're quiet? - Fri Nov 27 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Am I meaningless? - Fri Nov 27 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks over at Akarui. "I apologize," he says in a blunt tone. He didn't intend on causing beef with her, but it was a hostile situation and he acted accordingly. He felt as though he shouldn't even be the one to repent for what he said but he was going to be the bigger person. "I'll sincerely consider your advice and hold my tongue next time around. I hope you won't.. hate me.. like you do the peeper from before."* - Fri Nov 27 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: *It wasn't you - Fri Nov 27 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) did notice the rather despressed state Akarui was in. He truly didn't know what, or how, to question the situation at hand. Should he just ignore it or attempt to talk with her in private. Sogeki seemed to find himself in the most.. tough.. positions when it comes to other people --- maybe he should go back to staying quiet and talking trash to himself.

He releases an audible sigh and physically gestures for her to come stand next to him. "Sometimes.. it's someone that wouldn't judge you or even point a finger at you that makes the nest soul searcher. If you want, you can vent to me."* - Fri Nov 27 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: The Raikage basically called my life worthless for wanting to stand by Kari and help her when she needed it. . . - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: And. .  - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: Everytime Kari stands up for me I feel weird. . . - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: And when people talk mean to her. . . I get mad. - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: And. . and. . - Fri Nov 27 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: And that creep followed me around . . - Fri Nov 27 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: And tried to look up my skirt. . . - Fri Nov 27 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) understood Akarui fully. The last person he wanted to tell him that he was worthless is the Raikage. If anything Sogeki would go to the Raikage for motivation, not to get my self-esteem killed in just a few words. Sogeki sighed and attempted to inch closer to Akarui, making every movement visibly clear that he didn't mean any harm. At that point he'd release an audible sigh and begins to whisper back to her.* - Fri Nov 27 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: D-Don't touch me. - Fri Nov 27 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: I was told if a guy touched me I had to make them marry me. . . - Fri Nov 27 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded toward her request, keeping his arms firmly hitched to his sides.* - Fri Nov 27 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Sometimes things are said in the heat of the moment that can't be taken seriously. What the Raikage said was clearly out of time. You and.. Kari.. have a friendship --- that alone should tell you that you have some form of worth. It takes someone, now a days, a lot to claim someone as a friend. - Fri Nov 27 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: If anything, use this is motivation. - Fri Nov 27 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm not sure if you're the type to drive to get stronger in every way you can, but this is the biggest ego-booster you can get. - Fri Nov 27 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Is that weird feeling I get when she stands up for me just friend- stop. . it has to be. - Fri Nov 27 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: A friend that actually defends you to the max and someone that put you down.. - Fri Nov 27 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That's what you should use as fuel. - Fri Nov 27 08:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks up at the sky and listened to the words over the villages' intercom. He didn't see a problem in what was announced but from what Akarui murmured he knew it wasn't something to be pleasant about. He shrugs a bit, not knowing what to say to Akarui pertaining to Eiyu's words, "uhh.."* - Fri Nov 27 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah. - Fri Nov 27 08:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Good luck. . - Fri Nov 27 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was now chopped liver. "Good talk," he says out loud to himself as he just went back to nonchalantly leaning against the side of the mountain and minding his own business.* - Fri Nov 27 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: So.. Kariudo is her name. - Fri Nov 27 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I automatically won. - Fri Nov 27 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirks.* - Fri Nov 27 08:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: I would have taken my friend with me. - Fri Nov 27 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: I would have realized that I had someone who wanted to help beside me. - Fri Nov 27 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: A new friend that you've just obtained? You'd take them on a possible life or death scenario? - Fri Nov 27 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: - - Fri Nov 27 08:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) allowed her to take his hand. He looked down a bit then met her gaze in a bit of confusion. His head turn from left to right a few times, wanting to make sure no one was around to judge her. "Listen.. how about we go back.. to my place?"

Once his hand was released he'd bit down on his lower lip and hope she don't freak out.* - Fri Nov 27 10:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stepped back some more, digging his hands intro his pockets. He really didn't intend to set her off, his own lust took control and he was going to make it up to her some how.* - Fri Nov 27 10:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: *a boy she had - Fri Nov 27 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her walk over and remained still. It wasn't until he felt his lower chest, upper abdomine, press against hers when his eyes widened. It took him every bit of his soul not to cop a feel --- his respect for her wishes helping him restrain his body. He releases a sigh and nodded.

"Yes, yes.. Of course.. I'm sorry if I've.. made you feel uncomfortable."* - Fri Nov 27 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) simply smiled. He had no reason to object or even think about objecting to what she believed it and wanted. It wasn't his place and he wasn't going to step out of his own box that she placed him in. Be it friends, acquaintance or some guy she knew in the village; it didn't matter. As long as she was comfortable and she knew what she believed in and wanted, Sogeki was fine.

He nods his head, showing the level of understanding he had for her wishes. After the nod he takes it a step further, granting her with a bow as well --- he went as far as dipping his upper body so he was split into a 90 degree angle, showing her the ultimate form of respect with bowing. Rather than lifting his body up to straighten it, he keeps himself bent and spoke:

"I deserve no apology from you Akarui," he says while chuckling. He made a desperate effort to lighten the mood and show her that her way is what he was going to go by. "I am wrong for attempting to sway your mind. I sought out the possibility to open you to new views and I see that you are not comfortable with that but rather comfortable with your way. I hope you can forgive me."

Sogeki remains in that position throughout the entire monologue, only lifting himself up once he was done. He took pats himself off, straightening the fabric of his clothing.  He honestly had a severe form of OCD when it came to that aspect; he was a neat freak from hell. He released a sight through his smile and chuckling, wanting to make sure she understood everything was fine with her beliefs. * - Fri Nov 27 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) figured she cut herself off for a reason so he didn't push the issue. If she looked at him she'd able to tell that he caught on and simply refused to acknowledge it verbally. The most he did was nod his head once and listened to what more she had to say.

"Yes, yes. We don't want you missing your beauty sleep, haha! I won't be able to forgive myself if you end up getting an headache tomorrow morning!"

He begins to wave a bit, bowing only slightly in the process.

"And for the record~," he pauses to chuckle, "what is said and done between us, stays between us!"

With that, he'd straighten his back again and nodded one last time.

"Sweet dreams!"* - Fri Nov 27 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took note of the cough at the end and acted oblivious to her statement.

"Haha, I'll try not to!~" He watches her walk off, biting down on his tongue a bit.* - Fri Nov 27 11:08:35 2015
