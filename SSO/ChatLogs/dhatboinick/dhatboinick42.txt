Once again, he'd slowly go through a set of handseals, making sure that Jehan was able to visually follow along. "The previous jutsu made to form the water in a quick pace a expel it. This one, you're adding more chakra than you are liquefying it. In turn, it'll become a syrup-like substance."* - Thu Nov 12 01:33:52 2015

This time around, however, they were shorter in length than the previous two. "This jutsu isn't of the water affinity, but lightning. The process is similar when it comes to gathering chakra, but instead of liquefying it you will have to allow it to vigorously vibrate. That vibration will turn into a surge. That surge will be at your disposal."* - Thu Nov 12 01:56:03 2015

"You know where my settlement is; stop by whenever you can and we'll train. I'm in a rush now and decided to just pop in and say hey.. Send a messenger bird if you need anything."

With that Ortho would turn on his heels and walk off.* - Thu Nov 12 03:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: I-I've never seen her around before. . . - Thu Nov 12 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood before everyone with two bottles of sake in his grasp and a blunt chilling in the right corner of his mouth. There was an occasional discharge of smoke from his nostrils from the intake of the blunt, but nothing too hard that would be seen as a hard hit. Every now and then he'd raise the liquor bottle to his mouth and take a few gulps, three at one time. He didn't have his usual battle clothing on; he was rather casual in his settlement. He wore an open chest, sleeveless, black jacket. His pants sagged a bit, stopping just below his boxers' waistband. His arm wrapping were still being worn and so was his arm guards. Ortho was just chill for the most part.

Jehan's words didn't fall on deaf ears, but they weren't verbally acknowledged. The most Ortho did was glance at the female he whispered about then shrugged. Ortho had to give Jehan props; he had good taste in women if Eri baffled him so easily. "Anyways, Ishi. You're free to stay here as long as you please. Whatever happens here, however, stays here. Nothing about this place should be discussed to the outside world. Trust is the key to this paradise. Make sure you don't lose it."* - Thu Nov 12 03:28:12 2015

Making his way towards Eri, he'd stand in front of her, waiting to see of she'd take her earbuds out. If she did, he'd finally speak up, "Yo, I'm Jehan. . .haven't seen you around before."  unsure if he was following what Ortho had said, he'd throw his hands into his pockets, keeping an apathetic face, waiting to see if she'd reply.*)* - Thu Nov 12 03:56:22 2015

Ortho would lean his head closer to Eri's, having his ear get into zone of the music's volume; expecting that it was loud enough. Once hearing the beat she was bumping to, he'd begin bopping his head in rhythm. Still, he said nothing.* - Thu Nov 12 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued to bounce his head to the beat. When he noticed that she turned up the volume to make it easier on him, he did a daring move of inching just a little bit closer. He masks this movement by subtly leaning his head so he had a clear sight of what she was using to play the music; a show of interest of what she liked in music and technology. To take things a step further, he'd subtly reach for the ruffles on her skirt, feeling the material while making sure not to make physical contact with her body directly. After a second or two, he releases it and pulled his hand away.* - Thu Nov 12 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had the ability to retract his hand, but purposely let her grab it. At this point he submitted to her momentary dominus stature, letting her feel that she was in completely control of everything dealing with his moment. No words were said from Ortho, he simply nods his head and waited for her to let go of his wrist. Once she did, he'd slowly pull it back to his person and continue to rhythmically bounce his head to her music.* - Thu Nov 12 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took notice of the tension and subtly inched back. Eri was the domina of her personal space and Ortho was going to respect that. He continues to bounce to the music, despite the volume distance from her slight distance creator. He didn't know the name of the song nor did he ever hear it before, but it was actually to his liking. "Not bad, not bad," he murmurs to himself. He knew that Eri couldn't hear him, but he still said it.* - Thu Nov 12 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't have the earbuds in, so the shout didn't do much to startle him. If anything, the shout was normal in volume. All Ortho did was pick up the device after it fell to the ground and subtly offer it to Eri. He looks up at her, saying nothing. He went as far as using his other hand to gesture that everything was okay and safe.* - Thu Nov 12 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I see, I see. - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stands to his feet, dusting himself off once he had a steady footing. "Alright, alright. I'm going to say this once and once only; this is my settlement and I want whatever beef you two have to be settled.. now,' said Ortho. His voice was calm as well, but also demanding.* - Thu Nov 12 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: No beef, i like him. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Naoya. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Step outside of the settlement. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: It's even more stupid that way. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And you didn't beat me, I had you on the run. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I could of killed you, but i don't do finishers like that. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's your problem. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: Not a problem. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It is now. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This is that pervert's settlement? - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Akira, are you gonna handle him? - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Of course. - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Damn, what a shame. - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I just came for knowledge. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Exactly. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like you did me. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Leave or prepare yourself. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I'm already prepared. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Good. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) backs up a few feet.* - Thu Nov 12 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...My jacket and NinjaTunes.... - Thu Nov 12 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Hmph. - Thu Nov 12 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) thinks: Shitty guards.. - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) thinks: Sounds normal. - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reacted. A set of handseals was weaved together, the speed at which they were formed seemed like a blur to the naked eye. From that point, Ortho took a few steps forward before crouching down and slamming his hands atop the ground. As a result, in almost an instant, a massive dome is formed around Naoya. The explosion from the tag was intended on being caught as well, resulting in Naoya and the tag both being trapped with no normal means out.* - Thu Nov 12 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's movements continued. His body weight lessened in an instant, causing his movements to be higher in pace and smoother. Just before he reached the side of the dome, he jumps and glides upward until eventually floating to the top of the dome. At that point, Ortho's weaves together a series of handseals. His connection with the dome releases and in turn the earth crumbles. Of course, before it crumbled, Akira's explosive tag went off.

By time the dome was to be destroyed, Ortho would unleash a massive fireball down on Naoya.* - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glides back to the ground, folding his arms across his chest.

"Anyways.."* - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Were you..... - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Flying? - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks from Eri to Akira then back to Eri. He shrugs his shoulders, momentarily closing his eyes and lowering his head. "Yeah, you can say I was flying."* - Thu Nov 12 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced off to the side * - Thu Nov 12 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained at the side. He was a known medic in Sunagakure and only in Sunagakure. Unless Akira asked if there was one around in Shinkogakure, Ortho would keep quiet.* - Thu Nov 12 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He unravels his arms from across his chest, preparing his chakra from now. He paces toward Akira, viewing the injury as he closed in. Ortho slowly shook his head, seeing that the fuss was over a mere kunai gash. Ortho hovers his palms over Akira's shoulder and guides his chakra to the wound. At this point, the wound would begin to close until eventually being closed up.

"The poison is out of my control. Buy a healing pill and let the effects run its course," says Ortho in a stern tone. Just as he completed that statement Ortho's attention was altered. His gaze set upon Paine's and immediately he knew something was wrong. Paine was able to accomplish amazing feats in Taijutsu, a physically straining battle art; seeing her like this almost tore him apart.. almost.

"I've.. heard of Katsune and met with her before, but I haven't seen her in almost a [IC] month now. What's wrong Paine?" Ortho inches toward Paine.* - Thu Nov 12 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) closes his eyes and his head lowers. Everything Paine said, he knew about. The whole aspect of Kilm's death and the cause Ortho was already aware about, but he didn't know Paine was affiliated with them in any way. A sigh escapes Ortho as he continues to inch closer to the female, crouching down to her kneeling level so he can be face to face with her. He had no words for what she had to say so he places his hands on her shoulders, looks at her for a few seconds then pulls her into a hug. Something he learned recently is that sometimes words aren't enough; a hug from a loved one is all it takes for you to center your mind and just think things through in silence.

Ortho wraps his left arm behind Paine and places his right hand behind her head, allowing her to sob on his shoulder. It wasn't until a good five minutes of her sobbing when he decided to speak to her in a hushed tone.

"When it's a loved one that kills another loved one, there is nothing you can really do. You must understand that once two loved ones but heads, they have to settle it in their own way. You, as the middle person, will end up postponing the inevitable. It's not the fact that you weren't there to stop them, that's out of your control. What you need to do is put it into your mind that your two loved ones, even if one or both are no longer here, settled their beef. In this situation, it's not your burden.. it's Katsune's.. All you can do, Paine, his keep your head up, allow your emotions to pour and keep walking down 'your' path."* - Thu Nov 12 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) heard what Paine had to say and understood. Her words were from the heart; a broken heart from a person in sorrow. Once upon a time Ortho was in that position and it wasn't even that long ago his angel floated down with her look of understanding and lack of biased thinking to help him further down his path. He remains a comforting pillow for Paine for as long as he needed. Currently he was pushed back a bit and allowed to glare into her eyes.

"Look around, Paine. Look where your path led you to. This is a place of serenity and peace, nothing more and nothing less. Accept this place as your home and I promise you that I will be you compass. Allow your path to merge with mine, Paine.. and you won't have to worry about sorrow every again.."* - Thu Nov 12 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) lifts Paine up off her feet and carries her off.* - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks out the house and paced to the side of the main group, saying nothing.* - Thu Nov 12 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Could it be considered a phenomena that shinobi all across this world can be centered in one place and find some bit of peace? Could it be considered a miracle that once arriving in that one place that their minds will be centered once again and their bodies would relax from its on guard tension? Or is this all trickery of what's truly to come? Many people question the purpose of Shinkogakure and its leader, but what more can they ask for? The main residence of Shinkogakure are refugees, most have experienced their fair share of pain, sorrow, betrayal and confusion.

What was the true purpose of Ortho creating this village? Was it for him to escape and center himself? Or was it truly to help others in the same predicament as him? Why is it all of a sudden that he seeks to have as much people around him to train and grow together when a few days ago, close to a [IC] week, all he cared about was being alone with just one or two other people in his immediate vicinity? What was the true purpose of Shinkogakure? What was it that made this village the.. ideal.. place for Ortho and the possible main attraction for a select few? Despite their skepticism a few stayed and allowed to feeling of ease to seep into their pours and marinate with their bones. Even if they wanted to leave, the feeling they got once here would only force them back.

Ortho was no saint, that's an automatic given. Ortho was neither a person that emitted hope and determination, those days were long gone. Right about now, Ortho only released the feeling of truth and logic. Truth in his words and what he believed in and logic to back up what he said and preached. This village was the ideal vacation spot. This village was the one you go to away from your home and just relaxed. Where you can have people from different countries and beliefs sit down at one table and laugh. They can laugh in freedom and not judged because the laughter was not at one another, but with one another. They can actually talk about things that wouldn't and practically couldn't lead to a life threatening battle. This was just the place to be when you just wanted to get away.

Ortho released an audible sigh. He leans his head back, the tree behind him preventing his neck from being extended all the way. Still, at this angle, Ortho was able to comfortably set his gaze on the sky. Currently the sky was a dimming orange, the sun illuminating as much as it could before nightfall. The birds were chirping still and a few swooped overhead every now and then, getting their last bit of fun before easing down in their respective nests. A smirk creeps on his face at the sight of the birds. He didn't know why by for a well-known snake summoner, the birds managed to cast a warm feeling in him.

Maybe it was because of their freedom. These everyday birds didn't have to worry about being betrayed by their siblings, blood or water. They didn't have to worry about traveling long distances by foot or slow caravans, nor did they have to worry about the potential war if one thing was said the wrong way unintentionally. The birds had complete freedom and balance in their life, something Ortho longed for since he first left Konohagakure when the massive Iron-Sand Raccoon attacked. Back then nothing made sense to Ortho. Back then it was just "run or die", but he was never given a clear answer on where to run to. A lot of times he felt like he should just remain stationary and accept his death with open arms; bear hug it and even attempt to plant a kiss on its cheek.

Another sigh is sounded from Ortho, the last bit of light in the sky vanishing over the walls of his village. At this time of night all the shop owners were closing their buildings. They didn't have to put up protective shutters, the trust that they upheld for another made them feel like shutters would be disrespect to the next shop owner. That's one thing Ortho wanted to make clear in Shinkogakure: trust is the key and that key should never be lost. As the shop owners walked down the main street of the settlement they made sure to announce their departures and goodbyes to Ortho. One thing Ortho did was make sure he never said "goodbye", it was always "see you later".

Chuckles and audible laughter was always given to Ortho when he said that. Everyone took it as a joke and him just being a 'deep person', but this was something he wanted to live be thoroughly. This was something that Ortho wanted to stitch into the minds of everyone that reside in Shinkogakure. Here, there was no goodbye, only a see you later. To Ortho, however, the see you later weren't even guaranteed. It was something that was said at the time because it felt right rather than mentally processed and assuringly felt. Back then, the first time he actually said it, Ortho was just trying to come to terms with his feelings.

Ortho slides down to his butt, using the tree to lean on in the process. His legs are stretched out in front of his and his arms are momentarily at chest level. A quick set of handseals are woven together, his right palm gently tapping on the ground next to him. A small puff of smoke spawns and from within it was four full bottles of sake. Ortho looks down at the bottles, releases another sigh and takes one into his grasp. He pops off the cork and brings the bottle to his mouth. Rather than gulping the sake like he'd usually do, he'd take in a mouthful and down it little by little. A slight grunt came from him due to the strength of the liquor as the last bit was swallowed. He leans his head back again and stares at the night sky, "wonder when it's my time to go.."* - Thu Nov 12 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noticed Eri walking off. He stands up, keeps his bottle of sake gripped and paced off after her. She was the only people he didn't have verbal communication with here thus far and it was only fair as the leader that he made that attempt.* - Thu Nov 12 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hey.. - Thu Nov 12 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had one hand tucked in his pants pocket and the other gripping a bottle of sake. "You and I haven't been properly introduced. I guess that's my fault."* - Thu Nov 12 08:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: No..? - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, okay then.. - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Name's Ortho. - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head once. "Pleasure, Supaiku. Sorry about.. all that with that one guy and Akira.. That's not what usually goes down here."* - Thu Nov 12 08:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckles a bit. "You're right. It's a baby compared to the other villages."* - Thu Nov 12 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn...  - Thu Nov 12 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes a hit off his sake, rolling his eyes in the process.

"You remind me of someone I know, haha.. Someone so impatient but.. mellow.. Ease yourself and allow me to get to know you."* - Thu Nov 12 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hell no. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Fuck that. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I said mellow, not crazy. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn... a past lover then. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..N-No.. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A close friend that passed on too soon. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Liar? Haha, I'm being honest. - Thu Nov 12 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A past lover.. is not it.. - Thu Nov 12 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still request your audience. I do seek to get to know you just a bit.. - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Cute.. - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) followed.* - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched her in shock. His facial expression didn't really show the shock, but still.. this was an unusual sight. "So," he says in an attempt to overlook what she was doing. He takes a quick sip of his sake and continues speak, "any specific reason you came here? Was it the 'free training' part?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Your honesty is much appreciated. I've only heard one other person say they were tired of Konoha. Of course they are a leading reason as to why I decided to build Shinkogakure," he says in a soft but audible voice. His eyes continued to watch Eri's movements up until the sap began to pour out. He gave a nod to commend her, not even he, a person that lives in the wilderness, knew how to do that. "Are you looking to possibly make Shinkogakure your steady home? Or at least a proper resting place?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods a few times. He walks off to a tree and sits down at the base of the trunk, stretching his left leg out while bending his right leg at the knee. He casually rests his right arm on his right knee while holding the bottle of sake. Every now and then he'd take a few sips then place his arm back. "Are you looking to even travel outside of the Fire Country or is this it for you?" Ortho's question was actually something he wanted an answer to. Maybe if she answered with something interesting he'd be able to put her to use.* - Thu Nov 12 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you drink..? - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Smoke.. - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ? - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Those sound rather personal. - Thu Nov 12 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh right, you are a doctor. - Thu Nov 12 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls a blunt out of his jacket pocket and held up it and his bottle of sake. "Wish to join me?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the blunt on his lap and the bottle on the ground beside him. He forms a single handseal, a puff of smoke spawning to his right. From behind the smoke came a come of him. Both it and Ortho make their way to Eri, Ortho making sure to carry his blunt and pick the sake up. The clone would reach out for the bottle while Ortho went to sit at the base of that tree. "Come, come. Take a seat."* - Thu Nov 12 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The clone took grasp of the bottle before Eri let it go, assuring her that it wasn't going to let it go. Ortho, while that transaction was going on, lights the blunt and hands it to Eri; yes, he was allowing her to go first. Meanwhile, Ortho takes a solid swig off of the bottle then places it in front of Eri. "This.. is actually the first time I've had someone to drink and smoke with.. Feels different," he says in a 'wow' tone.* - Thu Nov 12 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had to respect Eri's usage of the blunt. He may have never been able to sit with someone and smoke, but he has soon others share a blunt; the disrespect to the rotation alone made Ortho a bit annoyed. He slowly shakes his head at that thought, bringing the blunt to his lips and taking a subtle hit at first. Unlike Eri, he doesn't hold the smoke in for the second hit, he expels it in portions. Between the first and second release of smoke, he'd take the second hit; this hit was a bit harder than the first. As he passed the blunt back to Eri he'd form a set of handseals.

He pats the ground between them and allowed even more bottles of sake to be summoned. A slight smirk crept on his face at that sight, "not really. More pot and liquor for me, but the company is welcomed.. as long as the company know what they're doing."* - Thu Nov 12 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs. Eri was right, but wasn't right enough to where she'd get a solid answer from him. "Shinobi life is a killer." If Eri refused to get drunk then he was going to get her high as shit. He had plenty more blunts where that one came from and way more sake that was yet to be unsealed. He lets her keep the blunt, slowly shaking his head at her offer to return to him. Instead, he opens a completely new bottle of sake while subtly pushing the rest more in front of her. "And you..? What got you started in this 'rebel' act of smoking and drinking?"* - Thu Nov 12 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but laugh a little. "Ahh, you're a good girl. Twelve is modest as hell," he says throughout the laughter. He brings his own bottle of sake and takes a drink; two to be exact. "I started when I nine..? Eight? I used to play this game with my classmates when our parents were on missions."* - Thu Nov 12 10:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "I think after a while I got a high tolerance for it all. I take it you're still a learner?" He smirks while looking at Eri through his peripherals, wanting to see her reaction to what he just said.* - Thu Nov 12 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grows wider. "I can bet you're still a learner. Hell, probably not even a learner."* - Thu Nov 12 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) got quiet for a moment. He slowly shook his head, trying with all his might to hold back his laughter. "And what exactly makes me immature in your mind?"* - Thu Nov 12 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Either that or to get me to smoke and drink more out of irritation. - Thu Nov 12 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help it now, he releases a bit of laughter and slowly shakes his head again. "I wouldn't call that immature, just having fun rather than making this some business meeting type thing. Is that bad?"* - Thu Nov 12 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So this is business then. - Thu Nov 12 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Possibly, unless you plan on lightening up just a tad bit and have fun. That'll make this all worth wild." He brings the bottle to his mouth and takes a few gulps, purposely lowering the content to half full.* - Thu Nov 12 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't know you, why would I lighten up? I don't even know if you are a Konoha shinobi. - Thu Nov 12 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed his bottle of sake on the ground beside him. He reaches over to his right arm and pulls down as much of his bandages as he can. It didn't really take much effort for him to reveal his Konohagakure insignia tattoo. It was red and black; black for insignia alone and red for the blood-like drawing seeping from it.* - Thu Nov 12 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Born there, raised there. - Thu Nov 12 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: As for you lightening up, if I wanted to harm you.. I wouldn't be sharing my drink and blunt. - Thu Nov 12 10:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's just me being honest with you.~ - Thu Nov 12 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow. At first he didn't know where she got the 'hiding' aspect from, but then it clicked in his head. His slight cheerful expression altered to a more serious one for the moment. He takes this moment to unwrap more of his arm to reveal what was left of his tattoos. From afar, it looked like massive body art.. but up close the deep scars and patchy skin could be noticed; not even ink can hide that.

"Not hiding that.. I take pride in being a Konohagakure shinobi. Just other things that could be exploited by my enemies in battle."* - Thu Nov 12 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Takes so fucking long. - Thu Nov 12 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Thanks for your permission," he says jokingly, a smirk forming back on his face. He wraps his arm up again, but made sure to leave the insignia in sight. "Better?"* - Thu Nov 12 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes another drink. "Your turn.~"* - Thu Nov 12 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: My turn? - Thu Nov 12 10:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're the first to see my arm up close.. other than the person that placed the scars there. - Thu Nov 12 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it my attempt to gain your trust. - Thu Nov 12 10:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why would you show me something so special? - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Not even your sister or lovers have seen such a thing, that's just... - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly..? I got it from protecting them.. well, most.. of them. - Thu Nov 12 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why show them the end result that may make them feel like a burden? - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But why show -me-, you said why but it's just not a good enough reason. - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is it not good enough cause it's truly.. not good enough, or can you not just accept my reasoning? - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's honestly my attempt to gain your trust. - Thu Nov 12 11:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Atta girl.~ - Thu Nov 12 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't show any sign of amusement in what she had to say. It wasn't that he was judging her, but being respective for her secret. "May I.. ask you something?"* - Thu Nov 12 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 12 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you regret it..? - Thu Nov 12 11:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head.* - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still want to show you something.. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know that sounds insane. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We're shinobi. Nothing should sound -insane-. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I've gained your trust by telling you I killed my parents and don't regret it. You didn't ask why I did it, but yet you trust me now. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We're able to spawn fire in our stomach and not burn from the inside out.- - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I didn't ask you that because that's your past. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you believe that then you are naive. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Asking you that is like asking you to relive something you don't want to remember. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Who says I don't want to remember it? - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You are making quite a lot of assumptions. - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you call me insane? Haha, you gained my trust by telling me something no one else probably knows. Not what you told me, just the fact that I know. - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides, assumptions makes this fun. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A lot.. more fun. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Because then you learn more about me by me correcting you. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, ma'am.~ - Thu Nov 12 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) downs a few more gulps of the sake, subtly shaking the bottle and listening to its hollow sound.* - Thu Nov 12 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. I want to show you something.. then you tell me if you feel anything from seeing it. - Thu Nov 12 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright? - Thu Nov 12 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "People with low stock recycle the last bit, toss it and I'll give you another in a second." As he says this, he'd lean in closer to Eri just a bit. His movements were intentionally slow and subtle, wanting her to feel completely safe and as relaxed as possible. "Tell me when you're ready."* - Thu Nov 12 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans in just a bit more, nearly having their nose touch. His movements continued their slow and subtle pace. He places his right index finger under her chin and momentarily closes his eyes. He takes in a deep breath through his nose, holding it for a few seconds. When it came time to exhale, his eye lids slowly open as the air was released from his nostrils. His normally black pupils was now crimson red with a single tomoe swirling around a black circle.* - Thu Nov 12 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) backs up a bit, examining her expression intently. The look he gave her made him knew what was going down in her mind and what could possibly be the outcome of this all. He releases a sigh, looking down a bit. "Well?"* - Thu Nov 12 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's face actually turned red a bit. "It's the.. uhh.. Ryu," he says in equal tone as Eri. "I don't agree with the name, but that's what I hear people call it.."* - Thu Nov 12 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip. He was asked that question a few times before, but never knew how to properly answer without leaving more questions in the person's mind. "..Simply put, it's your birth right.. This is something you achieve once you're mind is ready."* - Thu Nov 12 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There goes the questions, right on cue. Ortho looks down a bit, scratching the back of his head and sighing once more. "That attraction you feel once you see it, that lets me know if your blood thrives for it. It's a craving feeling and once you see it, you can't stop craving it until you've achieved it yourself. Even though, however, you want more from it.. I showed you this because I wanted to see if you have that pontential thrust.. Who I am.. has already been stated."* - Thu Nov 12 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks up at Eri and shrugs his shoulders a bit, "call it a hunch? I mean, I guess it's more to it than a wild guess, but I don't know how to explain it. The best I can come up with is 'attraction'. Instantly noticing you and thinking 'hmm, I'm sure she has the potential'." * - Thu Nov 12 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Once again everything was on cue. This was all deja vu for Ortho, and it could never get old. He was pushed down to the ground, Eri straddling him and a kunai to his neck. He slowly raised his hands for her to see. "I understand, Eri.. I understand. You're craving it, you're wondering if everything about you is a lie and you're wondering if this is all fuckery wrapped up in a bag and thrown at your face. Listen to me.. I can help you find your way to it.. I can quench your thirst.."* - Thu Nov 12 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls himself up, altering their positions just a bit. She remained on his lap, but he was just sitting up. The words she spoke, the emotions that guided each syllable and the pain that ended each sentence; all of it was comprehended. He didn't know how her exact pain felt like, but pain was still a comparative between them. His arms slowly fold around her waist, making sure that she was physically and mentally aware of his movements.

"I'm not going to sit here and say what they kept from you is for your own good," he starts off. His tone was hushed and calm, an attempt to ease her I mind. "Nor am I going to say that they were right for doing it. But here you are, Eri. Here you are exposed to it when it's not too late. What you see in my eyes is your destiny, yes.. but that doesn't mean you should've been told or shown sooner than today. As much completion you feel from achieving these eyes is as much misunderstanding they grant. You're able to see things from a different perspective and if you don't have that level of understanding of your own path before achieving it, you'll end up self-destructing.."

Ortho subtly reaches up with his right hand, gently takes Eri's chin with his index and thumb and inches her head down for her to look him in the eyes again. "They are a double edged sword if you achieve them too early, Eri. Take my word for it. I've met someone to achieve them before their time and they self-destructed mentally, physically and spiritually within days.."* - Thu Nov 12 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Bingo.

Ortho shifts again. He leans forward completely, loosening his hold around Eri's waist just a bit. With his lean forward and the slack hold, Eri would now her back, staring up at Ortho who was now hovering over her. His hands were firmly planted into the grass, helping him refrain from crushing Eri with his body weight; he didn't know what she could handle. This went from a moment of her staring down on him after realizing more chapters to her destiny, to him staring down at her to see if this was the common case of 'power achieved too early'.

There was silence between them two. Ortho leans his head in more, allowing the tips of their noses to make constant contact. His singular tear drop eyes meeting hers, a potential staring contest underway.* - Thu Nov 12 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

There was a level of understanding at this point. Ortho went through the same thing when he first activated his ocular prowess and it took him days on end to fully regain his peace of mind. He had no one but a little sister to aid him, and even then she was too busy on trying to unlock her own birth right. The thing about this achievement is: it takes a lot of time to grasp and understand. Once you see through its lenses, you can't back out and you don't want to back out. It was just something that you get addicted to instantly, no matter what.

Ortho's eyes widened to full capacity. He took this opportunity to break Eri out of whatever trance she was in. A quick surge of chakra is sent to the ocular portion of his brain. As a result, the single tomoe that resided within his crimson red pupils twirled. Once it came to a complete stop, it settled in its rightful place; the top right of his black inner pupil. If this attempt was successful, some form of verbal or physical reaction would be made. "Talk to me, Eri.."* - Thu Nov 12 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded to himself, understanding that Eri had the intense trance like Nina; one that couldn't be broken manually. Eri had to make it run its course. A sigh escapes Ortho as once again they switched position. He takes her by her limp arms and pulled her up as she restraddled him. This time around, with caution, he'd lie back down on her back and pulled her on top. He kept eye contact with her threw each movement; not even he wanted to break that. With her now on top of him, there was nothing more for him to do but to wait.* - Thu Nov 12 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inched further past the gates of his settlement. He wore a more casual outfit compared to his usual attire. A simple black sleeveless jacket that was open to expose his bare frontal body, arms wraps on both arms, black pants that sagged slightly under his boxers' waistband and black shoes. Ortho's right arm was noticeably more exposed compared to his left arm; he purposely made it that way so his tattoo of Konoha's insignia can be exposed to the naked eye. For the most part, Ortho didn't look like, by his attire, that he was prepared for battle.

"Can't get rid of me that fast Kana," he says in a hushed tone. It was loud enough for her to hear, but still hushed. "Well..?"* - Thu Nov 12 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"We have a score to settle. One last battle, one last round about, one last.. war."* - Thu Nov 12 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) (*Redrum, Ortho slowly shook his head.

"We have a score to settle. One last battle, one last round about, one last.. war."*)* - Thu Nov 12 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) formed a quick set of handseals. His chakra fluxes forth after quickly manifesting within his stomach. Within a split second, with his lips puckered slightly, Ortho unleashes a massive fireball.* - Thu Nov 12 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took the lesser road traveled by. Yes, the mask of the steam was attractive, but this wasn't a game of cat and mouse. Ortho forms another succession of handseals are woven together and just as the vortex came to clash into him, Ortho crouches and plants his hands into the grass. At that moment, a massive dome of earth erects from the ground and completely covers him. In turn, the vortex clash with that.

Meanwhile, while within the confinements of his dome, Ortho bites down on his right thumb and smears the blood in his opposing palm. More handseals are then woven together and yet another pat of the ground was made. From there, there was silence.* - Thu Nov 12 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The momentary break of battle between them is all Ortho needed. His connection with the dome was released and the earth began to crumble down. In that instance, Ortho bends at the knees and hops. Rather than falling back down, he continues to rise higher and higher into the air; it was as if he had absolutely no weight and gravity didn't even exist. Handseals are quickly strung together and his lungs began to fill to their max capacity.

Ortho puckers his lips once more, lowering his head to stare down at Kana and unleash a massive gust of wind. The intention was to momentarily daze the female, leaving an opening for something completely different.* - Thu Nov 12 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's own ocular prowess deactivates, slowly transitioning back into its normal pitch black shade. He keeps his visual attention on Eri; it was a matter of how she would take this level of realization rather than what she'd do with it. There were stages to this and quite frankly Ortho didn't know exactly what stage Eri was on. Silence was a given and understandable, but this level of silence only made more questions run across Ortho's mind. It's that same understanding why we remained still and quiet, not daring to speak and break whatever concentration and train of thought Eri was experiencing. The only form of movement that came from Ortho was his chest and stomach slowly expanding and retracting from his subtle breath intake and exhale of breath; nothing more.* - Thu Nov 12 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The groan was good enough.

Ortho release an audible sigh, slowly shaking his head. He still didn't know if he did the right thing by showing her his eyes, but it didn't matter now. The only thing he can do now is subtly question her, help her make conclusions of what's going on and how to comprehend it all. "How.. are you feeling," he asks in a hushed tone.
* - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls Eri in again, taking her by the waist and wrapping his arms around her; intent on comforting her through this entire process. "Say it again.. Louder, let me hear you." He looks at her, narrowing his eyes a bit. "Tell me what you're feeling, Eri."* - Thu Nov 12 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks, leaning his head to the side a bit and returning an answer within a whisper. "I say we did a good job at keeping it completely professional. Just the everyday change of perspective of our lives, same old same old.~" * - Thu Nov 12 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods. "It could be way worse. You on my lap is one thing, copping feels were to the minimum.. surprisingly."* - Thu Nov 12 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) holds Eri a bit tighter, as if trying to pull her in even more. "Rest, I have nowhere to be."* - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. "Alright, then tell me what you're thinking. Even if it doesn't make sense, tell me."* - Thu Nov 12 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Like I understand everything but nothing at the same time. - Thu Nov 12 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So you understand somethings, but others you dont? - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No it feels like I understand everything around me but like I dont another layer to them. - Thu Nov 12 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: What do you see with them..? - Thu Nov 12 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: What.. does it look like to you? - Thu Nov 12 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You look.... so bright. - Thu Nov 12 21:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: ..She.. said darker... - Thu Nov 12 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but chuckle.* - Thu Nov 12 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: And now..? With it off? What do you see? - Thu Nov 12 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Do you feel like you see things differently? - Thu Nov 12 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Everything feels dim.... slow... - Thu Nov 12 21:49:52 2015

"And why not?"* - Thu Nov 12 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reaches for Paine's hand, attempting to grab it. If she allowed him, he'd lead her out of the settlement.

"Lets talk more about it. I can tell you have more on your chest."* - Fri Nov 13 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leads Paine down the river. He finds a good spot by a tree and sits down, giving her a subtle smile. "Do you trust me, Paine?"* - Fri Nov 13 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: is...t-there a r-reason...w-why i s-shouldnt? - Fri Nov 13 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There was many forms of comfort in this world. There was verbal comfort, mental comfort and physical comfort. Right now Paine was grieving and trying to come to mends with her own peace of mind about the death of Kilm and the cause of Kilm's death. It's for that reason why Ortho placed everything he had planned on hold and make time for Paine; just him and her. As she was descending to sit by him, he'd subtly stop her and pat his lap.

"Come here, Paine.. Let me comfort you while you express yourself to me. You deserve to have someone to just listen to you."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wraps his arms around Paine's waist, pulling her in as close as possible. He allows her to lean back against him and simply talked to her hearts content. Ortho, while behind Paine, would just comfortingly rub his hand up and down her leg, nodding every now and then to show that he was listening intently.

"There are a few people that I have lost in this world, Paine. All of these people were lost while I was off doing my own thing. Out of all those deaths, I felt the same thing as you're feeling now. I soon had to realize what my motives were though. I was trying to make myself stronger so I'd be able to stand side by side with them and walk down their path. Now, as I look back at it, I realize that I needed to walk down 'my' path, not theirs. You were absent during their beef, yes.. but you have to understand that you have nothing to do with it. You would've made a little difference, that's true.. but if they truly wanted to kill each other then they would've waited until you were just a tad bit distracted.. Trust me, Paine.. your grievance is completely understood and I'm here for you.. But as someone that sincerely cares about you, it's not fair for yourself to carry that burden."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly retracted his hand, not wanting Paine to feel uncomfortable. It was clear that he was new to this entire comforting thing, he was doing what he thought was best to help her. After pulling his hand back he'd wrap his arm back around her waist and just left it there; he honestly didn't mean to make her feel uncomfortable.

"You are never wrong for thinking of your own progression," he says while leaning his head forward a bit. "You are your own person and just like everyone else, you used someone to find your own way. Mistakes were made in the past by you, but you're not to blame for any of this. Zetsumo led you down his path while forgetting to keep the flashlight out of your hands. With that flashlight, you managed to break away from him and everything else and turn on to a road that's best for you. Paine, trust me when I say this: you are not in the wrong here. You're not a hypocrite, you're just a person on your own path."

Ortho takes a moment for his words to sink in before starting again.

"I've made plenty of mistakes because I was on someone else path, and here I am now. I am known for be a murderer, but I still manage to put everything aside for you, someone I care so much for. This is just an example of what we have to go through to assure our own selves, Paine. Take it out of your mind that everything is your fault because you sought power. Everyone seeks power and everyone makes mistakes in the process of gaining that power. Katsune and Kilm sought their own form of power and Katsune used Kilm as a stepping stone to achieve that power. You have nothing to do with that."* - Fri Nov 13 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pats Paine's leg and unwraps his arms from around her waist. "Sorry.. if I made you feel any type of way.. I didn't mean to."* - Fri Nov 13 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Remember my settlement is open to you at any time. - Fri Nov 13 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: a-alright - Fri Nov 13 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stands to his feet, momentarily picking Paine up. He places her down on her feet and smiles at her. "Also.. you know you don't have to be nervous around me, right?"* - Fri Nov 13 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gives a wide grin. "I'm always safe!" With that, he'd subtly wave at her. "I'm going to head to my settlement, stop by at any time," he says while walking.* - Fri Nov 13 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was facing the other direction by now, so there was no way for him to catch the look on Paine's face. The sigh, howeverm was noted and registered; something he'd bring up at a later date. For now, Ortho gives her one last wave before hopping and soreing through the skies.* - Fri Nov 13 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || A oddly shaped shadow can be seen casting over the generic area. If anyone was to look up at the skies, they'd see a single solid figure hovering high above their heads. With the proper vision, they can tell it was Ortho and he had his arms folded across his chest. He was actually chilling midair like he was standing on the ground. His focus wasn't on the people below him, but the generic area. Still, however, he did keep tabs just in case some asshole threw a jutsu at him.* - Fri Nov 13 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turns his head from left to right, subtly scanning the area for something.. or someone. Recent reports said that Yan of the Sand accepted Ortho's challenge and was due to show up soon. Whether or not Yan was a man of his words, Ortho didn't know. The only thing Ortho held true though the reports was Yan is from Sunagakure and Ortho only trusted a select few from that village; Yan wasn't one of them. "Where are you, yo'? I don't have time to fucking play games.."* - Fri Nov 13 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Alright.. - Fri Nov 13 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They're not showing up any time soon. - Fri Nov 13 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Might as well get things started in Shinko.. - Fri Nov 13 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) begins his descent to the ground. His arms remained folded across his chest and his gaze was already fixed on the generic area, his main line of sight switching from person to person. "How is everyone doing today?"* - Fri Nov 13 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "I'm fine, everyone.. Thanks for asking," he says while slowly shaking his head. "Anyways, I was thinking and decided that bringing this up to you guys is better than just assuming. A little bird once told me that assuming only makes the other person correct you. That being said, I'd like to make you all official shinobi of Shinkogakure. I will be handing out missions and I will be rewarding you guys generously. This idea is not a demand, but something I actually hold high expectations for in the name of.. progressing.. this village."* - Fri Nov 13 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Alright, one out of three, better than nothing," he says with a nod. "Very well, Akira. I wish you the best on your travels, Akira." Ortho glances over at Eri, but says nothing to her. "All of you, if you choose to change your mind are free to come and go as you please. I am running a place of peace and legitimacy, not a slave village."* - Fri Nov 13 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zombie(ZenoKuthric) says: u die with me - Fri Nov 13 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods. "Alright. Listen, I have someone to.. meet. I'll be back in a [IC] day or two." With that, Ortho would begin trailing off unless stopped.* - Fri Nov 13 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Hmph. . more time to practice then. - Fri Nov 13 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in gratitude.* - Fri Nov 13 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would remain stationary, not bothering to take a step forward or back. Yan's approach was thoroughly analyzed, but not with Ortho's sharingan. A level was respect was formed for Yan so of course he didn't second guess the male's words. A nod was given from Ortho to Yan, both a signal of greetings and possible farewell.

Handseals are immediately strung; the pace at which they were formed could be a blur to the untrained eye. Ortho's chakra kneads and expands out, covering the immediate area before Konohagakure's gates. With that, as soon as the handseals were completed, Ortho crouches and firmly plants his hands atop the ground. As a result, a earth-based dome is formed around Yan's person and an attempt to completely capture him.

Following that series of handseals came another set. Ortho remains in his crouching position and continued his outpour of kneaded chakra. Once again, after the second set of handseals were completed, his slam his hands on the ground. This time around, however, a multitude of spikes erupt from the ground, aimed to travel toward Yan's location, which was suspected to be in the dome at this point. These spikes were formed and spawned from the ground so as Yan remained in the dome Ortho hoped that one of the spikes would pierce through Yan's body.* - Fri Nov 13 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) quickly bites down on his right thumb, a trickle of crimson red liquid seeping out of the minor room. He smears the blood in the middle of his left palm and used that same palm to slap the ground. In turn, a massive shroud of smoke covers the immediate area. Out from behind the puff of smoke came an enormous purple snake. Said snake had black horizontal stripes over his body. Ortho stoop atop the snakes head, high above the ground.

By this point Ortho's connect within the dome was canceled, causing the earth to crumble. It's at that point when Ortho knew that his initial attack failed. There really wasn't any way else for Yan to escape so Ortho immediately spoke.

Ortho: "Manda! One last time, I promise. Underground!"

Manda: "You don't fucking feed me enough for this, Ortho! You're starting to screw me over!"

Ortho: "LAST TIME, MANDA! I PROMISE!"

At that point, Ortho folds his arms across his chest and allowed Manda to swiftly burrow beneath ground. Ortho, on the other hand, remained in the air. He just hovered there like it was nothing. Manda, with the orders already given, would seek after Yan, using his burrowing capabilities to capture the yellow haired male and potentially swallow him whole.* - Fri Nov 13 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had to react and he had to react with haste. The second Yan emerged from the ground Ortho would step to the side. Yan has proved to be quick with the handseals so Ortho had to think with his feet. A light bulb flickers on above his head and in a swift moment, after evading the torrent of water, he'd form two quick handseals, the requirement for the jutsu to come, and shoot his arms forward.

As a result, four massive snakes shoot from his sleeves; each with their mouths wide open. Three of the snakes was equipped with kusanagi-like blades, intent on piercing right through Yan. The remaining snake would travel straight for Yan's face and clamp down, injecting its venom into the male.* - Fri Nov 13 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watches Yan maneuver around and evade his snakes while a mass amount of mud clones were created. Ortho momentarily close his eyes, backing up a few paces and reopens his lids. His formerly black pupils were no longer existent, but replaced with a crimson red shade and a single black tear drop that swirled around a black midpoint with the campus of red.

Ortho's snakes retract back into his sleeves and just as fast as they did, Ortho forms a quick set of handseals. He may not be as fast as Yan, but it is proven that Ortho was fast nonetheless. The handseal count for the upcoming jutsu paled in comparison to the rest in his arsenal, so it was almost instantaneous. That being said, now that Ortho created some distance and completed the handseals, he raised his arms and expel a massive surge of chakra. This surge would pulse and electrify the mud clones and even transgress toward Yan himself.* - Fri Nov 13 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was getting annoyed at this point. Yan was a formidable opponent and it's for that reason why Ortho decided to switch up his approach to this battle. Seeing as though both Yan and Ortho took their respective paces back, the Uchiha of the two went a step further. 

Another step back was made, more diagonal in direction. With the step back, however, he leaves the ground completely and continues on a straight path into the air. By doing this, he'd evade the ground-based attacks from the clones and Yan. Yes, the lightning surged and zapped two clones while some others were being handled by snakes, but the bamboo shoot was evaded. Ortho's sharingan aided in the anticipation of what Yan and his clones had planned.

While residing in midair, Ortho weaved together a quick succession of handseals. His lungs fill with oxygen and his stomach knead with chakra. The intake of oxygen was through Ortho's nostrils, but the exhale was through puckered lips. With the release of air came a match-like effect where something sparked and a massive fireball was created. Said Fireball was be aimed for the mass of Yan's, clone and original alike.* - Fri Nov 13 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. It was time that he stopped being modest and go all out.

The clones and Yan proved to be in sync with each move they made, but Ortho was just that good when it comes to combinations. Rather than having to resort to clones on team ups, Ortho handled all that himself.

Haste guided Ortho's movements. To start off, the Raging Waves did prove to combat Ortho's fireball, but that didn't mean Ortho's intentions weren't successful. Behind the mask of steam, Ortho maneuvers his way through the air, causing the spikes that the clones aimed to discharge to miss completely. Next up was a series of handseals.

These handseals aided in Ortho's efforts of relighting his chakra and expelling a massive fireball toward Yan and the clones. This time, however, Ortho wasn't going to just let the fireball handle things alone. To top things off, yet another formation of handseals were made and the ejection of a massive gust of wind was made. As Ortho unleashed the wind, he'd sway his head from left to right, using the oxygen and widespread to maximize the area of effect the fireball had.* - Fri Nov 13 07:35:15 2015
