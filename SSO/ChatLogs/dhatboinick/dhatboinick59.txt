<br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You know.. - Fri Dec  4 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Through it all.. - Fri Dec  4 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Everything..? - Fri Dec  4 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raised his right hand, since he was laying on his left side, and trailed it down one of her arms. He meets his palm with the back of her hand and go to lace his fingers with hers and fold them in.

"Through it all.. now that you say that.. I can honestly say.. it's kind've the same way I'm attracted to you.. Like you being a 'savage' is broad.. but the specific details of you continuing the game with me for that long and that seriously.. knowing you can hurt me as much as I can you.. all that.. it makes sense.."* - Fri Dec  4 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't care how quick the kiss was. He didn't even care if it was a full kiss or not. What mattered the most to him was Kariudo wanted to do it. That she didn't feel like she had to do it because Sogeki was already centimeters away from making contact so she just leaned in the last bit to get it over with. What mattered to Sogeki was the fact that she was at least comfortable to the slightest degree to turn her head and plant a kiss, quick or not, on him.

He turns the kiss

Afterwards, he remains quiet. He doesn't verbally comment, nor does he press for another. He just gripped her hand a bit tighter, lay his cheek on hers again and remained still.* - Fri Dec  4 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes eventually closed as well. The same grin she gave was copied by him absent mindedly. There was no other facial expression in existence that could go with her slick comment. "Mhm.~ I'll do my best to take.. full.. advantage, babe.~"* - Fri Dec  4 11:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh god. - Fri Dec  4 11:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That so? - Fri Dec  4 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm.~ - Fri Dec  4 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I did tell you that my brother would make us marry. - Fri Dec  4 11:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leaned even more into her. "Beautifully Savage."* - Fri Dec  4 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You're perfect. - Fri Dec  4 11:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nah... you're perfect because you like the things about me that scare others. - Fri Dec  4 11:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You're perfect because when I threatened to take off a finger if you cheat on me you didn't see it as a threat but as a promise. - Fri Dec  4 11:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I have to admit.. - Fri Dec  4 11:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You'll be savage enough to do it? - Fri Dec  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.* - Fri Dec  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Love it. - Fri Dec  4 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) peers down at her as she rotates. Her words echoed through his mind, but for this moment he was focused at how close they were while being face to face. They've been like this before, but it was under different circumstances. Now, it was relaxed and chill.. apart from the slight threat. "I'll take your word for it.~"* - Fri Dec  4 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Aren't you like. - Fri Dec  4 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Way too old for me? - Fri Dec  4 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continued to look down at Kari, fighting back the urge to just pull her in and nuzzle into her. Who would've though that Sogeki was the cuddling type? At most he'd just level himsel fon the pillow so his nose was perfectly in line with hers, only a few centimeters short of their tips touching.

The scent from Kari was unique. Not many people smelled the way she did and it was extremely attractive. Her hardcore nature and attitude topped off with the sweet innocent scent of a naive schoolgirl. He smiles a bit and slowly shake his head.

"Oh come on.~ I'm not that old compared to you. I mean, apart from certain things, you can even be known as the same age as me."* - Fri Dec  4 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) acted like he needed to take a time to think.* - Fri Dec  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmmmmm. - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Carry the oneee..~ - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Eh? - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Add the the thirty.... - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Ummm.. - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm about..- - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi.. - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oi! - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Why you... - Fri Dec  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Fri Dec  4 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leaned in a bit as if he was going to kiss her, but sways his head just before contact and placed his lips next to her ears. "Probably.. have my way with you," he whispers in a seductive, jokingly, kind've serious manner.* - Fri Dec  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) pulls her in a bit more and just kept his face where it was. "Or maybe add just a little bit more poison to you.. just enough to make you feel like you have control, but you're really.. mine."* - Fri Dec  4 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: no nothing - Fri Dec  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "But I want you to know.. that all it takes is one more prick.. just," his voice became even more hushed and dragged on, "just.. one more babe. Wouldn't you like that? Just a tad bit?~"* - Fri Dec  4 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was so tempted to make his hands roam. This felt like the perfect seduction moment where things just kicked off, but he keeps himself under control. "Talk to me, babe.~ Just say 'okay' and all it takes is me reaching for an arrow..~"* - Fri Dec  4 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) pressed his lips against her cheek. "Just imagine it. You're just laying there.. poison flowing through you.. can't feel a single thing.. Tell me, babe.. Do you want it?"* - Fri Dec  4 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) felt her thigh clenched together and he ran his hand over her upper most one. "Run the arrow down your body, stop at certain points.. poke you here and there.. then when I was out of poison.." His hand trailed in between their bodies, threatening to graze over her ass --- he doesn't continue what he was saying.* - Fri Dec  4 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gently exhaled, making the heat from his breath run over the back over her neck and ears. "Claim you," he whispers as he just barely manage to cup one of her cheeks, squeezes a bit, then brings it back to her thigh* - Fri Dec  4 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) threw noriko on the bed, "you in this too."* - Fri Dec  4 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || "You know the magic word."

His hands trailed up, lust kicking in once again. He aimed to graze over her arms and head to cup one of her breasts, just slightly squeezing if he made it. His mouth opens a bit more and he continues to exhale slowly and seductively.

"And the poison.. will only make you relax.~"* - Fri Dec  4 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't know how to feel. All this 'foreplay' and one little thing ruined it..? He didn't want to look sad or.. disappointed, but he was so turned on at the moment and things seemed to be going down a whole new level with the female he cared so deeply for.. that-

He shook his head, placed a straight face on and sighed. "Uncomfortable..?" he asks with honest curiosity. Did he really screw up and made the wrong move or was she just not at that level yet? He couldn't piece it together, his mind was still clearing from his extremely aroused state.

His member down south may take even longer to ease down.* - Fri Dec  4 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Just.... - Fri Dec  4 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Further than I expected. - Fri Dec  4 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then I realized... - Fri Dec  4 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) saw how she was slightly distraught. He inches her back down, slowly making her lay her head. "Just me and you, babe." If she was to comply, he'd lean in once more and continue to exhale over her cheek and ears, keeping his hands in a safe place so she didn't run from him again. He closes his eyes and continues to speak to her in his hushed tone, wanting to bring her to the same point he was at. "Just," his lips graze against her earlobe, "me," more pressure against her ears, "and," even more pressure, as if he was trying to kiss her ear on a whole, "you." There, that single word, even though it had vowels that required him to exhale more than normal, he found a way to inhale through the end and take her earlobe into his chamber-like mouth. There, with no hesitation, he clamped down just slightly and nibbled on the skin, claiming it as his.* - Fri Dec  4 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) got the okay.

He continues to gently flick his tongue over her earlobe, grazing his front teeth on the outer most part of her ear --- devilishly teasing to bring her tongue past the lobe and up more. His right arm raises and bends at the elbow, allowing him to take grasp of a single arrow. There, with slow movements, he'd bring the tip of his arrow to the back of her middle-upper bicep and prick it. He keeps the tip there for exactly five seconds, making the poison flow down the head, to the tip and into her bloodstream.

He releases her earlobe and puckers his lips, slowing blowing on her ear to make the sudden change in temperature continue seducing her.

He places the arrow off to the side, takes her by the hips and pulls her in more. By this point he was fully aroused and just wanting to finally release what he had for her. Eventually one of his palms found her rear and gave it the most subtle and gentle squeeze possible, still not wanting to scare her off.* - Fri Dec  4 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continues to squeeze and have his way with her ass cheek, loving every bit of it. His mouth continues to work on her earlobe up until he heard her words. To comply with her request, whether it was rhetorical or not, he slowly shift her. He wanted her to turn so her back was face him and he could start working on her other ears.

Once on her new side, Sogeki would press his body against hers, leaving no room for his imagination to determine how well she fit against him. His hand reaches up to her upper breast, cupping it and squeezing a bit. His mouth, however, didn't object to start the seduction of the untouched ear. He takes the lobe into his mouth and starts all over again; nibbling, sucking, pulling away just to subtly blow on it and making it enter his moist, wet, chambers once again. * - Fri Dec  4 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || The same hand that had Kari's breast gripped would let go and trail down her body. It finds the waistband to her pants and tugs it down just a bit. Lust was fueling each action he made, but still caution and some form of restraint was apparent. The difference in her growls and the moan from just minutes before didn't go unnoticed, and it's for that reason why Sogeki came to the decision he made at this current moment.

With her pants now at mid-thigh, he'd only bring his hand back up to her hips and keep it there. The only movements he made at this point was the use of his own strength to sway her bare ass against her confined erection and him continuing to work on her ears. Not wanting her to get completely bored of what he was doing up top, he'd mix it up by kissing on the back of her neck, inch his head over to the side of her neck and just behind her ears then finding her earlobe just to suction cup it back into his mouth.* - Fri Dec  4 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's index found the waistband of her black underwear. He toys with it for a bit while continuing to teasingly simulate his hard-on with the use of her ass cheeks. He uses his thumb to grab as much flesh as possible and separate the cheeks, giving his clothed head and shaft more access in between. Meanwhile, while retaliating to her physical show of arousal, he'd pucker his lips and begin kissing around her neck. He purposely inches closer and closer to that second sweet spot and just before he reached there, he teasingly evades it all together. He goes around her neck again, eases up, and pulls away. He finds her earlobe once more, sucking it in. Instead of just concentrating on that, however, he'd push his tongue out and use his tongue to just graze behind the ear, making her know that he was aware and ready to take advantage* - Fri Dec  4 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) really couldn't take it anymore. A few sways of her hips and pumps of blood to his shaft and he knew he was ready to expose her cheeks to what he had for her. He pulls down her panties, leaving it where her pants was, and reached in between their bodies. He find his zipper just to work around his enlarged member and expose him completely. At this point, with his nine-incher finally set free and welcomed to play, he go back for her cheeks and separate it, more than last time. He lets go, allowing her to completely wrap around his cock and give him a sensation he hasn't felt ever before.

His own body shivers from the feeling of something like this completely covering his length. His hips sway back and forth, the head of his cock threatening the lower part of her pussy but not exactly entering past the lips. While he worked his hips, he felt no reason to sway hers so he trails his grip up her side and found the tail to her upper body clothing. He digs underneath all of it, wanting to claim her breasts as his from this point forward. Once cupping her breast, of course pulling down on her bra rather than lifting it up, he manages to expose her nipples. He felt the harden nub and immediately attacked it. He grips the nipple with two fingers, the side of his index and entire thumb, and twirls it. Every so often he'd tug and pinch, taking things slow in movements.

Kari's sweet spots weren't forgotten. He was fully aroused and having the time of his life. He knew what sort of feelings she could get from all this and he made it his priority to give her some form of satisfaction as well. His tongue fully licks over the back of her ear then moves her lobe, flicking it a few times just to barely enter her ears as whole before retracting back to the back of her ears. He repeats this process twice before pulling back to kiss on her neck then repeating.* - Fri Dec  4 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: cuz i didnt know if he could read the screen or not - Fri Dec  4 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was teasing himself as much as he was teasing her. Every time his head pushed against her mound he'd release a deep grunt. It was low in pitch, but the base behind it shook his entire body. The sound of his voice being called tipped him half. He needed to enter her and he needed to enter her now. Her grabs her breast completely and squeezes, thrusting his hips forward a bit more and causing his head to push a little in between her lips and threaten to pierce through her walls.

The tightness was amazing and mind blowing, only making him want to go further and further. Still, while keeping her request from earlier in mind, he'd only keep at the current level he was at --- putting the infamous 'just the tip' to full usage and upholding it.* - Fri Dec  4 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was as much of a virgin as her up until this point. Yes, he was older than her but he wasn't even sexually involved until recently. He was suddenly given more access. It wasn't much, she was still tight as hell, but the difference was there. His own eyes widened and he was just begging for her to let him go in fully. "T-Talk to me," he mutters while swaying his hips back and forth. He kept his head the focus of penetration, not going any further. "Y-yes or no, babe.." His voice was shakey and almost begging to let him know. Of course he was hoping for the yes, but he was so arouse that just the head was sufficient of enough to get him off.* - Fri Dec  4 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) got the okay.

He pulls her closer to his body and nuzzled his face in to her neck and caressed his lips over her skin, wanting to comfort the best way he amateur mind could think of in the heat of the moment. His hips sway at a slower pace this time around, instinctively knowing that from this point forward that rampaging in her can't be the same how he just separated her cheeks and planted his cock in between. He begins audibly breathing through his mouth between the kisses on her neck, each sway forward added a bit more of his cock into her.

The thrusts back and forth weren't fast or forceful. They were as moderate as can be while trying to make her aware of every inch that entered, giving her full opportunity to back out and tell him no. He wanted her to enjoy this as much as he was, planning to fuck her- possibly even make love with her- to the point where their orgasm isn't something of a sin to some crazy guidelines, but magical in every sense possible. If he had it his way, by time his fourth or fifth thrust came he'd be almost half way in. At that point, he'd just keep his member inside and hold it there, helping her get used to the feeling before going again.* - Fri Dec  4 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || The feeling he got was amazing. Her pussy wrapped around his cock perfectly as his girth and length molded her. She stretched to his liking and went no further, only clamping around. At this point, there was no coming back. Out of everything she muttered and struggled to say, all he heard was 'Sogeki' and 'Good'. This may have been selective thinking, but fuck it. His cock was so hard at this point that it felt like it was about to burst any moment.

He picks back up on swaying his hips back and forth, slightly tightening his grip on her breast for leverage purposes and going from there. He archs his back from sheer instincts and began to work around her pleasantly phat ass, hitting the pussy at that specific angle for this specific sex position. He was giving her back shots that led directly into her pussy, all the while keeping it at a tempo that was okay with her, from what he can tell by the reception he got from her up until this point.* - Fri Dec  4 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) allowed her to ride her orgasm out completely. He too was new to this entire thing so when her pussy didn't clench as much as it should have, due to the poison, he was completely oblivious to the fact. The only thing he knew, at this point, was that he was getting a tingling in his sex and hers was only juicing it out of him more. He gives her a few more thrusts sent from heaven until he couldn't hold back anymore. Common sense and other factors kicked in immediately and he pulls out completely. He was so out of it that'd he continue to pump in between her cheeks and allowed himself to unload. Stream after stream of cum shot between her cheeks and he extracts his hand from under her shirt and separate ass, looking down to see her meat and flesh jiggle and all that good stuff. "O-Oh.. shiiittt."* - Fri Dec  4 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Everything feels tingly... and awful in some ways... what was that... it was amazing... why did I like that? - Fri Dec  4 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: It was like my head exploded. - Fri Dec  4 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) came down from his high little by little. He was so far gone right now that he only thing he could do was instinctively caress over her body with his hand. He started by giving her cheeks a light tap, squeezing it slightly and gliding his touch to her hips. The mixture of their juices made feel like they did a job well done, a satisfying sigh escaping his lips. He crawls back up to Kari's level and lay next to her, pulling her in close. He caught just a bit of her face, but diverts his eyes so he could continue his descent. Another sigh is released and stares up at the ceiling as he lay there on his back.

He really didn't know what to think at this point. He slowly shook his head and bites down on his lower lip, and thought about everything. He came to two decisions: either he made a mistake by pushing things too far, or this'll be perfect and everything was chill.

"W-Wow.."* - Fri Dec  4 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked over at her, hearing her mumble. He was more-so leaning to the 'I'm going to regret this later" mindset, but right now he's going to wing everything. She submitted to him and, even though he climaxed, he was going to work her body a bit more. He leans more into her, nuzzling his face into her and slowly swaying his hips back and forth while his cock slowly, but surely, deflate. He was still kind've hard, but not as hard as when they started. If he was to put his stiffness into levels, he'd be at a decent five out of ten. He'd seductively moan in her ears, enjoying the aftereffect from their juices, her ass and his cock running over one another. "..Mmm..~"* - Fri Dec  4 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly nodded his head into her neck. He kisses her gently and reaches in between their bodies, extending his middle finger to graze against her crack and push in. His cock twitched every now and then, but for the most part he was deflating. He wouldn't mind a round two, but for now he was going to continue pleasuring her then see how things go from there. He pulls his cock out and rested it at the fold where here thigh and ass cheeks met; swaying his hips just a bit to let her know something was there for her. His fingers, however, would start to roam in between her cheeks, squeezing her phatness and grazing over her pucker just a bit. The only thing missing from his palm that could show the passion each pinch, grope, squeeze meant was a pair of lips that can kiss her ass.* - Fri Dec  4 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) applied pressure too her pucker, but not too much for him to enter. "I'm.. going to claim this next," he whispers in her ears. He lifts his face and kisses the back of her ears, continuing to stimulate her the way he know how --- which wasn't much. Every now and then he'd tap her ass and glance down to see the ripple effect in her cheek, "mmm.~ Soon.~"* - Fri Dec  4 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't bother answering her. He raises his hand from in between her cheeks and place it on her hips, "sooner than you think.~" He nudges her limp body forward, forcing her to lay on her stomach.

At this point, he'd hover over her back and start gliding his tongue down her body until he met her cracks. He looks at her cakes with hunger, licks his lips and uses both hands to separate them, exposing her extremely moist pucker. "This is mine now, Kariudo.." he says in a hushed tone.* - Fri Dec  4 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "just.. a little bit.."

He lowers his head in between her cheeks and sticks his tongue out, closing his eyes and taking a firm lick off of her pucker. The mix between their juices and the mustiness from both their bodies fused together actually turned him on even more. He pulls his head back, takes a look.. "okay, maybe a lot more.."

He dives back in, pushing his lips out and, literally, kissing her pucker gently. He extends his tongue and licks over it, "mmm.."* - Fri Dec  4 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is completely enjoying himself. The taste was something he could easily get used to, and that he was. He grabs and lightly smacks on her cheeks, arousal picking back up in his body as he runs his lips and tongue over her pucker. The fact that her shape provided a source of cushioning made everything all that better and he loved every bit of it. He would've surely rethought all this if the simplest "no" escaped Kariudo, but that gentle moan she provided him, while he was face deep in between her cheeks, only made him believe she was completely enjoying it. To make things, in his view, that much enjoyable for her, he'd occasionally lick over her pussy lips but went back to her pucker.* - Fri Dec  4 17:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is completely enjoying himself. The taste was something he could easily get used to, and that he was. He grabs and lightly smacks on her cheeks, arousal picking back up in his body as he runs his lips and tongue over her pucker. The fact that her shape provided a source of cushioning made everything all that better and he loved every bit of it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || "Mmm.~"

The only response Sogeki had for Kariudo was that audible moan of lust and enjoyment. Their juices merged together and smeared across her pucker, which also was enhanced by her spew of liquid from her stimulating her lips, made this very tasteful. The softness of her cheeks making this that much enjoyable. He gives her ass a few more swats, extending his tongue completely out and licking from the entrance of her pussy, up to her pucker and back down. His hands continue to squeeze, push together, separate and slap her ass to a mild level; only enough to cause a handprint without making it seem like he was downright punishing her.* - Sat Dec  5 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gives her asshole one last lick before pulling himself away. It was a proven fact now that he was a definite ass-guy. He grabs her cheeks with both hands, cupping one in each hand, and separates them to get a good aerial view of her pucker. "Should I claim this, babe?~ Yes or no?~"

As he asked that he's climb up over her, pushing her legs together as she lay on her stomach and hovered his hips over her cheeks. The head of his cock graze of her cheeks and gently push further down until meeting her pucker. "Let me know.~" He knew she wouldn't be able to physically object, but just wanting to hear her voice in this extremely lustful moment is what he desired the most.* - Sat Dec  5 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || A large smile grew on his face at her panic. Something about it turned him on to extreme levels and he just wanted to dip his, now fully erect, cock into her asshole. He wanted to claim it as his, a form of intimiate possession that he is the first to enter and wanting to be the last to enter. He lowers his head, the one on his shoulders, over her neck and starts to blow a gentle breeze over her. His other head, the most important one right now, would inch lower and lower between her cheeks until the tip finds her pucker. Of course, with how tight she was when he lubricated tongue was trying to violate her, he knew something as large as his cock would take time and patience to enter. "Let me in, Kariudo.. Let me in," he whispers into her ear, grazing his tongue over her earlobe by time he muttered the last "in".

His hips lower down on to her plump ass, an attempt to apply just enough pressure to start the process of claiming her anal cavity. The tightness and overall thought of how much he was going to enjoy this made him gasp for air as his cock met the wrinkles of her pucker. Still, he gave her every bit of opportunity to yell out the magic word, or words, to stop him.* - Sat Dec  5 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) would normally feel disappointed that he couldn't go through when he was this close, but he actually wasn't. If anything, he was completely okay with the situation at hand. Of course he wanted to get this second nut off, but if things were to truly stop he'd have to deal with it by himself. For now, to get rid of the obvious fear Kari was feeling, he'd pull his hips back and grab hers. With a swift swipe of his arm he'd flip her over on her back and just look at her. "Your wish is my command," he whispers. By this point his extremely hard cock was barely fliding over her lower stomach and upper pelvic area.* - Sat Dec  5 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her turn red and simply smiled, saying nothing to increase her embarrassment. Instead, in a slow pace, he'd take hold of her right thigh lifted it. He wraps it around his waist, and leaned down by his hips. He does the same thing with her other thigh, leaning down even more so the top of his cock was barely grazing against her mound. He knew that she had no control over her body so he made it a priority to aid her as much as she can. "Talk to me."* - Sat Dec  5 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) narrows his eyes a bit and chuckles a bit. "Well.. let's start off with a yes or no." He sways his hips back and forth, rubbing his length across her lips. "Then.. we'll talk about whether or not you still want the poison in you though this all."* - Sat Dec  5 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's move to the tail of her coat and continued to look at her, pulling it up with caution. He bites down on his lower lip as more and more of her upper body was exposed to him. By time her breasts were clear for him to see he'd smile in lust and lower his head to take her nipple, that he pulled out before, into his mouth.

His other hand reaches between their bodies and took hold of his cock. With a few sways of his hips and an amateur attempt to find the right angle, he'd finally meet her entrance with his head and slowly enter her. First go he makes it to the rim of his head, pull back his hips just before he was to completely leave her and drive in a little further than the last. This process continues until her finally based out in her.* - Sat Dec  5 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't say he was fully aware of all the aspects of what they're doing. Yes, his ears were open to her responses to certain things but when it came down to it, lust was driving him to do everything. He lips wrap around her petite breasts, specifically her nipples, and his tongue run over the hardened nub. His eyes close as he starts to sway his hips back and forth, gliding his cock in and out of pussy with each passive second. Compared to how he was hitting it when he was behind her, this time around he was more passionate. Before he had to take things slow by nature for them both, or mainly Sogeki, to figure things out and best way to go about each movement. This time around however, he added a bit more passion and genuine care with each thrust --- going deep when he based out and stroking in an out of her slowly. Whenever he was to base out he'd jolt his hips downward a bit harder and faster than how he came, making that last inch or so hit the 'spot'.

In all honesty? He wasn't intentionally making love to her. It wasn't a hidden fact that he has pent up emotions and feelings that he had to release --- whether they were good or bad. In this case, he was just releasing everything with the person he potentially lov-.. Took extreme interest in.* - Sat Dec  5 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continues to passionately thrust in and out of Kariudo, catching on to how he was stroking and deciding to just accept the fact. He releases a sigh over her, now, moist breast and nipple as he accepted the fact. It was no longer about claiming her and her body, but something more intimate that he knew he only shared with himself at this moment. It bothered him just a bit, probably more if he wasn't still fueled by lust. He lifts his head from her cleavage and glances at her, making eye contact. He tucks his knees more under her frame, for leverage purposes and raises her hips. Now, similar to how he was when she "let" him hit it from the back, he was giving his cock a straight path in and out of her pussy.

The look in his eyes was different. Lust was still there, that wouldn't go away until he finally relieved himself, but the general look was different. It was more modest, sincere and just.. accepting..* - Sat Dec  5 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) came to figure that the faintest call of his name from Kariudo was able to send him over the edge. It was something about it that made his mind skyrocket and his orgasm being the place where it landed. Just as his name rolled off her tongue, he give her pussy a few final thrust, as she herself was riding out her orgasm, before his own arrived. He raised his head more toward hers, getting a direct flow of eye contact. He didn't dare blink to ruin the moment, he just continues to passionately thrust into her at a slightly picked up tempo until he finally arrived. Of course, like last time, he did his best to make her finish before he completely released.

When he did release however, it was stronger than the one before. It was more.. divine and knowledgable.. Like that one time he did cum led to him knowing how to make the best out of this feeling without disrupting his flow or hers. Just as his cum was spew out he'd pull out and have the head of his cock rest just below her entrance. Once again, similar to last time, he juices would seep in between her cheeks and merge with the downpour of her own liquids. His jaw cracks open and his lips part, allowing them both to hear his deep moan of lust. It was low in volume, but deep in bass, exemplifying his manly stature through this moment.

Instead of rolling over and hold on to her, he'd simply lower his body to a small degree over hers and rest there for a bit. He didn't want to break the eye contact they had, but the need to just momentarily close his eyes and glide down from his high was to strong. He daringly leans in and plants a soft kiss on her cheek, physically apologizing to her just in case she really wanted the constant battle. He nuzzles his face into her shoulder, and a bit into the pillow supporting her head and just laid there.* - Sat Dec  5 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's own panting eventually subsided. He nods his head in response to Kari's comment. His eyes finally reopen and his body shifts, rolling over to his side, where the side table was. There, he grabs a piece of tissue from the box he has on both ends of the bed and dabs it into the bowl of antidote he left there. At that moment he brings to the soaked tissue behind the same bicep her pricked and squeezed down, making as much of the cure seep into her arm as possible. Of course excess liquid would drip down her arm, but that didn't matter. Lazily, he'd throw the soiled tissue on the side table and slum his own arm over his chest. "..Never thought it'd feel like that," he whispers as he stared up at the ceiling.* - Sat Dec  5 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyelids slowly lowered. "All that movement.. I'm sure I lost like three pounds or something." He smirks a bit and released a low sigh.* - Sat Dec  5 08:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) he sits up with a grunt, his own lower back aching a bit. He crawls off the bed and starts stripping off his clothing. His shirt dropped, his pants, he shoes are kicked off and his pants was unbuckled. The only thing he had on was his boxers and even then his soft member was poking out the peep hole in the front.

He reaches over to Kari's body and pulls her to him, gripping every bit of clothing he can and pull them off and, or, over. When it came time to take her bra off he'd stare at the nipple he was just sucking on just moments ago, playfully licking his lips for her to see. Eventually her got her down to absolutely nothing.

When he was done, he'd hook his right arm behind the back of her knees and place his left arm behind her back, lifting her up bridal style. He carries her to the bathroom where he lays her in the tub to rest. Her head was away from the lower faucet of the shower system. He fiddles with the gauge for a bit until finding the right water pressure, of course she had to feel every change in temperature.

At this point, with the water warm he'd look over at her and smirked. "So you want me to wash you or you got this?"* - Sat Dec  5 08:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm ready. - Sun Dec  6 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) places his hands in to his pants pockets and follow after Kariudo.* - Sun Dec  6 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) grabbed for the tail of his vest and pulls it up over his head, throwing it to the ground. He brings his right arm over his chest and uses his left arm to hook the back of his right tricep, stretching the entire arm. "I've been in so many fights that training seemed pointless. I learned at the heat of the moment," he says in a leveled tone.

He releases his right arm and does the same process over with his left arm being the one to be stretched out.* - Sun Dec  6 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "I tend not to pick the fight. But if someone has beef, I'm eating it." His tone was getting a bit more serious. He wasn't angry or annoyed, just focused at this point and time.

With both his arms now stretched out, he'd work on his legs. With his right leg, he'd bend at the knee and use his right hand to reach for the front o his ankle, pressing his heel against his butt and using that pressure to stretch out his thighs and leg on a whole.* - Sun Dec  6 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her. He blinks a few times and a slightly confused expression plastered itself on his visage. "We're training. I can't fight you." His head slowly shook.

After releasing his right leg and flashing it back and forth a bit, he'd bring his left leg up behind him by the knee and use his left hand to press the heel against his butt. "Have anything in mind?" He sways his bent leg left and right, getting full stretch out of his muscle.* - Sun Dec  6 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't want to answer the question about why they couldn't fight, knowing that she won't agree with it. He sighed a bit and momentarily closed his eyes, shaking his head a bit. "I can chuck around a few kunai, shuriken and wave around a massive blade. I have only two kunais with me and no blade so I'm going to have to go straight taijutsu with you."

Sogeki releases his leg and brings both his hands to his hips. He leans back with his spine while using his grip to keep his hip as straight as possible. Every few seconds, while leaning back, he'd sway from left to right then right to left.* - Sun Dec  6 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked a bit at her comment of his Taijutsu, "sure.~ Teach me, senpai.~"* - Sun Dec  6 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ew. - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, come. - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) grabs the colar of his jumpsuit and pulls it down, half way taking it off but leaving it around his waist.* - Sun Dec  6 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I may take you up on that fight. - Sun Dec  6 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shook his head. He found the extreme cockiness of Kariudo extremely attractive, but he had to take it seriously. "I only have three ninjutus in my arsenal. One of the three involves basic fuuinjutsu, the other two I either haven't mastered.. or I doubt you can learn."* - Sun Dec  6 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked. He knew sooner or later his bow was going to be put on the backburner. He grabs for it and chucks off, showing her that he wouldn't use it. Instead, he reaches down to his right thigh, where there was a leg holster, and took out one of the two kunai's he had left. He grips it, twirls it with his index finger and prepared himself. "Then I demand you go all out against me. No bow.. you go all out."* - Sun Dec  6 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Not even sure if this'll work.. - Sun Dec  6 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Worth the try.. - Sun Dec  6 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's grip on the kunai altered. The senbons was a great distraction, causing him to use his own weaponry to clash at the projectiles aimed for his hip. The remaining senbon found nothing but air as he shifted his stance so his right leg was leading his movements and the opposing leg was making it a priority to evade. Of course, with Kariudo closing in fast, he had a decision to make.

She was effective in the muscular shut down department, a matter that he faced head on plenty of times thus far. Her multitude of arms made things all that tougher, but he was up for the challenge. His right leg is currently the lead in all his movements and is also her current target, so he retaliates in an attempt to create room between them.

With her reached forward for his right leg, he bends at the knee and kicks off, using the left leg that was formerly targeted as a safe haven --- hoping to evade the pressure point assault and remaining punches to his midsection. His left heel slams into the ground and applied the friction needed to halt his back-dash. Following that evasion, if it was successful in the first place, he'd use the kunai gripped and thrust it forward. With that thrust, he'd quickly apply chakra to its metallic base and used that very same chakra to generate an electrical surge. His own aim was superb compared to the average Joe, but his main priority was to create just a slight cut on her skin. The specific destination of the kunai was her upper right shoulder, close to her shoulder blade.* - Sun Dec  6 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's narrowed and he focuses his sensing abilities. Her buildup of chakra didn't go unnoticed and it honestly caught him off guard. He had to think of a way to get around this layer of chakra without his poison and without wasting his last kunai, what a drag.

He nodded his head and continues to pace backward, taking it one step at a time. He spends this momentary halt in their battle to examine the layers of chakra, wanting to identify every bit of it and determine if the cut he created could be taken for advantage. "Impressive," he tells her with a nod. "You never cease to amaze me."* - Sun Dec  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked.

"Not trying to beat your ass so soon," he says a bit louder, matching her taunts with his own. "Hell, if anything you have me on the run. I obviously can't contend with you. You are my superior after all." He raises his arms and stretch them out, mimicking a surrender-type pose. "Give me your best shot.~"* - Sun Dec  6 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || The usage of her sweat glands and how she's able to form a multitude of things with said sweat impressed him greatly. She was the ideal combatant in close range and it scared him to a slight degree --- scared him in the sense that he felt bad for anyone that truly pissed her off. Of course there was a secondary buildup of chakra that was too familiar by now; those damn webs.

That stacking of chakra, seeing as though it was in the same timeframe as the formation of the weaponry, made Sogeki knows she was coming in for the kill. Swiftly, he'd reach down with his right hand and extract his final kunai, gripping it and preparing to slash through as much webs as possible. Kariudo is going to hate the fact that he's on the retreat again, but he'd desperately looking for that specific opening he created moments before.

He takes three steps back, avoiding the first the webs, but when it came down to the fourth he doesn't bother evading it. His ankles are trapped and subdued to Kariudo's liking. Despite this, attempting to make that sacrifice and possibly bypass the layer of chakra she coated herself with, he'd chuck the kunai forward after generating a sufficient amount of electrical chakra through it. It wasn't aimed exactly at the cut he created before, but specifically her upper body as a whole. The simplest of touch from his chakra was aimed to null her out to some degree while he thought of how to get out of this trap. He may have to use his arrows after all.* - Sun Dec  6 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I dare him to try something. - Sun Dec  6 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lifted his chin and gives a wind grin. "You and I both know a savage isn't going to admit defeat," he says in a hushed tone, placing his gaze directly into hers. Of course, even if he didn't know it, he was going to accept her dare. In a swift movement, using his left hand, he'd reach up to her long spear and smacked it away. In that same moment he'd use his dominant hand, which was obviously his right, to grab for a arrow and pull it out. At the end of the day he was still bounded by the web and the only thing he could do was fend himself off with a basic arrow --- poison wasn't even coating it.* - Sun Dec  6 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || The arrow did, however, have an explosive tag around its length. Of course it wasn't set to go off thus yet. On top of that, he was attempting to bluff at a certain degree to make her feel that the arrow was indeed laced with poison. Of course, by now, she may have been able to tell the difference in his arrows when it came to poison-laced or not.* - Sun Dec  6 08:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was smacked by the spear, causing a decent laceration in his cheek. His entire demeanor changed, knowing now the intensity between them was truly on a scale far past 'joking'. With his newfound battle wound, and his head now leaning in the direction the momentum of the hit sent it, he'd begin to chuckle. It started off low and subtle then gradually increased to a straight up laughter. His eyes water from how heavy he was laughing, something that surely wasn't normal for Sogeki --- no matter how much of a goofball he was at times.

The fact that he came out with an injury from this fight was hilarious to him. It didn't matter who he got the injury from or how miniscule the injury was, but the fact that there was an injury excited him. Not only that, but how he got it sent chills down his spine. Before he could even finish talking he was made Kariudo's bitch once again, something that could possibly become a trend if he's not careful. He straightens his neck and pears at her, continuing his laughter.

"This is rich, Kariudo," he says behind his laughter. "You've gotten the best of me yet again.~"* - Sun Dec  6 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) turned his head and shows her his other cheek, the one that wasn't lacerated. "Might as well do your worse."* - Sun Dec  6 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Just admit the loss. - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Why admit something you already?~ - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, come. Go a head. - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks at her from his peripherals, really waiting for her to go a head and slash him. This was a his pride talking and his desires to it in tact. He had no problem losing to someone that earned the win, but to kiss the ass of the person that clearly won? No thank you.* - Sun Dec  6 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, come. Get it over with.~ - Sun Dec  6 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) grunts heavily. The pain sent through his face was shocking and caused him to bite down on his tongue. His head lowered a bit and his jaw clenched to the point where the bone on the sides of his bulged. "O-Okay!" he exclaims through the pain. "That one hit the spot." He turns his head completely and raised it to give Kariudo a good look, not really expecting much to be said. At most, he was waiting for another slash in place of him admitting something they both knew.* - Sun Dec  6 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, getting a bit serious. "Pride does that to the average Joe." He watched her unravel the webs and free him, but he remains still.* - Sun Dec  6 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah well...--...tch. - Sun Dec  6 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Sun Dec  6 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Does it really mean something to you? - Sun Dec  6 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... I don't like doing things without reason. - Sun Dec  6 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Right. - Sun Dec  6 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: If I admit.. would it make you happy? - Sun Dec  6 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you never admit defeat? - Sun Dec  6 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: No. It's done. - Sun Dec  6 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I just didn't know you couldn't admit when you are beat. - Sun Dec  6 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed, looking away. "You win.. I give up," he muttered.* - Sun Dec  6 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took the flick and wiggled his nose a bit, looking her with a 'why' expression.* - Sun Dec  6 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You didn't have to say that. - Sun Dec  6 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I was just commenting. - Sun Dec  6 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmph. - Sun Dec  6 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) grumbles something.* - Sun Dec  6 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What is it? - Sun Dec  6 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked at her, sighing a bit.. "Wanted to give you what you want for a change."
* - Sun Dec  6 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You.. beat me.. fair and square. - Sun Dec  6 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Do I really? - Sun Dec  6 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And uhh.. - Sun Dec  6 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shrugged.* - Sun Dec  6 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I dont know.. - Sun Dec  6 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked around a bit then met her gaze. His voice softens to match her tone and he shrugged a bit. "What more can I ask for? Unless you're offering something."* - Sun Dec  6 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I am asking for you to ask.... - Sun Dec  6 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) chews the inside of his lower lip a bit as he reaches up to her chin, gliding his thumb over it.* - Sun Dec  6 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: How soon do you have to leave again? - Sun Dec  6 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times, a bit shocked.. "W-Wow.." He runs his thumb over her cheek and steps a bit closer to her. "Let's head back to me place?"* - Sun Dec  6 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded and returned the smile. He reaches for one of her free hands and lead her off --- of course he gathers his layed out stuff and what not.* - Sun Dec  6 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) walks her to the bedroom, leading her directly to the bed and letting her sit there. He motions to her that he'll be right back and walks to the bathroom. There, he'd wash his face and patch up his cuts. He was narturally a fast healer so he wasn't in need for antibiotics so the most he dead was cleanse it with a alcohol pad  and leave it at that.

Once done, Sogeki would walk back to the bedroom and glance at her. "You hungry?"* - Sun Dec  6 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded. He walks out the bedroom, well.. to the other side of the bedroom since the living room was the bedroom, and opens the cage to his messenger bird. After writing a note and tying it to the birds leg he'd walk over to a window and open it. In turn, the bird would fly off. "Food is its way," he says out loud for Kariudo to hear. "Anything else?"* - Sun Dec  6 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Everything spicy the place got. - Sun Dec  6 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) said that casually.* - Sun Dec  6 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...That's.... expensive. - Sun Dec  6 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Ehh. There's nothing in the fridge so left overs would serve me for like.. a week? - Sun Dec  6 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Works out either way. - Sun Dec  6 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm.. okay...  - Sun Dec  6 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) walked back to the bed and sit down on the chair he placed there days before.* - Sun Dec  6 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Huh. - Sun Dec  6 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... your house is pretty small. - Sun Dec  6 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Have to agree with you there. - Sun Dec  6 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: How long? - Sun Dec  6 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: For wha- - Sun Dec  6 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded, "not long."* - Sun Dec  6 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn... so you really don't train? - Sun Dec  6 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Nope. - Sun Dec  6 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her, smirking a bit. He like that sight believe it or not.* - Sun Dec  6 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I may have to now. - Sun Dec  6 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm getting my ass handed to you too easily. - Sun Dec  6 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And.. I have a few jutsus to master. - Sun Dec  6 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: handed to me* - Sun Dec  6 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Guess we will start training regularly when I'm here then. ---By the way, you are a dirty liar about saying you are going to write me letters. - Sun Dec  6 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) coughed. "See.. what had happen was..."* - Sun Dec  6 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: If you don't like writing letters it's okay. - Sun Dec  6 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no.. It's not that. - Sun Dec  6 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly..? It just.. slipped my mind.. - Sun Dec  6 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: For a second time? - Sun Dec  6 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not.. used to have someone.. that's away. - Sun Dec  6 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: So I have to get used to sending letters rather than waiting for them to show back up. - Sun Dec  6 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Oh. - Sun Dec  6 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Two birds swoop in to the house. They'd head directly over to Sogeki and steadily hover a plastic bag full of neatly stacked containers. Obviously, from the scent coming from the bag, the food had arrived. The food was so plentiful that it took two birds to carry it all. Sogeki unties the bags from the birds' feet and placed it on the table by the bed. Then, he'd reach under the bed and take out his infamous box of money. Once subtracting the needed amount of money, he'd place it in a pouch and wrap the string to the pouch to one of the birds legs, allowing them both to fly off.

Soon after his personal bird would show up and already know to head back to its cage.

"There ya' go.~"* - Sun Dec  6 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her as she rummaged through. "It all makes sense now," he says in a 'matter of fact' tone.* - Sun Dec  6 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm? - Sun Dec  6 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) just.. watched. He wasn't exactly amazed how she was able to eat like a true savage, he was more amazed at her eating the spicey food like it was mild. "You eat what your attitude is like.~"* - Sun Dec  6 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, not bothering to make a slick comment on her first statement. "Go a head and eat. I had lunch a few hours before hour.. fight."* - Sun Dec  6 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smiled a bit. He was leaning back in the chair when she brought the dish over, he looked from the food to her face then back at the food. He eventually accepted it, but as he took hold of it he purposely grazed his fingers over her hand. "Was going to eat something else, but this'll be a good appetizer," he says in a hushed tone. He grabs for a fork, since he didn't want to bother with chopsticks, and began eating. "Not bad."* - Sun Dec  6 10:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but make his smile transition back into a smirk. He continued to eat as well, not bothering to comment. "The food taste busy in that.. place you go to? What did you call it? Land of Rain?"* - Sun Dec  6 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's brow raised. "Oh..? You force yourself to eat it?" He takes another bite of his food, slowly chewing and swallowing.* - Sun Dec  6 10:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Because of the village I'm staying in? - Sun Dec  6 11:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was about done with his food, only having a little bit left in the container. He shifts forward a bit and placed the container on the table before leaning back into ther cair. "Do -you- feel safe there?"* - Sun Dec  6 11:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ....Is that wrong? - Sun Dec  6 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Even though I'm loyal to Eiyu and I want to be near you.... - Sun Dec  6 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: If I could just take the two of you there I'd... be the happiest. - Sun Dec  6 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Obviously that'd never work. - Sun Dec  6 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) now understood why she wanted him to promise her that he wouldn't come looking for her. Just that little bit of truth being exposed made him feel some type of way, probably something she expected. He turns his head and looks over at the pillow on the bed..

"I.. promise," he says in a hushed and hesitant tone.* - Sun Dec  6 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 11:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I won't.. come looking for you. And no, it's not wrong.. - Sun Dec  6 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I just don't want you coming to look for me because they don't like surprises... I want yous afe. - Sun Dec  6 11:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, chewing the inside of his lower lip.* - Sun Dec  6 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I get it.. No worries. - Sun Dec  6 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Ugh... Sogeki...talk to me. - Sun Dec  6 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. want you to be in a place where you're.. comfortable.. happy.. and like you say.. 'feels right'.. - Sun Dec  6 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: But.. the lingering thought that maybe.. just maybe.. - Sun Dec  6 11:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) went to speak more nonsense, but was stopped half way. His head was lifted a bit and his gaze is set on hers.* - Sun Dec  6 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You listen here. - Sun Dec  6 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I never have been more comfortable with anyone but you, even if I enjoy those in Amegakure it's because it's fun... for my job and they are dangerous, it's a thrill... you are different in a way but still very similiar. - Sun Dec  6 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You are special to me. - Sun Dec  6 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Don't doubt yourself, it's unattractive. - Sun Dec  6 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes fixed on her as she spoke. If Sogeki was more in touch with his feelings there wouldn't be a doubt that he'd shed a sentimental tear or two, but he was too much of a savage. Instead, he'd give a smirk. By now she'd be able to tell that he had many smirks for many situations and this smirk was the compensation for his lack of being able to shed those sentimental tears.

He nods his head in agreeance, "alright.. you win." His voice is low and gentle, matching hers in most aspects, the only difference being the bass behind his.* - Sun Dec  6 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leans more into the chair, releasing a long sigh. He relaxes himself and continued to smirk at her. "So.. how many people you beat up while there?"* - Sun Dec  6 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: None yet. - Sun Dec  6 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times and got quiet for a few seconds. He slowly shook his head then chuckles a bit.* - Sun Dec  6 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yet? Have a hit list or winging it? - Sun Dec  6 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm usually too busy -training-. - Sun Dec  6 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Ew. - Sun Dec  6 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph. - Sun Dec  6 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you making good progress like I expect you to be? - Sun Dec  6 11:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhmm.~ - Sun Dec  6 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What you gonna do? You can't even beat me.~ - Sun Dec  6 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: We'll see.~ - Sun Dec  6 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head and have your last meal before I.. restrain you for my safety and yours.~ - Sun Dec  6 11:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Reasons, babe.~ - Sun Dec  6 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Ugh..when he calls me that. - Sun Dec  6 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Just tell me when you're ready to be restrained. - Sun Dec  6 11:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) chews on his lower lip, trying his best to stop a smirk from forming again. Before he raised from the fridge, he'd clear his throat and speak in the most casual and straight forward tone he can muster. "Make sure you're naked when you come back. Most I'm accepting is underwear, nothing else."* - Sun Dec  6 12:02:46 2015
