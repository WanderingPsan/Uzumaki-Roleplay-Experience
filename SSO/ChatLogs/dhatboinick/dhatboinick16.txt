<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, so what's first?~ - Thu Oct  8 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, realizing that Misa was full of bullshit. The request to train someone he doesn't even know is one thing, but to be lied to just so he can do it is another. At this point and time Ortho was prepared to just walk away, but even he knew that he couldn't stoop to such a level where he abandons this child in need of a drink of knowledge. A simply sigh escaped Ortho as he set his gaze on Nina, examining her built to depict whether or not she could hone in on the few techniques he had. Whether or not she was, he wouldn't have a straight forward answer just yes. "First things first, start honing in on your own techniques. Once you master them, I will supply you with some from my own arsenal."

Waiting on a reply from Nina wasn't on Ortho's mind as he simply turned his back to her and began his own training. He starts off by stitching together a series of handseals, skillfully tying his fingers together with relative ease and haste. Upon doing so, whilst his handseals were sowed together, he began kneading his chakra together within his stomach. It's at that moment when his kneaded chakra would thicken a bit and take the form of water. With the puckering of his lips and a subtle push, a powerful torrent of water would spew from his mouth.

By time the torrent of water was to explode from his mouth in a continuous stream, Ortho began weaving another set of handseals together; his chakra kneading within his body once again. Once the handseals were completed, he'd stretch his arms out and unleash a pulsating surge of electricity through his palms. The two jutsus would merge into a devastating Electrical Raging Waves.* - Thu Oct  8 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues on with his training, allowing his chakra to slowly seep out of his body. Within seconds, after performing the necessary handseal, a shroud of white smoke would spawn to the right of him. From within the mask of the smoke emerged an exact duplicate of Ortho, matching him in every way possible. The clone, with the knowledge of what Ortho had happened, would string together a series of handseals whilst pivoting forward. While in sync of his clones' movements, Ortho, the original, would pivot backwards while performing the same handseals as the clone.

With the two of them traveling in opposite directions, they'd both face another in their new positions and prepared their jutsus. Both their chakras would knead within their stomachs and liquefy and reach full capacity. Following that was the puckering of both their lips and the unleashing of two powerful torrents of water.* - Thu Oct  8 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So mister Ortho, when do I get to learn something...? - Thu Oct  8 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're rushing yourself too quick. Master the techniques you have thus far and advance at a pace where you don't burden yourself. - Thu Oct  8 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I am merely here to oversee your progress, not to hand you techniques when you haven't mastered the ones you already have. - Thu Oct  8 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yes sir. - Thu Oct  8 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) and his clone continued their assault on one another. With their respective torrents of water clashing at a midpoint, the two strung together other series of handseals and generated even more chakra. From within their body, as their chakras vigorously vibrate to create a spark, they'd raise their hands and unleash a powerful electrical surge.* - Thu Oct  8 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey, I'm getting better aren't I?~ - Thu Oct  8 18:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes were fixated on the skies above, not altering for a second. Reisen's presence was both felt and heard, the go-happy aura that emitted from her engulfing Ortho and her girly voice echoing through his mind. A simple nod of acknowledgment was supplied to the female; that's all Ortho could muster up due to his usual silent way of life. Still, however, with all the efforts shown, he'd speak. "Hello there, Reisen."* - Thu Oct  8 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) really wasn't the affectionate type. Lust was a thing where it can be expelled at will, but affection was something he just didn't learn growing up. With Reisen wrapping her arms around him, the most Ortho could do in response as lean it slightly and raised a single arm to return the grip. It wasn't much, but anyone that knew Ortho could tell that that was the best he's got. "I've missed you too.."* - Thu Oct  8 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a shrug and a slow shake of his head; nothing was really on his mind at the moment. "I'm not sure. I've been doing a lot of meditating lately, and quite frankly I came to an understanding recently." Ortho's voice was subtle and leveled, no emotion granted with each syllable. For the most part, he was just calm and collected like usual. "I wouldn't mind getting a quick battle in; just to see how I fair against your unique ninjutsu."* - Thu Oct  8 22:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head was still raised and his eyes were still fixated at the sky. Luckily for him, the arrival of Misa wasn't too much of an unseen event. With haste, however, upon seeing Misa's preparations, Ortho would alter his stance and pivot backwards to assure safety. [I typed a longer RP, but the RP window crashed. This is what I get for not typing in word doc like I usually do.]* - Thu Oct  8 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) managed to recollect himself; the battle between Misa and Reisen raging on in the meantime. His knowledge of what happened after he pivoted back and was briefly knocked out due to the initial explosive tags was minimum, but from what he could see another person showed up; Hideki. With a look of confusion and anger, Ortho would turn to face Hideki and simply stared.* - Thu Oct  8 23:47:12 2015
