<br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's right eyebrow rose out of skepticism. Did he truly come off as someone that was going to try and mooch off some of her nuts? A simply shrug was given then a nod of understanding, "No thanks anyways." His voice was subtle, showing that he really didn't have intentions on asking for some. "Uhh, name's Ortho. You?"* - Mon Oct 26 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) supplied Chi with another nod, watching her chomp down on nuts after nuts. Eventually, the sight got boring so he would turn his head back and supply a shrug. "Pleasure is mine."* - Mon Oct 26 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "You rank of modesty." Sarcasm was clear in Ortho's voice, Chi's comment only backing up his statement. Nevertheless, she must've had good reason to view another as such; self-confidence wasn't around much anymore. Ortho had no choice but to uphold some form of respect for Chi, a sign that, despite his continuous efforts to devour as much nuts as possible, she was indeed a commendable person. Still, however, Ortho didn't pass such in depth judgment, he has only viewed the cover of Chi's book.* - Mon Oct 26 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's gaze shifted slightly, Chi's reply catching him off guard a bit. He prepared to throw another sarcastic comment at her, but was soon interrupted by Kana's arrival. With a nod, Ortho would accept the scroll and sealed it away. "I take it that you found the basics of the jutsu to be easy?" Ortho's voice was subtle, but interest was identified in his tone. All the while, he kept his head slightly turned to keep Chi in his peripheral line of sight.* - Mon Oct 26 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Of course. - Mon Oct 26 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The level of love Chi had for salted nuts baffled Ortho. In one hand, she refused to share the ones she already had before Ortho could even ask for some. In the other hand, she sought out to buy another pack from him --- she most likely didn't intend to share any of those either. It's not like Ortho wanted any, but it's the principle of it all.

Ortho slowly shook his head, denying the offer of yen. "I don't have any nuts- edible.. salted nuts. Check the vending machines in the village."
* - Mon Oct 26 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Okay, this could completely be Ortho's fault. Here he stood, stationary in a singular spot, with Chi demanding that he accepting money and retrieve a pack or two of salted nuts. Now, how could this possibly be a bad thing? Ortho wasn't a relatively 'nice' person. If anything, he was far from it. In this case, him greeting Chi and engaging in a mellow conversation with her only proved to backfire on Ortho, for now she felt it safe to make such a demanding request of him. Now, his image was shattered by this unknowing female; what could he do?

A sigh of annoyance escapes Ortho as he reached out and accepted the money. He took began scanning the area for a nearby vending machine. After realizing there was none in the immediate area, Ortho would grunt and pace out of the courtyard and head to a known area with a vending machine around. It approximately took Ortho five minutes before he returned with three packs of salted nuts. He handed Chi two and kept the remaining in his grasp. "There you go."* - Mon Oct 26 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his arm lowered, not bothering to grant Chi with the remaining pack of nuts. Little did she know, her money was only able to buy two packs, the third he bought with his own money in an attempt to just mess with the female. A sly smirk formed on his face as he slowly shook his head, denying her.* - Mon Oct 26 13:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was going to fall for the trick up until Chi mentioned the "hand yours over first" bit. The smirk on Ortho's face only grew thicker as he slowly shook his head. He would teasingly transition the packet of salted nuts from one hand to another before juggling it around in just one palm.* - Mon Oct 26 13:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Why arent you with my child... - Mon Oct 26 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: He is here... nina isnt... we have a poblem - Mon Oct 26 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Mon Oct 26 14:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked the packet of nuts in his pants pockets and folded his arms across his chest. For this moment, and this moment only, Ortho shifted his gaze away from Chi. Eventually, as if acknowledging Violet with just visual contact, Ortho would shrug. "She's with Fujitora. They went off to train in some Labyrinth. I wasn't allowed to tag along, so I assured Fujitora that if anything happened to Nina, he might as well hand over his spine on a silver platter."

His gaze tore from Violet and rested back on Chi, smirking at her once more.* - Mon Oct 26 14:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Good...Im glade you understand - Mon Oct 26 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: This shit is creepy af - Mon Oct 26 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I should go train - Mon Oct 26 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his gaze on Chi and simply shook his head, once again denying her access to the packet of nuts. He knew the truth behind the payment of said packet and in turn, used Chi's lack of knowledge to his benefit.* - Mon Oct 26 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugged his shoulders, caring not for whatever business Chi thought he was affiliated with. Still, however, he'd extract that packet of nuts from his pockets and slowly paced himself out of the courtyard. He expected that Chi would follow close pursuit. To ensure that she does, he'd teasingly juggle the packet around once again.* - Mon Oct 26 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: All you're after is girls, sigh. - Mon Oct 26 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) managed to lead Chi to somewhere secluded, fit for him to have a bit of fun. He held the packet of salt up, making sure it was in Chi's line of sight. Upon doing so, after analyzing her response to the visual contact of the packet, Ortho would speak.

"You said you would do anything for this, right?"
* - Mon Oct 26 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The offer before wasn't exactly declined, but shrugged off until Ortho came up with a good enough idea on how he can take full advantage of it. Now that he has that idea set in mind, it was time for fun.

"Alright, then jump."

The smirk on his face only thickened, his boyish lust taking over his peace of mind.
* - Mon Oct 26 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched how Chi made it a priority to secure her kimono. Usually Ortho wouldn't care, but his lust only grew and shrouded his mind. In turn, with her thinking that the task was done, Ortho slowly shook his head. He juggles the packet of nuts around once more, throwing it up in the air and catching it just before it was to hit the ground.

"Lose.. your clothing."
* - Mon Oct 26 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had no idea that females free-balled beneath Kimono's. In fact, he thought they wore skimpy underwear. With that knowledge, Ortho thanked the God he didn't believe in. He'd raise his arm high into the air and alter the grip he had on the packet of nus. Upon doing so, he'd dangle the nuts as if suggesting he'd drop them.* - Mon Oct 26 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is that a 'no, I won't do it'? - Mon Oct 26 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) thinks: The choices. - Mon Oct 26 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head once more. Not even he knew how long he wanted Chi in the nude. To help come to an answer, he'd lower his arm and open the packet of nuts. Ortho takes one out and paced himself closer to Chi, bringing the nut to her lips in an attempt to feed her.

"For however long I choose. Accomodate me and I'll accomodate you. I have enough money to buy you as much salted nuts as you want.~"* - Mon Oct 26 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thought about the second request while taking out another salted nut. He rubbed it against her lower lip before gently inching it into her mouth. "Yes, even milk."* - Mon Oct 26 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk transitioned into a smile. Lust was behind the smile and that was clear. He'd take out another salted nut and gracefully rubbed it against her lips as he leaned in to whisper in her left ear. "You'll see." Upon saying that, he'd allow the nut to enter in mouth and have her eat it at will. Afterwards, he'd hook the front of her kimono and gently tugged; not to pull it off but to suggest that he was waiting for her to take it off.* - Mon Oct 26 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || When Chi untied her belt Ortho reached forward with his left hand, slowly gliding his fingers down her soft skin. It wasn't until she used her arms to cover herself when Ortho's lustful concentration was broken. A sigh escaped the male as he dug into the packet of nuts and took two out, holding it up for Chi to see. Meanwhile, he'd eye her arms before looking up at her face, gesturing that he wanted her to drop her appendages.* - Mon Oct 26 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Rape was never on Ortho's mind, nor will it ever be. Grazing his fingers over her skin for a brief moment was one thing, but what he wanted to do with Chi was another. Rather than blackmailing her, or even bribing her, with the packets of salted nuts, Ortho would gently take her hand and placed the packet in her grasp. He would look her in the eyes then pan over her graceful body. In a low, seductive, voice Ortho spoke. "May I?" The question was obviously to see if she was okay with him making more physical contact.* - Mon Oct 26 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) really wasn't a fan rape. In fact, he despised it so much that he when he inched his hands forward to cup Chi's breasts, he stop and looked her in the eyes once more. "Are.. you sure? I'm not here to force you to do anything." Ortho's voice told that he was sincere as well filled with lust. Self-restraint was also shown in actions, allowing him to assure that Chi was completely willing.* - Mon Oct 26 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was truly caught off guard. Chi's approach to the reassurance was unexpected, but rather welcomed. Ortho's eyes trailed off once more, soaking in the sight of Chi's body as she spoke. "What exactly is it I am responsible for? I've already offered aid in your food and drink. Tell me what else you seek and consider it done." Ortho reached forward, gently cupping Chi's breasts and occasionally fondling her erect nipples. Within the confinements of his pants, Chi would feeling the stiffening and rising of his member. * - Mon Oct 26 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) subtly lowered his hands, allowing his left palm to hover over the back of his right wrist. After applying his chakra in that generic area, a puff of smoke would spawn and in his grasp was a single jutsu scroll. He'd make an attempt to play things off, giving Chi ample time to conceal herself once more. "H-Here.. is a scroll, consider us to have a deal."* - Mon Oct 26 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but smirk while giving Chi a nod. After sealing back the scroll, Ortho would gesture for Chi to follow him southward. He knew of a perfect training ground, secluded and ideal for all forms of regimen. "Let us depart and I shall teach you all I can."* - Mon Oct 26 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Who's that? - Mon Oct 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) did his best to act casual, waving his left hand a singular time toward Mana. "Name's Ortho."* - Mon Oct 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, continuing his attempt to make the scene look casual. He knew that what he and Chi was about to do should be private, and in turn he wasn't going to mention it in front of Mana. If anything, he won't mention it at all in an attempt to not make things awkward. For the most part, however, he simply nodded toward Mana.

"The pleasure is mine, Mana. Chi and I got quite.. acquainted.. thus far. In fact, I'll be taking her to a good area for some training."* - Mon Oct 26 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched Mana's interest peak at the mention of training. Call him selfish, but he was planning on having a one on one session with Chi. Still, however, we hasn't going to turn down the progression of another, so upon the question if Mana can join, then the question if Mana wanted to join, Ortho would supply a shrug and generic smile. "Sure, why not."* - Mon Oct 26 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yaay!!! - Mon Oct 26 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Mana, Ortho gives good massages. - Mon Oct 26 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What kind of massage? - Mon Oct 26 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Mon Oct 26 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had no rebuttal on whether or not Chi decided to continue.* - Mon Oct 26 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Good ones! - Mon Oct 26 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Are they really good, or just good!? - Mon Oct 26 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Mon Oct 26 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Chi can show you. - Mon Oct 26 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained quiet. He was tempted to suggest that he showed Mana rather than verbally telling her, but he simply let Chi and Mana have their discussion.* - Mon Oct 26 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Maybe we should train first and show later? - Mon Oct 26 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... I guess, we can take a bath later after trainin'. - Mon Oct 26 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let us go then? - Mon Oct 26 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, here.. we are. - Mon Oct 26 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What now...? - Mon Oct 26 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Step one, clothes off. - Mon Oct 26 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Makes trainin' easier. - Mon Oct 26 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: H-huh? - Mon Oct 26 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Are you sure? - Mon Oct 26 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened a bit. This was the first time he heard of that stipulation for training, but he complied. He started off by taking off his shirt, revealing his numerous upper body tattoo's, along with his 'sleeve' of body art. Seeing as though Chi said clothes off, he would also strip off his pants and stood before the two females with just his boxers. Obviously his shoes too came off.* - Mon Oct 26 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave Mana and Chi a sly smirk as he eyes wandered between the two. He wasn't modest about attempting to get in as much view as possible, and in turn he managed to give Mana solid answer, "Love it.~" Ortho knew that Chi wanted to learn jutsu's, but he dumbfounded when it came to what Mana requested.

"Uhh, tell me what you two wish to learn. Ninjutsu? Genjutsu? Taijutsu?"* - Mon Oct 26 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Taijutsu. - Mon Oct 26 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Genjutsu an' Mana. - Mon Oct 26 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Aww.. - Mon Oct 26 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Taijutsu for Mana, Genjutsu for Chi. - Mon Oct 26 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Very well then. - Mon Oct 26 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a deep breath and slowly exhaled it. The good part about instructing others was the fact that it helped him hone on his own abilities. He knew that training two people at once was going to be slightly strenuous, but he was willing to suffice the needs of both females. That being said, Ortho prepared himself to instruct Mana first.

To start off, Ortho bent at the knees. His fists balled tightly and in a swift movement he sent a high roundhouse kick. Upon doing so, whilst using his own momentum to help him flow through, Ortho would dip low to send a leg sweep-like attack. "This technique is well known against the Taijutsu community, Mana. The initial kick is high to catch the main attention of the victim. After using the moment of the high kick, you must allow your body to flow into the second kick. Bend on your opposing knee while using the leg you first kicked with to sweep the victim from below." After lecturing the red-head, he'd repeat the process. He also expects, by the second show, Mana would get the jissed of things.

Ortho's attention altered to Chi as he paced forward to close the distance. Within his stride was the slow stringing of handseals, slow enough for Chi to comprehend. "This technique, as you requested, is a Genjutsu. The trigger for it is the handseals and the objective of the Genjutsu is to make the victim believe that there are a massive amount of clones of you. The more they attempt to destroy the clones, the more illusions appear. In turn, if you so choose to use the clones to launch weaponry, you can throw one yourself and catch the victim off guard." By time Ortho had finished his lecture to Chi, he had already ran through the necessary handseals two more times. In which point, he'd expel his chakra outward and force Chi to experience the effects first handedly. It didn't take long for Ortho to break the Genjutsu, causing each illusion of him to vanish.* - Mon Oct 26 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had his arms folded across his chest, watching the two females' progress through their training. For the most part, he had to commend them for the great job they were doing. Chi and Mana were naturals, and in turn they were granted a nod of approval. "Good job you two. You both did great."* - Mon Oct 26 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Have any other taijutsu you can teach me? - Mon Oct 26 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not the taijutsu person, so I don't. Sorry. - Mon Oct 26 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: No. That'd be pampering or something. - Mon Oct 26 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... - Mon Oct 26 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Ortho what was that massage earlier? - Mon Oct 26 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Pamperin'? - Mon Oct 26 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: .... - Mon Oct 26 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, yeah. I suppose, haha. - Mon Oct 26 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I mean, it does help loosen your muscles... - Mon Oct 26 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Kind've.. - Mon Oct 26 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: I did feel kinda' lose, I guess. - Mon Oct 26 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I was thinking more of techniques, or something. - Mon Oct 26 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Ortho got anymore techniques you can show mr or Mana? - Mon Oct 26 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, not at the moment.. - Mon Oct 26 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I was actually going to by a few scrolls, learn them and get back to you two - Mon Oct 26 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: You can buy scrolls? - Mon Oct 26 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Need help studying them... deep? - Mon Oct 26 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I go from village to village and buy what I can- - Mon Oct 26 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sure, Chi. - Mon Oct 26 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tried not to smirk, but one slowly crept on his face.* - Mon Oct 26 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sounds like you two will have fun together. - Mon Oct 26 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Yep~. - Mon Oct 26 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I mean, if.. you want the same massage as I gave Chi.. you could just ask. - Mon Oct 26 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: If it's fine with you both. - Mon Oct 26 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Not much of one for massages I don't think.  - Mon Oct 26 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Unless you can convince me otherwise. - Mon Oct 26 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I suppose I can show you better than I can tell you.. - Mon Oct 26 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: When do you wish to get your massage? - Mon Oct 26 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What is it? - Mon Oct 26 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: If you wish to do so you may, but i'm not moving at all. - Mon Oct 26 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I think it may be best if we all caught our bath. Maybe even take a swim at the beach? - Mon Oct 26 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) points to the body of water nearby.* - Mon Oct 26 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'unno. - Mon Oct 26 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Is that a good idea? - Mon Oct 26 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I want you to feel comfortable and safe, so just tell me what sounds best to you and we'll go with it. - Mon Oct 26 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: It's up to you. I usually just let Chi decide what we do, but she seems to be dozing off. - Mon Oct 26 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. Lets head to the beach. - Mon Oct 26 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turned on his heels to face the beach and paced himself forward.* - Mon Oct 26 22:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a slow, deep, breath and advanced closer. He keeps his eyes focused on Mana, allowing his right hand to reach forth and gently take grasp of her left thigh. Afterwards, he'd have that single leg wrap around his waist; leaving Mana to balance on her right leg against the current. He would reach up to her feminine bust and cautiously cup them, gently squeezing and caressing. Not knowing whether or not she'd reject, he'd keep the pace slow. Eventually, if allowed to continue, he'd put a tad bit of attention to Mana's nipples, gently fondling them for a while before returning to her breasts as a whole.* - Mon Oct 26 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hands continued to roam over Mana's breasts, squeezing and groping ever so often to completely seduce her. His own lust was taking over, and in turn he had to assure himself that he kept things mellow for pace-sake; he didn't want to the flow to be interrupted abruptly. In turn, using his left hand, Ortho would caress Mana's upper stomach and trail down to her pelvis. Upon doing so, while keeping his right hand on her left breast, Ortho would inch closer and closer to her panty protected mound, only gliding a single finger across.* - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The whole point of this massage was to send Mana to her limits without having to engage in penetration. Teasing was the key to ultimate climax, and that was what Ortho aimed for. Despite his own sexual lust, he kept the slow pace up. He trailed his hand lower toward Mana's mound, cupping both her lips and gently separating them through the fabric of her panties. With his own hand fondling his shaft through his boxers, Ortho resorted to biting down on his own lips and concentrating. His opposing hand trailed from one breast to the other, seductively pinching the two erect nipples. He applied just enough pressure to reach the borderline of pain without crossing it.* - Mon Oct 26 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || And as such, after a few more minutes of seductive fondling, Mana reached her end point. Her body going slump from weakness showed Ortho that he completed what he needed. In turn, without his own sexual gratification being met, he enters a state of mine to ease down his erection. Afterwards, while hooking one arm behind Mana's knees and the other behind her back, Ortho carries her to shore and placed her on the sand.

"And that.. is my massage, haha.."
* - Mon Oct 26 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, assuring Mana what she thought happened was real. He folded his arms across his chest and simply looked on. She'd notice that the tent in his boxers was slowly going down, possible proof that penetration was not involved through the sequence.

"Mhm, that's it. Was it something you expected?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood before Toudou, extracting his hands from his palms. Seeing as though Ortho was given the chance to start things, he saw no reason to exactly go ham and ruin the casual flow of things. That being said, he'd pace himself and string together a series of handseals. Whilst doing so, his chakra would knead within his lungs. After puckering his lips and allowing the chakra to charge, Ortho unleashed a devastating gust of wind. (I typed a long RP, but word doc crashed and I couldn't retrieve the original).* - Tue Oct 27 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit as he watched Toudou encased the general area in a ring of fire. Ortho was many things, but a fool wasn't one. By time the ring of fire was to be completed, Ortho would form another set of handseals. During the succession of seals, the chakra within Ortho's lungs would be transferred to his stomach. There, the chakra would liquefy and prepare itself to be launched. It took merely a second for Ortho to repucker his lips and launch a torrent of water to extinguish the flames.* - Tue Oct 27 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's focus was indeed on the fire, but that didn't mean Toudou was overlooked. With the chakrams closing in, Ortho wove another set of handseals together. Upon completing the handseals, Ortho would clamp his hands together, causing a clap. As a result, a gale of wind would exert forward in an attempt to negate the Chakram's movement and possibly push Toudou back in the process.* - Tue Oct 27 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || This is where things got interesting.

It's no longer an hidden fact that Toudou could handle himself in battle, nor is it an hidden fact that Ortho could do the same. At this point, it was a matter of who could out smart who. This time around, however, Ortho knew he'd have to.. double.. his efforts.

The young lad formed a single handseal. In that instance, a shroud of white smoke spawned to his right. Out from within the smoke came an exact duplicate of the male, the figure already forming a series of handseals. The clone, with the chakrams surging forward, made the first move to counter. Upon the handseals completion, the clone would slam both his palms into the sand. As a result, the very foundation of the earth below would rumble. Numerous spikes lift out of the turf, each aimed to either submerge Toudou to render him incapable.

Nevertheless, the chakrams continued surge forward. Ortho, the original, while his clone targeted Toudou directly, would form another series of handseals. Within his stomach was the stirring of his liquefied chakra. The thickness of his chakra turned the liquid into a syrup-like substance. After puckering his lips once again, the original Ortho would unleash a torrent of the thickened water at as much chakrams as he could. Rather than using the syrup to trap someone by the feat, Ortho instead used it thickened stat to trap the airborne weaponry.* - Tue Oct 27 02:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || They say the best way to fight fire is with fire.

The ring of fire made its presence, and it's because of that Ortho retaliated in the manner he did. Both him and his clone wove a set of handseals together. Rather than holding back at the speed in which they formed the handseals, they allowed haste to guide them. With relative ease, both Ortho's completed the sign requirement whilst kneading chakra within their bodies. At the same exact time, they'd pucker their lips and expel two massive fireballs in Toudou's generic area.

Neither the clone nor Ortho was done there. Whilst the fireball's launch, another set of handseals were strung and another kneading of chakra was made. This time around, the chakra was centered in their lungs; a general area for wind based jutsus. That being said, now that the two fireballs were attempting to dethrone the fire rings and rage toward Toudou, both Ortho's would unleash Great Breakthroughs to assist in the size and strength of the fireballs.* - Tue Oct 27 03:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) supplied a shrug of his shoulders. "You speak as if any of us was mourning Hidkei's death. Shin requested that I retell what I knew of the man, and I did just that. Ya'know, I take fond of people like you. The type to think that they can jump in any conversation and add their little opinion in an attempt to ease down whatever imaginary tension they saw. This was a merely a casual conversation. You come off as someone that had some form of anger toward Hideki, rather than, as you say, being his friend."* - Tue Oct 27 05:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but chuckle. The discussion at hand was rather intense. Ortho listened intently to what Reguel had to say, and it didn't take long for him to realize that Reguel was contradiction wrapped in human skin. A simple shrug was given to Reguel, the lecture almost falling on deaf ears. If Ortho was to amuse Reguel any long, surely the brain cells of all spectators would deteriorate at such a rate that both Ortho and Reguel would be charged with attempted murder. "They say it's the contradictions of a man's life that truly shines brighter than the sun." Ortho's voice was subtle, having no emotion in its tone. His eyes momentarily wandered away from Reguel and fixed back on Shin. "I really want to restart our conversation with a  'as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted', but I managed to tell you all I knew before.. that.. jumped into the fray. If there's anything else you wish to know, let me know." Ortho kept Reguel within his peripheral line of sight, not knowing if the male was the type to attack over petty stuff.* - Tue Oct 27 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't going to respond to Reguel, but the flashback of the day in question forced him to. Another chuckle escaped Ortho as he slowly shook his head, amused by the reminder. "Ahh, yes. You're the self-proclaimed pacifist. You're the guy that talked about the sins of this shinobi world and how it should all be changed, but still can't do a damn thing back up what you preach. You're the ideal wingless angel. It's been a while since we lost, has it not?"* - Tue Oct 27 05:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't believe Reguel at first, mainly due to the fact that Kuro and Reguel did indeed share similar characteristics. Nevertheless, Ortho was the type to give everyone the benefit of the doubt so he simply nodded. "Forgive me then.-For mistaking you that is. My opinion on you is congruent to that of the Kuro fellow, but you're more.. modest about the way you are."* - Tue Oct 27 05:38:46 2015
