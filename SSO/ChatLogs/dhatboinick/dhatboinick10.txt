<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The approach of Zenaki was actually surprising; he expected there to be some form rebuttal --- not exactly from her, but from one of the other goofs in the immediate area; all eyes on Mitsuru. Still, however, there was no complain, Erebus simply trailed himself backwards a few paces, expectant of Zenaki's own continuation forth, and turned his back by time he was close enough to the courtyards main entrance, or exit --- dependent on which way you're coming from.* - Sun Sep 27 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The question at hand honestly caught Erebus off guard. Who was her master and what asshole forced someone fresh out of the tyranny of Zetsumo to call them 'master'? Erebus was cruel with his decisions, but not even he would do something like that; well, not outside of the bed. Erebus took fond of his females submitting in bed due to his graceful handy-work; that was beside the point. A grunt of disapproval came from Erebus, but no verbal rebuttal came from him at the word 'master'.

"No, I've come to hold an important discussion with you. It's pertaining to your nephew, Suitengu." Erebus' voice harbored the hints of annoyance, but each syllable was said with patience and, just like his movements, precise fulfillment.* - Sun Sep 27 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Erebus wasn't the type to ask questions about anyone's physical features; mainly because not many things sparked his interest. Of course, by nature, Erebus was observing the body of the woman before him; not in a sexual manner, but to view any sudden movement and possibly take sight of any weaknesses he could take advantage of if a battle was to break out. The numerous scars that riddled Zenaki's body didn't really surprise Erebus; it was the shape of said scars and their locations. Still, however, no judgment was made of Zenaki; everything was just mellow for the most part and calm.

"He branched off from Kirigakure; found it fitting to reside within Konohagakure under my reign. Of course I am no tyrant, but it's only natural that he has some form of family alongside him --- which brings me here. I'm sure you know where I'm going with this.."* - Sun Sep 27 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The word master was said once again. Now, don't get Erebus wrong; the whole sensei and student thing he understood, but the context in which Zenaki was using it could easily be misunderstood. Still, without any judgments being passed on the female, Erebus pursued the topic at hand.

"You are your own person; you don't need permission to do anything you want to do. If you wish to come to Konohagakure and live alongside your nephew then depart with me."* - Sun Sep 27 18:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || It's usually the unknowing and unwanted that cause the most commotion; the lack of knowing what place you have within this Shinobi World and the unwanted feeling once you realize you're no longer needed.

Words can't describe the situation at hand, a mere dilemma within the gates of Konohagakure; a problem that needed to be fixed. Still, however, a problem is only ever a 'problem' when said problem doesn't sit right with the wrong person --- this was that 'problem'. Long story short, however, no warning was given. Erebus strolled up, smeared his gaze over her existence and took action.

Two scythes hung from his neck, both connected by a thick chain; a chain that could be used to tie up wild animals that have yet to be tamed. Erebus took grasp of both, gracefully manipulating his body from the chains' wrapping and seized for his target. The scythe gripped by his right hand jerked forward, aiming to slice through Hanabi's frame at a vertical angle; starting from her upper left shoulder down to her right hip. Following close pursuit, as if in complete sync, the left scythe came in for the jab --- its only purpose was to completely pierce through Hanabi's throat, placing the entirety of her gullet for display like the garden leading to the Hokage's mansion was a museum.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Many factors could be taken into consideration at this point a time. Yes, it didn't take much for Hanabi to open her jaws, but for five thousand snakes to be launched forward instantly, not plausible. Snakes rampaged out of Hanabi's gullet with ease, but that didn't mean Erebus didn't have any form of retaliation. Let's take into consideration that Erebus had a keen sense of sight, allowing him ample time to react to Hanabi's opening jaw.

Upon viewing said opening, whilst attempting to stop the faucet-like pouring of snakes, Erebus alters the grip his has on his right scythe and aimed to drive it straight through Hanabi's opened mouth. Now, Erebus was extremely close to Hanabi by this point and if Erebus was to play the same game as Hanabi, there are many reasons why said attempt could prevail. Unless Hanabi's throat was expandable to the point where five-thousand long snakes could exert from her at ONCE, it'd give Erebus ample time whilst taking some damage. Even then, with the speed at which Erebus was attacking, the amount of snakes being launched forward could be questionable.* - Sun Sep 27 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Lets take things one step at a time.

--- Erebus was met with equal power due to the massive amount of snakes pouring out of Hanabi's throat. This was an amazing feat to say the least, and it deserved the proper commending; Erebus wasn't the person to grant such a thing. With his right scythe poised within Hanabi's mouth, with the snakes continuing to pour out, Erebus would make one last attempt to attack. Seeing as though his left scythe was still at full usage, he'd poise the end of said scythe and drive it toward Hanabi's stomach; all in an attempt to pierce through her stomach.

--- The attacking speed of Erebus was great and so were his reflexes. The snakes rained down on him, that was a given, but with his scythes doing what they were destined to do, despite one going slightly off course, Erebus took it upon himself to dash back as fast as he could. His main concern was to get out of the immediate danger, but not without laying down his last attack.

--- There seemed to be a misunderstanding on things. When it comes to assassinations, speed and precision were key elements; Erebus had both. The snakes were definitely a surprise, but nothing he couldn't handle. As a sacrificial piece, Erebus would leave both his scythes within Hanabi's body and create as much distance as he could.* - Sun Sep 27 20:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) found that this situation was all too sticky for a last effort to kill the woman. There was no reason to stand idly by and having the snakes rampage on him, so with a quick tug of his scythe, using the momentum gathered in an attempt to dash back, Erebus went to create as much room as possible. Yes, he'd be bombarded by snakes from below, but to specifically go after his ears and eyes, let s be realistic. Even so, with his scythe no longer bound by her cheek, Erebus made it a priority to slash away at as many stacks as possible whilst his departure attempt.* - Sun Sep 27 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was bombarded by snakes. They relentless sieged after him, giving Erebus no break and room to get away. Still, however, an attempt was made. From spectating the scenario at hand, he knew that the most he could do was evade to the best of his ability and tank as much as he could. Pierce wounds riddled his body and the closest thing to his eyes and ears were multiple gashed across his face and neck; he was still alive though --- thank you Lord Jashin.

Eventually, the snakes would subside and Erebus would take a kneel, panting slightly.* - Sun Sep 27 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I had practice under Zetsumo. I had to lie non-stop to keep him from torturing me or making me eat peoples' flesh. - Mon Sep 28 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I mean, maybe a lie here and there when I'm forced to...but with you for example? I never do. - Mon Sep 28 15:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo taught me that. Not intentionally though. He was never very good at it, because he never realized this. - Mon Sep 28 15:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He tried to play with my emotions but it was always pathetic. - Mon Sep 28 15:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yes the point I was trying to make is...I "did" lie. I "was" a con artist. Under Zetsumo. - Mon Sep 28 15:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only Flexus and Hanabi come to mind. And the person in Kirigakure. I've seen and done an awful lot of things. If the people you kill aren't either my friends or my tools, it doesn't concern me enough to take note of them. - Mon Sep 28 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In a general basis, what do Flexus and Hanabi have in common? As far as why I killed them. - Mon Sep 28 15:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || It's funny how things worked now a days. Trust was nothing more than a piece to a game board while lying was the name of the game. No matter what you do, no matter the person, everyone played that game. Erebus, on the other hand, found himself learning the rules of this game, and he was learning from an unlikely veteran. Even an immortal can get played.

An annoyed sigh came from Erebus, the words of Katsune doing nothing to sooth him. Still, however, it wasn't her fault that she was only describing. With a slow shake of his head and an inflamed look in his eyes, Erebus glances toward Katsune.* - Mon Sep 28 16:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' snapped up, rising to his sides. His form resembled that of a King leading his soldiers into battle, displaying the true authority the God of Death had over the troops he paid for in full. Each and every troops turns to Kilm, poising their gaze on the males' frame.* - Mon Sep 28 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I really wanted to tell him that we'll settle this later though I have no time. - Mon Sep 28 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I ain't taking risks . . . Fleeing is the only option. - Mon Sep 28 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || There was ultimately no reason for Kilm to suffer for the deeds of Katsune. Erebus supplied those two with everything they desired. They asked him to save their home and allow them to thrive together, he gave that. They asked him to not end their lives on a whim, he allowed them to live. Still, however, Katsune led the one that loved her most into destruction. Believe it or not, Erebus deemed that as a sin. A sin that wouldn't be able to be repented, no matter the multitude of begging one does.

A sigh escaped from Erebus as he watched Kilm submerge into the ground, it was clear that Erebus was clearly hurt by the unraveling of these events. His arms found themselves folded across his chest once more and his head slightly raised. Erebus' eyes fixated on the sky and words could be heard coming from him.

"Forgive me, my lord. I begged for you to allow them into your kingdom, but they even disappoint me. No more, my lord.. no more. From this point forward, you will no longer be placed on the back burner, but on the only fire abailable."* - Mon Sep 28 20:37:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Since it feels like you cut your ties with Konohagakure this way. - Mon Sep 28 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Katsune is the Hokage, so if you the person holding the military cut your ties with her. - Mon Sep 28 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then there would be two sides. - Mon Sep 28 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There wouldn't be two sides. - Mon Sep 28 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It'd be her and Kilm against Konohagakure. - Mon Sep 28 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Katsune was just the title holder, I was and still am the true Hokage.. - Mon Sep 28 20:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I found Katsune and Kilm lost in Genjigakure, a village south of here. I talked with them and found out their dreams and goals in life; they were both lost mentally and physically.  - Mon Sep 28 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Little by little I noticed the people that I forewarned were waltsing into the village.. - Mon Sep 28 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Claiming that Katsune was putting hits on me.. - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I would like you to take care of Katsune for me, and that would leave an opening for me to take care of Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 21:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd say so. - Mon Sep 28 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well, I was told that Katsune killed one of our clansmen, and when I confronted Kilm about it, he dodged the question. So that only proves my assumption. - Mon Sep 28 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..It's hard trying to interpret you when you fail to provide names.. - Mon Sep 28 21:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Such is the mortal life.. - Mon Sep 28 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Kilm isn't on my hitlist.. - Mon Sep 28 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Katsune, however, bumped herself from nonexistent to one and only. - Mon Sep 28 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Mon Sep 28 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Should I be warry of any of his techniques? - Mon Sep 28 22:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No one outruns death. - Mon Sep 28 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Point made. - Mon Sep 28 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: All due respect, not to throw salt on the wound, Hanabi is a prime example. - Mon Sep 28 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ..... - Mon Sep 28 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Again.. not to throw salt on the wound. - Mon Sep 28 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Afterall.. it was Katsune that hinted me toward her death. - Mon Sep 28 22:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hello, Paine. - Mon Sep 28 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head nonchalantly, sighing at the fact that he had to reexplain.

"Long story short..? They double crossed me. I asked for honesty and trust from them, instead I got betrayal."* - Mon Sep 28 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm...long s-story...i-im usually l-left out of w-what happens in a village.... - Mon Sep 28 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wouldn't mind explaining everything to you, just didn't think you'd want to hear. - Mon Sep 28 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: What do we have here? - Mon Sep 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Eh, hey there. . . Guys. - Mon Sep 28 22:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A weird place to have a conversation don't you think? - Mon Sep 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: i-is it? - Mon Sep 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, maybe that's just my opinion. - Mon Sep 28 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) remained quiet, allowing Paine to possibly expand your friendship horizon.* - Mon Sep 28 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands into his pants pockets.* - Mon Sep 28 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, honestly..? - Mon Sep 28 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I really don't.. - Mon Sep 28 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll keep an eye open for you though. - Mon Sep 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Katsune got it from Orakuru, but he's dead. . . So asking her won't work either. - Mon Sep 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Thank you. - Mon Sep 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'll let the two of you resume your conversation. It was rude of me to break it in the first place. - Mon Sep 28 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looks over at Paine, giving her the best genuine smile he could.* - Mon Sep 28 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) snatches the scroll dropped by the random messenger bird and unravels it. After reading its content, Erebus would look up at Paine. "Hey, listen. I have some information I need to gather. I'll be sure to update you." With that, Erebus dashed off.* - Mon Sep 28 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' arrival was no less than loud and abrupt, but not in the manner you'd think. The smell of Death and Blood introduced themselves before Erebus did. Not to mention the clinking of the chain connecting his scythes by the hilts that dangled down his neck. Erebus, himself, was nonchalant with his step; having his palms tucked in his pockets and a lean to his posture. His eyes fixed on Katsune, a single smirk forming.

"Only a few hours, but it feels like years.."* - Mon Sep 28 23:34:24 2015
