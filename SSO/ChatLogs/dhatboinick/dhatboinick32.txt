<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It doesn't leave much room for hanging out and leisure time. - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could train with you and maybe critique you, if you'd like. Otherwise Trilliam is someone you'd probably liket o go hang out with. He's a fun guy. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: He didn't. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucks his hands away within the confinements of his pants pockets. He turns his head back and looks off into the distance, allowing the angry expression to slip off of his face. Ortho's eyes lower a bit as he glared down at the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a hit off his blunt, allowing the excess smoke to seep from his nostrils. He remains quiet in the spot he currently was, watching Yan storm off due to an emergency. Ortho's eyes trailed to Nina, watching her reaction.* - Mon Nov  2 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released a sigh, taking a step forward in Nina's direction. "Oi, how about me and you train?"* - Mon Nov  2 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked over at Fujitora. "Let Hassan know I'm taking Nina with me to Konohagakure." With that, Ortho would turn and head to the Caravan lot. There, he pays for a caravan to take them both to the Hidden Leaf.* - Mon Nov  2 22:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked away his hands, placing them in his pants pockets. Once Trilliam began walking, he'd follow close pursuit.* - Tue Nov  3 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm. - Tue Nov  3 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a hit off the blunt, audibly exhaling the excess smoke. "Alright, Trilliam. I'm going to take it that Lightning is a, or one, of your natural affinities. That being said, this shouldn't be a problem for you to learn. It's a C-Ranked lightning jutsu, but it's as simple as it gets." Ortho extracts his hands, brings them to chest-level and began slowly forming a set of handseals. This set was necessary to activate the jutsu in question. "Your chakra flow must spike suddenly. Don't ease into it, but make a sudden push so the vibration would spark something from within. At that point, allow your arms to be the main source of conduction. Once you've done that, stretch your arms out. The rest, you must figure out on your own."

As Ortho instructed Trilliam, he'd make sure to keep a slow pace of the handseals being formed. This session would be useless if Trilliam wasn't able to comprehend and master the necessary handseals. Just as he lectured, Ortho would use his arms as a conductor after sparking his chakra. He'd raise his appendages and allow the Earth Flash to surge toward the side of the mountain, causing a small explosion and a miniature rock slide.* - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took another hit off his blunt. "That's the only lightning style I know, kid. Sorry."* - Tue Nov  3 00:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a hit off the blunt, audibly exhaling the excess smoke. "Alright, Nine. I'm going to take it that Lightning is a, or one, of your natural affinities. That being said, this shouldn't be a problem for you to learn. It's a C-Ranked lightning jutsu, but it's as simple as it gets." Ortho extracts his hands, brings them to chest-level and began slowly forming a set of handseals. This set was necessary to activate the jutsu in question. "Your chakra flow must spike suddenly. Don't ease into it, but make a sudden push so the vibration would spark something from within. At that point, allow your arms to be the main source of conduction. Once you've done that, stretch your arms out. The rest, you must figure out on your own."

As Ortho instructedNina, he'd make sure to keep a slow pace of the handseals being formed. This session would be useless if Nine wasn't able to comprehend and master the necessary handseals. Just as he lectured, Ortho would use his arms as a conductor after sparking his chakra. He'd raise his appendages and allow the Earth Flash to surge toward the side of the mountain, causing a small explosion and a miniature rock slide.* - Tue Nov  3 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself off. He turns his head to look at Marrisa, giving her a stern look. "May I have a word?"* - Tue Nov  3 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) casually sits himself down at the table.* - Tue Nov  3 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a solid hit off his blunt, allowing the excess smoke to seep through his nostrils. "Do.. you know why I hate the Gezo so much?" His voice was calm and collected, but anger was also detectable.* - Tue Nov  3 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised his hand to his mouth, placing the blunt in between his index and middle fingers. He takes a subtle hit off of the rolled up herb, giving it a glance and nod. "Maybe I've come off wrong in the past, ya'know?" Ortho continues to look at the blunt, but he was obviously talking to Marrisa. The anger that once trailed in his tone was gone and replaced with no emotions at all. "Maybe I've worked so hard to give you everything, but in turn screwed you over. Maybe.. I should've been the type of guy that made you choose between me and your loyalty to Sunagakure.. Maybe, Marrisa, it was my love that led to you losing your arm."

Ortho's volume remained low and his demeanor remained relaxed.
* - Tue Nov  3 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, leaning forward and placing the lit blunt on the wooden table. He closes his eyes momentarily and lowers his head a bit then begins speaking. "A choice between myself and your loyalty to this place is something I'd never put before you. I think of things as the whole village system that forces a shinobi like yourself to feel that it's necessary to take a exams for a mere rank at the cost of what? Your life..? Your arm? Quite honestly, the Gezo and their entire ordeals over this shinobi world is bullshit."

Ortho begins chuckling. The chuckle wasn't from amusement, but the feelings he had rampaging on the inside of him. Tears could be seen pouring from his eyes and landing on the table before him. "I promised myself that no matter what I'll be there to protect you and Nina. We are ninja's of this Shinobi World, I accept that.. I acknowledge that and embrace it, but no amount of embracing and acknowledgment would allow me to come to mends with myself that the female I love the most went to some stupid ass exams and lost an arm.. No amount of acceptance could prepare my heart for that.. To know I let you down.."

His head rises, his eyes slowly opening. His black pupils were replaced with crimson red. A single dot of black was at the center with one tomoe swirling around it. "No.. amount of acceptance.."* - Tue Nov  3 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes trail down to Marrisa's approaching hand. He was truly conflicted at this point. If he accepted her hand then he's agreeing to allow her to continue walking down this unforgiving path. If he took her hand, he's agreeing to allow her to progress forward with him in the dangers to come. Despite what Marrisa said he couldn't do, he couldn't put his love her aside and allow her to do such a thing. He inched his own hand forward, gripping hers and gently pushed it back.

"I can't.. allow you to do this anymore. I want to take your burden, your determination and goals.. I want to take it and throw it over my shoulders, and run with it. I want to be the one that holds your name so high the very gods and Gezo's will have no choice but to raise their head to look at it. You've done enough. You've lived your life as a shinobi, and it is time.. you stopped. You got the rank you trained so hard for, you've done enough.."* - Tue Nov  3 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes trail down to Marrisa's approaching hand. He was truly conflicted at this point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would remain quiet. Each word Marrisa spoke was heard, analyzed and registered. He compassion for being a shinobi was understandable to the max, but his compassion to assure her safety was just as strong has her determination to continue her career.

"I want you to trust me." Ortho's words weren't in a angry tone, nor was it in a sad tone.. it was more of a 'ha, got you' tone. The type that only had the intention to be simple, sweet and direction, the type to make a person have no real reply.* - Tue Nov  3 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, test(TenaciousRiven) says: denied - Tue Nov  3 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, test(TenaciousRiven) says: his love - Tue Nov  3 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. Marrisa's statement was the last words to this book. He couldn't risk it. No matter what, he couldn't look within himself and allowed her to continue forth on the same path as him. His eyes momentarily close. He stands to his feet and takes hold of his blunt once more, placing it at the left corner of his lips.

"I understand, Marrisa." Ortho's eyes open and his natural black pupils were seen. He gives her one last nod before pacing to the exit. "Our path, as shinobi, can't cross. I'm going to destroy as many representatives of the Gezo as I can, rid them from the face of this Shinobi World. I know I'm going to die in the end, and in turn I'm not going to allow you to be at my side. You're right when you said you chose to walk your path. Forgive me for trying to make you think otherwise." With that, he'd attempt to leave.* - Tue Nov  3 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) makes his way to the Caravan lot, handing a random driver a wad of cash. "To Kumogakure."* - Tue Nov  3 07:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: To be able to do this while the village is on high alert means it was a very proficient shinobi. - Tue Nov  3 07:07:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's stroll came to a halt. He just arrived in the village and has no idea what's going on. He notices the chaos amidst, but the cause was unknown. Upon his arrival to the main street leading to the Mizukage's Mansion, he's stopped by Nina.

"Ehh, what happened here?"* - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..An explosion. - Tue Nov  3 07:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Now. - Tue Nov  3 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: No one. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: The village has yet to recover from the tragedy. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is it really expected for us to? It's been only a little bit.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks toward Nina. "You right. So, yeah. This isn't any of my business soooo," he'd turn on his heels and head back to the exit. "I'm out."* - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Those two. Scum. Both of them. - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He doesn't care. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stops, turns on his heels once more. He pulls out a massive wad of cash, a million or two in sum and handed it to Heiwa. "Make use it of it."

Ortho's focus transitions to Marco. "Fuck your suspicion. None of this is my business, hence why I'm still alive. I mind my own and protect my little sister. That's all I do, that's all I care about. You're in a major village in a major country. Mourning the death of a 'illegal' Mizukage is the 'last' thing you need to do. Find out what happen, accept it, move on, try again."* - Tue Nov  3 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a slow, deep breath. Marco's words echoes through Ortho's head, a smirk slowly forming on his face. Heiwa was at a safe distance and Nina was a fair length away. Marco didn't really have an impact on Ortho, but this chaos and lack of morals from the military power of Kirigakure is what truly made Ortho fond of this current situation.

In turn, the games began, Ortho dashed backwards. His hands rose to chest level and a multitude of seals were strung. In alliance with such, a massive manifestation of chakra within his chest is made. In a split second, Ortho would unleash a massive fireball forward. His aim was not at the four shinobi before him, but the military power that was once supposed to protect Kirigakure.

Following the Fireball, with haste, Ortho would pucker his lips and form another series of handseals. This time around, he'd unleashed a powerful gust of wind. He's sway his head from left to right, aiming to use the massive wind to aid his fire in covering a massive amount of area.* - Tue Nov  3 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: What happened now? - Tue Nov  3 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: What are you doing?! - Tue Nov  3 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Another string of handseals came after Ortho bit down on his thumb and smeared the crimson blood on his opposing palm. An audibly chuckle sounds as he side steps Nina, not bothering to pay attention to her. His mission was clear and her attempting to stop him is futile. Once creating enough distance, he'd slam his palm on to the ground and allowed his chakra to flux.

Out from a massive puff of smoke came Manda himself. On his head was Ortho with another series of handseals stringing together.

Ortho: "Avoid the children, take out the military power!"

Manda: "YOU OWE ME FOR THIS, ORTHO!"

Ortho: "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

Manda slithers through the mass of shinobi, taking out a considerate amount to place the casualty count five times higher than what Ortho could do on his own.

Ortho, whilst on Manda's head top would unleash another fireball aimed to take out stray shinobi that may have escaped Manda's wrath.* - Tue Nov  3 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Manda, with Ortho on top of his head, raged toward the exit. In their path was the last bit of Kirigakure's military forces. Of course, as they attempted to leave the village all together, they handle the defiant troops. Ortho would take care of the shinobi trailing behind as Manda crashed through the shinobi in front. This was the perfect guerilla warfare.* - Tue Nov  3 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: i want a different icon for my hat :| but idk where my shit is - Tue Nov  3 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) steps out of one of the few abandoned housing. He was dressed in a black cloak that hid most of his frame, the tail stopping above his ankles. He held a blunt in the left corner of his mouth, taking a hit off of it every so often. As he paced back into the empty streets of this small settlement, he'd stop to take a moment and analyze the generic area. "Hmm, safe place to hide out I suppose.."* - Tue Nov  3 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed, his focus settling on the figure before him. It took only a glance for Ortho to come to the decision that this person was of the female species, the purple locks aiding in such a analysis. His arms fold across his chest, his cloak masking such actions; seeing as though his arms weren't exactly trailed within the sleeves. An audible cough is given to the female in the distance, an attempt from Ortho to gather her attention.* - Tue Nov  3 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The presence of this female didn't bother Ortho, it was her silence. A small acknowledgment was given to him, but only in the soundless efforts of a visual glance. He slowly shakes his head, allowing her to continue he lopsided contest with the bush. In the meantime, while keeping his movements subtle, Ortho inched forward. No sudden movements just calculated steps to close the distance between himself and the female.* - Tue Nov  3 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's pace continued until he was on the other side of the bush. He kneels slightly, getting down to her level and looking at the vegetation life. "So, you're going to tell me what's so special about this or are do you just have a grudge against the bush?" Ortho's voice was subtle, almost comedic.* - Tue Nov  3 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) has seen plenty of people that lacked the normal amount of pigmentation, but this female before him must've been born with none. On top of that, she must put on sunblock.. in the house.. with all lights off.. at midknight. Still, this was the shinobi world. Ortho just got done destroying half a village with a massive purple talking snake; he has no right to judge the female before him.

"..What is it saying..?" Ortho whispers as he leans his head to the side a bit, implying he was trying to listen too.* - Tue Nov  3 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) opened his mouth to reply to the female, but he sudden movements forced him to look up. To his surprise, Nina launched several bullets forward, and before he was able to counter he was hit. Still, however, he managed to form an 'x' with his arms and take the blunt of the damage. The concussive impact sent him flying back a few feet as he skids across the ground.

Once friction one the battle it and Ortho's body, the male would stagger to his feet and smirk. "Hell of a impact Nina. Now stop playing around.."* - Tue Nov  3 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm not playing, what the hell was that!? - Tue Nov  3 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You think you can do things like that and get away with it? What if you hurt Violet or Lera?!? - Tue Nov  3 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: And what if she had hurt me? Only care who gets hurt when she knows them, then? - Tue Nov  3 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You know what. - Tue Nov  3 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shakes off his arms, wanting the numbness to subside sooner than later. "Why do you think I left before either of them showed up? To prepare for the future, Kirigakure.. You must kill of what remains of the past.  Only then can you move on. Those were my last words before leaving. You and I both know Kirigakure isn't want it used to be. I anything I did it a favor! I gave it two million in funds and I took out its failed military. If anything, they owe me." Ortho takes a single step forward. "And you come to attack me?! After I made sure to keep you out of danger back there!?"* - Tue Nov  3 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I have had it with these monkey fighting androids. In this monday to friday timeline! - Tue Nov  3 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest. He shrugs, not caring for the male's induction into the group. "Whatever, Nina. I'll remember your attempt of killing me next time you're hungry and have no money.." He slowly shakes his head, placing his focus on the figure. "I don't know who she is. I was trying to find out before someone went all brother-homocidal."* - Tue Nov  3 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked at Nina like she was a spoiled brat. The money part was fine, so he complied with giving her half a million. The kiss, hell no. "I'm not stupid. I go to kiss you on the forehead and I have a kunai through my heart." He slowly shook his head, chucking the pouch of money to the girl.

As for Ume, he'd simply nod head. He didn't bother to repeat the name, for if it was meant to be said out loud then it would've happened as such.* - Tue Nov  3 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Jeez, can't even get a kiss from my brother. - Tue Nov  3 10:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey Thaenan, show him what you can do. - Tue Nov  3 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a step forward.* - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, Thaenan. - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) says: Why....do you want your brother to kiss you? - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: W-....What? - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It was a joke. - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Because I knew he wouldn't do it. - Tue Nov  3 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head as he glanced over at Ume. "Uhh.. so like.. Where are you from?"* - Tue Nov  3 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Kirigakure? - Tue Nov  3 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see- - Tue Nov  3 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Tue Nov  3 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov  3 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 10:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || And so the fun began. Ortho paces backwards. His hands inched to chest-level as they began weaving a series of handseals together. His chakra swells within his stomach, churning and kneading. A secondary source of chakra distributes itself to his brain, activating his ocular prowess.

As a result, his one black pupils transition into a crimson red. A single tomoe swirling around a black dot-like circle.  At that moment, which his chakra ready to burst, Ortho would unleash several air bullets, each aimed to take Thaenan out.* - Tue Nov  3 10:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck it. - Tue Nov  3 10:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'll take them both on. - Tue Nov  3 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ewwwwwwy - Tue Nov  3 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't care what Thaenan had to say. The mud wall came forth, and the mud wall was going to crumble. Another succession of handseals was made. Ortho generates chakra within his hands before crouching down and slamming his palms into the ground. As a result, the very foundation of the area would rumble. In turn, massive spikes protrude from beneath the earth in an attempt to rampage on the boy. The spikes were coming from below, so in turn the mud wall would be rendered useless.* - Tue Nov  3 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't done by a long shot. His pacing went slant and his focus remained on Thaenaan. Nina wasn't her target so he made it a mission to apprehend her before he moved on to him. That being said, after kneading chakra and weaving the necessary handseals, Ortho slams his palms into the ground once more. As a result, a massive earth corridor would form over Nina, completely encasing her.

From there, as if suffering no delay, Ortho would alter his chakra nature to wind he puckers his lips, forms a series of handseals and inhaled. As Thaenan attempted to pace off, Ortho would unleash a powerful gust of wind to knock the boy off his feet.* - Tue Nov  3 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: What're we gonna do about a leader? If anyone found out that our Mizukage is dead, and if we have enemies, they'll surely strike. - Tue Nov  3 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) steps out from one the abandoned buildings. He was dressed in a thick black cloak. The collar of the cloak was buttoned to keep the robe on his body; that being the only support to it staying on his body. His arms are not stitched through the sleeves, giving off the effect that he has no arms. Instead, his hands were tucked away within the confinements of his pockets. A nonchalant lean was to his posture and each step he took was more lackadaisical than the last.

Upon his arrival to the main street of this small settlement, he came to find Kana standing off in the distance. "Ahh, you've made it.."* - Tue Nov  3 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head. "Mybad.."* - Tue Nov  3 18:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks into the village square. He's dressed in a black cloak, his hands aren't stitched through the sleeves and the only support the cloak had to cling to his body was a single button on the collar. Ortho eyes immediately fixed itself on Marrisa, but he says nothing.* - Tue Nov  3 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Who's that guy? - Tue Nov  3 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's my boyfirend Ortho. .  - Tue Nov  3 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: boyfriend* - Tue Nov  3 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noticed the arm, but doesn't say anything about it. No form of emotion was displayed on his visage, just his usual blank expression. Without saying a word, he'd use a head gesture to request that Marrisa follow him.* - Tue Nov  3 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, he doesn't seem too friendly. - Tue Nov  3 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, anytime. - Tue Nov  3 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turned on his heels, pacing himself southward.* - Tue Nov  3 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) enters the house and immediately went to sit down. He reaches up to the collar of his cloak and undoes the button. As the cloak dropped to his side, he'd take in a deep breath and release an audible sigh.* - Tue Nov  3 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's expression was blanker than it has ever been. The smile from Marrisa was acknowledged visually, but not returned. It was clear that Ortho was more emotionally absent than he has ever been, and in turn his words world bland and blunt.

"No Kirigakure shinobi is innocent." Ortho's tone was cold but subtle; a solid mix between the two that only enhanced the proof that he lacked any real emotions.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head slowly. He breaks eye contact with Marrisa, placing his visual focus on the table between them. "Nina originates from Kumogakure, but the two females that adopted her are from Kirigakure. Lera and Violet." Ortho purposely skipped his answer to Marrisa's comment about the children; he didn't know if children died, nor did he care.* - Tue Nov  3 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his gaze on the table as he listened to Marrisa. "I've done what I must to begin the process of reshaping this shinobi world. That.. is all I have to say about this subject." Ortho raised his head slightly, allowing the back of his skull to rest against the wall. His gaze, in turn, transitioned from the table to the ceiling. "It is.. good.. to see you have acquired a new arm."* - Tue Nov  3 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) subtly nods his head.

"Nice, nice. Now you can continue serving your village."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That being said.. I'm going to say no. - Tue Nov  3 20:39:28 2015
