<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Oh. - Wed Dec  9 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'll calm down, WHEN YOU UPHOLD YOUR END OF THE DEAL. - Wed Dec  9 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I didn't agree to anything. - Wed Dec  9 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: To be honest. - Wed Dec  9 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: You made the deal with me. - Wed Dec  9 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: So technically. - Wed Dec  9 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sly-kun, I'm going to bite you now. Kay?  - Wed Dec  9 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: I'm at fault. - Wed Dec  9 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) dashed forward, stretching his arm out and allowed her to clamp down on his flesh. He winces a bit, releases a growl of pain and looked at her.

"E-Enough."* - Wed Dec  9 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took grasp of Yuriko's arm after he halted her movement. Course, with her covered in oil, he'd moreso attempt to grab and piece of clothing he could. In a swift movement he'd attempt to spin her around. Upon doing so, while keeping the grip, he'd then go to hoist her over his right shoulder.'

"We're not doing this. This is pointless. Raikage, you said some of the prisoners do indeed deserve death, grant her those," he looks over his shoulder, if he did make it this far, and Yuriko --- or her ass that was now in the air, "relax yourself Yuriko."* - Wed Dec  9 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: They're going to fuck. - Wed Dec  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) inched his heel over it.

My ninja, my ninja.* - Wed Dec  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) thinks: She's a biter. - Wed Dec  9 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't care for her skirt or panties at the moment, his focus was to calm things down. He backs up a few feet to make space between them and Eiyu, "this ends here."

With that he paced off, lightly scolding Yuriko.* - Wed Dec  9 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Nearly two years you haven't showed up, then you come and do this.. - Wed Dec  9 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: How can I defend you when you eat people, Yuriko? - Wed Dec  9 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....where are you going!? I need my bodies like was promised! - Wed Dec  9 05:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hmph. - Wed Dec  9 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) led her straight to the bathroom, placing her in the tub.

"There is soup hanging from the shower head, get cleaned up."

He turns his back.* - Wed Dec  9 05:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't have to kill him. - Wed Dec  9 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I got him to go with me to attack Kiri. - Wed Dec  9 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he got deads. - Wed Dec  9 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, nodding a bit.* - Wed Dec  9 06:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Just to get him killed? - Wed Dec  9 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No I attacked Kirigakure for a reason. - Wed Dec  9 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But he just happened to come along and I saw an opportunity. - Wed Dec  9 06:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why won't he uphold his end of the deal? - Wed Dec  9 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They are trying to back out when we made a deal, I healed Sly-kun for making the deal. - Wed Dec  9 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Even as much as I like you I will have to do something about this if they don't give me what I want. - Wed Dec  9 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: We have bodies laying around at the border, do you not want those? - Wed Dec  9 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That wasn't part of our deal and those have been laying out for ages.. I want my deal and I want them fresh. - Wed Dec  9 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed a bit and slowly shook his head.* - Wed Dec  9 06:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't shake your head at me. - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They made a deal and I gave them something in return for the deal being made. - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's brow rose.* - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Besides they aren't going to bury the dead anyhow. - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What is wrong with me having them? - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: They don't even have to execute them. - Wed Dec  9 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Tease-kun is an asshole. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You gave Takuma the deal, Yuriko. As much of a fuck up that was on Takuma's part, you can't expect the Raikage to do that. On the other hand, yeah.. he's an asshole for that. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I might as well sneak her a prisoner or two.. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Ughh.. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He made the deal on this village's behalf. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Let me.. talk to him- - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And it saved this village a mighty lot of losses in children. - Wed Dec  9 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Just fucking saying. - Wed Dec  9 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Just let me talk to him, Yuriko.. - Wed Dec  9 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stepped to the side.

"Whatever you want."* - Wed Dec  9 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This isn't even my responsibility. - Wed Dec  9 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Wed Dec  9 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Raikage, please.. allow me to handle her case.. - Wed Dec  9 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If thats what you want. - Wed Dec  9 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: The situation at hand is complicated and I understand the views of you both. Whether or not the deal was made with you, a deal was made at Takuma's expense. The fixing of his arm for the prisoners we have. Now, of course the logic that -you- didn't make the deal with her can be applied, but I feel as though if we grant her the prisoners that are already deemed 'dead', there is no problem. - Wed Dec  9 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And quite honestly we, as Kumogakure, have a lot of those prisoners. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not saying we give her people that are waiting for trial, but the ones that have been trialed and got all the chances they can possibly get.. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Takuma's arm.. is a fair deal. - Wed Dec  9 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The way I see it is. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: She had no business for injuring him anyway. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Thus healing him was expected. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's along the lines of. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Me punching someone in the jaw, and then trying to fix it and demand money. - Wed Dec  9 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: But if a treaty was made between Takuma and Yuriko on that matter, resolving it before the deal was made.. then the whole situation is nulled. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It's using locked evidence in a case.. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'm.. stupid for doing this.. but.. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Do it.. at my expense, Raikage. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow her the death-ridden prisoners and I'll personally keep an eye on things. - Wed Dec  9 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can understand if this was to help you. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It is.. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But why would you go out of your way to help her when she's cased nothing but trouble? - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Because I made a promise to her.. and to myself. She doesn't know the promise but I'm a Savage of Kumogakure.. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: My word is my bond. - Wed Dec  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You are my Chuunin. I leave this dispute in your hands. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The second. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You try to kill my shinobi. - Wed Dec  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: *Sigh* - Wed Dec  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nevermind. - Wed Dec  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded, commending Eiyu. "Once again, gratitude."

He placed his gaze on Yuriko, "let's go.."* - Wed Dec  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Of course he walked off, expecting her to follow.* - Wed Dec  9 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You have what you need. - Wed Dec  9 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I wait two years to collect on the deal and this happens. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I was so kind. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Kindness gets you no where. - Wed Dec  9 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) simply facepalmed.* - Wed Dec  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: See ya. - Wed Dec  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gave it his best shot. Him as a peacemaker was like a brick trying to perform photosynthesis, just something that doesn't happen. He slowly shook his head and watches Yuriko walk off, Eiyu's comment only making him that much more annoyed. The situation was handled and the deal was fine, Yuriko got what she wanted and Eiyu continued to assert authority --- how did this turn to shit?

"Pathetic," he mutters to himself. It wasn't to any specific person, but the general situation. "How the hell do we beat someone that considers themselves a 'weapon'..? Shit just don't make sense," he continues.* - Wed Dec  9 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No-one cares, talk is cheap. - Wed Dec  9 06:57:42 2015

"Let's just calm down here and understand we have emotions high. We just came from war, you're hungry.. or something. I'm missing my future wife.. Okay? So let's just go to that prison and I'll let you eat those death-row prisoners."* - Wed Dec  9 07:01:07 2015

"I suppose you're right on that.."* - Wed Dec  9 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head this time.

"It's completely fine. When you're right, you're right. No way around that." He smirks a bit and shrugs. "Not too many brutally honest people like you."* - Wed Dec  9 23:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) arrives at the legendary bridge of Kirigakure. His visual focus shifts from left to right, then from up to down --- taking in as much of the sight as he can. It was clear that he was here on a mission, and he was determined to fulfill it the best of his abilities. Course, this was high risk and he knew sooner or later his card would be drawn --- it was just a matter of when and where it'll happen.

Once crossing the bridge he'd waste no time in bringing his hands together and forming handseals, tying his fingers together in a multitude of ways. Just then, as his feet finally met the earth of Kirigakure, since the bridge was to allow him to travel over water, he'd begin to sink. At this point, Sogeki aimed to infiltrate the village hidden in the mist.* - Thu Dec 10 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) swam underground for a bit.

When his checkpoint was reached, which was close to the main gathering area of the village, he'd slowly ascend. Of course he didn't do it abruptly, but rather slowly and cautiously. The last thing he wanted was to attract attention as a foreigner poking his head up from beneath the ground. Luckily for him, he finds a decently sized tree --- this gave him the opportunity to casually extract himself from the ground and act as though he was just relaxing at the base of the tree.

Once the coast was clear, after casually looking from left to right and up to down, he'd stand to his feet and moderately pace off.* - Thu Dec 10 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's stroll came to a halt. He didn't know if Kirigakure was naturally empty but, by the way things seemed, there was hardly anyone around. Course after the recent events in this village Sogeki didn't expect much, but the level of nothingness still baffled him a bit.

His eyes immediately focus on the two shinobi before him --- Kyubishu and Takiji. Naturally, since one of the two shinobi had their back turned to him, Sogeki would make his presence heard by supplying a subtle, but audible, cough.

"Ahem.. Greetings to you all."* - Thu Dec 10 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) felt absolutely foolish. How could he miss the presence of a third shinobi of this village? Quickly he'd attempt to correct his wrong-doing, shifting his gaze to the female and nodding. "Forgive me," he goes to step closer in her direction so their voices can travel better without the need of excessive volume increase, "I didn't notice you there." He bows slightly, attempting to show her a level of respect in compensation of looking over her. Once his head was lifted up again he'd catch Takiji's glare but says nothing --- another antisocial kid, great.* - Thu Dec 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || It is noted that Sogeki does wield a bow across his back. A quiver full of arrows is also strapped to his back by a single leather belt that runs from his upper right shoulder, across his chest and down to the middle of his left waist. The bow is hitched against the quiver and kept balance due to Sogeki's back and the sack in general.

Sogeki is also wearing a black jumpsuit. There jumpsuit consists of a single sleeve that runs down to his left wrist while his right arm has no sleeve at all. However, his right arm does consist of tribal-like body art that can be identified as tattoos. Sogeki doesn't wear a headband, but he does look like a common Shinobi. If anything, he could be labeled as a simple traveler.* - Thu Dec 10 00:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: It is up to lady Kana or a jounin of rank, but as long as nothing happens I think it would be okay. - Thu Dec 10 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded, "understood." He turns on his heels and began striding off, "I'll be back later then. I don't want to cause any problems.. or be likely to cause problems."* - Thu Dec 10 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: A good man you are. - Thu Dec 10 00:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) hits it from the back, rubbing her head like it's a crystal globe.* - Fri Dec 11 08:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continues to rampage the pusspuss.* - Fri Dec 11 08:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says "fuck sanoke" and gives mirai the proper fucking.* - Fri Dec 11 08:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't know if Kariudo was IC, but she she was she'd see him with his bow to his rigth side, quiver of arrows on his left and a new tattoo on his right wrist that says "Chuunin of Kumogakure" in romaji.* - Fri Dec 11 08:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is also sitting down.* - Fri Dec 11 08:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's head rose and his gaze set on Kariudo, a gently smile forms on his face. Soon after glancing at her he'd nod, now placing his glare on somewhere else. "A small one, nothing major.."

He leans to the side a bit, taking out a piece of paper. It was folded in half twice, making a perfect square. He offers it to Kariudo with a smirk, but doesn't look at her.

If she was to accept the paper and open it all the way, she'd see Sogeki's official kill amount in the war against Sunagakure --- 102.* - Fri Dec 11 08:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: They said I had nothing to fight for.. - Fri Dec 11 08:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So I should just give up.. so I kind've told myself that the first hundred-two kills is for you. - Fri Dec 11 08:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks down at his tattoo and chuckles a bit. "I.. did some T-ing while you gone. Decided that as much as I hate to.. t-word.. I have to make you proud," he whispers gently. His tone was in a 'matter of fact' sense, but still modest and kind've.. shy.* - Fri Dec 11 08:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took a glance at the paper, nodding a few times. "Yeah," he whispered back, assuring her that what he stated was honest. "Would've been more.. but the war was called off before it got too serious."* - Fri Dec 11 08:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I love you, Sogeki. - Fri Dec 11 08:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was suddenly pulled it, but remained collected and casual. It wasn't that he expected this reaction from Kariudo, but he's gotten to the point where a brief show of emotions, feelings or anything of the kind was casual. It wasn't until her eyes broke to his lips them matched with his gaze when he was in utter shock. His lips part a bit and his heart begins to pound faster and harder with his chest.

Four words put Sogeki in a daze. It was the ultimate high and the ultimate stimulation for his mind --- I love you, Sogeki. That's all it took for his to slowly shake his head against hers and show his true disbelief of the situation at hand..

He knew for a fact that he loved her and he knew for a fact that he'd go to hell and back for her, but he wasn't used to this. He can show his feelings and emotions, yes.. but not to this extent.. Not without preping himself or something to cope with this intensity.

But everything felt so right. Everything felt like it needed to be here and everything felt like it needed to be said here.. Everything was just.. right

He raises his right hand and cups her cheek with his palm, slowly gliding his thumb across her skin and releasing one final breath of acceptance. He nods this time around and grants her with a genuine smile..

"I love you too, Kariudo."* - Fri Dec 11 08:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raised his chin just slightly, allowing her lips to press against his. Course he allowed her to take charge wit the initial kiss, doing everything in his soul to return the same level of passion she gave him. When the multiple kisses started to rain down, he'd push up more against her, even with her arms tightening the hold, and leaned his head to the side. He forced their lips to stay connected just one second more than what he should really have been, wanting every moment to count.

His thumb went from rubbing over her skin to gliding to her chin. His index finger found under her chin and he places a gentle grasp on her, tilting her head in even more.* - Fri Dec 11 09:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't lie, he needed air too.

When she broke away and went to nuzzle into him, Sogeki would lean his body back a bit and give her something more comfortable to rest against. His own arms wraps around her waist and just left them there, saying nothing.* - Fri Dec 11 09:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shrugs slightly and smirks a bit, "maybe. Now there's no denying you're mine.~* - Fri Dec 11 09:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Mnnn... never going to deny that--...hah.. that's going to be a problem when my brother finds out. - Fri Dec 11 09:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ----- - Fri Dec 11 09:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Forgot about him- Ehh.. makes no difference to me. - Fri Dec 11 09:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm growing up...I'm sure he'll be fine. He leaves me to do what I want anyhow, so might as well leave me to chose who I want. - Fri Dec 11 09:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You think he'll have a problem with you choosing someone.. or who you chose? - Fri Dec 11 09:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..If.. he'll have a problem or not. - Fri Dec 11 09:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Mn... I think he would like you... course he doesn't even know you exist... you two have never met right? - Fri Dec 11 09:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Once, but no conversation. - Fri Dec 11 09:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And it's more so just that he wants to make sure whoever I've done something with will be with me forever... apparently that didn't apply to girls though... --...eh... yeah, but uhm... he probably will demand you marry me or something like he normally does. - Fri Dec 11 09:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Marry you huh? - Fri Dec 11 09:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) chewed on his bottom lip.* - Fri Dec 11 09:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Oh hush, don't get your hopes up. - Fri Dec 11 09:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her manuever her way on to his lap, allowing each movement to happen. His grip remains on her waist, only inching down just a bit to threaten a grip on her hips. "I mean.. We agreed that us doing that is stupid, but it's not something I really mind."* - Fri Dec 11 09:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: If I -have- to, I wouldn't feel forced. - Fri Dec 11 09:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You know you are a terrible liar? - Fri Dec 11 09:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) starts to caress her a bit while keeping his hands in that generic area. Might as well he was giving her a slight massage.* - Fri Dec 11 09:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mmm..~ - Fri Dec 11 09:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...what? No? - Fri Dec 11 09:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Phew. - Fri Dec 11 09:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why would you be in trouble? - Fri Dec 11 09:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gave a humorous smile, his eyes shutting a bit.* - Fri Dec 11 09:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Noothing.~ Nothing..~ - Fri Dec 11 09:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Nah say it, because you can say anything to me. - Fri Dec 11 09:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: True, true. I thought maybe me saying if I -haaaaaave- to would suggest thath's the -only- reason I'd marry you. - Fri Dec 11 09:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'd end up in trouble- listen. - Fri Dec 11 09:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tell me you want to get married, and it'll happen. - Fri Dec 11 09:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: See... I already know you want to marry me. -That- was the lie. - Fri Dec 11 09:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Why do you catch on to everything? - Fri Dec 11 09:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times, nodding his head.* - Fri Dec 11 09:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why does it make me sick feeling in a good way to say that. - Fri Dec 11 09:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Good point. - Fri Dec 11 09:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Denied. - Fri Dec 11 09:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Um, let's see... I knew you were letting me win from the beginning but I let you think I didn't know. You played along not because you thought that I was playing a game with you but because you actually thought I was stupid enough to believe I was that good.~ - Fri Dec 11 09:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's mouth drops open a bit. He didn't really have anything to say to that so he'd cover it up with completely wrapping her arms around her instead of gripping her hips and kissing her cheeks.* - Fri Dec 11 09:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mmmmmuaaah~ - Fri Dec 11 09:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Such a liiiiiiiiiiar. - Fri Dec 11 09:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: A BAD liar. - Fri Dec 11 09:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) another kiss!* - Fri Dec 11 09:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mmuuuuuaaah~ - Fri Dec 11 09:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirks heavily.* - Fri Dec 11 09:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I win. - Fri Dec 11 09:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Soooooo, anywaaaays~ - Fri Dec 11 09:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Hmmmm?~ - Fri Dec 11 09:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: How was your traveling this time? - Fri Dec 11 09:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Boring... I've been pretty lonely lately. Sort of just like training by myself but I did make a friend so I hang out with him a lot and train together. The group sort of went traveling without me so yeah... - Fri Dec 11 09:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Can't you roam arou- - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Nice, nice. - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Hm? - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You beat his ass too? - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...yes. - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) gives her a peck on the cheek. "Atta girl.~"* - Fri Dec 11 09:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I tried something stupid though and ended up with the breath knocked out of me. - Fri Dec 11 09:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: He had tried to bear tackle me so I wacked him upside the temple with my elbow and he dropped me on the ground. I hadn't thought that part out... it really hurt. - Fri Dec 11 09:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) bit down on both his lips, snickering a few times.* - Fri Dec 11 10:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Do you wish I was here more often? - Fri Dec 11 11:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yeah, but like I said.. I want you to continue doing what makes you feel 'right'. - Fri Dec 11 11:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm not so certain it's right anymore...I get left behind a lot. - Fri Dec 11 11:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Do you think you'd have that same thrill by staying here? - Fri Dec 11 11:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I got you... - Fri Dec 11 11:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Was.. that the wrong question..? - Fri Dec 11 11:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Umm.. - Fri Dec 11 11:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times.* - Fri Dec 11 11:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm going to talk to Eiyu, don't get your hopes up about it...but I might ask for a different mission or have him have me...accepted back. - Fri Dec 11 11:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I have a mission- a few missions rather.. out of the village. - Fri Dec 11 11:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: O-Oh, okay then. - Fri Dec 11 11:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I like being out in the world... so maybe he will let me do the missions with you? Maybe like... get a feel about doing missions like that rather than living undercover. - Fri Dec 11 11:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...if you want me. - Fri Dec 11 11:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked at her.* - Fri Dec 11 11:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ....... - Fri Dec 11 11:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Whaaa? - Fri Dec 11 11:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You know I wouldn't mind, Kari. - Fri Dec 11 11:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Oh, duh.. I was trying to be polite. - Fri Dec 11 11:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Ew. - Fri Dec 11 11:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nudges her a bit.* - Fri Dec 11 11:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: YOUR LOVE, IT'S CONTAGIOUS. - Fri Dec 11 11:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: STOP IT. - Fri Dec 11 11:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) accepted every flick, but returned them. Flick on her thighs, her knees, her waist, her hips, everywhere!* - Fri Dec 11 11:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: We.. can do this all day~ - Fri Dec 11 11:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) only pulled her in more, using one arm to completely wrap around her while using his other hand to continue flicking her. "Bit off more than you can chew!"* - Fri Dec 11 11:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) only continued!

His flicks went from her outer thighs, to the top of her thighs then trailed all the way to her waist. Every now any then, once he made it to her waist, he'd wiggle his fingers back and forth to see if she had any tickle spots!

The day he finds one is the day he becomes king!* - Fri Dec 11 11:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Bingo!

He adds leverage to his grip. He pulls her back even more with the arm hewrapped around her and continued on! His opposing hand roamed from one side of her waist, to her stomach then the other side!

"Nooope! Nope, Nope!"* - Fri Dec 11 11:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grows wider as she squirmed!

He eases up a bit once hearing he desperate plea for him to stop. Still, he kept it up. He focused on one side of her waist, poking her every few seconds when her laughter was getting ready to subside --- torturing her whilse she remained on his lap and wrapped with his other arm.* - Fri Dec 11 11:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) felt her nails digging into his skin but was actually enjoying this very moment. He had Kari against the ropes and he didn't even have to use poison --- this may even be more effective!

His poking eventually died down and his other hand, the one that was wrapped just beneath her breast, creeps up a bit. He was subtle with it, not really thinking about where his hands was progressing to.

"I won!~"* - Fri Dec 11 12:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) thinks: Once again this has turned out to be rather....dissappointing...might have to see what other villages are up to. - Fri Dec 11 13:52:48 2015
