<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's cock twitched, blood starting to rush to it. Her hand, however, brought back to the time they made a bet. "Okay, okay. Listen here now.. You one the last time, we don't need a redo."* - Fri Nov 20 14:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) swiftly pulls Eri in closer to his body and raised his hand, preparing to take a solid swat at her rump. Just as he was to swing his arm down his eyes narrowed and he quickly remembered. Instead he'd reach for her hand, grab it and moved it to where her other hand was. "That's more fun to play with. Try it out."* - Fri Nov 20 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "Just got done slamming it with my cock. Think of it as me paying my debt of you helping me progress my Sharingan."* - Fri Nov 20 14:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head and crawls off the couch, "of course.~" He reaches for her body and hooks his arms under her. He hoists her up then turns on his heels to carry her off to the bathroom. He works his way around with her in his arms before sitting down that side of the tub. He rests her on his lap as he leans forward just a bit to work the gauges. On top of that, once getting the water nice and warm, he'd place the clog over the drain and allow the water to fill up. Ortho then reaches up to the many soap dispensers for the shower. "Bubbles or no bubbles," he asks while glancing at Eri.* - Fri Nov 20 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, "fine with me, bab-.." He cuts himself off, blinking a bit before diverting his eyes. He bites down on his lower lip then looks at the numerous soap dispensers. He coughs to clear his throat before picking one out and squirting some right under the water current. From there he'd turn the hot water gauge more than the cold water gauge was and waited for the water to heat up to a nice steamy temperature. During this time the bubbles would start to form. Ortho remains silent; his face was noticeably red.* - Fri Nov 20 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. "Not.. used to it.."* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The shower finally filled up to the proper amount. He turns off the pipe and lifts Eri up a bit. He stands in the water and lowers himself just a bit before laying back. With on his lap, he'd slowly position her so she can either lay on him or straddled him --- either one she shows, it was just a simple movement to make between the two.* - Fri Nov 20 14:58:33 2015

I take thas as you not 'saying' you love me.. but showing it. I'll take that over you saying it any day. It was the heat of the moment..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because if he brings his forces to fight me, I'm taking on him and all of them. - Sat Nov 21 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) snaps his head to the right and looks at Eri. His eyes are widened a bit and silence riddled the area. He didn't know if she could hear how hard his heart was pounding, but he would be surprised if she did. His breathing is slowed just a bit and he felt a bit light headed. A look of shock is plastered over his visage.* - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's lids lowered and nodded a bit. He didn't know if he should say it back, or just continue to the casual flow of things. He coughs to clear his throat and just.. tried to talk past it. "Our.. paths are together right now.. but sometimes," he coughs again, "sometimes we have to-." He couldn't do it. He cuts himself of and jumps toward Eri, getting on top of her. He places the tip of his nose against her and just stared at her; it didn't matter if she opened her eyes or not.. he just stared.* - Sat Nov 21 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Why was hearing this from Eri so foreign-like? He knows that she loves him and she has shown it countless times, but still he got a tingly feeling in his stomach and heart when he heard her talk. He told her that he'd take her showing over telling any day, but now that he actually heard it.. it felt great. He's not expecting her to say it all the time or get mushy and feely twenty-four seven, but damn.. This was nice.

"I..I love you too Eri," was all he was able to muster up. The part about them getting married wasn't blown over but he leans in and plants a full kiss on her, not knowing what else to do in this moment.* - Sat Nov 21 00:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Plenty of factors came into play here. To start off, Ortho has been training himself since he and Heiwa last fought. He figured that the best way to counter Heiwa's near-unbreakable Genjutsu is by knowing it is coming. On top of that, Ortho's doujutsu was activated. In contrast to the last time Heiwa and Ortho went at it, Ortho wielded a second Tomoe instead of one. As a result Ortho breaks the Genjutsu in the same manner he did last time --- activating his transformation.

Ortho's skin begins rough and scaly. His body structure transitions and almost instantly half of him became just like a snake. His skin tone darkens a considerate amount and the inner iris of his crimson-red pupils went from perfectly round to a long snake-like slit. This transformation would give Ortho's chakra a massive boost, negating the Genjutsu altogether.

Ortho has been trying to keep Heiwa alive for as long as possible, but the boy just seemed to test fate for a living. That being said, Ortho forms a quick string of handseals and allowed a massive amount of chakra to knead within his chest. At that point, while maneuvering his way around the battle field so no one got hurt from a stray bullet, Ortho would unleash a massive ball of fire.

Following the fireball came another succession of handseals. This time around, he intakes a good amount of air and kneads his chakra within his lungs. Just as fast as he inhales the air, he unleashes it in a powerful gust of wind. As a result, while swaying his head from left to right in an attempt to use the wind to leave little to no room for Heiwa to evade, Ortho aimed to simply put.. burn the child to crisps.* - Sat Nov 21 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's movement never halted. Heiwa's handseals were noticed but wasn't recognized. For that reason Ortho thought on his feet. His chakra flares and caused his entire essence to lift off the ground. From doing so, he'd continue to levitate while attempting to create distance. It wasn't until he took a glance at what was pivoted out of the ground when he realized what jutsu was used, "I see.. Hachirou came in for the clutch.. That's the jutsu he warned me about.."

With that in mind, Ortho glides down to the ground and forms another succession of handseals. This time around, instead of using launchable techniques, Ortho slams his palms atop the ground and sent his chakra out. A massive dome would eject up and look to enclose Heiwa in his entirety. From this point, Ortho would trail himself off in a diagonal path, looking for an opening in what he can do. Still Heiwa wasn't someone he wanted to kill, but the more he sees the boy is the more he's pushed to the edge.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stands stationary next to a tree. His head is slightly lowered and his eyes are subtly focused on his bare right arm. He is seen with a few rolls of bandages in his left hands' grip, unraveling one and beginning to wrap his right arm with it. Every now and then he'd wince and grunt from slight pain --- many of his stitches and wounds were still healing and sometimes they'd ache and throb when he fights for too long. His battle in Kumogakure just a few hours ago took its toll on him, causing a few of those wounds to leak blood. "F-Fuck.."* - Sat Nov 21 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times, watching Eri take the bandages away from him and aid him in wrapping his arm. "Went to Kumogakure to give some funds to the Raikage and ended up getting attacked by a Kirigakure shinobi. I didn't get hit but.. you know this damn arm messes with me when I fight for too long.."* - Sat Nov 21 10:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes remained focused on Eri, "Heiwa. He's a little runt that hates me for attacking Kirigakure. He's the main one that wants me dead. He's young but his Genjutsu can easily get me killed. No worries though." Ortho gave Ziare a quick glance, "you making me want to see it firsthand. Did you give it a good name?" He then places his focus on Eri, whispering to her.* - Sat Nov 21 10:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Guard(DhatBoiNick) was pierced instantly. There was no rebuttal and there was no form of object --- his death was assured. He body falls to its knees before tipping over, blood squirting from the wound. The other guard, however, made an attempt to bang on the gates in hopes that someone on the inside heard and came to help.* - Sat Nov 21 10:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Guard(DhatBoiNick) 's back arched and his spine is easily pierced through. A snap is heard then everything went dim for the guard. It's sad how his life ended --- a virgin and spent most of his life as a bandit turned guard. Luckily, however, the doors to the village open and a mass of guards rushes out. Sirens within the village goes off and the threat is soon identified.* - Sat Nov 21 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Guard after guard was dropped with relative ease. They stood no chance against the enraged female and it's for that very same reason the leader himself made his presence known. He looks at the carnage made by Kana and simply grunted, a look of anger creeping on his visage.

"I got your name off of the bounty list," he shouts at the top of his lungs toward kana, "and this is how you repay me!?" The massive shockwave takes out more of his shinobi, leaving more room for Kana and Ortho to face off.* - Sat Nov 21 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) no longer had a reason to talk. He long since left Kirigakure alone and countless times shinobi from that tarnished village decide to come to his doorsteps and cause problems. Talking time was long since over, it was time for actions. Ortho as accepted blame for way too long, now it's time for other people to accept their fate.

He brings his left and right hands together, quickly tying his fingers together in many different formations. As he did so, he'd start the process of kneading chakra within his lungs. A quick intake of breath is mad and he puckers his lips, leaving a large enough hole for his jutsu to be successfully executed. In a moment's notice, Ortho would exert a multitude of air bullets toward Kana's frame, aiming to unleash hell on her.

Following that jutsu, Ortho strings another set of handseals together. His chakra nature quickly alters and his own body crouches closer to the ground. He plants his palms atop the surface of the earth and allows his chakra to surge forward. As a result, a massive dome would begin protruding behind Kana and aiming to enclose her inside as the air bullet clash into her body.* - Sat Nov 21 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Don't hurt her man, she's just a girl, we can all just talk this out... - Sat Nov 21 11:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. His black pupils transition and turn crimson red. Two teardrops swirl around a inner black iris. The jutsu launched his way was anticipated and evaded by side stepping. Ortho swiftly unsheathes a kunai, allowing a flow of chakra to engulf it in its entirety. That being said, as wind begins to surge around it, Ortho would launch that kunai-

Ziare's words struck Ortho. The Uchiha leader stops his movements just before he went to launch the kunai; dropping it. Instead, he'd form a single handseal while Kana was binded and thrust his right arm forward. At that moment, two snakes would expel from his skin and look to coil around Kana, hindering her arms to her sides. "Release the shadow, Ziare."* - Sat Nov 21 11:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "You're pitiful."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ----- runs.* - Sat Nov 21 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) is sitting at the base of the tree tending to his right arm. The same wounds that opened up a few days ago have yet to stop bleeding --- the only thing applying pressure to his arm is the bandages. He pulls the wrapping down and begins the process of stitching things up.

Eri's approach wasn't visually acknowledged, he was aware of her due to his ability to sense chakra. He keeps a straight face and speaks in a leveled, hushed, tone.* - Sat Nov 21 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: We're leaving out soon. - Sat Nov 21 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit. He hears her sigh and gave her one back. He looks up at her face and allowed her to stitch him up. He slowly shook his head and simply stayed quiet until she was done --- he question went unanswered for the time being.* - Sat Nov 21 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckled a bit, shaking his head slowly again. He stands to his feet and dusts himself off using his left hand before reaching over to his down-folded arm wrap and pulls it up over the stitches. He glances down at Eri and offers his hand for her to use and pull herself up off the ground, "let's go."* - Sat Nov 21 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighs. He leads her to house full a memories, but doesn't say anything. He opens the door and walks in.* - Sat Nov 21 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says nothing to Eri. He has a smirk on his face but says nothing. He walks into the kitchen and heads straight for the sink to wash his hands.* - Sat Nov 21 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || They are in a basic house. Rooms with beds, small kitchen, small living room, single bathroom. The aroma is sweet like scented candles were lit but extinguished not too long ago. Faint music could be heard, but not exactly distinguished without focusing your sense of hearing on it. The lightening was a bit dim but the place was easy to maneuver around. The flooring is padded with elegant mats and carpets while flower petals scattered about. The mood was a bit romantic with a hint of 'casual' thrown in.* - Sat Nov 21 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) makes his way out of the kitchen. He looks around for a bit as if he was searching for something. "I sometimes.. look back on my past and ask myself how and why I've made it this far in my life," he says in a hushed tone but loud enough for her to hear.* - Sat Nov 21 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to look around the living room. "Then I start thinking about the things that I've been through in my life. I recall every major event that made me stray from my path and things that threatened to keep me off my path.. But this my mind wanders to the things that urged me to get back on that path I've set for himself --- basically pushing me back to that point where my goal is clear.." His face lightens up as he found what he was looking for. He had hid a massive bottle of red wine in a cooler under the coffee table by couch. He hasn't been in the house for weeks now so remembering exactly where it was had him shook. Now that he had it, he'd look over at Eri, stretches his arm out and suggests that she walks more into the house and take his hand. "Then.. when it all stops making sense and I feel like there's nothing left for me to do or care about in this world.. your face flash before my mind. Then everything pieces back together. It's not a hidden fact that I have been in a few relationships. Feelings were attached and feelings were expressed. In those relationships there was a reason why I was with them.. a worldly reason that seemed so selfish when you think about it." He chuckles a bit, slowly shaking his head and looking away. "When I think about why I have these feelings for you, there are so many reasons that come to mind that I can't piece it together. It's like.. everything just makes sense that I'm with you.. and it makes complete sense that I have these feelings for you.."* - Sat Nov 21 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) opened his mouth to say something more, but there was a knock on the door. Before he could even shout out to tell the person to leave a guard barges in and kneels down with a bowed head, "forgive me Lord Ortho. The village is under attack! We tried fending the threat off but to no prevail!"

Ortho's eyes widened. He looks at Eri then back at the guard. He sighs then pulls Eri in close, planting a quick kiss on her lips. "We'll do this right later.. Okay?"* - Sat Nov 21 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip as he heard her desire to tag along. He sighed, nodded his way and allowed her to follow.* - Sat Nov 21 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arrival was no less than abrupt. From the get go, at the sight of his blown up gates, anger was plastered on his face. His eyebrows furrowed in and in an instant his ocular prowess activate. His black pupils transition into a crimson-red shade. A single Tomoe swirl around an inner black iris. Just as that Tomoe was to halt, a second makes its presence known and settles in the contrasted position of the first Tomoe.

A smirk forms on Ortho's face when he heard Edge's words. "Gratitude. Maybe next time you can knock a little lighter? My doors aren't made of real metal."* - Sat Nov 21 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And I assure you. I would not leave your eyes in your sockets. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: They'd be resting safely, tucked into my pockets. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Holy...fuck. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Kana ain't got shit on him. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, supplying Edge with a playful smile. "Come now. You're viewing me with a more in-depth sight, allow me the same. If anything this is me acknowledging your worth rather than threatening to engage in battle. Is this not a honor for you?"

Ortho turns his head to the side a bit, placing his gaze on Eri. The look on his face told her to take a deep breath and calm down. Ortho, on the other hand, has been running these streets as a shinobi for way too long. Edge's aura was intense, but it wasn't something Ortho hasn't experienced before. "Tell me, guest.. What exactly brings you to a settlement such as this? Surely you understand that we're just on the upcoming."* - Sat Nov 21 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's left eyebrow rose. He sets his gaze back on Edge for just a brief moment before breaking away to his remaining guards and scared every-day-civilians. He sighs, a chuckle emitting somewhere in there. "Very well," he says as he momentarily close his eyes. By time they reopened his doujutsu deactivated. "What is it exactly you've come for?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: 2 fire jusu - Sat Nov 21 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sprang into action. Edge's chakra wasn't hidden from Ortho and it's for that very same reason why the Uchiha brings his hands together in a multitude of handseals. They were now securely trapped in the prison but with a flare of his own chakra Ortho slams his arms down on the ground; an attempt to form a quick dome over them to shield as much of the damage as possible. Whether or not this was successful he'd reach over to Eri and drag her down to the ground and tucked her under his body.* - Sat Nov 21 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: then* - Sat Nov 21 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) yells out in pain. He tried to move away or even push Eri away before he could his hands were pierced and subdued. "F-FUCK!" Ortho slips in and out of consciousness, the chakra receivers doing exactly what they were invented to do. He squirms and kicks, trying his best to break from --- no prevail. "Er-Eri.. Run.. Go don't listen to him. R-Run!"* - Sat Nov 21 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Worms. - Sat Nov 21 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: All of them. - Sat Nov 21 21:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: This is a village of the red-eyed. - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I have little time left though. - Sat Nov 21 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Your instructions will come by mail. - Sat Nov 21 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I suggest you follow every instruction. - Sat Nov 21 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched as Edge approached. There was little to nothing he could do and that burned him on the inside. It was as if he had the grim reaper himself closing in and instead of being killed, the reaper goes after his loved one. Ortho begins to struggle, his anger overflowing. He tucks his knees under his body and attempts to pull up. "No! FUCK THAT!" His hands are still pinned to the ground; the only way to release it is to have the receivers travel completely through his palms --- that'll only cause more damage. Still, however, he begins swing and kicking his legs to the side, trying to back Edge away from Eri. "WE'LL DO IT! DON'T TOUCH HER! I'LL DO IT MYSELF IF I HAVE TO! LEAVE HER ALONE, BACK AWAY!"* - Sat Nov 21 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's body was used as a doormat. He had no worries about that, but his attention immediately tore between Eri and Hatsujin. Eri's limp body causes his eyes to widen a bit, but the sight of Hatsujin being stomped on set him over board. It wasn't fair.. the guy was as innocent as ever, but he was treated like a common rug.. disrespected and simply embarrassed.

He sees Hatsujin's arm stretch forward in an attempt to grab his guitar. Ortho crawls toward the male, trying his best to make it toward him. "Hatsujin! Keep your eyes open! Don't you dare fucking close them! That's an order, Hatsujin! YOU BETTER LISTEN TO ME! Don't you dare-," tears flow down Ortho's cheeks. He was drenched in blood as well, the massive army of Edge doing a number on him as well. "Hatsujin.. You have a mission, damn it! Do not close your eyes! There is no rest here..! We're doing this together, Hatsujin! STAY WITH ME DAMN IT!"

He continues to inch closer and closer to his fellow Uchiha, trying his damndest to make it to him. Despite all the pain and agony his hands were experiencing this was a last ditch effort to heal the male. Chakra flows to his palms just as he managed to make physical contact with the male. The chakra extinguishes from lack of concentration just as fast as it was summoned. Ortho's natural ability to sense is what screwed him over at this point and time. He watched at Hatsujin's light flickered and flickered until finally cutting off. The male became paler and everything that resembled life vanished.

Ortho bites down on his tongue, trying his best to get his emotions in check and think rationally. "I can save you.. I know I can damn it. Just stay with me, Hatsu. I promise I won-," he cuts himself off. Deep down he knew that he couldn't save the male, but his heart and soul desperately wanted to. Once again Ortho tries to generate chakra in his hands to heal Hatsujin, but that flare was soon extinguished again. There was no point..

Ortho closes in on Hatsujin even more. He uses his slump arm to push the guitar closer to the lifeless Uchiha and simply sat there.. "I let you down, Hatsu.. I should've tried harder.. I should've.. I should've done something.. I'm sorry, man.. Please forgive me.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was just sitting there staring down at the body.* - Sat Nov 21 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) knew that Ziare was right. There was no way around it. Ortho sighs and struggles to his feet, looking around at the carnage. He'd glance at a guard and give him instructions to dig into his back pouch and take out bandages to wrap around his legs and palms. Once the guard was done Ortho began the instructions:

"Seal off the door, set traps that are designed to spring on anyone who isn't of this village. The rest of you move these bodies off to the side and dig some holes to bury them. I'll create tombstones. Work with haste, we were hit pretty hard and it's time for us to bounce back."

Ortho limps over to Ziare and simply nods, "I hear you. I got this."

He walks off to the house Eri was in and prepares his chakra to heal her.* - Sat Nov 21 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) limps into the room. His legs were bandaged and so was his two palms. He stares at Eri, looking at the numerous shrapnel's in her. Soon after Ortho walked in came a guard. They both pull up a chair and begins working on the female.

They start with the larger projectiles that were lodged in her, plucking them out --- not before  the guard followed Ortho's instructions and injected some liquid into Eri's body to numb her up. At that point, while wincing in pain, Ortho raises his hands over Eri's body and generates chakra to his body. His love for her fueled his endurance against this pain and in turn allowed him to just bear with it to heal her. Meanwhile, the guard would use a syringe to squirt cleansing water into her wounds. They were taking full advantage of her being numbed up. Once the wounds were properly cleansed, Ortho would order the guard out of the house and let him do the stitching.* - Sat Nov 21 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes away from Eri's. He knew that if they just grazed past each other's line of sight that tears would start flowing from him. Right about now he needed all the concentration he can gather to work on Eri. Thankfully, however, Ortho's chakra control was on par with his medical capabilities. The only problem was the aching and throbbing from his wounds --- it sucked that he couldn't heal himself like he could heal Eri.

Nevertheless he continued. By this point the wounds would close a considerate amount. The bleeding halted and the inner depths of the wounds were properly cleansed with the chakra. The only thing Ortho needed to do was add three or four stitches per wound and they'd be done. On a side note though, what the fuck did they just experience?

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think about it...until you can speak.. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think... - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think....just...don't. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's healing process concluded. He digs into his back pouch and uses the tip of two fingers to grab his stitching supplies. With a bit of struggle he opens the small container and starts patching up Eri's skin. It really didn't take long --- her numb muscles didn't give him a fight so it was just a matter of him working through his pain. He only gave off a single grunt through the process, but nothing more. His eyes lowered just slightly, the recollection of what transpired merely an hour before continuing to flash through his mind. 

Still, he manages to hold it together and finishes the job. Instead of breaking the silence that riddled them he'd turn just slightly and tend to his wounds.* - Sat Nov 21 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) knew she would start a riot so he kept her there for a good ten minutes. He finishes up on his wounds before unsheathing a kunai and thrusting it toward the one Ziare had trapped her with. He knocks it off and releases her.* - Sun Nov 22 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) still kept his eyes away from Eri. To assure that they don't meet he'd lean back into his chair and leaned his head back a bit, setting his gaze on the ceiling. "Sadly.." His voice is leveled and emotionless, his facial expression matching the lack of sentiments as his tone.* - Sun Nov 22 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his focus on the ceiling. He tried his best not to look down at her but her words hit home. His facial expression still lacked emotion but tears poured from the outer and inner corners of his eyes. They flow down his cheek bones and toward his ears before falling down to his shoulders. His hand is grasped. He welcomes Eri's hold and fought back the slight urge to grunt from the pain. "You're my strength.. you always will be my strength.. I would've long since attempted to continue fighting if I didn't have you to heal. I've failed you all, that's.. a given.. Hatsujin is dead and there's nothing I can do about it.."* - Sun Nov 22 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't have anything more to say about Hatsujin. He was a good guy that fell at Edge's whim and was let down by Ortho himself. Hatsujin asked for one thing and one thing only, Ortho failed to grant him it. Tears continued to flow down Ortho's face but no excessive heaving and sobbing. He didn't know why he wasn't as hysterical as Eri; he was just so broken that he just felt numb --- like he injected with that numbing liquid ten times in the heart and soul. Maybe he just lost hope completely.

Eri's tightened grip was returned for that brief moment. When she was forced to loosen due to the complicity of their current strength Ortho managed to keep the hold for a few more seconds than she could, but soon he too submitted to the pain. He remains quiet and kept his gaze fixed on the ceiling, just accepting things for what it was at this moment --- hell.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's palms are bandaged and so are his legs. It's as if someoen pierced right through them. He looks over at Mizumi and sighed, "handle it for me."* - Sun Nov 22 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Ugh....No... - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyebrows furrowed in, his anger instantly flaring. "He died nearly two months ago, damn it! Where have you been!?"* - Sun Nov 22 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head slowly, his anger still flaring towards the woman. "What reason do I have to lie," he questions. He was fighting back the urge to step forward, knowing that it'll excite a battle he couldn't handle right now. "Hideki was my sensei and brother! If I say he's dead, he's dead!"* - Sun Nov 22 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't believe the show of shock that Rymei presented. It's long since been overplayed by many people that claimed to be close to Hideki but all failed to help the renowned man out of his depression --- Ortho stood amongst that list of people. Another slow shake of his head is given, "the man convicted died by my hands not too long ago. He went by the name of Index at the time of Hideki's death but soon after went by Ryutaro."* - Sun Nov 22 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released another sigh. A slow shake of his head is given out of annoyance. Was he truly about to die here..? Over his eyes?

"You're right. I have the trait and I'm able. And yes, Index died by my hands. He lived the life of a traitor and died as such." Ortho's jaw tightens, his anger flaring up again. "Look, are you here to kill me? Yes or no?"* - Sun Nov 22 04:27:05 2015
