<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: No. - Sun Nov 29 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nah-uh. - Sun Nov 29 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continued to dust himself off and act oblivious to her denials, "maybe just a few minutes of.. you know.~"* - Sun Nov 29 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continued to dust himself off and act oblivious to her verbal denials, "maybe just a few minutes of.. you know-."

He saw something strange within her peripherals and his head cocks up. He looks up at the sky and slowly shook his head, denying what he just saw. He begins to chuckle to himself, seemingly convinced that he didn't see that. Sogeki shrugs a bit and murmures to himself, "you're stupi-"

He saw it again and immediately made eye contact with Kariudo and her two extra arms. He blinks a few times and took a single step forward, "whoa.."* - Sun Nov 29 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: why are you back here? - Sun Nov 29 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times, his jaw widening. He takes a few steps back and just observed for now.* - Sun Nov 29 10:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...did this BITCH just call me a monster before trying to call herself one? - Sun Nov 29 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: She calling me a FREAK? - Sun Nov 29 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continued to watch. How exactly does he cool down this situation? Like.. what steps does he take to make things calm down without him, or someone else, getting hurt?

He sighs.* - Sun Nov 29 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) remained relatively calm and quiet throughout Akarui's responses. He didn't mind what she was saying, there were no shots being thrown in any particular direction.

That ending piece, however.. that ending piece got to him. His eyes twitched and his fists clench, but response.* - Sun Nov 29 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Until others ripped it out..? - Sun Nov 29 10:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: All this was to secure your damn self.. - Sun Nov 29 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Your feelings for us- your feeling you 'claim' you have for us was just to make sure you had someone in both your pockets.. - Sun Nov 29 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't know whether or not him being unfazed was a bad thing. He was so over Akarui and her ways that everything that was laid out before them three was nothing more than filler. He hesitantly walks over to Kariudo and sits down next to her.

His legs are stretched out and he's leaning back on elbows; the supported his upper body with leverage. He released a small sigh and glances at Kariudo and speaks to her in a hushed tone. "Usually.. a hug would make all this feel a bit better. So the most I can say, while following your guidelines, is that.. all this is truly over now that you told her exactly what she had to say."* - Sun Nov 29 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) decided not to question the extra two sets of arms. They didn't really bother him honestly, they were just.. different.

His raised his chin a bit and placed his eyes on the sky. He gives Kariudo's question a shrug, she had a good point. "I.. don't know, maybe? I mean if it was me I'd stay clear of someone that just basically told me to fuck myself. For all it's worth, she acknowledged once before that her stepping up for you back then was all a bluff; she can't back up her words. Knowing that you can hold your own and she can't will leave some form of 'let me stay away before I get killed' thought process.. No?"* - Sun Nov 29 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) diverts his eyes and runs his tongue along the inside of his left cheek.* - Sun Nov 29 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Great.. - Sun Nov 29 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..yeah.. - Sun Nov 29 10:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Guess you can say I took away your friend. - Sun Nov 29 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Why are you sorry? - Sun Nov 29 10:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded in understanding.* - Sun Nov 29 10:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: After my mission so far.... things were going to be different with me anyhow. - Sun Nov 29 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: How so? - Sun Nov 29 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I was only staying here in Kumo and settled down as a shinobi because my brother was suppose to settle down too...but he can't. - Sun Nov 29 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Ahh, ahh. - Sun Nov 29 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I see.. - Sun Nov 29 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ....and all these people are saying I'm a traitor... I mean I talked it out of Takuma but. - Sun Nov 29 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: So you're planning on doing the "where he goes, I go" thing?- - Sun Nov 29 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm not a traitor, I wouldn't leave unless I was allowed to leave. - Sun Nov 29 10:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) takes a glance at her, "Kumo is slowly loving a savage then.~"* - Sun Nov 29 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Huh? - Sun Nov 29 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You earned the title of "savage". - Sun Nov 29 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I don't think Kumo 'loves' me. - Sun Nov 29 11:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I won't say crazy.. - Sun Nov 29 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: But.. Hmm.. - Sun Nov 29 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You're.. without straint. - Sun Nov 29 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I have restraint....when it's needed. - Sun Nov 29 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: We'll see about that.~ - Sun Nov 29 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oi. - Sun Nov 29 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You aren't getting those arrows near me again. - Sun Nov 29 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You think so? - Sun Nov 29 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, I know so. - Sun Nov 29 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Cute. - Sun Nov 29 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It's easier if you just accepted, ya'know. - Sun Nov 29 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...easier sure. - Sun Nov 29 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: For you. - Sun Nov 29 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Course who knows what you can do if I punch your bow or snap it like a twig before you can get an arrow out. - Sun Nov 29 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hell. - Sun Nov 29 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I probably can hold you down. - Sun Nov 29 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Without even touching you. - Sun Nov 29 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Then I'll just spit poison in your eyes, babe.~ - Sun Nov 29 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He called me babe. - Sun Nov 29 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't have to be near you to put you down. - Sun Nov 29 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shouldn't help but chuckle-

He got serious.* - Sun Nov 29 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: What are you? A magician? - Sun Nov 29 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: No. - Sun Nov 29 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..No. I'm scared of spiders that are able to kill me with a single bite. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Them fuckers are dangerous as hell. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: It's the bite you are worried about? - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Anything else, I don't care about. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What about the kind.... that keep you tied down for days and let you slowly bleed out...just dry you out. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: They're webs? If I get caught in them, I deserve to get bit- - Sun Nov 29 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You sure about that? - Sun Nov 29 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: That's.. savage. - Sun Nov 29 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip, staring at her.* - Sun Nov 29 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Shit...that's all I got. - Sun Nov 29 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I need to do more chakra training. - Sun Nov 29 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes were fixated on her the entire time. He saw the unique set of handseals and sensed the buildup of chakra within her mouth; his curiosity may have fucked him over greatly. Of course he could've made an attempt to quickly unsheathe an arrow and slice one of her biceps or something, but he was honestly intrigued.

One thing he didn't expect, however, was that she'd go to bind him with whatever she kneaded. Quickly, without any time to waste and while knowing he was going to end up caught either way, he'd shift his positioning a bit to use one hand and grab for an arrow. At that very moment he'd aim directly, as stated before, for her bicep and just grave the tip of the arrow over her skin to cause a small cut. He wasn't exactly sure if he'd be able to reach her on time, but fuck.. it was a helluva try.

One thing he knew for sure, though, was the webs caught him. Next time he senses a buildup of chakra from a female with six arms and been tolerating his suggestions that she let him fuck, he's hauling ass.* - Sun Nov 29 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: What.. the fuck.. - Sun Nov 29 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: normal arrow" - Sun Nov 29 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was a bit busy trying to fight his way out of the webs. "What fucking form.. of magic trick," he murmurs in annoyance. His shoulders shuffle from side to side and his legs kicked a bit. It wasn't until the deal presented itself to Sogeki when he made a snap judgment. "Alright.. Release me from this string of magic!" He centers his binded body and tried to wiggle and wobble as close to her as he possible could. "Go, go."* - Sun Nov 29 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: cuz  - Sun Nov 29 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) exaggerated a ton when he tore himself out. He mimicked Hulk Hogan ripping of his shirt and throwing the torn cloth, or web in this case, into the crowd. He looks down at his captured victim and smile rather devilishly. "You look so cute.~"

He reaches behind him and takes out the supplies for the antidote, beginning the creation process. "So.. You want me to have my way with you right now orrrr?"* - Sun Nov 29 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Is this.....safe....so close together? - Sun Nov 29 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. "You mean back to back injection of poison? You'll be fine. That's the weak stuff. Besides, you didn't take the full dosage on arrow truly possess. If the entire thing entered your body, I'd give you.. uhh.. three hours to live?"

He spoke so casually, as if he didn't have a paralyzed female right before him. He takes in the sight and bites down on his lower lip. "I'm going to free you.. I promise," he says in a hushed tone. He brings the antidote over to her and injects it into the generic area of the second wound --- the one that allowed his poison access into her.

"Now.. You're mine." He directly whispers into her ears, trailing his hand down to the very bottom of her cloak and going to lift it. "You said you were scared you might like it.. let me help you face your fears."* - Sun Nov 29 11:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || "Shhh, just close your eyes and go down this path with me."

He continues to whisper in her ears, making an attempt to reach for any form of lower body clothing, subtly pulling them down. "I'll be yours.. if you just be mine," he leans in and goes to caress his lips over her neck. If his previous attempt to pull her pants, or whatever she wore from the waist down, was successful he'd continue roam his hands over her lower back and cheeks. "Face.. your fears."* - Sun Nov 29 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's brows furrowed in greatly. His attempt to give this fine savage the freedom to accept his aid in conquering her fears was in vain. In his eyes, this was all an act of denial. There was a choice to be made and whether or not Kariudo liked it, she was going to choose the right one.

The attacks rattled Sogeki a bit. Three successive hits caused him to clench his midsection is slight pain. It wasn't the fact that she was extremely powerful compared to what he can endure; it was the fact that what she was capable in her fit of desperation caught him off guard. While cradling his lower chest region with one arm, he'd reach the other out and go to grab her pants' waist band, tearing it down past her cheeks. "You must accept what I'm offering. You're a savage, having fears is not what you're destined for!"

His opposing hand, the one that was caring for his ribs, would shoot forth to grab hold of Kari's lower most right wrist, yanking her forward in one swift movement. "LET ME HELP YOU!"* - Sun Nov 29 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took another combination of hits and groaned in discomfort. Pain was settling in on him from her punches and that much was clear. His left eye squinted a bit, but determination still fueled his movements. With her bare ass now full of view he'd go to grab another one of her wrists. To his disliking, however, he took quick notice of Kari going in for the bite after gripping his arm while he held one of her arms. There was little he could do at this point, but he wasn't going to give up on claiming her as his. He made a desperate attempt to retract his arm while keeping the hold he had; of course her teeth would still graze against his arm and cause a considerably gash, causing blood to trickle from the wound. Nevertheless, if all goes to plan, depending on if his natural reflexes and strength kicked in properly, he turn her completely around. As a result, he'd have that same hand he used to flip her behind her back and pushing her forward at the hip; bending her over.

With his other hand, after letting go what he had grabbed, he go to unzip his pants and release his enlarged member. "You 'will' accept my fear breaker," he murmurs. If the release of his member was made, he'd violently shake her complete frame to rattle her a bit while lining his head up. "Accept it!"* - Sun Nov 29 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) figured it out now. Kariudo was more of a savage. Yes. She was on a different level that allowed her to channel her anger and desperation. After channeling it, she's able to perform incredible feats that have rarely been seen in cases like this.

The initial kick, for all it was worth, triggered the chain reaction --- he made it a priority to pull his free arm back and cover as much of the hit as possible. One blow after another was landed, but he sacrificed everything to protect his manhood. The hyperextending of his elbow was easily successful. A sudden release of a groan is given to her in slight submission. He falls back with one hand cupping his, now deflating, cock while the other hang to his side due to being numb from the sudden assault on it. The pressure point was the topping on cake for the combination, giving him close to no use of that arm.

His eyes squint and look at the semi-exposed female. A determined look still resided on his face, but pain was setting in and he wanted to assure safety of his partner in crime. He's now on his butt looking up at the triumphant female, merely plotting his next moves while scouting out what she may have in store next.* - Sun Nov 29 13:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was defeated. There was no way around this, no way to counter, no way to cover himself and just fight back. Usually there would be a level of panic for the rapist in question, but Sogeki wasn't a 'usual' suspect. In fact, he was far from it. The thrill of knowing that someone of Kari's savageness level existed made him giddy. The thought alone that he was rightfully put in his place by a fellow savage, and not by some common guy or girl who was strong for no reason, only made Sogeki okay.. with getting his ass kicked.

His main priority right now was simple: just allow it. In all honesty, Sogeki expected to at least relieve his intense level of lust for Kari. He expected to pay for his crime later rather than sooner, but counting his chickens before they hatched back fires. It didn't take much for Kari to knock Sogeki off his feet. The cuts here and there did what they were meant to do and the punches rained down on him. Easily his jaw could be broken if she showed no restraint. Easily he cheek bone could be shattered if she had no remorse. Easily she could kill him as he simply lay there, accepting his charges from the jury of fists.

If he was to survive this day, he made a mental note to work on becoming immune to his own poison.
* - Sun Nov 29 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes were swelled to the point where he could barely see. His lips were busted and his cheek bones were the size of golf balls. His face looked completely shattered on the outside, but he was relatively fine on the outside. Does he regret what he attempted to do? No. His beliefs made this entirely okay. His beliefs allowed him to think, after all the turmoil with Akarui and her lack of savageness and fear of what's to come, that all of this was just him seasoning Kariudo for the rest of the world.. The same world that he has fought to live in for the longest while and feared he'd soon fall in the depths of hell.

If his face wasn't so banged up she'd see a smirk. Right now all there was, was swollen tissue and all that good stuff that came with an old fashion ass whooping. He heard her words past the ringing in his heard from getting beaten and struggle to nod his head so she didn't think he was out right ignoring her. He groans just a bit to shift his body but was immediately stopped by the kunai placed against his neck.

He remained still.* - Sun Nov 29 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Poison was also a major factor.* - Sun Nov 29 14:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || It wasn't like he could even reply to her. His lip was extremely swollen and he was paralyzed. Even the faintest amount of his poison would do more than it did to an healthy person.

The most he could do was groan in pain when she used the kunai to pull his lip down. The stretching of skin only adding to the aching and stinging. He felt as though being asked if he could understand was just her taunting him-

His eyes widened-.. No.

His eyes noticeably widened. Him? A savage afraid of something? Hell no, that can't be-..

Was it possible? Was he just preaching, and physically forcing, his beliefs on to her without coming to mends with his own demons? His chest starts to rapidly inflate and deflate. He looks her in the eyes and went to shake his head in denial, but failed. There was nothing he can do to even rebuttal and that killed him on the in side.

Regret wasn't something he's known for. Regret was far from his mind. Even now, with his three trigger words ringing through his mind, he'd attempt to jerk his forward against the kunai and aim to have her slit his own throat.. Those words he can't possibly live with.. Knowing someone viewed him as 'afraid'? That's the ultimate sin in the Savageologic Religion.

He continues to groan in pain. He was physically aching and throbbing but his mental was worse. Everything from his past flashed before his eyes and everything that led up to this very moment became clouded. All he saw was Kariodu --- the new face of Fear.* - Sun Nov 29 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) jerked again, attempting to make her hand leave his throat. He wanted to die. He doesn't care anymore. He didn't care if he lived nor did he care if he dead. Hell, she could leave him here to slowly rot away for all he cared --- nothing mattered anymore. The look of fear continued to mirror within his eyes as he fixed them on the sky. He merely glanced at the test serum within her grasp for a second before fixing his eyes back on the heavens above. Even in a paralyzed state his trauma caused him to vigorously shake.

A mix between tears and blood poured down the side of his face as he kept his focus on the view above. It was like he wanted to stay there. Nothing mattered to him anymore. In his current pained state he still managed to remain silent, saying nothing --- not even groaning.* - Sun Nov 29 14:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Shit. - Sun Nov 29 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I swear if he tells anyone about this.... - Sun Nov 29 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I'll hand him the kunai myself for him to slit his throat. - Sun Nov 29 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || What amount of self-worth did he have left? Okay, it was obvious that he was a hypocrite in what he was trying to preach to her. It was also obvious that demons haunted him to the point where any sanity he had left, before she muttered the magic words, was long gone. He was nothing; he may never had been anything and may never be anything. He was filler in this world, a mere testament of those that harbor magic tricks of the shinobi were more likely to survive. Basic barbaric men like Sogeki were simply nothing.

He was grabbed, hoisted up a bit and held. The tears and blood continued to flow down his face and his slump frame remained irresponsive. The most he could do was just lay there and succumb to his own mental darkness. Suicide? That'll be heaven. That'll be the weight lifted off the camel's back. That'll be the sacred moment when you meet the person you're in love with for the first time in a long period of time. It was just his only way out.

To make matters worse? He tried to implement his beliefs on someone so innocent. She didn't ask to know Sogeki at the level she did. She didn't ask for him to talk with her the he did. Nor did she ask to be threaten with penetration and demanded that she place her burden on his shoulders when he already had a heavy load from his own shit. Sogeki was as worthless as it gets and he knew it. He didn't want to accept it, but in times like these where acceptance was nothing more than giving up hope and just let life pass you by.

If it wasn't for the grip Kariudo had on his neck, Sogeki would've been made the effort to turn his head in a certain manner to allow more and more blood to leave his body. It was at this point, however, when he was starting to face in and out of consciousness.* - Sun Nov 29 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was carried off. He was a larger guy, but his slenderness in build aided her in the attempt.* - Sun Nov 29 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) just laid there on the bed. He was aware of everything going on and he knew how they scrambled to duplicate his antidote. Normally he'd find their desperation amusing, but this case was much more severe. It's not because he was the patient, but because the intensity of helplessness that filled the room.

Call it luck, or a curse, but the nurses managed to mix up a stable enough serum for him and inject it. Because the serum wasn't exactly the antidote, but something extremely similar, the wait time until he was able to move was just a bit longer.

When they were done patching him up and questioning him, it came to find out that he was truly suicidal. He only responded to gestures and questions about what he thought would happen if he was to just curl over and die. The latter was given a thumb up, meaning he felt like everything and everyone would be fine. The many different doctors evaluates him and told that he'd be able to check out in under a week, but mental stability was up for more questioning.* - Sun Nov 29 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Sogeki....can you hear me? - Sun Nov 29 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is laying on the bed with his hands subtly tied to the safety railings. His head is rested on the stack of pillows and his eyes are poised on the ceiling above their heads. Just as Kariudo entered, an examiner exited. He takes a quick glance at the female before shooting visual holes back to the ceiling.

The new face of Fear has entered.

He nods his head in reply to her question, trying his best to remain calm so no more doctors and shit came rushing in.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ....especially how you were going about it. - Sun Nov 29 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) has officially been in the hospital for a couple of days. By now he was fully aware of what's going on and he knew the reason why he was being held captive. The suicidal thoughts were still running through his mind, but he was able to suppress them enough to where no medication was assigned to him. For the most part, when it came to his physical damage, he was healing nicely. The lumps on his face lessened greatly and he only had two bruises that were extremely noticeable. The cuts across his body were patched up with band aids and quite frankly, he was okay enough to talk clearly.

When Kariudo walked into his room she'd see him sitting up straight with his head leaned back against the wall. His gaze is fixed on the ceiling and his overall posture was relaxed. No emotion is plastered on his visage and his eyelids were halfway closed.

His nose twitched at the smell of actual food. He knew who walked in already so looking over at her was kinda pointless. Still he slowly shake his head and speak. "After all that.. you still decide to bring me food? I'm not complaining.. just.. don't understand.."* - Mon Nov 30 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't expect to hear what he did. "If it's temporary.. is it really goodbye?" His head finally lowers and he placed his gaze on her. The corners corner of his mouth tugged as he fought back a smirk. He wanted to joke around a bit, but guilt was weighing him down greatly. "I'm guessing this is a sign that you're really don't hate me..? Or is this part of your warnin-," his eyes narrowed when he finally realized she labeled him as a 'close friend'.

He couldn't help but cough to clear his throat, a thick lump quickly forming. He didn't know how to reply exactly, but then the last bit of her words made him lean forward completely, wanting to look her right in her eyes.. the ones in her eye sockets..

"This.. relationship.. between us is weird, babe.~" The 'babe' part definitely caused a smirk to form on his face. He reaches for the food she offered to him and took hold of can of soda, takes a sip then offers it back to her for her to drink some.* - Mon Nov 30 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) placed the container on the table beside him. He saw the look she gave the can of soda and chuckled lightly, "I may use poison in battle.. but I don't have it in.~" He pushes himself closer to Kariudo so he could sit directly next to her. "Or did I ruin the drink for you?~"* - Mon Nov 30 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thought about the question. "Remember when I told you about the thrill of getting something you shouldn't? Or.. earning something?"* - Mon Nov 30 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah.. - Mon Nov 30 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And.. you said I can't touch you, right? - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Ultimate.. thrill. - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..........I see.... - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: So I was a cheap thrill.. - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Well...not -cheap- - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You paid pretty badly for it. - Mon Nov 30 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "True. Not everyone deserves good things."* - Mon Nov 30 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm just one of those unlucky ones. - Mon Nov 30 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...You deserve good things... - Mon Nov 30 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: But not how you went about it. - Mon Nov 30 02:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed. "Before.. it was straight lust and thrill.. Lost to claim your body as mine and make you know that you belong to me and my desires.." He pauses and looks at her, meeting her gaze. "Now it's to show you.. that I'm willing to 'earn' my spot in your life.. rather than forcing my desires on you.. I want you to share the same desires I do.. and not have that disgusted look."* - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) knew that their time away would make things hard, but who was he going to look forward to here? It's not like there were females in the village that remotely attracted him --- that was the easy part of all this.

He nods his head, "yeah. I don't see why not. I'm as determined as I am stupid.."* - Mon Nov 30 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What about Akarui? - Mon Nov 30 04:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn... she will try in my absence. - Mon Nov 30 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: It's funny to feel jealousy when I can't even bring myself to kiss you. - Mon Nov 30 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...did I just say that out loud? - Mon Nov 30 04:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Another smirk forms on his face. He winks at Kariudo and shrugs his shoulders. "Like I said: whatever it takes for you to not be disgusted in me.~ And Akarui is the type of person that'll pursue and fail. Whether or not she got the idea from your.. blunt.. statements, that's her problem. My problem is finding out what I have to do to be 'that'.. right person for you."* - Mon Nov 30 04:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was sitting in the bed with nothing but his black boxers on. The bruises and lumps on his face pretty much cleared up at this point, the only thing keeping him here is the doctors desire to analyze his mend.

When Kariudo creeked the door open a bit Sogeki would smirk a bit but act oblivious to her presence. He keeps his head slightly lowered and eyes fixated on a magazine given to him for mental stimulation.* - Tue Dec  1 07:47:12 2015

He got a pair of baggy gym shorts, puts them on, and walks back over to the bed. "Your way or the highway.~" He gives her a wink and sat at the side of the bed, making sure not to touch her.* - Tue Dec  1 07:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's left eyebrow rose. "Wow. Way to get my hopes up," he says. It was clear he picked up on what she said, but didn't bother to push toward it.* - Tue Dec  1 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, hah. Have to keep you on your toes. - Tue Dec  1 08:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked.* - Tue Dec  1 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "Tell me how to make you comfortable.. I'll do anything."

There was a sudden seriousness in his voice, almost as if he was begging her. His eyes lowered a bit and so did his head, a bit of shame and uneasiness emitting from his person. "Anything, Kariudo.."* - Tue Dec  1 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's head slowly shook, "just.. let me know.. I have to make this up to you.."* - Tue Dec  1 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ugh... - Tue Dec  1 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Come on....cut that out. - Tue Dec  1 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's head was still lowered and his eyes remained diverted away from Kariudo. With the thoughts that ran through his mind he knew he couldn't manage a direct eye contact with her so her current appearance went unnoticed. He'd have to hear a true change in her voice to pick up on anything. "You say.. you're not mad and you're so.. willing to even speak with me and consider.. certain things.. Let me prove that this isn't a waste of time.. and.. and.. just-," he sighs again and brings his hand to the sides of his head, trailing his fingers through his hair.* - Tue Dec  1 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stayed quiet for a while. He wanted to answer the question, but nothing that came to mind remotely made sense. He closed his eyes and squeezed them close as tight as he could, desperately trying to come up with an answer. His fingers clamp down on a good amount of his hair and takes in  deep breath.

A few seconds pass and he eventually exhale the breath into a sigh, slowly shaking his head. "I don't know-," he looked up in submission and saw her flushed state. "Wh-what's wrong?"* - Tue Dec  1 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) felt as if she was lying, but momentarily let it go. He keeps his eyes fixed on her and nodded a bit, "alrigh.. then." He brings his hands down from his his head and folds his arms across his chest, "I.. want -you- to tell me what I can do.."* - Tue Dec  1 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...but I don't kno- - Tue Dec  1 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) goes to grab for the special clicker. The clicker was designed to send a small alert to the front desk of the hospital and tell them that the pacient in this specific room needed something. He kept a close eye on Kariudo as he reached for it. Whether or not this was just an emotional event and she just needed the topic to change or something was genuinely wrong with her. He takes in a deep breath and released it in a sigh, clicking the notification button.

In a few minutes time a nurse should arrive.* - Tue Dec  1 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..What's wrong, Kariudo.. - Tue Dec  1 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. The request was odd but Sogeki was determined to comply. When the nurse went to place a hand on her forehead for temperature purposes, Sogeki would reach forward and grab the nurses' wrist. "No."

She looks at him with a confused expression, wiggling her hand out of his grasp. Instead, she goes over to the sink on the other side of the room and gathered a few supplies from the top cupboard.

She walks over with a oral thermometer and gestures for Kariudo to open her mouth. Of course, with Sogeki's aid, Kariudo was ordered to sit up as much as she can. There, the nurse would place the thermometer under Kari's tongue and have her hold it there.

Once that was done, the nurse brings over a manual blood pressure machine. she places the wrap around Kariudo's left arm and begin pumping using the hand-held device. Within the third or forth pump the nurse grabs for the thermometer, frowns with a nod and continues taking Kari's pressure.

When all the testing was done, without saying a word, the nurse would get up and head out the room. She returns a few minutes later with a single tablet and a small paper cup of water.

"You have a fever and your heart rate is a bit high. This should do the trick in no time. I suggest you either lay down and ride it out or get escorted home by a few EMT's. It's your choice. Feel free to use the clicker if you decide to leave, I'll personally arrange something."

The nurse places the cup of water and container, with the tablet in it, on the side table next to the bed. She leaves the room and Sogeki goes to place Kari more on the bed, making her sit straight up while using the wall as leverage. Upon doing so he'd grab for the container and tablet, offering the pill to her then the water.* - Tue Dec  1 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's own heart rate was picking up. He watches her down the tablet and nodded. "Atta girl," he whispers. He climbs up more on the bed and sits himself next to her. He knew her rules on physical contact and such, but he felt like this was an exception. He placed his hand on one of hers that was on her lap, squeezing gently in a comforting way. Sogeki remains quiet, simply watching her for the remainder of the time.* - Tue Dec  1 08:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip and continues to stare at her, panning his eyes up and down her visage. A few minutes pass of silence before he sighed a bit and spoke in a hushed tone.

"If I knew being shirtless would do this to you, I would've at least put on a tank top.~"* - Tue Dec  1 09:04:51 2015
