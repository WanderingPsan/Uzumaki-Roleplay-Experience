<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Up for some training? - Fri Dec 11 22:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Yea, Sure. - Fri Dec 11 22:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Any kind in particular? - Fri Dec 11 22:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Nope. - Fri Dec 11 22:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Spar it is then. - Fri Dec 11 22:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) yawns.

It's been a while since he achieved the Chuunin rank. Quite frankly he doesn't even know what to do now. It wasn't like he wanted the rank in the first place, and it's not like he doesn't want it now --- he just felt more stagnant than ever. If anything, the Chuunin-life is as boring as the Genin-life. Hell, it may just be more boring. He just sat here, at the base of the mountain leading to the Raikage's manor, being a guard. Being a guard doesn't bother him, it's the fact that the only thing he ever stops from intruding, when intruding was actually possible, was a few Genin that was looking for missions.

This is a time waster.

Sogeki's constant yawning turns into sighs. He has his arms folded across his chest and his head raised back until it leaned against the rocky wall. His eyes are fixed on the sky, watching the clouds have more of an interesting life than him. His breathing was subtle and calmed, showing that despite his slight annoyance of nothing happening, he's still pretty relaxed --- guess that's the only upside to sitting here all day every day, he gets to relax.* - Sat Dec 12 03:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || There is actually a point where a person can have too much relaxation.

Sogeki is currently at that point.

He's tired of sitting around doing nothing. Training, guard duty and sky staring --- three activities that revolve around relaxing. Kumogakure is a village he takes great pride in, that's a given. However, at this point, Kumogakure is the most boring place to be in. Nothing, since the war three years ago, is entertaining. Couse Kariudo's occasional arrival is always great, but moments like this make him dread becoming a Chuunin. He upholds great honor in the rank, he'll never do anything less, but this was becoming more of a chore than a basic lifestyle. Hell, it was becoming bothersome to sit in this one generic spot and stare off at the most dullest things ever.

Sogeki is growing wary. Excitement, even if it's to the minimum degree, is all he hoped for. Knowing him though, he wasn't going to rebuttal and demand any other mission. Hopefully he can bear through it and something'll come to him.* - Sat Dec 12 04:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reaches over toward his sack, extracts from its confinements and begins toying with it. Desperation for any form of entertainment was starting to get the best of him, his arrow being the play-thing at the moment. Sogeki places his focus on the tip of the arrow, watching his purple-colored poison drip down that arrow's length. Suddenly, he'd grip the tool a bit tighter and coat his chakra in its entirety --- he taps into his special chakra nature. This chakra, as it coats the arrow, would taint and invert into a thick layer of poison; course this causes the secondary source of poison to be negated and replaced with the chakra-infused one.

He sighs, releases the chakra and drops the arrow back into the sack. "So fucking boring.."* - Sat Dec 12 05:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighs yet again. He leans over to the left and pulls out a scroll from his back-pouch. Attached to the scroll is a small container of ink and a pen; the container only supplying the user with enough ink to create a quick and simple letter. Course, Sogeki literally has no one to write to so he was going to use this scroll and ink for something else.

After pulling the pen and container from the side of the scroll Sogeki would unravel it. The inside is empty, showing that nothing was prewritten on it. At this point Sogeki opens the container of ink and dips the tip of the pen in, soaking it with the thick liquid. There, he'd begin to glide the pen over the canvas in a art-like fashion --- he's obviously drawing something.

By time Sogeki ran out of ink the canvas of the scroll was completely covered. Even the most unknowing could tell he drew a basic fuuinjusu seal, one that is intended to seal something. From the size of the center piece, within the seal itself, the amount of items that could be seal is small --- maybe three or four. Sogeki looks down at his work and rolled his eyes, finding even this wasn't entertaining enough for him.

At the end of the day, he was still stuck in this one spot doing nothing.* - Sat Dec 12 05:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) opens his eyes and smirked. "Mhm. Keep playing.~"* - Sat Dec 12 05:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks at her and raised his hand just to wiggle his fingers. "Keeeeep plaaaying.~"* - Sat Dec 12 05:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) laughs a bit and reaches over for her just to pull her on his lap again. He doesn't tickle her, but teasingly put both his hands on her waist. His lips find the side of her cheek for a few seconds, giving her a subtle kiss. "What's wrooooong?~"* - Sat Dec 12 05:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grew wider. Just to tease her a bit more and keep her on edge he'd twitch both his index finger against her waists. "Alright, what do you have in mind?"* - Sat Dec 12 05:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nngn... - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Anything but sitting around. - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You could test new poisons... or... we could just do a good work out... or we could spar... but that seems pointless nowadays... I can't beat you anymore. - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Can't beat me..? - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Haha, you're kidding. - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And.. new poisons.. - Sat Dec 12 05:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I have a few new techniques, mastered bout one and a half. - Sat Dec 12 05:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you make new poisons? I wasn't sure. - Sat Dec 12 05:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. I wouldn't say -new-.. just stronger. - Sat Dec 12 05:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...but you kill things with the other one. - Sat Dec 12 05:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: True.. I just have to be more careful with the latest version of my poison. - Sat Dec 12 05:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides. - Sat Dec 12 05:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) he leans in a whispers into he ear.

"I got a way to get the poison out without the antidote."* - Sat Dec 12 05:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: her* - Sat Dec 12 05:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .....that sounds dirty. - Sat Dec 12 05:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Sat Dec 12 05:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. He didn't think of it that way, but when he did a large smirk regrows on his face.* - Sat Dec 12 05:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmmm.. - Sat Dec 12 05:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) knew what he wanted to use the poison for and what he wanted to do after using the poison but he doesn't say it. Instead, subconsciously, he chews on his lowerlip for a bit. After a few seconds of being in thought he'd slowly shake his head.

"N-Nah," he says in a hushed tone, "uhh.. you suggested a work out? What do you have in mind?"* - Sat Dec 12 05:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) coughed. "Probably.. not in the way you think."* - Sat Dec 12 05:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What way then? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I mean normally you use poison.... to do things sexually to me... is it something else you had in mind? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Something ....dangerous? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's exactly -that- which I want to use the poison for.. I mean, just the thought of using this advanced version is dangerous and., and an extreme turn on. - Sat Dec 12 05:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I mean.... could it kill me? - Sat Dec 12 05:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: If I use too much, yes.. course I wouldn't even make it get to that point. - Sat Dec 12 05:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ....what will it do to me? - Sat Dec 12 05:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The same thing. I have it under control. - Sat Dec 12 06:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...Then how is it more powerful? It doesn't even do a different thing? Lame. - Sat Dec 12 06:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reaches for an arrow. Once extracting it he'd place it in front of Kariudo, showing her that it wasn't laced with the usual dripping poison. Not even an explosive tag was tied to it. However, as he makes physical contact with it, his chakra to coat around the arrow and "invisibly" lace it with his special poison. "This," he whispers subtly, "is the next 'level' of my poison."* - Sat Dec 12 06:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .......................... - Sat Dec 12 06:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: #Nope. - Sat Dec 12 06:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) let her maneuver away up until the last second. He goes to gently grab one of her hands at get her attention, bringing the tip of the arrow to her mid-bicep. "Still willing to test it?~"* - Sat Dec 12 06:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) glides the tip of the arrow across her arm, not making it pierce her and inject the unique poison. "Chakra," he says casually, "purest form of poison.. chakra."* - Sat Dec 12 06:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded in reply to her question. He stares at his arrow, getting a bit aroused at how she trembled under his control --- the poison wasn't even injected in her yet. He chews on his bottom lip a bit and glides the tip back up her arm, stopping around the same place he started. With the hand that gripped hers he'd reach behind her and go to take hold of her butt. His fingers rested right under her cheek, where her thigh and the start of her butt were. "Very.. possible."* - Sat Dec 12 06:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus remains on Kariudo.

His fingers trailed more between the creases of her cheeks, wishing her pants weren't there. Still, he would add just a bit more pressure to press as much of his finger and the back of her pants between her ass. "Been a while since I've been able to roam your body," he glares at her and chews on his bottom lip for a few seconds, "my place?"* - Sat Dec 12 06:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Giving me a wedgy...hmph. - Sat Dec 12 06:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: O-okay... your p-place... just cut it out with this public stuff...ngng.. - Sat Dec 12 06:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raised himself off the ground, lifting her in his arms in the mean time. The arrow is removed from Kari's bicep and placed back in his sack. "I actually like stealing a few feels," he looks around and watches the civilians pass by, "just imagine the thrill knowing at any second we could be caught so we have to stay on our toes.~" He'd give her innocent smile as if he was talking about the Holy Gezo themselves, preaching their word and everything that was holy.* - Sat Dec 12 06:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leads her to the living room slash bedroom. He places her on the bed and just looks over her frame. A look of want and anticipation plasters over his face as he reaches behind his back for the same arrow. His chakra coats it once more and goes to rub the tip over her clothed upper chest. He says nothing to her, just kept a visual lock on her face.* - Sat Dec 12 06:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) managed to glide the tip of the arrow between her breasts and down her stomach, in which case he'd stop once her belly button was found. There, with his other hand, he'd grip the tail of her coat and whatever clothing she had underneath that layer and raise it. Once again his arrow would meet her skin and just gently prick on the side. It came like a small poke, all that is needed to start the process.

He keep his focus on her face while slowly continuing to lift the clothing he had gripped, subtly and gracefully flowing his movements together so nothing felt rushed. He drops the arrow on the side table and just waited.* - Sat Dec 12 06:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's movements remain slow. Eventually he had her top over her chest, at which point he stopped. Sogeki notices her lacy bra and couldn't help but lately whistle, audibly letting her know he enjoyed what he was seeing. With her top now above her breasts he'd use his free hand to reach forward and cup one, squeezing and fondling gently. Meanwhile he'd climb over her a bit, maneuvering his way between her lays and hover over. His head finds her other breast and his stretched out tongue glides over as much flesh as the bra allowed.* - Sat Dec 12 06:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reaches up to her bra straps, pulling them down from her shoulders. He moves to the cups of her bra and tugs on that, exposing her twins. He looks at both niipples and licks his lips in anticipation. "Maybe something he knew," he manages to whisper before lowering his head and clamping his lips around her right nub.

His left hands trails down her body, gliding oer her stomach and snaking under her pants. At this point he was looking to cup and graze over her lips, feeling his way through her mound.* - Sat Dec 12 06:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's lips formed a smirk around her nipple. The panic in his voice was heard and he loved it. His tongue glides over her nub, licking and flicking it in that order. "Him.. The modest -," he cuts himself off on purpose, wanting to tease her just a bit more. He lifts his head then moved on to her other nipple, repeating his tongue motion. Sogeki's hand found her lacy panties and was immediately ready to lay eyes on them. Course he rubs his fingers over her lips a few times and poked at her clit a bit, but he'd slowly pull his hand out and go to undo her pants button. Once that was done he'd return to snake under her panties and meet her lips again, focusing on he entrance just a bit more than last time.* - Sat Dec 12 07:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) paused for just a moment, "that'll never happen." He assures her once again that she's all his and that's how he wanted to keep it --- it was actually the only way he thought of her, his. If he was asked if he owned her, he'd say yes with no regret or hesitation, that's the level of 'mine mine mine' he was on for Kariudo. That was beside the point.

He smiles warmly and nodded his head, applying even more pressure to her clit and inching his middle finger into her entrance. He stops just before he was to pass his first joint, swaying that much of his finger back and forth inside her. "The modest Sogeki.~ The one that threatened to put it in your face.~"* - Sat Dec 12 07:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) calls her bluff.

A devious smile forms on his face as he slowly pulls his hand away from her pussy. Sogeki makes sure to rub his entire middle finger over her clit, swaying his finger back and forth just to get her soaking before he was fully out. Once he was, he'd bring his hand to his mouth and lick off her juices --- in the same fashion of a fat guy licking off his fingers after eating some hot wings. "Pretty good~," he mocks as he lifts himself up off of her. His other hand found his zipper, feeling the bulge in hidden behind his pants. He looks down at her, as he laid on the bed and as he stood at the side of her. He grips the zipper with two fingers and pulls it down.

Before he could even reach half way his cock would spring out and force the remaining distance to open, exposing itself to her view. He grabs the length of his member and slowly stroked it in front of her face, wanting her to see what he was planning to place in her mouth. "Honestly," he says in a casual whisper, "I've been wondering how this'll feel for the longest." He stops stroking and reaches for her cheek, glides his thumb to her bottom lip and slowly got to open her mouth. Sogeki would intentionally make his member raise and lift, taking full advantage of its erect state.* - Sat Dec 12 08:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her lips part and he immediately bit down on his. He saw her tongue and lust guided his hips to place the very tip of his cock against her mouth. The look in her eyes was noticed, but easily mistaken as that moment where thrill and fear merged together and gave her a level of satisfaction from this all --- in the end, he took it as the "okay".

His hips sway back, pulling his cock from her lower lip. He uses his thumb to part her mouth a bit more before swaying his hip forward against, placing his head just between her lips. He keeps it there, wanting to see if she'd naturally go to use tongue or give the slightest of jerk to indicate she's pulling away.* - Sat Dec 12 08:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shivered in delight at the brief moment his head made contact with her tongue. When she only retracted her tongue, but not jerks her head back in an attempt to fight against the poison, he took it as her just being nervous and intimidated by his cock. A smile forms on his face as his head fell back. The vibrating sent to his cock from her puppy-like whine and groan inclining him to put more and more of his member into her mouth. He does just that.

Slowly, with his thumb still opening her mouth wider and wider, he'd push more of his cock into her. His pace was slow not because he was over considerate of how she was handling this, but because he wanted to feel every bit of this. "Sh-Shit..~"* - Sat Dec 12 08:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't know if this was her getting into the blowjob or not, but the movement of her tongue and the sudden jerk forward sent him to heaven. His hip inched forward in reply to her jerk and then the call for his name, right after the groan, put him at an all-time high. He wasn't going to cum from this, but have mercy on his soul. Everything was feeling right against his cock and he wasn't even having her deep throat.. yet.

His hand glides over her cheek and caresses it with his thumb, finding that her lips wrapping around his member would make this even more perfect. Course, with his thumb now free she'd able to mutter just a bit more words than before. Right now, however, he was saying his hips back and forth --- slowly fucking her face while making sure not to put too much in her mouth every time he went back in. He was savoring that for later.~* - Sat Dec 12 08:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but give his hips a few more thrusts. This feeling was unbelievable and it was driving him crazy. Yes, lust was taking over his mind but just hint of modesty and caringness from before was stronger. His cock brushes against the back of her throat twice, feeling her muscles clench and gag against her frame for just a brief moment --- his releases a moan of straight joy. Still, he fights himself and pulls his cock out and lays the head on her bottom lip. He groans again, audibly showing his enjoyment in this all. He cry for him to stop was granted, but only because he was conflicted between his lust and he refusal to go against her no's.* - Sat Dec 12 09:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked down at her and watched as she diverted her eyes away from him. He can't lie, the sight he had was amazing. His lover has his cock against her bottom lip, but she diverted her eyes. Sogeki nods to himself and fought back his lust as much as he could. He didn't bother to say anything, just pulled his cock away and took her by the arm, gently shifting her so she was now on her stomach. Sogeki then walks to the end of the bed and reached over to grab her pants, and panties, by the waistband and pull them down to her ankles --- tugging them off once there.

He didn't know how to make it up to her, since clearly she didn't find enjoyment from him face-fucking her. He decided to just return the favor, pleasing her to that point of no return. Sogeki separates her legs and climbs in between. His head, of course, made his mouth over right over her mound where his tongue stuck out and grazes against her clit. He gives it a few flicks and licks then slowly dove in, puckering his lips to gently kiss hers and open his mouth enough to lick her pussy as a whole. He repeats this several times.* - Sat Dec 12 09:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) grabs both her cheeks, something he loved doing since she had such a nice ass. He gives her right cheek a proper slap as his tongue continues to run across her pussy. He licks from the bottom to the top, which was from her clit to her entrance. Once he did make it to her entrance, he'd extend his tongue as far as it could go and push his head in, driving his tongue in. He pulls his head back, then in.. then back.. then in.. At this point he was tongue-fucking her entrance.* - Sat Dec 12 09:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continues to work Kariudo's body, not going to settle with this small orgasm --- he wanted the real deal. Both his hands continue to grope her ass, squeezing and jiggling the meat of her cheeks back and forth and side to side. Every now and then he'd swat one of the cheeks, trying his best to slap a different area. Too much pain wasn't something he's looking for right now. His tongue, however, continued to ride Kariudo out. It got to the point where he'd extend his tongue completely out and force it as far as it can go inside her then flick around on the inside. Then, in a subtle movement, he'd push on her cheeks to expose more of her pussy to his liking and, literally, suck in her lips. There, he'd nibble and lick for a few seconds just to go to her clit and focus on that for a few second, flicking the tip of his tongue against the nub then licking it on a whole. After doing all that, in that same order over and over again, he'd go back to bobbing his head back and forth to tongue fuck her again.* - Sat Dec 12 09:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) hit the spot he was looking for.

He continues to relentlessly rampage over her pussy, not caring for what she says or what movements she managed to muster her while the poison invaded her body. This moment was all about her and he was going to keep it that way. Two orgasms thus far and he hasn't even dipped his cock in her, she deserved to feel good so it didn't even matter to him if he actually -do- get his dick in. He rides her orgasm out, squeezing her cheeks tightly and bobbing her head back and forth to continue tongue fucking her --- he bon of his head had less speed and pressure until he eventually went down to a few small licks of her lips and entrance. At this point he figured that to just lay her out cold and let her glide down from this high.* - Sat Dec 12 10:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Rather quiet around here.. - Sat Dec 12 11:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I wouldn't mind a quick match.. - Sat Dec 12 11:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lifted his head and leans forward, placing his gaze on Akito in the distance.

"Are you up for that training session?"* - Sat Dec 12 11:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...Yeah, they'd have no reason to do so... They go about things all wrong.. If glory is what they truly desire they shouldve never become shinobi. - Sat Dec 12 13:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It seems the motto. - Sat Dec 12 13:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded then turned to the Raikage.

"I might enter in the private exams."* - Sat Dec 12 14:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmmmmm, you are confident in your ability? - Sat Dec 12 14:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: True, true. - Sat Dec 12 14:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: In the mean time then, may we talk in private? - Sat Dec 12 14:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Of course. - Sat Dec 12 14:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Could I borrow some money? - Sat Dec 12 14:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) steps off to the side and heads up the mountain, hoping the Raikage was to follow.* - Sat Dec 12 14:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stood before his leader and kneels respectively, bowing his head as he spoke.

"I'm not entirely sure that you're aware, but I caught some word of some destruction that happened in Konohagakure recently. Apparently a battle was engaged between two powerhouses and it left the western flank of the village weak. Course I'm still willing to go on that Hokage-mission we talked about before the war. This time, however, it's more of a scouting thing than message relayal."* - Sat Dec 12 14:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in understanding.

"Do you request I obtain verbal information? Act as their own and go from there, or do you simply want a scale of their physical situation?"* - Sat Dec 12 14:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Both would be helpful. Just don't kill anyone, but if you need to defend yourself. - Sat Dec 12 14:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Do so. - Sat Dec 12 14:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nods once more. The level of understanding that Eiyu and Sogeki had was commendable. It's clear that Eiyu is the higher up, but Sogeki always felt like he can talk to the Raikage on a brotherly level rather than from a commander standpoint.

"It's no hidden fact that I am a master manipulator of poison. Archery is my specialty and I feel like us being a mountainous village is something we can basically use to our advantage.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) releases a subtle sigh, a slow shake of his head suggesting that Akito's words hit the spot but it's a matter of what beliefs are being upheld. "In times like this I wonder what path I truly belong on. The arrow-like path that sends me through life in a straight shot with little lessons learned? Or the round-about path that makes each lesson felt more than the pain our shinobi faced at Sunagakure's hands. I stood in this spot every day on guard duty since the war, and I have yet to make up my mind on what step I take next --- or what path I take once my journey meets two different roads."

He begins to chuckle, placing his hands behind his head and looks up at the sky. "Right now, the lesser must be eradicated. Justice isn't something that can be placed in a system with rules and regulations, but an instinct that kicks in at times like this. I suppose a basic yes or no will determine whether or not my mind will sway from this matter," he places his gaze on Akito, "the death of Rias.. Yay or Nay?"* - Sun Dec 13 01:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) continues to blink a bit. At first he didn't know what she was talking about, but then the light bulb went off. Sogeki gave a half-assed chuckle and shrugs. "Yeaah, great!"* - Sun Dec 13 08:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Let's get started. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Right now. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ---...uh. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Okay. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why did he look at me like that? - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) took one of her hands and pulled her along as he paced toward the training area.* - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) walks over to the fences and pulls out multiple scrolls. Along with the scrolls are wires commonly used for his bow. For each scroll there was one wire, which he tied the wires around said scrolls then use the other end to tie to the fence. In the end, the scrolls were dangling horizontally from the fences. At this point, he'd grab one of the scrolls, the one at the far right, and tug it. Once releasing, the scroll would hit into another and that one hit into the other. By time all scrolls were hit, they're sway back and forth.

"Alright," he begins. His voice is leveled, but extremely stern. "First thing we need to establish is aim. Using a bow is nothing if you can't at least point the arrow at your target, no matter the situation. That being said, your first lesson is to hit any of these scrolls three times with a kunai as they sway."* - Sun Dec 13 08:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || Of course he'd walk back over to her and grant her three kunai's.* - Sun Dec 13 08:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick)  rolled his eyes, letting Kari's comments pass over him. He knew that this was basic training, but it was only basics that were taught in the Academy. To be a true marksman, you must go past that level and achieve the newer level --- this was nothing more than him refreshing her mind. 

Once her third eyes exposed Sogeki nodded in approval --- it's true that a true marksman must take advantage of all their abilities to secure a hit. Sogeki walks over to the line of scrolls and clipped off all the wires except one. This time around, he'd begin to vigorously maneuver the tied scroll --- it's now spinning like a high paced Farris wheel [spelling]. To assure that the pace doesn't slow down, he'd manually rotate it with his hand while leaning against the fence itself.

"A simple refreshment of your mind, Kariudo. Now.. Hit the Scroll."* - Sun Dec 13 10:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smacks that ass, "hey you."* - Sun Dec 13 10:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raised his opposing hand and caught the kunai just as it was to pass his frame. Two fingers, his index and middle, clamp on to the hilt and casually tossed it at Kari's feet. "Again," he says. His tone suggested that he was annoyed and angry, but the expression on his face told he was calm and patient. "Don't try to hit the scroll as it's spinning, but before it reaches its next location." To make it slightly easier of Kariudo, he'd slow the pace at which the scroll was spinning. "For now, don't try to hit the middle, just land the kunai on the scroll.."* - Sun Dec 13 10:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched the kunai zip toward him. He sighs. The same hand he used to catch the kunai before is raised and with relaxed sigh he'd catch it between two fingers again --- just before it was to drive straight through his eye. "Alright, maybe this isn't working- Actually.. I know exactly what we can do."

He chucks the kunai back to Kariudo and releases the wire that kept the scroll attached. After a few second of letting the momentum die down Sogeki detaches the scroll. "Hit the scroll." He launches the scroll straight up in the air, expecting her to aim and hit it.* - Sun Dec 13 10:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: How can she not hit it? - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You're joking. - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked at the scroll starting to free fall.* - Sun Dec 13 10:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Tick tock, tick tock. - Sun Dec 13 10:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded in approval. He paces under the descending scroll and catches it, takes the kunai and launched it back to her. "Good job."

He'd then thrust the scroll straight in the air. This time however, he has it spin.  That way, the bullseye was only open for merely a second, making it harder for her to hit. "Hit the target."* - Sun Dec 13 10:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: OMG - Sun Dec 13 10:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched Kariudo's every moment. He saw he focus and he saw her 'train of thought' --- from how she launched the kunai he knew what she imagined. Nevertheless, the scroll got a beaten. The kunai pierces right through, hitting the bullseye from the back. He nods in approval and shrugged, "good job."

He didn't bother with catching that scroll, it was done for. Instead, he goes for two of the others and chucked them in the air, spinning one and leaving the other to stay stagnant rotation wise. Just as he did that he'd launch two kunai toward her, expecting her to catch it, aim and fire to hit the bullseye in a swift movement and fluent movement, "hit the bullseyes."
* - Sun Dec 13 11:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was willing to accept her progress thus far and deem her ready, but he desperately wanted to add the icing to the cake --- just to assure himself that she had this down. He picks up another scroll, allowing the two in the air to fall victim to gravity. In a swift movement he'd unravel as much of the scroll as possible and launch it into the air. Seeing as though the bullseye was on the outer part of the parchment, now that it was flowing in the air and the wind was making the length flap around, it'll make it a bit harder for Kariudo to pinpoint a proper time to launch her kunai. "Hit the bullseye."* - Sun Dec 13 11:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) steps to the side and folds his arm across his chest and let the pierce scroll drop to the ground. "Alright, I'll accept that for now." He places his gaze on Kariudo and shrugged. "You're ready for the actual training now."* - Sun Dec 13 11:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) steps to the side and folds his arm across his chest and let the pierce scroll drop to the ground. "Alright, I'll accept that for now."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: My eye is giving me a headache. - Sun Dec 13 11:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) attaches a wire to another scroll and hands it from the fence. There was no special spin, not unique arch --- just a basic scroll that's going to be used for target practice.

Sogeki walks over to Kariudo and hands her his bow. He had to pull it from around his body and place it in her grip of many hands. "Alright, your dominant hand.. or hands.. must grip the length of the bow. That is your foundation. Your opposing hand..s.. will ready the arrow and pull the string back. Your target practice before is to rerun the basics, now apply that to this. Wind the arrow and wire back, aim and fire." Throughout the instructions Sogeki would maneuver his way behind the female and physically lift and lower her arms of choice to how they should be.* - Sun Dec 13 11:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched the arrow fly. Honestly? She did ten times better than what he thought she'd do. The last person that he tried to teach didn't make it past a foot in distance; she had nothing to be ashamed of.

Rather than cracking jokes and trying to tease her about her failure he nods, "good job." Sogeki reaches behind his back and pulls out another arrow, hands it to her and had her ready it. "Your form is good, but not perfect. I want you to experiment with what feels right to you and makes you feel under complete control over both the arrow and bow. Don't try to use brute strength, but channel that strength through the wire and allow that to launch the arrow forward." Sogeki gives her an example by placing his hands over hers and using his own ability with the bow to pull the string back, aim the arrow and launch it forth. Of course, he hits the bullseye. "The bow is a part of you and the arrow is an extension of yourself."* - Sun Dec 13 12:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) had long since noticed Akito but didn't bother to say anything to him. His focus remained on Kariudo and the task at hand, watching the stance and result of her new foundation. He nods once more, commending her for her success compared to her last efforts. Once again, after she went and unsheathed another arrow from his quiver, Sogeki would slightly turn his head in Akito's direction. "I have."

Sogeki brings his arms around Kari once more, deciding that if she was going to use multiple hands that it's best she doesn't conflict the string in its pullback and release. He made it so the arrow was firmly tucked in her grasps and the wire wouldn't cause a back fire. Her grip on the bow itself was superb; he didn't have to modify that. With the slight adjustment he'd ease back from her body and let her do her thing, "go ahead and launch. Remember to keep the string in your control at all times. Use it as the base of your strength." Sogeki released a sigh and shrugged a bit, once again turning a bit to suggest Akito had his attention. "I looked into the situation and decided that I'll let it rest. Revenge is something I sought out rather than seeing if it'll seek me. Whether or not it does, I won't force others to walk this path with me.. I may never return."* - Sun Dec 13 12:45:23 2015
