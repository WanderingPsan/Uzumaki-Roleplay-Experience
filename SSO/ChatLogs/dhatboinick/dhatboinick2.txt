<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's more to do with the fact we have a lack of leadership. - Sat Sep 19 12:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If you are truly next in line to uphold that position, then you must allow your mind to reopen and accept the fact that your safe haven, Tethys, is no longer here. You, and only you, can be your safe haven from this point on. - Sat Sep 19 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's why i'm training so much. - Sat Sep 19 12:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're using your stepping stone, killing Zetsumo, is the wrong way. View him as just that, a stepping stone that's merely a little elevated than the rest. - Sat Sep 19 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So you have to put in more efforts to pass over said stone. - Sat Sep 19 13:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) takes a step back, allowing the space between him and Himura to grow. An understanding was made between Erebus and Mitsuru, something that the rest of Kirigakure would most likely deem impossible.

His cloak covered his entire body, only providing a slight glimpse of his lower face when he holds his head at a certain angle. No words were given to Kirie and Koeki, just the subtle sound of his exasperating breath while the high pitch clink as the end of his Scythe trail against the concrete floor. Erebus makes his way to the offset of the bunch, paying everyone with the satisfaction of not greeting them.* - Sat Sep 19 14:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The sound of metal dragging against concrete is heard within the courtyard. The source of said sound came from none other than Erebus as the tip of one of the three prongs on his scythe made contact with the ground. That alone showed the length of the weapon. Erebus, himself, continued to wear the black cloak that provided him with a hoodie to disguise his complete facial features; not to mention the rest of his body. The sleeves of his cloak were longer than his wingspan, giving no visual of his hands as they dropped down beside him. The cloak shields his legs from view as well; not giving anyone the opportunity to read his movements from just mere sight of his footing.

The hoodie provided by the cloak permitted everyone to see his face from the upper lip down, but only once Erebus raised his head at a certain degree. Now, with his head lowered slightly, was not the opportunity for anyone to even see that. For the most part, Erebus remained quiet; having no real reason to acknowledge anyone at the moment. He sets himself up in the off distance, not allowing his self to be tied in to the main line up of Kirigakure shinobi.* - Sat Sep 19 15:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's body pivots forward, the clinking of his scythe dragging on the ground signaling his departure from the courtyard. He provided Baen and Mitsuru a slight nod, allowing them to view his face from the upper lip and down; his hoodie was perfect for concealment of his identity. Erebus' departure was rather swift, time was something he refused to waste.* - Sat Sep 19 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hogo Island, I'll show you the specific location. - Sat Sep 19 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The sound of a hard object rubbing against wood could be heard drawing in, the presence of a cloaked figure being apparent. The figure wore a three pronged scythe on his back, the length being longer than his own height. From the looks of things, if he was to turn and head back to the hallways leading to the Raikage's office, it was the tip of the upper most prongs that dragged on wooden floor. Erebus, the being within the black cloak, edged closer to Aiyana and the male; he says nothing.* - Sat Sep 19 17:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || "It has come down to this, my lord! To you, I submit another sacrifice in your name! Take them, my lord, allow them to meet you at your gates for judgment!"

The battle cry of Erebus was only the frosting to the cake. His body pivots forth, allowing himself to close the distance between him and Kyushiki. Erebus' right arm reached over his left shoulder, allowing his palm to take grasp of the hilt leading to his scythe. Upon doing so, while most likely being close enough, Erebus allowed the massive weapon to slash forward. His intentions were lethal and his aim was to completely hack the males' head off.

[11 Strength, 17 Taijutsu, 12 Attack Speed, 5 tile movement.]* - Sat Sep 19 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) watched the boy progress closer, an attempt to prevent the unsheathing of the Scythe. Some form of respect had to be given to Kyushiki, but respect isn't going to save his life at this moment. Erebus' ability to wield his massive scythe was magnificent, resulting in it being unsheathed with quickness and elegance. Kyushiki managed to pull his two metallic weapons out, but in retaliation Erebus altered his footing and body position; evading the strikes.

Following the evasion, with no time to waste, Erebus would swing his scythe forward. Of course, due to him seeing Kyushiki as nothing more than a sacrificial piece, there was lethal intent in Erebus' intentions. The strike was aimed for the neck of the male, an attempt to end his life.* - Sat Sep 19 18:33:23 2015

It wasn't a greeting or farewell, but rather a physical twitch to assure them that he was indeed back in Kumogakure.

His eyes caught glimpse of a figure standing off in the distance, using the slight mask of the trees shadow to cover himself. Nevertheless, Erebus halts. He examines the fellow cloaked figure a bit, allowing a quick analysis to be made. A minute transcends before any words could be said.

Erebus' head was held high, eyes closed and arms stretched out to the sides of him. The hoodie that came with cloak dropped back, allowing the full view of his face as he stood in his submissive pose. Erebus was indeed a faithful disciple of his higher-power's word, unquestioning the authority of his lord. Every maniacal move Erebus made was in the name of his lord, and thus far he has pleased his god.

"Speak your word, my lord, and I shall shadow each syllable and continue to prove my worth. Voice your wants, my lord, and I shall do everything in my supremacy to help deliver you just that."* - Sun Sep 20 05:04:51 2015

He examines its height, registering the fact that maybe if he climbed its length then he'd be closer to his god. He walks forth, snapping his ankles shut just in front of the mountain and jumping to the top.

"This mountain, my lord, will be my safe haven for when I wish to speak with you."* - Sun Sep 20 05:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) paced forth, cloak covering the entirety of his body. Only visibility of his body was from his upper lip down, but only once he raised his head to a certain angle; his head wasn't at this moment. Erebus' large scythe dragged against the ground as he walked, causing a loud scrapping sound; similar to that of nails dragging against a chalkboard. His tread came to a stop just before Jin, but didn't supply the Chuunin with no acknowledgment. An audible release of a breath came from Erebus, nothing more.* - Sun Sep 20 06:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's head remained lowered, not rising for the least bit. The words of Jin rang through his ears, an insult if the mind of Erebus. Still, however, there was tolerance shown from the loyal Jashinist; no reason to lash out on a person that simply did not comprehend. Nevertheless however, Erebus persisted with his refusal for verbal communication; only another release of a breath could be heard.* - Sun Sep 20 06:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) inched forward, closing the distance between himself and Jin; the loud screeching noise of his scythe scraping against the ground echoed throughout the courtyard. No sudden move, other than that step, was made; another discharge of breath was sounded. Erebus' head raised slightly, giving Jin the opportunity to view the little bit of his face that the hoodie couldn't cover.

"Sins are meant to be repented," whispered Erebus. His voice was soft, but the sensation of something sinister emitted with each syllable.* - Sun Sep 20 06:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The question from Jin caused Erebus' body to twitch; even while masked within his large cloak the twitch was noticeable. Erebus' mind began to spin, as if something sparked a revolt within him that instantly got out of control. Soon enough, however, the Jashinist found his mental balance and opened his jaw to speak once more; this time around, each word he said was trailed by a audible crack of his jaw bones.

"I know not of the sins you commit. Mortals of his world riddle their lives with iniquities; sins must be repented." Erebus voice was no different than the last time, a soft whisper that tagged along with a sinister sensation.* - Sun Sep 20 06:47:15 2015

My abilities far surpass plenty, but I have yet to surpass all. My goal is not vague, but broad due to how wide my path is.

For the time being, however, Erebus brings his left wrist to one of the three blades on his scythe. From there, he allowed the blade to slice his inner and outer wrist.

Blood seeps from his wounds, dripping down the ground and forming a puddle. His crimson blood taints to a pitch black shade as the rest of his body began to morph into something more sinister. Erebus' eyes become more demonic and his posture told the story of a being that was nothing less of possessed.* - Sun Sep 20 10:00:06 2015

Erebus was in a fit of rage, caring not for the wellbeing of Jin; it was time to collect on another sacrifice. However, through the anger and flamboyant episode, a safe haven was established with Erebus' mind. Mitsuru, a recognized ally in the mind of Erebus, called out to him. The words of Mitsuru didn't fall on deaf ears, so by time Erebus was to make it to the halfway point between his original spot and where Jin was, Erebus halted. His glare remained fixed on Jin, but no words were said. An audible release of breath could be heard seeping from Erebus' frame as he held his head low and simply stood there.* - Sun Sep 20 10:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had enough. He cared not for the requests of Mitsuru, just the final sacrifice leading to his seat amongst the gods. The shuriken flew past Erebus' shoulders, landing mere inches before Himura. Using that as the straw that broke the camels' back, Erebus swiftly unsheathed his scythe once more and pivoted toward Jin. A twist in his body, with an outstretched arm, would signal for a lethal attempt.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's grip on the scythe altered as Jin vanished from behind a puff of smoke. Instinctively, Erebus turned his head slightly to locate the Chuunin's new location, but before he knew it he was grasped and launched. His reflexes kicked in that point, allowing his free arm to stretch out and act as a support. Upon doing so, with little time to waste, Erebus pivots forward once again with his scythe ready to hack away at Jin's body; mainly his throat.* - Sun Sep 20 10:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's body turned, meeting the barrage of fireballs head on. Erebus' eyes set upon Jin's frame, caring not for the jutsu Himura used. The most Erebus did, however, was rip the cloak off of his body to prevent any further burns. His own natural resistance to the ninjutsu based attack would aid him in walking through it barely fazed. That being said, while staying hot pursuit on Jin, Erebus would tighten the grip he had on his scythe and send another slash forward, aiming to diagonally lacerate Jin. Following the first swing came a second, aiming to put the nail in the coffin.
