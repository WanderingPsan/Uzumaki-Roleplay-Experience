<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released another sigh, lowering his head a bit and taking a glance at Marrisa. "Your duty is here as a Private of Sunagakure. You and I both know this. What I have in stored will force you to make that decision of 'Ortho.. or Sunagakure', I'm not going to do that to you.." He stands to his feet, grabs his cloak and dressed himself in it. Once again, he aimed to leave the conversation on a cliffhanger, pacing himself toward the exit.* - Tue Nov  3 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "No matter what actions you take, no matter what actions I take, are paths won't cross. Even if they're about to, I will find a way to curve around you. That, Marrisa, is how I'm keeping my promise to always protect you. You and I have that connection internally, but for safety purposes.. I can't afford to let you be involved with me.." He makes another attempt for the exit, pacing himself accordingly.* - Tue Nov  3 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself forward and seated himself by the bush.* - Tue Nov  3 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Quick question. - Tue Nov  3 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: -omit- - Tue Nov  3 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked at the female, then the bush, then back at the female. The look on his face told that he kind've believed.. that she had mental problems. Still, however, he kept that thought to himself.

"What is it saying?" he whispers back.
* - Tue Nov  3 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: And I thought I was weird. - Tue Nov  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times as he glanced back at the bush. He was silent, not knowing what exactly to say at this point. The bush was just.. there, doing nothing but being a bush and living the bush life. If anything, if Ortho truly believed that plants had feelings, he'd suspect that he was invading the bush's personal space.

Eventually, Ortho had something to say about this entire situation. "What.. was it saying before..?"
* - Tue Nov  3 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) altered his focus from the bush to the female then back to the bush. He was genuinely trying to understand what was going on, and in turn he looked dumbfounded. A single nod was granted to her from Ortho as he whispered back. "Next time it talks to you, tell it Ortho says hi."* - Tue Nov  3 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't the type to display a real smile. The most he did to repay the smile was give her a subtle nod and a gentle pat on the back. His focus altered once more, focusing on bush again. "So uhh. Do all plants talk to you, or was it just this bush?" His voice was low, not wanting their business to reach the ears of spectators. * - Tue Nov  3 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) saw the abrupt end to her smile. Ortho was a murderer, yes, but compassion was also within him. He took in a deep breath, audibly exhaling it. He made an obvious attempt to smile, but ended up looking as goofy as a clown without white makeup. She could tell that he was genuinely trying. "All plants, huh? That's pretty, uhh.. cool. Do they talk loud now that you're in the middle of a forest?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow. He honestly thought that every plant life would be bombarding her out here in the wild. Now he looked stupid, as if the goofy smile didn't already do that. A simply nod was given as he looked at the bush then back at her. "Does it.. like feel pain?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So If I HM01'd that bitch it wouldn't scream? -omit- - Tue Nov  3 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was even more dumbfounded. His question must've seemed more in-depth than he intended. In turn, he was left wordless. "I, uh.. I see. Well then. What else can you do..?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head to back up his words. "Yeah. Like, I mean.. you talk to plants. Are you able to like.. talk to farm animals too?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: . . .Do I want to even try and jump in this conversation? . . .Nahhh. - Tue Nov  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Ortho. - Tue Nov  3 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest and altered his positioning. He plops down on his butt and folds his arms over one another, the ideal meditative pose. He folds his arms across his chest and looked at the bush, a look of interest plastered on his face. "I see, I see. So like, are you able to tell this plant to-"

Ortho looks up to see Index. He rolls his eyes before getting to his feet. "Let me guess, I have a bounty on my head now and you've come to collect?"* - Tue Nov  3 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirked. He didn't know why he held a tad bit of doubt within him for Index, but nothing has ever proven that Index was a traitor. In turn, Ortho sits back down and looked down at the bush. "It's nothing major, I suppose. Probably a hundred million at most. Ninety-nine for my amazing hair, one million for attempting to destroy Kirigakure."* - Tue Nov  3 22:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head perked up at the mention of Ume being his friend. He wasn't going to deny it, but he wasn't going to agree to the title. If anything, Ume was someone Ortho thought to be.. unorthodox. In turn, she captured his interest. For the time being, he'd simply nod. "Ehh, she's someone I met here. Not sure if she'd like to have her name spoken, so maybe she'll open up to you. As far as I know, she digs the vegetation life."* - Tue Nov  3 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why is he talking to me instead of the person who is important? - Tue Nov  3 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Strange, it looked like he was delivering bad news but then he smiled. - Tue Nov  3 23:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks toward Ume. "What do you wish to do? Stay here until I get back, or come along?"* - Wed Nov  4 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. "Very well."* - Wed Nov  4 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I trust that you keep this between us. - Wed Nov  4 00:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No one needs to know about this besides the people here. - Wed Nov  4 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Didn't he say 'we'? - Wed Nov  4 00:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Wow. - Wed Nov  4 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released a heavy sigh, allowing his mind to center itself. He gestures for Ume to come along as he paced off toward Genjigakure. As the both paced forth, Ortho would dig extract a kunai from his backpouch. This kunai had a single smoke bomb attached. Within a moment's notice, he'd chuck the kunai high into the air and allowed the bomb to go off. This was obviously a signal.

It didn't take long for a second smoke signal to spawn high in the air. This time, it wasn't from Ortho but from a camp he set up a few days ago. A mass troop of two-thousand, five hundred bandits were on their way to Kirigakure. Meanwhile, Ume and Ortho followed their trail.* - Wed Nov  4 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. So be it. - Wed Nov  4 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Get out here. - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The world we live in is tainted. The world we live in is dirty. I stand here before Kirigakure as the sponge and my jutsu as the soap. Together, my prowess and I will wash away all sin committed.

Ortho's left hand rose to his face. His canine teeth clamp down on his thumb and as the crimson liquid seeped out, he'd smear it in his opposing palm. Handseals are rapidly strung through; the slamming of his palm against the dirt is made at their succession. A massive shroud of smoke spawns and from its confinements came none other than Manda.

Behind Ortho, at this point, was his massive army. He, himself, stood atop Manda's head. The snake knew of the plan already and easily rampaged forth in hopes of penetrating the depleting forces of Kirigakure. Any troops he saw that wasn't owned by Ortho were destroyed. Ortho, whilst his current position, found another set of handseals strung together. At which point, he'd unleash a considerately sized fireball into the village. He added arch with his aim, wanting it to fall on the closest, and biggest, building; the hospital.* - Wed Nov  4 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || This was Ortho's chance. He jumps off Manda's head, allowing the snake to continue its rampage while staying within the generic area. Elon's immediate focus was on the hospital, and even if the building didn't crumble, Ortho was going to take full advantage.

A series of handseals was run through with grace and haste. His lungs expanded with the intake of breath and retracted in timed pulses. Ortho's lips were puckered and his aim for the Elon's head. Air bullets soared toward the male, aiming to take him out in one swoop.

Manda, on the other hand would circle around the area, taking out as much of back up as he could while Ortho handled the finer details. The two-thousand, five hundred, bandits that Ortho brought along continues to seep into the village, doing the major dirty work with Manda.

Following the air bullets, at his current location, Ortho would form another succession of handseals. He makes a back dash and swells his lungs with another mass of air. With a powerful exhale and the swaying of his head, he'd attempt to unleash a powerful gust of wind to knock everyone in the immediate area off their feet.* - Wed Nov  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: riven you didnt see violet rp last night did you - Wed Nov  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||| Talking was futile. Ortho was on a mission and his determination clouded his mind. Volet's words fell upon deaf ears.

Elon sunk beneath the ground and instantly Ortho broke off into another back dash. Handseals were once again formed and chakra was kneaded within his stomach. In a moment's notice, in an attempt to take advantage of Elon's current standings, Ortho slammed his palm on to the ground allowed massive amounts of earth spikes to protrude through the ground. Their intent was to pierce through Elon as he made is way closer.

Ortho have fought against the Hiding Like a Mole technique and that allowed him to find some way to counter.

Violet's clones made their presence felt, but handseals were strung from Ortho in extreme haste. By time the clones were to even complete the handseals they required, Ortho already raged through his own set. Any slam of his palms on the ground was made and just as the clones were to unleash their mud rivers, Ortho would spawn a Earthern Corridor around them.

Manda, in the meantime, would charge toward Violet, attempting to either force her further away from Ortho or to completely crush her under his weight and power.* - Wed Nov  4 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Ok Violet... ready to take out a giant snake? - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tit Kubo(Tsundere-san) says: -omit- - Wed Nov  4 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Violet must be commended for her efforts. She was planning on going toe to toe with Manda, she must think she is Orochimaru. Ortho supplies her with a nod of respect, then a slow shake of his head to show his disapproval.

The chakra flow of Violet wasn't going to go uncountered. Ortho formed a single handseal, allowing a clone to spawn to his right. Following that handseal, he'd muster together a complete series. His lungs would expand once more from a large intake of air and retract as he, the original Ortho, aimed to release a gust of wind. This gust of wind was to put out the lightning chakra around Violet's blade; giving Manda the opening he needed.

Meanwhile, the shadow clone formed its own succession of handseals. His goal was to back his original form up. So once the first gust of wind was made, the clone followed up with a second. This was all supplementary for Manda's efforts to kill off Violet while her lightning was rendered incapable. The two gusts of wind would most likely send Violet off balance. The clone, just like the original, was able to transition to another series of handseals, and it did just that.

The clone spawns a thick layer of liquid around itself and Ortho, creating a safe haven for when the Earth Clones decided to extract themselves from the ground.

Manda, with the possible off balance from Violet, would take that chanced to slam the entirety of his body on top of her. Not once, however, but twice. The first to do the deed, the second for good measures.* - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: so your trying to take away the clow through my blades? - Wed Nov  4 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: "Also, he signed a contract too and if you are dead, ur name will vanish" - Wed Nov  4 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

Ortho: "Manda!"

Manda: "Shut up, I know!"

It was time for the games to end. Violet was a stepping stone at this point and quite frankly, it was time she sunk beneath the surface of this shinobi world. Ortho's eyes narrowed. He charged forward a few feet before halting. Those that are able to view his face could tell, at this point, his once black pupils transitioned into crimson red with a single tomoe circling a black dot.

Ortho strings together a series of handseals, allowing his chakra to knead within his chest. Upon doing so, he'd pucker his lips and unleash a fireball. While the fireball was launched, he'd allow his hands to trail through more handseals. His lungs filled once more and another gust of wind was expelled. This time, his head would sway from left to right; all in an attempt to increase the area of damage for the fire.

Manda, on the other hand, broke to the left, allowing himself to make room for Ortho's attack. By doing so, he'd burrow beneath ground and simply prepared.

Ortho's clone came in for the cut, his focus, without the doujutsu, was on Violet. His own handseals were formed. He slams his palms into the ground, causing more spikes to rupture forth. While the enhanced fireball came from above, the spikes came from below. The clone, however, wasn't done there, he broke off in a sprint southward and his handseals formed again. His pushed his arms out and allowed a devastating flash of lightning to inch toward Violet, zapping her from that angle.

Manda, now beneath the ground, would wait his time for Ortho and the Clone to render Violet incapable before pushing himself out and swallowing her whole.* - Wed Nov  4 03:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || And that point, the same mistake Elon made is what Violet fell victim to. There were no hard feelings for her death, but she was indeed a stepping stone for Ortho's view of 'true peace'.

One of the bamboo spikes protrude through the ground, blood painting its tip. The clone disperses and Ortho's eyes returned to normal, the deed was done. Violet had the opportunity to evacuate sooner, but her pride, which is commendable, allowed her to create her own crave. A nod of utter respect came from Ortho as he bites down on his thumb and smears the blood in his opposing palm. He forms a succession of handseals and slams his palm down, resummoning Manda from beneath the earth.

Whilst on his head, Ortho scans the area.

"Behold, Kirigakure. Two have fallen in the name of peace. Now, with the new generation, you all can rebuild this village and mold it into what it should truly be. No longer will the previous generation, such as shinobi similar to Kirie, work you off like some mule. No longer will you feel obligated to do countless missions at minimum wage. No longer will you have to look at a tyrant masked behind the Mizukage's hat! Now, you can triumph. Take this opportunity to build yourselves back up. Then, and only then, would you be the true shinobi you can possibly be!"* - Wed Nov  4 04:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head as he watched Mana approach him. Whatever form of boost she was just granted caught him off guard a bit, but nothing he couldn't handle. He allows her to scale the body of Manda, wanting her to come catch these hands one on one. (Seeing as though you didn't know Manda was still summoned, I RPied that Manda remained stationary for you to climb up and attack me.)

Ortho opens his palms, allowing his chakra to generate around his hands. As a result, even from the naked eye, a thick layer of his chakra, which came to a point, is formed. Ortho watches Mana close in once meeting the top of Manda's head and he side steps her. Yes, even in Gate three he was able to out reflex her. Just then, with two swipes of hands, he's aim to cut the insides of Mana with the chakra.

"Ease yourself, female. This is for the better good!"* - Wed Nov  4 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It was clear that Mana was outclassed, but her emotion ran rampant and she was making a foolish mistake. Ortho slowly shook his head, side stepping Mana and allowing his chakra scalpels to subside. He didn't want to arm her. "Stop this, Mana! You don't want this pressure!"* - Wed Nov  4 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head slowly once more. "As I said, shinobi of Kirigakure.. This is where you can forge your own destiny; you don't need to look to people that only mooch and not give! You are not slaves, you are people! Hear my words and allow it to register, for I did this for you."

Ortho: "Alright, Manda.. Lets go."

Manda: "You owe me, Ortho.. Remember that.."

If unstopped, Manda would slither off with Ortho on top of his head as the remaining of his bandits retreated as well.* - Wed Nov  4 05:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands away, placing them in his pants pockets. His posture was calm and nonchalant, as if he didn't just kill off a multitude of Kirigakure shinobi. He notices Ume's smile and returned it, he took matching the sadistic vibe. Okay, maybe he smiled because his mission was accomplished, but still. "Let's go before more idiots decide to avenge Violet and Elon." With that, he'd pace off. Of course, his remaining troops scattering back into the wilderness, where their camps were located, to await Ortho's next signal.* - Wed Nov  4 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released a loud chuckle when he saw Nina launch toward Thaenan. He slowly shook his head and wiped away a tear of laughter. "Ahh man, priceless." He thought as he would form a single handseal. Upon its completion, a quick torrent of water would expel forward and aim to clash with Nina's body. It was in no way to harm her, but to.. cool her down? "Oi, it wasn't him Nina."* - Wed Nov  4 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest and watched Nina's movements. When she reached for the corpse Ortho would slowly shake his head. "This is why I want to destroy Kirigakure, Nina. If the village wasn't so foolish, Violet wouldn't be dead right now. Remember that."* - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: So quick to kill her boyfriend... - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes, slowly shaking his head. Nina blamed him for Violets death and Thaenan was salty that Nina attacked him. The only legitimate thing about this scenario that Ortho was indeed to blame for the death, but Thaenan was being a little pansy. Ortho allowed Nina to walk away, taking the corpse with her. "Think about it, Nina. Violet died protecting the falsehood of Kirigakure. The bind that village had on her caused this, not my actions."

Ortho's focus switched to Thaenan. "Ahh shut up and sit your ass down."* - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I want to destroy her emotions, not her pride. - Wed Nov  4 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: My pride is in my accomplishments, so her besting me is no problem. - Wed Nov  4 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: All you did was grow her emotions. - Wed Nov  4 06:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Should, but don't. The shinobi that aren't foolish are outnumbered by the foolish ones. Numbers are a major factor in the shinobi world. - Wed Nov  4 06:42:46 2015

Ortho released a sigh. "You are that flower, the foolish shinobi are those giant trees and I want to be your lucky ray of a sunlight."* - Wed Nov  4 08:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The voice of reason has been muted for far too long. The safe haven aspect of this world has been corrupted for far too long, and it's time that someone took a stand and made that change. The transition between anarchy and serenity is nothing more than an earthquake in the midst of a tornado and hurricane clashing. At this stage of life, this stage of living, there is only one answer to the problems that have constantly pushed us down and kicked us. There is but one answer to restore the world order, but the minds of the common day shinobi is so clouded by greed and self-wants, rather than self-need, that for a person to make it anywhere, they must attach themselves to someone from the previous graduating class.

This world is so segregated that while Sunagakure flourishes, the likes of Kumogakure is still nothing more than shattered earth. This world is so segregated that while Kumogakure is in deep depression, Kirigakure is suffering nukes after nukes to their political and military standings. Right about now, the main focus point is for each refugee to pack their bags, no matter their beliefs has human beings contrasted to plain old Shinobi, and transgresses to a land they know nothing about. The sheer disrespect to their way of life that they're forced to make is what leads to anger and revenge, but then they're labeled as emotional and terrorist because their beliefs were stomped on the ground and spat on before their faces.

At this point and time, the Shinobi World is tainted. It's tainted to the point where the acceptance of it's overshadowing of the true light, the true way of peaceful living, is permitted. The taint in this shinobi world is so thick that you are able to look at your closest brethren and wonder if he is secretly plotting to stab you in the back for a simple jutsu he wishes to learn. The taint is so thick that once you go into war with your fellow villagemate, the chances of you getting backstabbed is higher than the enemy defeating you. The acceptance of this world have been around so long that the newer generations have no choice but to grow up with the mindset of 'eat him before he eat me', even when the person that they're plotting to eat in hopes that they're not eaten is plotting to bring home enough meals for everyone to fill hungry belly. The taint is pure, and utter, tyranny.

Ortho stands in Konohagakure. His location is relatively close to the southern gate, under a tree that grants him enough shade to relax and cool off. His arms are folded across his chest and his eyes are subtly fixated on the generic area. He is dressed in an all-black cloak. The sleeves of his cloak were slack, showing that his arms were not stitched through them. An audible sigh escapes Ortho, his momentary relaxation doing what it was meant to do; put his physical being at rest. His mind, however, was elsewhere. He was recollecting all the information he gathered in recent events, running through them and plotting his next moves to cleanse the world of that unforgiving taint.

Kurt's words involuntarily fell upon deaf ears. Ortho didn't intentionally ignore him, but the deep thought Ortho was in proved to be louder than Kurt's arrival and verbal introduction. For the most part, Ortho remained silent.* - Wed Nov  4 17:19:21 2015

His arms are folded across his chest; the sleeves of his black cloak were slack despite this, showing that his arms were not trailed through them. The only support that kept the cloak on Ortho's body was a single button at the collar that was clamped together. For the most part, his cloak was open for spectators to see his second layer of clothing. Ortho's eyes immediately fixate on Takeda, granting him a subtle nod. "Greetings."* - Wed Nov  4 18:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's ears perked up. "Hokage, huh? Seems you're moving on up in the ranking system, Takeda."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) seemed to get the attention that he desired from Takeda. He wasn't gloating about what he did in Kirigakure, but he wasn't ashamed of it either. Ortho was more or less stating facts and events that recently took place. "Honestly? The village was, and still is, tainted. Until I erase all traces of the previous graduating class of Kirigakure, the village will continue to be attacked by me."* - Wed Nov  4 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head. "Kirie's death is not my doing, but I wish it was. Violet and Elon were the ones to fall victim to my onslaught, but my main focus was on their military rather than main ranking shinobi. Those two happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."* - Wed Nov  4 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a skeptical look. "Looking for you and attacked Ziare, but he won't tell you who it is? Ease your mind off of it; I'll see what I can find out for you." Ortho nods his head, assuring Takeda that he meant what he said. "Zeus.. has been more M.I.A recently, no?"* - Wed Nov  4 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yonbu(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I need a raise. - Wed Nov  4 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes. He was trying not to engage too much in a discussion about the Gezo, but for the time being it was inevitable. "I see the Gezo is more important than the village he vowed to lead."* - Wed Nov  4 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit. "I'm listening."* - Wed Nov  4 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) skepticism was rung like a Chinese gong. His eyes narrowed further. "Come, Takeda. Spit it out, it's just you and I here.."* - Wed Nov  4 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Wed Nov  4 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had a look of annoyance and slight concern plastered on his face. "Oi, take it easy.. Just tell me, get it out quick and it'll be painless."* - Wed Nov  4 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his arms folded across his chest. He remains stationary, but the pain Takeda was obviously going through hit home for Ortho, forcing him to release a sigh of compassion. "Takeda, you need to listen to me. Take a deep breath and take your time.."* - Wed Nov  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. He had half the mind to just forget about what Takeda was attempting to say, but his curiosity only edged him forth. "Say nothing if someone placed a seal on you.."* - Wed Nov  4 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released another audible sigh. "You met E-. Who the hell is E-..? Is it someone from Konohagakure?"* - Wed Nov  4 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a look of confusion. "I see, I see. Is it someone well known?"* - Wed Nov  4 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Well known, E-, and not from Konoha-," his train of thought was interrupted. "Edge?"* - Wed Nov  4 20:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, taking the pain shown from Takeda as the information he seeked. A sigh escaped his lips as he shift his focus to Marrisa. "Hello."* - Wed Nov  4 20:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A simple letter from a random person stating they heard of Katsune's location and detailing her location. - Wed Nov  4 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But, plausible. - Wed Nov  4 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but crack a smile, turning his head slightly. "Of course.. That's why I'm considering every risk."* - Wed Nov  4 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Pft. - Wed Nov  4 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was all for the physical contact up until he pushed herself forward. He was a murderer, yes, but only to the deserving. Ortho's eyes widened at that very moment, "Um-Ume.." The blade piercing through her chest. He was baffled, not knowing how a conversation about a flower turned to suicide..* - Wed Nov  4 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would remain quiet, allowing the situation at hand to sink in. Why was this affecting him so much? What was Ume to him? She was just another female he met randomly that hung around him. Why did he momentarily let his guard down enough for her to baffle him? Ortho's eyes panned down to her chest, assuring himself that the blade did pierce the generic area of her heart. The silence continued.

There was something obviously wrong here. A loss of words was one thing, but a sudden spike in emotion was a whole new level for Ortho. His eyebrows arched in as frown settled on his face. Ume's words were registered and analyzed, but not enough for him to come up with the perfect rebuttal. "You are.. indeed a tree, but you will still be viewed as a flower.. my.. flower."
* - Wed Nov  4 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Please don't tell anyone what I showed you....  - Wed Nov  4 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes fixated on the katana, trailing his eye up the blade's length. His jaw clench and a audible crack of his joint was made. The frown that plastered itself on his visage soon transitioned into that of relief and possible anger. The blood, however, set Ortho back as he finally looked at Ume's frame to examine the wound.* - Wed Nov  4 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No.. need to worry. - Wed Nov  4 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Ume's healing wound shed some much needed light on Ortho. His relief was represented with a audible sigh as he used his opposing hand to scratch the back of head. The hand that gripped the katana went slack by the below, causing the tip of the blade to pierce into the ground and remain stationary. "It bothered me.. in the sense that I thought you were ending your life. This, now.. that I know you can't be killed, makes you more of a.. use..?" The entire statement wasn't a question, but the last word. He was unsure how to perfectly word what he was thinking, but by the sound of his voice it could be told he meant well.* - Wed Nov  4 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "No, I killed deserving people.. deserving."* - Wed Nov  4 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) allowed the question to be thoroughly thought about. To most a massacre, on the scale in which Ortho committed, could be labeled as tyranny. To Ortho, it was nothing more than a very small stepping stone across the creek leading to a land of peace. He gives Ume a solid nod after a moment of silence. Expression was absent in his facial features, as blank as a new sheet of paper. "I preached that Kirigakure was, and still is, tainted. My beliefs are what drove me to that point and it's my belief that's going to restore order in this world. That way there can be more.. flowers.. that bloom without the hardship of destruction.."* - Wed Nov  4 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Then why did you allow me to guide your hand. - Wed Nov  4 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks away, matching Ume's whisper with his own. "A moment of vulnerability that could've been soon regretted.."* - Wed Nov  4 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Vulnerability? - Wed Nov  4 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I.. choose to be absent of emotions and attachments.. - Wed Nov  4 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: For when I allow such things, mistakes occur. - Wed Nov  4 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but I thought you have only hate? - Wed Nov  4 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: To make her experience hardship now, before she sinks too low like me. - Wed Nov  4 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You don't practice what you preach? - Wed Nov  4 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I am a preacher of my beliefs, but I didn't believe until it was too late for me to dig my way out of the hole. - Wed Nov  4 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head slowly. "You.. are not to blame. It was my choice to allow such.. feelings.. to exist."* - Wed Nov  4 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would've pursued the matter, but didn't. He lets it die down until the next conversation between them was made. He nods his head and raised his arms to suggest that Ume go ahead and lead the way back to camp. "Yes. If.. he's still there."* - Wed Nov  4 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Maybe I shouldn't have told him. - Wed Nov  4 23:30:33 2015
