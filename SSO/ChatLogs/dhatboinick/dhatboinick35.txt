<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's grip on his bottle of liquor loosened, causing it to drop to the ground. His eyes narrowed in on Kana, allowing him to watch her movements the best he can. "Violet's life and Lera's life were the only two I sought out for. Elon was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time."* - Thu Nov  5 18:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. Kana's movement didn't go unnoticed. His normally black pupil transitions into a crimson red, a single tomoe swirling around a black dot within the center. Ortho's understanding of his Ninjutsu was superb, and in turn Kana's handseals were quickly recognized; he too had the ability to use Raging Waves. As a result, without having the intent to kill her, he'd sidestep the torrent of water.

Upon doing so, while stringing his own succession of handseals together, he'd take in a considerable amount of air. His chakra kneads within his lungs, and in turn when he expelled it in different series, he'd form air bullets to rampage her frame. Still, he held back a good amount just for there to be concussive damage rather than fatal.* - Thu Nov  5 18:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched as Kana's chakra knead and manifest into two depositions of water. Soon enough, the two sources of were molded and crafted into exact replicas of the original. He took this opportunity to make slanted dash backwards, keeping his visuals on Kana and forming some more distance between them. He doesn't attack, maybe that'll show he wasn't out to harm her.* - Thu Nov  5 19:14:08 2015

The tightest and wettest of pussy can sway the minds of many and, in turn, have the mental standings of the strongest and boldest of many to easily be swayed. Here we are, a verbal standoff between two shinobi that were once allies, but now obviously enemies. All because of what? The attempts of one man attempting to lay with a single female led to the understanding of one thing; this was all about who could dick down who the best --- pitiful.

Here Ortho stood, between two important figures in his life that helped him be molded into the man he was now. Here Ortho stood, between two important figures that may cause him to do something that he will later regret. Here he stood, conflicted between brother and former spouse; it's a matter of who he chooses and if his choice was the right one.

He takes a step forward, allowing his eyes to momentarily close. A number of thoughts ran through his mind, causing his confliction to only increase. By time his eyes were to open, his blackened pupils transitioned into its infamous form of a Sharingan.

"Make your moves, and see to it that you take my life. I'll carry the burden of ending you both if true peace is made. I warned you two already, I am that midpoint and I am that peacemaker."* - Thu Nov  5 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed a hand on Ume's shoulders, using her as a physical representation of what he was about to say.

"We become shinobi with the idea that everything we do is to benefit the ones we love. We become shinobi with the illusion that even though our lives are on the line, we come home every day to eat with out loved ones. Becoming a shinobi was no excuse to commit murder without penalties, but the allowance to commit a necessary evil and be commended for such. It's necessary to kill before being killed. It's necessary to be the hunter before you are the hunted. We stand on the same ground, but we are on completely different planets. Your views can not be seen by me until understanding is met. I have, beside of me, a woman that has no emotions.. yet she is willing to lay her metaphoric life on the line for me, without hesitation. A man with emotions will consider every route out of his own life ending for someone else."

Ortho takes another step forward, allowing his hand to slide off of Ume's shoulder. He looks between Marrisa and Index, his single tomoe'd eyes piercing holes through their frame.

"I stand before you a man that is willing to do everything to obtain understanding. Many aim for peace in hopes that the path they set on leads straight to it, no. I aim for understanding, for with understanding true peace is obtained. It's the ideal domino effect. Now tell, Index.. Marrisa, are you two going to be the domino's to my path.. or be, like me, the force that knocks down the first domino to start the effect..?"* - Thu Nov  5 21:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Your death, and the death of every shinobi who watched Violet die. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: She is too consumed with anger. - Thu Nov  5 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Haha, my death seems to be sought out by many. Nina is my little sister, but I'll spit on Violet's grave before I submit my actions were wrong. Too much biasism was in Kirigakure and I'm ridding that from the village. - Thu Nov  5 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov  5 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood atop Manda's head. His arms are folded across his chest. He simply waits for the inevitable crowd to show up, making sure neither he or Manda made any sudden movements.

Manda: "You've been summoning me more and more lately, Ortho. Who are we killing this time?"

Ortho: "No one of specific. It all depends on how these people react to what I have to say.."* - Thu Nov  5 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Why the fuck. . . - Thu Nov  5 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Do I keep getting drawn into this. - Thu Nov  5 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) fixed his eyes on each arrival; Keiji, Nigen and then Aden. His arms remained folded across his chest as he took a single step, edging toward the edge of Manda's head --- close to the massive snakes' top jaw.

"I am a native of Konohagakure. I was born here and I raised myself within these streets. I have roamed this world, placing myself in the legal system of each major country. I've dined with demons and shot after angels. I've washed the feet of saints and cursed the names of Satan's. All this allow I, Ortho, stand before you a man with ambition and goals. I stand before you a man of understanding and anger.

Anger not for you, nor for the shinobi of this world. A man angry at the system that riddles each village. Today, I request your aid to true peace. Many have preached this and many have attempted this, but unlike them I have a plan. Just as I understand, I wish to place that understanding in the rest of the world. This understanding will result in the progression of our minds and souls, and in which case allows compassion to manifest. Once the kneading of compassion in completed, all that is left is love and peace. Love for one another, peace of longevity.

For too long the Gezo Empire has reigned over us. They have used us as a money making scheme and military force. They place it in our heads that a title granted by them, at the cost of our wellbeing. We are shinobi, we have always been shinobi and will always be shinobi. We should not resort to that damned Empire. This, my fellow shinobi, is where I request your aid to forge a new village out of our home. We can be independent and we can still stand strong!"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Why openly defy something that is capable of killing you within seconds, are you so sure of your strength that you would defy -true- Gods? - Fri Nov  6 00:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"The Gezo are not GODS, but beings that us as shinobi hold high standards for. I am not asking you to walk into battle with me. Nor am I planning to go to war with the Gezo. I am asking you to open your minds and stand as men and women. I am asking you to rid your minds of the ideal ranking system that to be recognized as strong, you must enter some tournament or some exams by the Gezo. We spend our lives fighting to live and living to fight, why must we obtain a mere title from a Empire of people we know little to nothing about?

All we must do is band together, fund our own services, aid blacksmiths and tailors in their efforts, do our own labor work and eventually we 'will' be a village to be reckoned with once more. There is a weird idea that to be a 'legal' village, we must have some high ranking person within the Gezo Empire than run the place. How can we be 'illegal' in our own home? I refuse to be an immigrant to my hometown! Forget the Gezo Registered Village.. This can be a SHINOBI Registered Village!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet, allowing his reflexes to kick in. Upon the withdraw of her blade, he'd grab her wrist and raised it in the air. "It's funny, Nina. You're quick to do things like this against me, but if I was anyone else you would've tolerated it. Like I said, everyone is innocent except Ortho."* - Fri Nov  6 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes fixed on Nina and tightened the grip on her wrist a little bit.

"I know I'm not innocent. I've never said I was innocent and I never will say I'm innocent. All because people show their affection for you more than I do don't mean I don't care about you. You're so fucking open minded to other people, but when I tell you all I've done in your name because I thought it was best for you, you ignore it. But when someone sends you a damn messenger bird, they're a saint? Man, fuck that. I've done nothing but love you because you're my little sister. That don't matter now does it? I didn't send you messenger birds, I wasn't there to feed you apple juice, I wasn't there by your physical side every minute of the day. I'm the bad guy.."* - Fri Nov  6 03:40:09 2015

Here he stood, a man that has done everything for her, and she acknowledges it as some attempt for him to play innocent. She, of all people, should know that Ortho doesn't give a damn about being innocent. If anyone was to call him innocent, he'd just rebel and do something chaotic then place the blame on himself.

"You don't get it. I know you're a trained Shinobi, I'm not taking that away from you. What I'm- Actually.. Whatever, Nina." Ortho shook his head in a faster pace this time, showing his disdain for the topic at hand. "Do as you please. Ortho is the enemy, Ortho is the bad guy. We got that much clear." With that, he'd take a few steps back. "Go where you please, say what you please, do what you please."* - Fri Nov  6 03:52:57 2015
