<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Tue Nov 10 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks into the shop. He wore his usual battle attire that consisted of arm guards, black one-sleeved jumpsuit, black baggy pants, arm wraps and head bandages. His usual black pupils were now a crimson red with a black circle within the middle. Around the black circle was a single tomoe. Ortho looks from left to right, examining everyone's chakra; he quickly recognizes someone but doesn't say anything. For the moment, he simply observed.* - Tue Nov 10 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: A strange texture to that man's eyes. - Tue Nov 10 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Well, I dare not say texture.... - Tue Nov 10 02:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Momura must've mentioned me. - Tue Nov 10 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || A simple whisper in the wind is that's needed to spark something off. The tension that emitted from Ortho could be sliced gracefully with the edge of mere eyesight. The eerie feeling of not knowing what's going to happen next is what Ortho thrived on, the feeling of unknowing.

Ortho inched further into the shop, setting his destination for the counter leading to the store owner. There, while keeping the three in his peripherals, he begins casting his order. "Finest tea you have and some side sandwiches for it."* - Tue Nov 10 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: ...Momura. - Tue Nov 10 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: It's.... the menu of this restaurant. - Tue Nov 10 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) eyes the scroll, saying nothing. He looks from the chef to Hanai then to Hanai's hoe. He nodded his head, "gratitude." Upon accepting the scroll, with caution, Ortho looks through its content.* - Tue Nov 10 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Oh right... - Tue Nov 10 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Momura... - Tue Nov 10 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'll be updating the menu with some new things soon. - Tue Nov 10 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I mean. - Tue Nov 10 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And the service was great./ - Tue Nov 10 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to read through the menu.

Each price seemed reasonable to what he can afford, but he had the mind of a man trapped in the cage of poverty. A slow shake of his head was given as he ravels the menu up and offers it back Hanai and Momura. "Do I place my order to you or does the chef handle the rest?"* - Tue Nov 10 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I'd be the chef. - Tue Nov 10 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Momura here is the waitress. - Tue Nov 10 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Take...a seat. - Tue Nov 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Forgive me. You do not appear to have the traditional chef attire. - Tue Nov 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Apologies. - Tue Nov 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: It's fine. - Tue Nov 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: What would you like to order? - Tue Nov 10 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: We have a special as well, if you'd like to order it. . . . - Tue Nov 10 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turns on the ball of his heels, taking a seat at the closest table.

"I'd like three cups of water and your finest bowl of Miso Soup."* - Tue Nov 10 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: An odd order. - Tue Nov 10 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Maybe he's trying to refill. - Tue Nov 10 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) waited patiently in his seat. His fingers rhythmically tap against the wooden table, his other hand resting underneath his chin. By time Momura showed up with the glasses of water, he'd waste no time in taking the first glass and gulping down its content. He places the empty glass in the middle of the table, nodding his head. "Fine water from a fine establishment."

Ortho examines the bowl of soup, taking his chop sticks, breaking them in half and gripping them. From this point, he'd begin eating. After the first taste he nods his head in approval. "Your soup does not falter in your fine customer services."* - Tue Nov 10 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Thank you for your kind words. - Tue Nov 10 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: We are still working on expanding our menu. - Tue Nov 10 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. How much would it cost for you take double your stock? - Tue Nov 10 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: D-Double our s-stock? - Tue Nov 10 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. Your food supply, how much would it cost for you to double it? - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Cost...? - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Maybe two-hundred thousand at the most.... - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: Our current one. - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see. - Tue Nov 10 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans to the side and digs into his backpouch. After a few seconds, he'd take out several stacks of paper yen, placing it on the table before him.

"That is roughly one point three million. I wish your business the best."* - Tue Nov 10 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Thank you. - Tue Nov 10 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: T-Thank you... - Tue Nov 10 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The pleasure is mine. I.. request something more of you. - Tue Nov 10 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The.. both.. of you. - Tue Nov 10 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to casually consume his soup.* - Tue Nov 10 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mmmm? - Tue Nov 10 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: What is it? - Tue Nov 10 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yeas..? - Tue Nov 10 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9sorry - Tue Nov 10 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The person that was just here, what is his name? - Tue Nov 10 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-He said yuta. - Tue Nov 10 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see,. And you know him personally? - Tue Nov 10 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: N-Not really. - Tue Nov 10 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-He just kinda...h-hit on me then pushed me to the ground a-after telling me h-he wants me to t-touch him.. - Tue Nov 10 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"I'm sorry to hear that."* - Tue Nov 10 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . .. - Tue Nov 10 03:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Thank you for your fine services. - Tue Nov 10 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stands to his feet. He takes the bowl in his hands and brings it to his face. After drinking down the broth, he place the bowl down and go to drink off the glasses of water. From that point, he places the glass down and starts to walk out.* - Tue Nov 10 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: E-Enjoy the rest of your day. - Tue Nov 10 03:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) yawns, walking off to the side.* - Tue Nov 10 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. His arms slowly raise to hesitantly wrap around Marrisa.

"Uhh, hey there.."
* - Tue Nov 10 03:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was caught off guard, his eyes widening. For that brief moment, his one tomoe'd sharingan was in full view. Before, his half closed eyes, that showed his laid back demeanor,  would block off the tomoe.

"S-Sure.. I'll watch."* - Tue Nov 10 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, Might ask that lady after her spar. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She seems to know a thing or two. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm. That does seem like a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll let you have her though, no point slumping two of us onto her. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Judging by that hip movement. I'm guessing this is the village bike. - Tue Nov 10 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Atta boy, Ziare.. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inches closer to the battle field.* - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I knew you showed potential. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Way to go Z! - Tue Nov 10 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) narrows his visuals on Marrisa and Ziare. To him, at this moment, their chakra signatures were vibrantly exposed to him, his ocular prowess proving to help him with such feat. Ortho took interest in Ziare the most. For a new graduate of the Academy, Ziare had quite a reservoir on him.

Ortho folds his arms across his chest, watching the spar intently. "Is it bad that I'm rooting for the kid," Ortho asks himself with a smirk. "He definitely can prove useful."* - Tue Nov 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not holding back. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And why would I want to be trained? - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think this is quite done. It's been a while since I've went a round with you, Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I must've fallen behind in my training, but I'm sure I can entertain you well. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you say? - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Love? Are they close or together? - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hm... - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks. He takes a few steps forward, stopping in Ziare's previous location. He hears Marrisa's words, but they weren't granted a verbal response. All he did was unfold his arms from across his chest, waiting for her to commence.* - Tue Nov 10 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Don't think I've been noticed yet, ooOoo I'm invisible.~ - Tue Nov 10 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure whats on your mind hun? - Tue Nov 10 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well uh...I was just wondering if you wanted to go to that tea shop any time soon..? - Tue Nov 10 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm, thats cool... I wonder what she is doing? And are there traces of chakra in her eyes? And why am I asking so many questions ? I really dont care.... - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "I thought you said we weren't holding back, Marrisa."

Ortho reacted. Haste fueled each move Ortho made. As a result, with Marrisa rapidly closing the distance, Ortho weaves together a quick succession of handseals. In the meantime, the males' chakra steadily kneads within his stomach before sparking itself. By time Marrisa came in close, Ortho puckered his lips and expelled a massive ball of fire; his intention was to use her own manifestation of wind against her.* - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Hmm.. So he knows fire style? - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: I'm guessing I better speak to him soonish.. - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was not done; not by a long shot. Marrisa's alteration in her dash forward could've made this a dire situation for her opponent.. under normal circumstances. This, however, was not that.

Ortho watched Marrisa's movements, narrowing his eyes a bit to place focus on her and allow him mind to quickly run through a series of counters. In a split second, he'd turn his head slightly toward Marrisa and launch the fireball.

Anyone that knew Ortho and have fought against him, or alongside him, knew he was the ideal combination specialist. It's for that very same reason why, with the fireball raging forth, Ortho crouches down and centers his chakra. He didn't expect that fireball to put Marrisa out for the count, he wanted some fun after all.
* - Tue Nov 10 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Perfect.

Just as Marrisa came in for the kill, Ortho backflips. With this backflip, his chakra surges to the soles of his feet and sparked. As a result, with his body flipping, a trail of fire is left behind. This fire, in turn, would be used to ignite the wind emitting from Marrisa; rendering her incapable if landed.* - Tue Nov 10 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Did I just get blown off because of where I'm from? - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm waiting for a friend at the moment. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Owari. Would you like a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Seemed as though Marrisa was finally taking Ortho serious. Good, Ortho wasn't a push over anymore.

With Marrisa coming in fast Ortho had to come up with a jutsu that can be formed instantly. A light bulb flickered on in a split second as handseals were formed. Afterwards, he'd crouch once more and slam his palms atop the ground, causing a mud wall to form in between him and Marrisa. This mud wall, in turn, would be used to negate her kick.

Whether or not she pursued further, Ortho continued his onslaught. Another string of handseals are woven together and another slam of his hands on the ground was signaled. This time around, while timing things perfectly, Ortho would attempt to form a compact dome around Marrisa, blocking her from the outside world.* - Tue Nov 10 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) felt a little bit disrespected. Marrisa insisted on going through with this damn Wind Armor, as if undermining Ortho's ability to counter. A slow shake of his head managed to disperse the lighten mood of a smirk that resided on his face.

Just as Marrisa started to surge forward, Ortho retaliates. Like a string in grandma's special quilt, a set of handseals are binded together. This time around, Ortho wasn't holding back. He launches a fireball toward Marrisa. Ortho wasn't done there; the same exact handseals were formed again. Once more, to magnify the first fireball, he launches the second.* - Tue Nov 10 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Of course. More and more Wind Armor. Ortho slowly shook his head, backflipping once more. This time around, with the quick maneuver and Marrisa now being exactly point blank, Ortho expelled as much chakra as he could. This time around, as the trail of fire was created, it'd back him to not only engulf Marrisa but force him back a few feet.* - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck.. - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Can't make the kid get hurt... - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Why the fuck he decide to stand behind me..? - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirked. Marrisa deactivated the Wind Armor and his opportunity arrived. She continued to charge forward, but not without a price. Not only was she burned to a minor degree, but she now had two white snakes charging toward her. Yes, two thick muscled white snakes that extracted themselves from Ortho's sleeves.

The first snake went to wrap around Marrisa's body, binding her completely. The second snake, while the first snake did his thing, bit into Marrisa's legs; two quick bites and implement of paralysis venom. Ortho knew of Marrisa's Fire Shroud, so he made sure his snakes acted with haste.* - Tue Nov 10 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Excuse me. Miss with the read hair. Fancy a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I think he's talking to you Rias. - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm me? Ugh, I dont think thats a good idea... - Tue Nov 10 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Why not? - Tue Nov 10 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She isn't good at sparring. - Tue Nov 10 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Becasue we are opposing fighting types - Tue Nov 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Neither am I. I don't think. - Tue Nov 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We? - Tue Nov 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't fight...I don't know about you. - Tue Nov 10 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: We can spar... just as long as you promise me you will stop before you hit - Tue Nov 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm? So you.. don't want to get hurt? - Tue Nov 10 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Basically. - Tue Nov 10 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes - Tue Nov 10 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There goes the attempted Wind Armor. By all means, it activated, but the snakes were just two steps faster than the armor. Once again, Ortho slowly shook his head. Hassan was indeed a genius for coming up with that armor, but the spammability of it when it comes to the people he taught was bothersome. Nevertheless, Marrisa put it to good use and if Hassan was around he should be proud.

By time the armor was to activate, Marrisa was already bit and released. She'd feel numbness in her thighs and the inability to walk on her own. Ortho, with his snakes retreating back into his sleeves simply folding his arms across, steps forward.

"You never cease to amaze me, Marrisa. You've learned a lot since the last time we went at it." Ortho paces toward Marrisa, offering her his hand. If accepted, he'd pull Marrisa up and wrap her arm around his shoulder. "Also, you know what I said about that relationship thing.. Our paths are not to cross while I'm making these movements.. Your feelings are your feelings, I understand that, but relationship status will get you killed," he says in a hushed tone, not wanting anyone but her to hear* - Tue Nov 10 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Sounds boring. - Tue Nov 10 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well an angel like myself should never succumb to such attacks - Tue Nov 10 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Modest too. - Tue Nov 10 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: That and the fact that I wouls snap like a twig - Tue Nov 10 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: As I said I dont really spar - Tue Nov 10 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Rias, you don't need to spar. - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But Z might be able to help... or Ortho or Marrisa - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm.. I might go Sunagakure. I'm bored here already. - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Good luck getting in there - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Why would I need luck? - Tue Nov 10 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I dont know, but leaving any village is dangerous - Tue Nov 10 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I wouldn't even know the way.. Now  I think about it. - Tue Nov 10 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well now you go another problem  - Tue Nov 10 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm.. - Tue Nov 10 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hrm? - Tue Nov 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do I have something on my face? - Tue Nov 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: No - Tue Nov 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He keeps Marrisa up with the aid of his own body. He knew the sorrow that she felt and he hoped that she could just understand where he stood on this entire matter. He honestly felt the way he's going about things was the best and that in the end everything will turn out for the best. Ortho slowly shakes his head, carrying Marrisa over to the fence. There, he'd gently place her down.

"Someday.. you'll see it from my point of view, Marris," he says with a hushed tone. "Some..day." With that, he trails off to the side.* - Tue Nov 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why are you looking at me so closely? - Tue Nov 10 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Becasue I can~ - Tue Nov 10 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I hope Marrisa is ok... - Tue Nov 10 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll check over her. - Tue Nov 10 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes fell upon Owari. He walks over to her, not knowing how he managed to overlook her presence.* - Tue Nov 10 08:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: A subtle rejection of her 'my love' thing. - Tue Nov 10 08:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Yes, there is nothing to be sure about. I have asked Index about this one female one male before since you would say he had female's he wanted while being with Katsune. - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm not Index.. - Tue Nov 10 08:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You keep the spool hidden in your sleeve or on your belt, or where ever. Then you gather up chakra and form your handsigns, flowing it into the hidden wire. With that don, you use your chakra to direct where you want the wire to go. It can be amazingly helpful in combat, or in a suprise attack.  - Tue Nov 10 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Index has no morals. If he truly believed that, then he wouldn't play those little games. He did the same shit with Nina when they first met. - Tue Nov 10 08:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Truth, he asks her personal stuff about her body and underwear. - Tue Nov 10 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Dare, he has her do something to him, or have her 'let' him do something to him. - Tue Nov 10 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I can believe we could never take him in real fight - Tue Nov 10 08:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I think I should go talk to the tree's.... - Tue Nov 10 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) narrowed his eyes, taking a glance at Owari.* - Tue Nov 10 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ...Alright then.. - Tue Nov 10 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) roughly rubs his right hand over his face. He slowly shakes his head, not knowing what to say or do at the moment. He releases an audible sigh, watching Owari pace off. After a few seconds after she left the training field, he'd also leave; time for some sake?* - Tue Nov 10 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shows up.* - Tue Nov 10 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) knew Owari was able to sense him so he remained quiet. He walks further into the garden, making his way to the pond. There, he'd begin disrobing. His movements were lackadaisical, taking him more time to do anything. While starting with his arm guards, he'd drop them to the ground then move on to slowly unwrap the bandages from his arms. * - Tue Nov 10 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes fixed on the pond. "Yeah, I did go but changed my mind. I remember promising you that I'll ease up on the liquor." His voice was plain; not emotionless, but just straight forward. He continues to unwrap the bandages, revealing more and more of his bare skin from the shoulders down. Ortho's crimson eyes would dim back to blackness as the tomoe dispersed, his ocular prowess deactivating.* - Tue Nov 10 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Sadly I can't communicate with trees. It seems cool and all, but not exactly my forte."

By this point Ortho managed to take the bandages completely off. In the process, he rolled them up so they could neatly reside next to his arm guards. He grabs the tail of his shirt and pulls it over his head. He folds it up the best he could and placed it next to the other stuff. Soon enough, the pants came off and was folded and placed as well.* - Tue Nov 10 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Sure, sure. You know you're always welcomed, Owari."* - Tue Nov 10 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) followed her in, taking his place against the bank. He leans back a bit to get comfortable and released a sigh.* - Tue Nov 10 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: You look upset. - Tue Nov 10 09:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, I'm not. - Tue Nov 10 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I assumed because of your sigh when I left the training area, and the urge to get alcohol. - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Annoyed, yes. Mad, no. Surprisingly enough, I'm fine now. - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Annoyed, why? - Tue Nov 10 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because I told Nina to watch out for Index back then. She didn't listen. You're the only one that actually listened. - Tue Nov 10 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Tue Nov 10 09:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow out of skepticism. He watched her get silent and close her eyes, but he didn't say anything on the matter.* - Tue Nov 10 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's one thing I have to coach Nina through.. - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Apparently she though that's what 'friends do'. - Tue Nov 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I asked her where she got that from and said Index told her that there was nothing wrong with what they were doing cause they're just friends. - Tue Nov 10 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed and his brows furrowed in. "Excuse me?"* - Tue Nov 10 09:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I thought Nina was just exa- - Tue Nov 10 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: But....from what you said, he didn't play it that way with me. - Tue Nov 10 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Tue Nov 10 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained quiet. He leans his head back, closes his eyes and just.. sat there.* - Tue Nov 10 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I ... didn't tell you when you told me what the game was because... I don't want you to kill him. - Tue Nov 10 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, keeping it leaned back and his eyes shut. "Okay. I understand."* - Tue Nov 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... are you going to kill him? - Tue Nov 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not going to hunt him down. That's your friend, I'll leave him be. - Tue Nov 10 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: He was using it.... because he wanted to get to know me as a friend. He didn't think I would actually want to talk to him like a friend does. In fact he stopped the game because something was going to happen that I didn't know was pre-fertilization and he wouldn't let it happen. - Tue Nov 10 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So instead of talking like I did, he played a game..? - Tue Nov 10 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Makes so much sense. - Tue Nov 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like I said. I'm not hunting your friend down. - Tue Nov 10 09:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Tue Nov 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Ortho... you two... were starting to make progress you stood in the same courtyard and were talking with me at the same time.... - Tue Nov 10 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, you're right. - Tue Nov 10 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I have better understanding now of what things are meant just for you and no one else. - Tue Nov 10 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained quiet.* - Tue Nov 10 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turned his head slightly, glancing at Owari.* - Tue Nov 10 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: If you want to take your anger out.... or punish someone it should be me. - Tue Nov 10 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have no need to punish anyone. - Tue Nov 10 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) purposely avoided the anger aspect.* - Tue Nov 10 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: You are lying though. - Tue Nov 10 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I seriously have no need punish anyone. - Tue Nov 10 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It already happened, Owari. - Tue Nov 10 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Can't do shit about it. - Tue Nov 10 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turned his head back, closing his eyes again* - Tue Nov 10 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "If you played the game, then something happened. Maybe not what you and I have done, but something is still.. something."* - Tue Nov 10 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ...  - Tue Nov 10 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: It was mostly silly things like poking a stomach or something like that. - Tue Nov 10 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh. Okay then, - Tue Nov 10 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: He stopped the game when it got to me rubbing his behind, he said that we shouldn't do it. Then I got the hint that there was something involved that was meant only for me and you and then he explained everything and why he had wanted to play the game.  - Tue Nov 10 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained quiet for the most part, keeping his eyes shut. "I understand, flower. I understand."* - Tue Nov 10 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm .... worried you don't.... It's hard for me to tell when you close everything off like this. - Tue Nov 10 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Either you are calm or supressing what you feel. - Tue Nov 10 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm calm. - Tue Nov 10 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Trust me. I can't be mad at you for not knowing. - Tue Nov 10 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Tue Nov 10 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhmmm. - Tue Nov 10 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you think I will have to stay gone a long time for when I go to the scientists? - Tue Nov 10 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's a good question.. not sure. - Tue Nov 10 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I imagine so. - Tue Nov 10 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Will you be able to visit me? - Tue Nov 10 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You know I'll try. But like Index said it's in his little hide out. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: He won't let you in? - Tue Nov 10 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doubt he will. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ....why'd you roll your eyes? - Tue Nov 10 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I saw that coming, but didn't think it'd happen to soon. - Tue Nov 10 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What was the end result of your conversation? She's not training you anymore? - Tue Nov 10 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: She doesn't know who I am. - Tue Nov 10 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm ....good at that. - Tue Nov 10 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Though she found similiarities. - Tue Nov 10 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: She told me I reminded her of a friend from the past who died and named me. - Tue Nov 10 18:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Home. - Tue Nov 10 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Ah. - Tue Nov 10 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Something wrong? - Tue Nov 10 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: No, I guess not. - Tue Nov 10 19:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood there all quiet, letting Nina and Owari talk.* - Tue Nov 10 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: So...... - Tue Nov 10 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm....hello? - Tue Nov 10 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ...You already said that silly. - Tue Nov 10 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm not the best with conversations anymore. - Tue Nov 10 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Why's that? - Tue Nov 10 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: It just happened... - Tue Nov 10 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ....right. - Tue Nov 10 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So clearly up and down attitude. - Tue Nov 10 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: So, how have you two been? - Tue Nov 10 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Good good. - Tue Nov 10 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Only good? Sounds boring. - Tue Nov 10 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) extracts his palms from his pockets. In his grasps was a lighter and one rolled up herbal treatment. He places one end of the treatment in between his lips while bringing the lighter to the opposing end. There, he'd use his thumb to reel back the switch used to ignite the gas. It took only three tries before the necessary flames were created and he managed to ignite the end of the treatment. His eyes glaze over a bit as he takes in a steady amount of air through his slightly closed lips; let the high begin. Ortho places the lighter back in his pocket and simply focused on his blunt.* - Tue Nov 10 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .................... - Tue Nov 10 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: So now you switched to smoking rather than drinking? - Tue Nov 10 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Easy, Owari. - Tue Nov 10 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I've always been a smoker, always. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And a drinker.. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Bad habit of his, actually. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This.. just doesn't slowly kill me. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm going to start spanking him like mom used to. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Relax. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ...guess I never noticed you smoking. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Because you never have in front of me, or smelled like it. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: My supply for it had only recently showed back up. - Tue Nov 10 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Paid for a massive stock. - Tue Nov 10 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I think I should go to kirigakure, see what's up with those swords. - Tue Nov 10 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: And bully the Mizukage a little more, whoever he is. - Tue Nov 10 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's always fun. - Tue Nov 10 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Tue Nov 10 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Okay then. - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: What swords? - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "You're going end up getting denied the swords. You need patience."* - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: She asked me to use my connections to get her a unique sword, but refuses to wait. - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Patience is boring. - Tue Nov 10 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lack of patience is going to get you killed. - Tue Nov 10 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: And how long will I have to wait, exactly? - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Until the swords arrive. - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's too much waiting - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then consider your ability to get the sword nulled. - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs.* - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Up to you, kiddo. - Tue Nov 10 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: You sure as hell didn't have to wait for those smokes. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I guess patience is only needed when it's for other people, hmm? - Tue Nov 10 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I didn't go looking for them after they said "your supply will come soon". - Tue Nov 10 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I waited. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Three weeks. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Three. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You only waited one week. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Suuuuuuure you did. Now come down here and get noogie'd to death. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Your biased attitude is getting old, sis'. - Tue Nov 10 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's posture remained still, her light weight doing nothing to him. Just like an older brother would, he lets his baby sister have her fun. Meanwhile, he takes another hit off of his blunt and allowed the excess smoke to seep out his nostrils. A few seconds passed and he could literally feel his hair starting to mess up and his bandages starting to loosen. He places the blunt at the right corner of his lips before reach behind his back and taking hold of Nina. There, he'd start unleashing the savaged Tickle Monster on her.* - Tue Nov 10 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Welp. - Tue Nov 10 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked down at their interlocked pinkies, trying his best to fight back a smile. Slowly, however, one crept up and made its presence felt. His eyes trail to Nina's and he slowly nodded. "You've really grown up, Nina.. But you're still my little sister.. My baby sister, remember that."* - Tue Nov 10 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hmph. a baby sister who can beat you up!~ - Tue Nov 10 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, alright.~ - Tue Nov 10 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You right.~ I give you that one. - Tue Nov 10 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: I think we should get Owari next, eh? Eh? - Tue Nov 10 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: You two done? - Tue Nov 10 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You're not going to believe this, but she's not tickelish.. - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: At al.. - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (all*) - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Oh yeah? I'll get her to get tickled! - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Alright! Go, go! - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks up, giving Owari a innocent smile.. even when there is a blunt in the corner of his mouth.* - Tue Nov 10 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Get her Nina! - Tue Nov 10 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: What the hell, Ortho! - Tue Nov 10 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) points to Owari. A massive smile of actual.. happiness and fun was plastered on his face.* - Tue Nov 10 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirked. He took this opportunity to dash forward himself. He hovers over Nina and Owari alike and reached down. In that instance, he unleashes the tickle monster on his little sister once more, forcing her to relinquish the noogie she placed on Owari. "Ha! Got you!"* - Tue Nov 10 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ........................ - Tue Nov 10 20:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He was departed from his blunt and it's at that moment he succumb to defeat. "Wait, wait. Think about this, Nina! Don't doooo it!" He inches forward slowly, his arms rising in submission. "Hands up, don't smoke!"* - Tue Nov 10 20:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) died. He falls back first against the ground, turning his head toward the male and Owari. "Uhh, alright then.."

Ortho takes a look at his sister, dying again. His blunt did not deserve that.* - Tue Nov 10 20:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) steps off, not asking any questions. "Lead the way."* - Tue Nov 10 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Alright then, what is it?"* - Tue Nov 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) listened to what Owari had to say about her conversation with Marrisa. It wasn't up until the claim that he told Marrisa that he loved her back when he got ready to rebuttal, but he didn't; he just let Owari continue talking. By time the estimation of how long it'd take for her to possibly gain emotions, Ortho swallowed. His own wants, contrasted to needs, was swallowed like a massive pill with no water to push it down with. He gives Owari a smile, trying his best to make his facial expression back up what he was about to say.

"You just said 'this is what I want'. What you want is all that matters. Two years, four years; twenty years, forty years.. it doesn't matter the amount of time. You go ahead and do what you have to do. If anything I'll send a shadow clone. He can block out my line of sight and lead me to your exact spot. That way when the clone disperses, I'll have knowledge what you and the clone talked about."* - Tue Nov 10 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Marrisa and I have history, that's no hidden fact. I'm not going to sit here and say that the time span of this isn't a downer, but I'm not going to say that I'll just switch to Marrisa from you; one man, one woman, Owari. I can even consider this an.. obstacle.. in this.. uhh.. relationship..? Look, focus on your procedures and the task at hand. Don't worry about my life, I was already planning to put my movements on a hold while you're stuck at Index's hidden base. Two years, four years; twenty years, forty years; it doesn't matter to me how long it takes, as long as it gets done."

Ortho's attempt to keep a mellow and happy expression continued. There was a few hints of sadness, but honestly there was a genuine attempt to cast aside his own feelings to assure Owari that what she should be doing is assuring her own wants and needs.* - Tue Nov 10 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks. He takes Owari by the waist, leaning in to plant a kiss on her. "I wouldn't mind doing certain things right now, but the maybe it's best to wait and see if your new emotions will make you feel what I feel while we're doing it."* - Tue Nov 10 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shakes his head. He leans in again, but not to kiss her. He inched his face to her ears.

"Never goodbye, just a simple see you.. later," he says in a hushed voice.* - Tue Nov 10 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) returned the smile and hug, nodding his head once. "Good luck, Owari. "* - Tue Nov 10 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood still, watching her leave. He didn't say anything, not wanting to make this situation any bit harder.* - Tue Nov 10 22:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) strolls up. His hands are tucked away within his pockets and a blunt is located in the left corner of his mouth. It stiffens a bit and the exposed end illuminates a bit. Excess smoke seep from his nostrils. He didn't know what was going on, but he just stayed in the background and spectated.* - Tue Nov 10 22:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 10 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was indeed a medical ninja. He made sure to dab in the arts of medical ninjutsu for times just like this. He didn't know what happened.to the female and it didn't really matter. The worse pain was in the back of her head, so Ortho focused on that point first. He opens his left palm, allowing his control over his chakra to aid him. From this point, he'd gently place his palm over Kiyoko's head, letting the chakra do its thing. Meanwhile, with his right hand, he'd summon a secondary source of chakra and hover it over Kiyoko's body. Before he used the syringe, he had to stabilize the female first, make sure once he used needle it didn't have any unwanted side effects.

After a few moments, once he was confident in her condition, he'd unseal a medical kit. He takes out the syringe, open its back and pours some numbing liquid into it. After capping it back, gripping it for better usage and squirting a little of the liquid out to make sure it worked properly, he gently leans Kiyoko's head and inject the liquid into her. At this point, with his left hand once more, he'd apply the healing chakra. With the numbing process commencing, the healing afterwards was meant to speed up the rejuvenation process enough for the numbing to take full effect with the body knowing what to do once the feeling wore off.

Ortho waits a few second, gently applying pressures and massaging that generic area so that the liquid didn't settle in one spot. He digs into the medical kit once more and takes out white bandages; similar to the one wrapped around his head. He shifts his position a bit, allowing his own left leg to be used as a pillow and leverage for Kiyoko's neck. Whilst doing so, he'd start the process of wrapping her head with the bandages. He made sure to wrap it like her head a diaper; that part was to give him and everyone else something to laugh at.

Once the wrapping was done, Ortho leans over a bit, taking a good look at her body and head. He wanted to see if there were any external injuries. All form of gashes would then be stitched up and have his medical chakra applied. Those stitches would then be patched with cotton bandages, a lesser and smaller form of the bandages around Kiyoko's head.

"Where else is hurting," he asks in a low tone.* - Tue Nov 10 23:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, hearing her words. She was clearly a more knowledgeable medic than he was; he hasn't put his practice to use in a while. He alters his positioning again, hooking his right arm behind her knees and placing his left arm behind her back. Ortho lifts her up, like a groom carrying his wife, and carries her off. The requirements to patch the remaining injuries shouldn't be done in public; especially with the amount of sand flying around.* - Tue Nov 10 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, slowly releasing it into a sigh. He carries the female over to the toilet, closing the lid and sitting her down. From there, he'd swiftly take out a kunai and grabbing the collar of her clothing, cutting through the fabric with ease. Eventually, the female was down to just her bra, if she was wearing any. It didn't matter to him if she did or not, he knew how to separate lust and attraction from emotionless and business. That being said, he'd start the process of extracting her from her lower body clothing. At this point, once he was done, he'd place the kunai on the sink and walk out the bathroom.

When he came back, Ortho had a chair in his grasp, obviously from the bedroom. He places the chair in the bath, since the water would be from a shower head and he doubt she'd be able to stand during the entire process. Ortho walks back over to Kiyoko, lifting her once more and carrying her to the chair. He places her practically naked body down. Ortho had on an outer layer of clothing; a sleeveless jacket to be exact. He takes it off and offers it to Kiyoko. "Go ahead and wrap yourself with that, I don't want you to feel uncomfortable or think this is a free access for me to visually grope you." Ortho's voice was a bit stern and lacking any emotional tone.

Ortho knew he was going to get wet from the shower; hhe strips off his own upper body clothing and hangs it over the door leading to the bath. He'd then walk to the gauge for the shower and turn it to the proper settings; he makes sure to bend the shower head so the instant cold water did not rampage over Kiyoko's body. Once the water was comfortable enough, he'd begin the process. He starts with examining her lower body, lifting her leg up, while crouching, and checking for any bruising or displaced bones that may be poking out. He rubs her leg as well, starting with the upper-outer thigh and right down. "Don't feel any bones out of place," he said to himself.

He moves on to the right leg, maneuvering around her so he could crouch and repeat the process. This leg, however, had a bruise on the outside of her thigh, right before her knee. He places a mental note of that and moved on to her upper body. First, however, he checked to see if she accepted the jacket or not.* - Wed Nov 11 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's treatment moved up to Kiyoko's abdominal region. He raises his right hand and begin pressing down, checking for any form of soft spots. The only damaging he could find was just a few bruises; he didn't need to feel around for that. Suddenly, as he began to move around her body again, he notices a trail of blood leading to the drain. His eyes widen and he follows the trail; it led him to Kiyoko's lower right back. "Ortho. I'm Konohagakure born.  I've lived here for a few weeks, but decided to pick back up on my traveling."

Ortho stands up straight and takes hold of the chair. He turns it around so Kiyoko's back was facing the downpour of water. The water would rush down her back and over her gash. In turn, he'd use two fingers to carefully widen the wound, wanting more water to focus on It. To aid in the clenching, Ortho would cup his right palm and allow water to fill it. Then, he'd bring his closed fingers to the wound and angle his arm so the water that was gathered poured directly into the wound; this was proven effective. At that very moment, Ortho would turn the chair just slightly so the main downpour of water didn't go over that specific wound. This gave him the opportunity to unseal another medical kit and stitch the wound up.

The stitching wasn't a fast process. If anything, it's what he hated the most about medical practices. To kill time, he continues the conversation. "Who are you and how do you know.. Lera?"* - Wed Nov 11 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The stitching went well. The wound was neatly closed and cleansed; a job well done. Ortho moves on to the remaining scraps and scratches, washing them the same way he did the first wound. He cups his hands, gathers water and used his hand has a gravy boat, pouring the water directly on to the cuts. These were minor injuries, so full concentration on them wasn't needed, but he did handle them with care.

Ortho moved on to the next gash, sighing a bit when he saw the amount of sand that was in there. He knew, from the way the wound looked in her mid-back, that she would have to lean forward a bit. "Lean forward," he says in a demanding, but still slightly sincere, tone. As she complied, he'd aid her in easing into it, not wanting no other wounds to tear open more than they already have. Ortho tugs and pushes the chair so that the force of the water was right on the wound. Sadly, the clunk of sand was so thick that the pressure of the water wasn't enough. For this fact, Ortho digs into the kit of utensils and takes out a small scoop-like item. With his left hand, he wasn't a lefty so he made sure to operate the item with his right, to gently open the wound a bit more. With the scoop end of the item, he'd begin extracting the main clunks of sand while using the water to beat away at the loose grains.

"Seeing her, huh? I'm sure she makes you happy." Ortho's tone was surprisingly leveled and calm for someone who was taking care of the spouse of someone he wanted dead. He keeps visual focus on the wound, extracting the last bit of the chunked sand. From there, he'd place the utensil down in the kit and recup his hands to wash out the wound completely.

Now that the sand was out, and the obvious fidgeting and jerks from Kiyoko's body, Ortho would wait a few second to ease Kiyoko up again so he didn't stitch the stretched out skin as he leaned forward. Once upright, Kiyoko would be altered once more so the water from the shower head fell down to the front of her body; that's where the remaining gashes were. With the water running down her body, he'd be given a head start with the cleansing process. At this point, he begins stitching her last back wound up.
