<br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||Eri's path would come to a halt. As soon as it did the snake of all snakes made his presence felt. His size was enormous, but not compared to Manda. His skin was extremely pale and wrinkly; as if he shed it then climbed right back in. Just the sight of him alone would intimidate the average shinobi, but he instantly knew Eri was a special case. If anything, he might just have to eat her for just her will alone; those with high wills taste the best.

"Eri.. Supaiku. Come here for favors? What do you have to offffeer me?"* - Sat Nov 14 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || A loud, obnoxious, laugh is sounded from the Sage. Eri's words would've gotten her killed before she even knew what hit her, but she quickly saved herself.

"Wise words, girl.. Wise words. We are snakes and we make movements that are calculated and benefit ourselves. We work together, yes.. but there is no 'together' without 'I'. Long story short, you proved to be able to think on the spot; despite all that fancy talk. We want you to be real and blunt here, not some show case. A simple 'I'll do what I can the best I can' was all that was needed. In other words, you have my blessing."

Upon Eri's return Ortho smirked. "Impressive," he says in a hushed tone. He was shocked at how fast she managed to get through to the Sage, but he didn't put it past her. "I'm taking it that my expert advice helped the eel out?"* - Sat Nov 14 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans his head, gesturing for her to come closer. "From the get go have I not said you're free to think and say as you please? And you're in control? I told you that the snakes at the cave hate being disrespected. Presenting yourself as.. not yourself.. is the biggest spit in their face."* - Sat Nov 14 11:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, alright. - Sat Nov 14 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm sorry. - Sat Nov 14 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Gotta teach me something now. - Sat Nov 14 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Deal. - Sat Nov 14 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brings his hands to chest level and slowly being goin through handseals. "This jutsu is C ranked, but it's common as hell. Basically what you do is knead your chakra within your stomach and allow it to rapidly heat up." As he spoke, Ortho made sure to form the necessary seals over and over again. "Once you do that, light it a blaze. Pucker your lips and expel it at full rage."* - Sat Nov 14 13:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that's it? - Sat Nov 14 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. Figure out the rest, my prodiy student. - Sat Nov 14 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Sat Nov 14 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This jutsu is lame. - Sat Nov 14 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Alright. This technique isn't fire based, but involves that contract you signed a few minutes ago."

Ortho weaves through a succession of handseals, slowly pacing himself for Eri to keep up. "Until you get well known in the Ryuchi Cave this jutsu requires that you use blood for their summoning. Instead of having to smear the blood, leave it and continue on with the few handseals. Once gone with the handseals, the snakes will make their presence felt at the first push of your chakra."

By time Ortho finished the handseals; three snakes slowly slither from his sleeves.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: . . . - Sat Nov 14 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) joined the fray.

Coming up to the battle was nerve rattling, but a promise was a promise. Whether or not lives were going to be taken by this bijuu, Ortho vowed to fight as if it was his last. It's true that Ortho once upon a time destroyed Kirigakure, but it was for a the progression and renewal of the once corrupted system.

Nevertheless, here they are. A single handseal is formed by Ortho. A puff of smoke spawns to the right of him and immediately a duplicate of him dashes forth. The plan was simple and the plan was direct, send the bomb off course.

With that in mind, and haste guiding every move the clone made, it'd dash forward to the battle front before kicking off into the air --- heading straight for the bomb. At that moment, once the bomb most likely met him half way, the clone would implement the same Lightweight Chakra it used to fly on to the bomb. He knew, from the looks of things, that the bomb wouldn't instantly be able to be lifted; just maybe enough to send the bomb off course and over everyone's head; landing in the far distance.

Ortho, the original, took off for the skies as well, climbing straight up.* - Sat Nov 14 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kissed his teeth. The casualty count of the civilians angered Ortho to extreme extent.

Ortho has been climbing in the air for a while now, managing to get out of the bomb's immediate path. Still, however, the mere heat that radiated from the bomb due to the intense clashing of chakra against chakra could paralyze the soul of any human being --- Ortho wasn't just any human being. The damnation the Rokubi was raining down on them was almost mockingly, but it was also commendable how such a beast existed and toyed with the shinobi of this world.

"Very well.. That's how you want it?" Ortho's straight ascension halted and hi path altered to a horizontal approach high above the Rokubi's frame. "I told you this, you worthless piece of waste. Either you defend the village or I do.. You're no where to be found and you.. deserve to die. If I make it out of this- when I make it out of this, you're dead you wannabe Mizukage."

Ortho releases his lightweight technique, allowing gravity to take effect. A quick set of handseals are formed and the rapid generation of chakra within his body is made. As he fell to the earth, he extended his arms toward and looked to send a massive surge of electrical pulses toward the Rokubi. Acid is a form of liquid, yes? Is liquid not conductible? Ortho, nor the person playing Ortho, wasn't a scientist so this was all him winging it.* - Sat Nov 14 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took sight of the lack of effect the electricity had on the Rokubi, he curses to himself.

The mist and flames were not overlooked and it's for that reason why with all of Ortho's might he activates his lightweight technique once more and pulls up. He hit the brakes hard and it was just that moment of realization he needed. "FUCK!"

The Rokubi was hit and quite frankly, Ortho did everything in his might to not join in on that. Once more, while attempting to evade, Ortho climbs straight up into the sky.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "You always find yourself in some form of fucking bullshit you dumbass. Stop drawing me into your fucking problems, Ryutaro.."

Haste guided Ortho's movements. NIgen's attempts didn't fall on blind eyes, and it's for that reason why Ortho reacted the way he did. Quick formations of handseals were made, his chakra steadily coiling around his body and centering on his arms. Ortho took two steps forward, closing the distance between him and Nigen. At this point, in an attempt to halt Nigen's attempts, Ortho thrusts his arms forward.

Allying the thrust of his arms are two sets of snakes --- four to be exact. "Can't let you do that, Priest."

These snakes went to coil around Nigen's body, constricting his arms and body into a tight hold.* - Sat Nov 14 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Such a warm greeting.. - Sat Nov 14 23:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Ryutaro you ugly piece of shit! HURRY UP!"

Ortho's visual focus was still on Nigen. "Forgive me, Priest. You know you and I have no beef --- surely you can understand that I must look out for my brother at all cost. Surely you and I can come to some agreement."* - Sat Nov 14 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So, tell your brother to stand down..I've done enough for Kirigakure. - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Not that..I mind that, but you are interrupting my hunt. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I am working with you. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Give me what I want..and I will be on my way. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes a glance at Ryutaro then back at Nigen..

"I.. mean you no disrespect.. but I can't let you do that.."* - Sat Nov 14 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in on Nigen before scanning the immediate area. It didn't take long for Ortho to raise his head slightly and take sight of the aircrafts. "Fuck.."

Ortho reacts with haste, allowing a set string of handseals to weave together. "As I said, Priest.. just like it's out of your hands, it's out of mine. I beg that you don't think this is personal."

On that note, once the seals were complete, whether or not small speech was done rolling of his tongue, Ortho crouches. Upon doing so he'd slam his palms into the grass. As a result, with Ortho's best efforts, he'd form half a dorm over Ryutaro and the Tailed Beast. Of course Ortho knew his own capabilities so rather than closing up the dome completely, it was more of an umbrella.
* - Sat Nov 14 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks away.
* - Sat Nov 14 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had to react, but didn't know how. He had Nigen on one corner and the aircrafts coming in on the aerial assault.

Handseals are quickly formed and instincts are kicked in. Ortho weaves a quick set of handseals together, slamming his palms into the grass once more. Within seconds a second come is formed, contrasting the direction of its umbrella-like structure. From where Ryutaro was standing and where Nigen was, the first dome was vertical in their perspective. This second dome, however, was horizontal and trailed over the first, forming an "+" to the aircrafts above. It for that very reason why the first dome, the vertical one, came like a 'bridge' to those who are on the ground. For Nigen he'd be face with a 'wall' like object before him.

Ortho wasn't done there, as soon as the dome was complete he'd string another set of handseals. This time around he'd raise his head and inhale through his nostrils --- filling his lungs to maximum capacity. At that point he'd pucker his lips and unleash a power gust of wind to do whatever he can against the aircrafts and what weaponry they dropped.* - Sat Nov 14 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do not attack those aircrafts! - Sun Nov 15 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: 0 - Sun Nov 15 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was doing everything he possibly could, but it was no use. All his attempts were being negated with relative ease and it annoyed him endlessly.

Nigen's spikes or whatever they were tore through the double stacked dome. Ortho responds with another gust of wind. A set of handseals and the kneading of his chakra was all it took. He wished he could do more, but that just wasn't the case at this point. The intended target? Nigen.
* - Sun Nov 15 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened.

"K-Kana.. Why did you.. Why did you.. save-.." His voice was hoarse, the shock clear in each word he said. Why is it someone had to save him all the time? Why does it take other people to save Ortho each and every single time? Hideki, Index, Ume, and now Kana? Enough.. enough of this.. enough of being so weak that no matter what battle he can't handle his own. Enough having to succumb to being the civilian in distress. Enough of all this shit.

"ENOUGH! ENOUGH OF THIS! I'M TIRED OF IT, TIRED OF HIS ALL!"

Ortho's voice echoes through the area, his chakra visibly flaring around his body like some form of aura. Ortho stumbles to his feet, looking down at his palms --- refusing to accept the fact that once again someone else saved his head. "No more! NO MORE OF BEING SAVED! I AM A MAN! I AM A SHINOBI! I MAKE MOVEMENTS ON MY OWN, I DON'T RELY ON OTHERS! ENOUGH!"

His black pupils lighten, turning into a crimson red. A single tear drop swirls within the pits of the red and rests on the upper right corner. "THIS IS IT!" Ortho's tongue slithers out of his mouth, a thick slob of saliva dripping down. Ortho's skin dims greatly and began to chap, almost like he was forming scales on his body. In this transformation, his inner pupil, where the black circle within his sharingan was, would transition into a vertical slit. His tomoe remains in place but it all progressed.

"ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!"* - Sun Nov 15 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm?~ - Sun Nov 15 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) whispers: (Leggo) - Sun Nov 15 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed his focus on Kana for a split second, tapping her gently. With the tap, Ortho would supple the female with chakra; in turn making her levitate off the ground and fly as she pleased.

Ortho, on the other hand, placed his focus on Nigen. "PRIEST!"* - Sun Nov 15 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why do you call for me?!~ - Sun Nov 15 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's goal was now to protect Kana at all cost. A quick succession of handseals and the intent to intercept was all it took. With Kana attempting to close the distance between herself and the aircraft, Ortho fills his lungs to maximum and unleashes powerful gust of wind. This gust was to negate the spears sent by Nigen.

"ENOUGH!?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stepped to the side a bit, folding his arms across his chest. "Leave whenever, Kana. Next time I won't be so nice.."* - Sun Nov 15 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Whatever you say. - Sun Nov 15 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You and me both. - Sun Nov 15 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (UchihaHouse = Password) - Sun Nov 15 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks to his crib.* - Sun Nov 15 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Tch . . - Sun Nov 15 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks into the house, immediately stripping off his sleeveless jacket; it was drenched in blood, but not his. Ortho looks exhausted more than injured, a few scratches and bruises here and there. He says nothing to Eri, keeping his focus on one end of the room. There was no emotion on his face, just a blank expression with emptiness in his eyes. He walks over to the Chester draw that held his clean clothing. He takes out a new set, places his dirty jacket in the bin and headed for the door.* - Sun Nov 15 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head. "Bathtubs and shower heads are too modern for me. I live in the wild so I'll be at the river. Your training will start back up whenever you're ready."* - Sun Nov 15 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..you don't need time? - Sun Nov 15 04:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll clean up- - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Matter of fact. - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Get naked. - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I meant to rest... or be alone. - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...w-what? - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turns around and starts to unbutton his pants. "I'm going to try out that bathroom. Lets go."* - Sun Nov 15 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks into the bathroom, placing his clothes on the sink. He looks at the tub and gauges for the shower, sighing a bit. He paces toward it and began playing with the gauges, getting everything to the right temperature. Once the water was warm enough, without being too hot, he would begin stripping down to nothing. From the looks of things, Ortho was mainly bloodied from the waist up --- maybe because how the blood got on him in the first place.

He turns around to face Eri, folding his arms across his chest and visually sizing her up. "You going in first or me?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed, watching Eri strip down to nothing. He released an audible sigh and slowly shook his head. "Come on," he says as he turned and stepped into the tub. Immediately he grabs for a rag and soap, lubing it up. "We might as well get some serious training in while we're hear, no?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained under the showerhead, allowing the water to beat down on his body. While he was soaping the rag up most of the blood on his body drained off. Still, however, he soaped his body up. "Apart from fire style, do you have another chakra affinity? Earth? Water? Lightning?" Ortho's voice remained leveled and casual.* - Sun Nov 15 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Alright, that's what I'm going to teach you today."

Ortho continues to soap himself of, keeping the levelness in his voice and casual expression on his face. He looks up at her, slowly raising his left arm with the rag in his right. He winces a bit as he did so, the bruise on his ribcage stinging him.* - Sun Nov 15 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave her a smile, "I'm okay. Trust me."

He brings his arm down and took hold of the rag, raising his right arm and scrubbing under his arm and down to his waist --- making sure to get off all the blood.

"Alright so the thing with wind chakra and when you flow it, it has the potential to be concussive and piercing. It all depends on the object, jutsu and chakra flow. In this case, right now, you're going to make a concussive chakra flow on the slipperiest thing here. You'll know when you got it right when you're able to effectively run your chakra over it."

On that note, Ortho reaches over for the same bar of soap he used to lube his rag up. He offers it to Eri, expecting her to accept it.* - Sun Nov 15 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Good job. Now levitate it and make it spin."

Ortho continues to scrub, bringing his hand down to his waist. There, with the rag still gripped, he'd begin cleaning of his member. Everything about Ortho was casual; from his expression to his tone of voice. With his member gripped with the hand and rag, he'd begin stroking back and forth.

"With this technique you'll be able to take any object and turn it into something devastating. Even if it's something as simple as a bar of wet soap that you can barely grip. Just the faintest of chakra implementation and it's something destructive."
* - Sun Nov 15 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....L-levitate? - Sun Nov 15 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 15 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) releases his member, finishing up on cleaning it. He reaches forward with his free hand and respectfully takes the soap from her. Just the briefest of contact Ortho was able to coat the soap with his chakra and have it levitate and spin. "See?"* - Sun Nov 15 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. "Good choice to make the soap her training item.. Easier to break so it requires more control," he thought. He sighs out a bit, quickly and thoroughly cleaning the rest of his body. Once he was all soaped up and rinsed off, he'd fold his arms across his chest. He remains under the current of the water and looked on.

"Alright, you made it harder for yourself. Try again. This time moderate the blow. That's a easy object to break and split so you have to concentrate."
* - Sun Nov 15 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip as he watched how Eri's body reacted to the chilled air. Temptation was slowly growing in him, but he promised her a training session so he was going to give that to her. He reaches forward, takes her by the waist and switched their position. Now, she was under the water current and he wasn't. "Keep going. You're doing good."* - Sun Nov 15 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to look over her body. Something about a female in his shower, learning a jutsu and looking as good as she did was turning him on. His eyes narrowed a bit the second he caught glimpse of the rotating wind. He nods his head in approval. "You've almost got it. Add a little bit more chakra to it but hold back on the amount you dish out at one time."* - Sun Nov 15 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Just a little more," he thought. By this point he managed to keep his lust for Eri's current nudity under control. Still, he did take a few peeps every now and then.

As Eri continued to practice, Ortho would step out of the tub and grab for a towel. "Stay there until you get it," he says with a more.. demanding.. tone. Meanwhile, he starts drying himself off.* - Sun Nov 15 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched Eri's bar of soap spin relentlessly, the pace he wanted. "Good, good."

At this point, Ortho slipped on a clean pair of boxers on. "Alright, come on. Step out." He'd raise the towel up, keeping a hold on both end of it.
* - Sun Nov 15 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stepped forward. "You did well. I'm proud of you."

He turns her around, making her face the bath tub. Temptations was running wild again, but to hold it back he'd bit down on his lower lip and simply wrap her body with the towel, folding the cloth into itself between her breasts.
* - Sun Nov 15 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) breaks a smile. The training session was pretty much over, but she was free to ask for more --- all dependent on her. He reaches up to her face and placed his index finger under her chin, lifting her head a bit. "A true.. prodigal student," he says in a hushed tone, leaning in a bit.* - Sun Nov 15 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leaned in a bit more, giving her a kiss on the cheek. His lips ended up being dangerously close to her lips, but not quite there. He pulls back a bit and looked her in the eyes. "Are you looking to go into other elements you don't have the natural affinity for?"* - Sun Nov 15 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Every shinobi is able to manipulate every chakra affinity. However, we're born with the natural ability to manipulate one, two or sometimes even three with relative ease. We can still learn the other affinities, but have to put in more effort for those than we do for our own natural-born affinities." As he spoke Ortho's hand would glide over Eri's skin, his thumb caressing her chin.* - Sun Nov 15 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but give a soft smile, his eyelids lowering a bit as she spoke.

"So experienced.. but so innocent in her own way," he thought. He didn't reply to what Eri had to say out loud, losing himself in his thoughts.
* - Sun Nov 15 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times, releasing an audible breath. His hands start to trail down Eri's body until meeting the towel. He stops there, waiting for objections. His touch was soft and less demanding than what he displayed during her teachings; this was a more seductive approach.* - Sun Nov 15 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) trailed his hand to her chest, slowly hooking the knot and subtly threatening to undo it. He looks Eri in the eyes, saying nothing but having the look of questioning whether or not she was okay with this.* - Sun Nov 15 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) undoes the knot, allowing the towel to drop from her body. He reaches forth with both his hands, takes Eri by the hips and lifts. He glides his left hand to her left thigh and wraps it around his waist before carrying her to the bedroom; all the while he kept silent. He also didn't break their eye contact.* - Sun Nov 15 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gently laid Eri back first against the bed, hovering his own body over hers. For the first time in a few minutes he breaks their eye contact, only to lean in more and lay a tender kiss on her lips. His hands trail from her hips and up her body, meeting the soft humps of her breasts. He squeezes softly and caresses around her nipples without actually making contact with them.* - Sun Nov 15 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's kisses starts to trace down Eri's body. His hands continue to caress and grope her breasts, squeezing gently and stimulating her nipples as teasingly as possible. Throughout this entire process his body starts to lower and lower, declining more away from her head down to her chest. Eventually, with his hands still fondling, he'd clamp his lips around her left nipple. His jaw opens just a little, allowing his tongue free access to flick against her harden nipple.* - Sun Nov 15 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) moved on to Eri's other nipple, wrapping his lips around it and flicking it with the tip of his tongue. His left hand, in the meantime, gently rubs down her body until meeting her mound between her legs. There, he'd go right after he clit, pinching it ever so slightly from the get go. With his other fingers, since he used his index and thumb to go after her nub, Ortho would enter her hole. His fingers, once inside, start to rotate and flick back and forth --- all the while making sure to pass just the entrance, teasing her to the max.* - Sun Nov 15 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave her nipples, both of them, one last flick of his tongue; he moved from one nipple to the next, giving them their last bit of stimulation. After a while he'd start to lower himself more and more, kissing her from her breasts right down to her stomach until he was eventually down to her mound. By this point, Ortho was kneeling at the edge of the bed with her legs over his shoulders and face to face with her mound. He continues to use his fingers to tease her while gently blowing air on her moist pussy; forcing the warmth of her own fluids and his cool air to battle.* - Sun Nov 15 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || She was ready.

The sight of Eri's juices trickling down made Ortho smirk. His lips parted slightly as his tongue protruded from behind his teeth, his head starts inching closer and closer to her mound. Within seconds, which seemed like minutes upon hours upon days for Ortho, he was just centimeters away from her pussy. Just before he made contact he'd push his entire finger in, roaming her insides gracefully. His tongue, on the other hand, flicks Eri's clit a few times. He leans back slightly, takes a good look then went back in. This time around he took her outer lips into his mouth and sucked gently and softly, using his tongue graze over the skin before transitioning to her clit and focusing on that nub.

He went as far as starting to push and pull on his hand while bending and extending his fingers within her hole. Completely stimulation with the constant fingering of her insides while his mouth focused on her lips and clit.* - Sun Nov 15 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's pace picked up. His fingering got faster and his licks had more pressure behind them. He felt the clench of her walls around his fingers and felt it was time for her to dive head first off that cliff. Back and forth his fingers went in and out of her pussy; the squishing sound coming from her only drove Ortho to do as much as he can to let her ride out through this entire process.

His mouth opens wider, but not too much to make it seem like he was trying to eat her whole. He opened it just enough to have his tongue slip half way out. Just like a ice cream cone, Ortho begins licking her pussy from her hole straight up to her clit. On top of that, just to add more knock to her body, every two or so licks up and down her take her lips and clit into his mouth and just gently nibble and return back to plan A.* - Sun Nov 15 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) helped Eri ride this climax out every second of the way. His licks continued and his constant fingering continued, all just to bring her to heaven and back. Each stroke and each lick was a combination of many things; the enjoyable taste of her fluids, the desire to make her feel desired and just to make love to her rather than treating her like she was a piece of meat.

Eri's legs clench around Ortho's head, preventing him from pulling back. Instead of thinking of this as some hindrance, he embraced it. He pushed his entire face into it, sticking his tongue out to full length and driving his fingers in as far as he could. Just to add more stimulation and hope to give her an instant orgasm before the first even finished, he's flick his fingers around on the inside and take her clit hostage once again.* - Sun Nov 15 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Once Eri's body went limp he knew he did his job. It wasn't a matter of completing a mission or anything like that, but to fulfill his instinctive duty to just make Eri feel like a queen; to just pleasure her until the pleasure wasn't really pleasure anymore, but just sheer bliss and serenity. Ortho's fingers eased up on the pressure he had on her pussy. He continued to just gently and gracefully glide his hand over her outer lips, looking up at her.

Ortho's member has been on full erect since this entire thing started. He can't even say it bothered him through the process since he was so focused on pleasing Eri, but it was so enlarged that it started to ache. Still, he remained quiet about it and just played with Eri until she was able to at least move and speak. The most Ortho did, while her legs were still on his shoulders, was climb up on the bed with her. He alters her positioning a bit, leaving her on her side and one leg hitched up while hooked with his elbow; the other leg falling limp. He simply looks down at her first and waited, seeing what's left in her tank.* - Sun Nov 15 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) fingers continued their slow pace of playing with her pussy, just letting her regain her thoughts and feelings while keeping her stimulated. Every few strokes he'd insert a single finger into her, up to the second joint, then pull it out to continue stroking. He, himself, kept quiet and just let her run through her high at her own pace. This moment was about her and just her, something he's completely willing to have to make her feel the way she feels right now. Still, he was lusting and craving for his explosion but he made sure to make Eri finish hers.* - Sun Nov 15 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave her mound one last stroke. He heard her hushed words and simply nodded, not denying her offer. He alters their position a bit, allowing her free movement at her own pace while making sure that her limp body didn't give away on her in the entire process. All the while, he'd use one hand to grip his boxers' waistband and slip the undergarment off, revealing his enlarged member. The stiffness of it was at its max and looked like a vein or two was ready to burst. Every now and then his cock would twitch back and forth, showing the rush of blood reaching its max.* - Sun Nov 15 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The faintest of touch could easily send him overboard at this point.

Eri's grip alone was given a response. His cock twitches and more blood rushed to aid in its maximum growth. From the looks of things any more blood and his member would explode. The feeling of Eri's lips on the head of his cocked sent shivers up Ortho's spine, causing him to flinch just slightly and raise his head just to meet her gaze. This gaze hypnotized Ortho, his lips parting a bit and a groan of sheer pleasure escaping him. He tried with all his might to keep things under control but Eri's efforts to repay the debt of teasing were nothing to joke about. Ortho's mind began to wander off, completely submerged in the feeling of her mouth surrounding his cock and her tongue slithering around his length. The saliva from her only lubricating him and enhancing the feeling tenfold.

Ortho's head feel back and his eyes closed, another groan given. "Sh-Shit.." His chest started to heave and the feeling granted to him by Eri was unmatched at this point. All the while however, even with his head falling back slightly, he'd keep the eye contact. The eye contact was a crucial aspect to this all and it's that look in Eri's eyes that made Ortho walk into her trap of seduction and suction. Each movement of Eri tongue and mouth causing a low groan from Ortho, letting her know what she was doing couldn't be described by the word "perfect" --- it'll only be an understatement.* - Sun Nov 15 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) releases another groan.

At this point and time there was no restraint. Hell, if anything, Ortho would be lucky to even try to have restraint of reaching his climax. He thought he worked the living hell out of Eri's pussy, but she was here sucking the life out of him and trying to swallow it whole. No matter what route he took in an attempt to place his mind elsewhere, it was futile. Everything he did and everything thought all went back to the feeling of her hitting the right spots and sucking the right way. "E-Eri.."

Ortho couldn't even muster up a full sentence much less her name. His face turned pale as he finally broke eye contact and closed his lids. He allowed the feeling to engulf him, and as a response his hips jolted up a bit and caused more of his cock to push into her mouth. The pressure of her throat enclosing around his head and length was just adding to the pleasure of this all, relentlessly pushing Ortho toward the edge.

It wasn't until Ortho lowered his head and opened his eyes and watched two main hotspots be hit one after the other that he understood Eri was going for the kill right off the bat. For that reason, and that reason only, Ortho reached forward with his right hand and tied his finger with her hair. Now that he had a grip of her head and she was persistent on sending him over, Ortho complied with her wishes and simply submitted. As a result, not to force anything on her, he'd pull her head down even more to make his cock enter her until she based out. At that point his climax was reached. He didn't know if she was a swallower or not and with the last ditch effort to allow her to evacuate ship he'd let go of her head and release a groan of warning. "E-Eri..!"* - Sun Nov 15 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ran off of instincts. His climax made him slip up and he'd pay for it later, maybe teach her three jutsus in one lesson rather than two. Still, he had no regrets because of the feeling he had. Low groans come from Ortho every now then as she cleaned him up. Hell, groans came from him when he saw her take the load like a champ. Maybe the pull on her head would've been worth it if she didn't want to taste his cream.

"I'll.. make it up to you," he says weakly as he watched her clean him up. He blinks a few times in amazement. Truth be told, this was his first time receiving oral favors and earlier was his first time giving it. Normally a guy would ask himself where they partner learned to do such things, but right now the only question Ortho had was if he should marry this girl before it's too late.

"You..- uh..- wow.."
* - Sun Nov 15 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) released a deep breath. He lays back and rests against Eri, bringing his arm around her and tucking her more into him. He glances down at her, smirks and slowly shook his head. "Who would've thought simple sex and friendship would've led to something like that.. almost seemed passionate."

There was humor behind his words, but truth was present as well. It wasn't like Ortho planned this all, but the way things are going and the way things seem so right, could it possibly be labeled as wrong?* - Sun Nov 15 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Not only did her staggering of words give her away, but the fact she was so close to him only made her heartbeat feel-able.

"Wrong or right.. It's worth it," he says while glancing down at her. "Completely.. worth it."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Just... a bit scary. - Sun Nov 15 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. He brings his right arm over to his left, since his left was busy nuzzling Eri. There, he'd form a quick set of handseals, unsealing a few things. Out from behind a buff of smoke came cups, water, sake, juice.. all that. Of course he had these sealed just in case he had to stay away from the village in the wild for a while.

He brings the tray of stuff to the side of the bed, where a small coffee table was, and took grasp of the bottles that said water and sake on them. He offers them both to Eri, making her decide which one she want.* - Sun Nov 15 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Scary as in.. unexpected or.. first time anxiety? - Sun Nov 15 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the bottle of water back on the tray. His head fell back a bit and his gaze set on the ceiling. "Hmph.. you and I both.."* - Sun Nov 15 11:29:04 2015

"Yeah.."* - Sun Nov 15 11:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is it.. betrayal.. when I said I'd wait.. but my feelings took me to another person? - Sun Nov 15 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You won't be able to make this decision unless it goes one way... the only way you make this decision earlier than right before she comes back is if you let her go. - Sun Nov 15 11:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) This battle started off intense, that's a given due to the stakes and reasoning. Now, Kirigakure was on the path of destruction and quite frankly it's a matter of time before things hit the fan.

Let the onslaught continue.

Manda was met with numerous attacks, all aimed to take him out in one single swoop. Sadly, Manda wasn't lacking in battle experienced. He burrows underground in haste, evading the fire-based ninjutsu altogether. The lightning that was destined to zap through the massive snake was negated with relative ease, a mere Great Breakthrough chopping away at the electrical surge from above.

This, however, was just the beginning. The seemingly endless burrowing set the troops of Kirigakure off balance, not to mention the gust of wind to aid in that effect; now it was time. Ortho, himself, took the necessary stand forward, allowing his troops to begin charging the gates of Kirigakure. Each of his troops knew what the deal was, this wasn't their first rodeo. As a result, they attacked everything and everyone. Not one thing was safe within Kirigakure. Buildings were rampaged and army men were slaughtered.

Ortho, while watching the mist form, slowly shook his head. A set string of handseals are formed and another gust of wind is made. He, himself, knew that if this battle was to be a success that he'd need his troops aware and ready for everything.

Manda, on the other hand, made his presence felt one again. After burrowing a few yards and wanting to get right into the middle of Kirigakure's troops he jolts up from the ground and began endlessly attacking them; taking out as much as he possibly can with no restraint.* - Mon Nov 16 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bolted forth.

Handseals are quickly formed and chakra is rapidly kneaded. Jirun has a slick mouth and Saitoma was just in the wrong place at the wrong time; the formula for their deaths. As he neared them, Ortho extends his arms and opened his fists to expose his palms. Just then, a sudden surge of lightning is shot forth.

This, however, wasn't the end of it. Following the surge of lightning calm a single handseal and a pucker of her lips. He inhales, fills his stomach with chakra, and exhales. Rather than wind being released, it was a massive torrent of water aimed to merge with the lightning conductively zap both people.* - Mon Nov 16 03:10:17 2015

Ortho was tired of waiting. He gave Jirun the opportunity to evacuate and the boy didn't accept it. Here, at this point, Jirun dies. Ortho continues his dash forward, forming to handseals. At that point, he'd extend his right arm and allow three snakes to shoot forth; each snake had their mouths open and kusanagi-like blades prepared to pierce through Jirun's body.* - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015
