Nevertheless, he walks further into the room and assisted her. He grabs her wrists and pulls her hands up to her chest, gestures her to clamp down at the bottom of her bra and pull it down a bit to cover her breasts. As for her panties, he'd take her two index fingers, guide them to her butt, have her hook the fabric and gently stretch the fabric to cover as much skin as the underwear allowed. Once she was decent, he'd take a step back.

He swims over to Ume and gave her a curious look. "So, how do you like it?"

Up close, Ume would notice scars across Ortho's neck and upper chest. He has body art from his upper right shoulder straight down to his wrist. The scars that riddled his body, that could be seen right now, was relatively new.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head, chuckling a bit. "How do you like the skinny dipping? It's my first time doing it as well."* - Thu Nov  5 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's okay, I don't think I can get to the special water plants though. - Thu Nov  5 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But certain things you wouldn't be able to do.. - Thu Nov  5 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Like what? - Thu Nov  5 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That pre-fertilization thing. - Thu Nov  5 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't know how he wasn't expecting that. He didn't even know how to reply to that. There was a moment of silence for a minute or so until he got an idea. He edges closer a bit more and spoke. "I.. don't know exactly what to say about that. The most I can say, or.. do, is ask you how can I help make you feel the same?"* - Thu Nov  5 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That form of 'different' is good. - Thu Nov  5 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I don't think a am.... like anyone else. - Thu Nov  5 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Thats why when Sanoke could see my chakra he looked..... worried. - Thu Nov  5 04:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Did it? - Thu Nov  5 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Was talking about my skin...and then wanted to touch it to see if there was make up making me so white. - Thu Nov  5 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And then he felt how soft I was.... - Thu Nov  5 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And just kept rubbing. - Thu Nov  5 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) grits his teeth as he listened to Ume. For some very strange reason Ortho was slightly.. affected.. from hearing that. It was as if a brick came flying through a window and hit him over the head. He kept his facial expression blank, but any further progression toward Ume ceased. He shifts his body a bit, leaning his back against the bank of the body of water. "I.. see, I see."* - Thu Nov  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head as he looks off in the distance. "I just.. don't trust him. Every bit of contact him and I had he always found some way to.. piss me off."* - Thu Nov  5 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay...but... he's why I was even allowed into Suna. - Thu Nov  5 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm.. not stopping you from having contact with him, but just don't make him have physical contact with you. - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You are worried he will find out what I am... - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You don't know if he's placing a seal on you. - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What will he do? - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: S-seal? - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, a Fuuinjutsu seal. - Thu Nov  5 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know what that is...but it sounds bad. - Thu Nov  5 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's basically a art practiced by some shinobi. It can be used for traps and many other things. Including preventing you from things. - Thu Nov  5 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So yes, it is bad. - Thu Nov  5 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised his arms, stretches them back and rests tehm on top of the bank. One arm was located behind Ume, giving her more room to get close.* - Thu Nov  5 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. He can stop you from saying certain things, doing certain things. - Thu Nov  5 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: .....thats....bad. - Thu Nov  5 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What...what if he already did it? - Thu Nov  5 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, where all did he touch you? - Thu Nov  5 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just my cheek. - Thu Nov  5 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just my cheek. - Thu Nov  5 04:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Was it a normal hug? - Thu Nov  5 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: She got excited about something and hugged me and Sanoke in a group hug. - Thu Nov  5 04:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Met him in Konohagakure? - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No he was in Suna. - Thu Nov  5 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Lots of people in Suna. Only met Yonbu, Ziare, and Marrisa in Konoha. - Thu Nov  5 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Ketsuki was visiting suna and offered me a home. - Thu Nov  5 04:49:42 2015

Instinctively, he'd bend his arm, which was behind her, a bit and pulled her closer. By this point he forgot that they both were naked. Things were so.. casual.. for his mind to remain in the gutter for long.* - Thu Nov  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) turns his body a bit, bringing his free arm below the surface of the water and hooking it behind her knees. Once lifting her up, he'd begin trailing up the bank. Once on the shore, he'd gently place her down. "Want to head back to the camp or what?"* - Thu Nov  5 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) lets himself dry off for a bit before placing his clothing on. "True, true. Konohagakure sound good?"* - Thu Nov  5 05:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Two figures subtly paces toward the south gate of Konohagakure. The male of the two would stop just before they reached, scanning the immediate area. This was his native village, but he was still as cautious as if he was entering a unknown area. "Well, home once again," he mutters. Most likely Ume would here.* - Thu Nov  5 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued to scan the area. He takes in the smell, the sight and the sounds. If he was as nature-ly as Ume, he'd even crouch down to cop a feel on the turf. Thaenan's arrival didn't go unnoticed. Well.. initially it did, but when Ortho turned his head to the right, he caught peripheral sight of the male. While not bothering to verbally acknowledge him, Ortho would physically gesture for Thaenan to pace forward. "One thing I have to love about this place, Ume, is that it never changes."* - Thu Nov  5 05:28:06 2015

With a nod, the chef would go to a cabinet and extract a bottle of sake. From there, he'd retrieve a small cup, but was quickly sent off track by a cough from Ortho. Upon looking at the Uchiha, he'd see the gesture to just bring the entire bottle come. Ortho digs into his pocket and takes out a wad of cash, handing it to the chef. "Thank you very much." With that, Ortho takes a solid swig off the liquor.* - Thu Nov  5 07:13:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is your self preservation not stronger than that resolve? - Thu Nov  5 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Priorities, Ume. - Thu Nov  5 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is a priority keeping me alive? - Thu Nov  5 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Because you already know that isn't an issue. - Thu Nov  5 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alive.. and safe. - Thu Nov  5 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You can be alive, but not safe. - Thu Nov  5 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: True...but you will find me. - Thu Nov  5 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighs. His eyes trail from Ume to the table/counter thing in front of them. His gaze showed that he in thought, but still paying attention to Ume. "It's come to the point where no matter what you can live through, I want to make sure nothing happens to you. That's.. just the way it is.."* - Thu Nov  5 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes a sip of his sake, slowing his pace down a bit.* - Thu Nov  5 08:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Ume seemed to love asking questions that Ortho couldn't answer on the spot. Silence fell upon them once again, and in the meantime Ortho managed to take in a few more sips of his sake. He thought about the question throughout the entire process until finally some-what coming up with an answer. "It's not something.. that can be explained. It's more so something that just.. happened. I can't tell you the exact reason, but I can tell you that I do care for you.. genuinely."* - Thu Nov  5 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "The kind of care that makes me wants to protect you. The kind of care that makes me want to see you progress into the best, fill in the blank, you can be. The kind of care that makes doing all.. this.. worth wild." Ortho's voice was subtle and hushed.* - Thu Nov  5 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: A mentor... - Thu Nov  5 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And a student. - Thu Nov  5 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes, those too. - Thu Nov  5 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: All of that.. - Thu Nov  5 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...then what did you mean? - Thu Nov  5 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I mean.. you hold a special.. place. - Thu Nov  5 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Special how? - Thu Nov  5 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Special as in.. the feelngs I fought, and still fight, to get rid of.. is there for you. - Thu Nov  5 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you want them gone? - Thu Nov  5 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because they will get you hurt.. - Thu Nov  5 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not physically.. but emotionally.. - Thu Nov  5 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You think you will hurt me emotionally?  - Thu Nov  5 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not that I think you have them, it's me preventing them from being hurt just in case you do.. - Thu Nov  5 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) felt her hand crawl on top of his. "I don't want to be the cause for you to do such a thing. To prevent.. is better than to fix. How can I forgive myself.. if you resort to bleeding.. for the emotional pain I cause to you..? You are not.. deserving of that.."* - Thu Nov  5 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Why do you think you will hurt me? - Thu Nov  5 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It always happens.. - Thu Nov  5 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I never catch a break with that. - Thu Nov  5 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Do you have much ... experience with that? - Thu Nov  5 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No.. Not really.. - Thu Nov  5 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Then why say it always happens? - Thu Nov  5 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Cause the little experience I do have, it has happened. - Thu Nov  5 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Maybe things will change? - Thu Nov  5 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You think so..? - Thu Nov  5 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Despite all the.. chaos.. I cause? - Thu Nov  5 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Yes.... but then again, maybe chaos will work for us? - Thu Nov  5 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the empty bottle in front of him and stared at it. Ume's words stung him and he didn't know how to respond. The 'us' aspect was what really hit him hard. It wasn't like he couldn't accept the words, but rather he didn't know how. So much has been going down in his life that any unison between himself and anyone was more of a cautious step forward.

He turns his head to face Ume. He glares at her, a desperate attempt for him to see any hesitation in her words. He couldn't take another person he cared so dearly for being hurt while walking down this path with him. This was the last thing he needed now. He could murder plenty, but when it comes to dragging people in his efforts, he felt it was his duty to walk alone. It was his duty to handle his business as a man, as a shinobi and as a wielder of the Ryu to accomplish his own goals.

"My.. path is full of obstacles. Allowing those that are close to me.. to walk it with me is asking them to commit mental, physical and emotional suicide. I am a murderer of many, but not even I am able to close my eyes at night and be able to sleep through the knowledge of my loved ones being killed off one by one. I have ventured from village to village in hopes of finding a strictly business partner that share my same views. But, no matter.. where I go.. I end up finding another person I'll lay my life on the line for.."

Ortho's visual focus remains on the empty bottle, not transitioning for a second. "I.. won't be able to forgive myself.."* - Thu Nov  5 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I already have committed suicide for you once, do you think I'm not willing to go through the others? - Thu Nov  5 09:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Damn it Marrisa is gone and didnt even even notice me - Thu Nov  5 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I see you two are still here... Well I got some one to been enjoy your stay! - Thu Nov  5 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well I see you two are still here well enjoy your stay - Thu Nov  5 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov  5 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || If Ortho was able to pierce a clean hole through the bottle with just his glare, he would. His stare was thick and precise, relentlessly rampaging over the frame of the bottle. Ume's didn't fall upon deaf ears, but they were not acknowledged immediately. The fact of the matter was this: Ume was a rider and Ortho wanted to make sure that the trail she was riding on was what was best for her.

The path Ortho walked was long, dry and scary. He, at times, gets lost and has no one to see him back. Learning from his mistakes and acknowledging them is what really allowed him to live this long, and it is for that reason why whenever someone special shows up he tests them. He puts them through the damnest of situations to prove to test their will and mind, but Ume sat next to him absent of flaw and unknowing. Ume sat beside him unknowing of the extents he'd go to just to assure her safety.

"You.. mean so much to me, that the thought of you continuing suicide.. is as good as you doing it once and me losing you. It's.. a matter of me wanting to make sure that my path.. is truly the path with wish to trail on." His gaze finally breaks, shifting to the left and resting upon Ume. This time around, from sheer emotions, his sharingan activates. By this point, instincts kicked in and in turn allowed his tomoe to swirl around a single black dot before settling in its usual spot.

"Are you.. sure you can continue by my side? For, my.. love.. for you is greater than my will to let you carry on.."* - Thu Nov  5 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || True peace is achieved when the perfect amount of hate clashes with the perfect amount of love. Once those two key elements collide, a natural disaster occurs; that disaster is the ideal understanding. Understanding allows shinobi from all regions of the world to look at one another, past the malice, and simply comprehend the pain one another have been through. Once understanding is met, compassion is formed. Compassion would allow the shinobi to take one another's feelings into consideration, and once understanding and compassion are met, peace soon arrives.

Ortho's visual contact with Ume was met. He focuses on her eyes as his right arm raised and his palm gently caress against her cheek. His thumb gracefully glides back and forth against her skin. When she leans in and finishes her statements, the outpouring of his emotions proved to be too much. He leans in subtly, allowing his right palm to alter as he places his right index finger under her chin. By this point they were mere centimeters away from locking lips, but Ortho stops.

"I've seen plenty to know that you can handle yourself in situations. I've also seen enough to know that I don't want those situations to exist around you. You've.. come to a point in my heart where I vow my life to you.. at all cost."* - Thu Nov  5 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans forward the rest of the way, placing his lips against hers and subtly applying pressure. His eye momentarily closes, but not after remaining open for a few seconds to see Ume's reaction. Of course, if he saw a sign of discomfort he'd back away, but if that wasn't the case he'd ease more into it. His opposing hand, out of instincts, would take her contrasting hand into grasp and simply held it. This was a matter of going off of emotions rather than lust, a feat that he didn't know too well but was fully welcomed for this brief moment of invulnerability.* - Thu Nov  5 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) held the kiss up for a few minutes. When they parted, his leak of emotions was lessened but not to a full degree.  He releases a sigh of relief, pulling his head back and opening his eyes. He searches for Ume's gaze, wanting to meet it and see if there was anything attached emotion wise for her. Thus far, since they've met, he's notice the lack of emotions from her, but maybe there was a trigger to some humanly features? Whether or not she showed emotions, he had just one thing to say. "It's.. different knowing I have someone there for me. Rather than something.. temporary.."* - Thu Nov  5 11:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "I have reconsidered on a little bit, but my views stay the same. I will gladly have you by my side as I walk this path, and if something seems to be too much for you handle.. I will take my stand as your shield." Ortho's voice was in a hushed and subtle tone. His hand remained intertwined with Ume's. By this point he didn't really consciously kept it there, but he wasn't fighting against it.* - Thu Nov  5 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: im so sorry >.< - Thu Nov  5 11:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet. "I have some things to handle first, I'll catch up to you later."* - Thu Nov  5 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: if it is conscience i assume i still take control - Thu Nov  5 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood off to the side. A bottle of liquor was in his right hand grasp and his left hand was safely tucked away within his pants pocket. Every few minutes or so he'd take a swig of the sake, he was obviously chillen.* - Thu Nov  5 11:58:56 2015
