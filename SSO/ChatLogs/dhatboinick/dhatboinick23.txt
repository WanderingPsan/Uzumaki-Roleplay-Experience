<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: To see if she'd like to start an alliance. - Sat Oct 24 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) currently had his arms folded across his chest and visual focus on Reguel. Taiga's arrival was well noted due to the question that rolled off the males tongue, but for the most part Ortho supplied a shrug. "She went off to train. Check the waterfall."* - Sat Oct 24 20:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm? - Sat Oct 24 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself into the village square. His hands were firmly tucked away within his pants pockets and his usual nonchalant lean was allied with his posture. A single blunt resided at the left corner of Ortho's lips, stiffening and going slack occasionally when he took a hit off of it. For the most part, Ortho's attire was slightly altered. Instead of dressing in his all black outfit with a long sleeved shirt, he wore all black with a missing right sleeve. However, white bandages covered his entire arm --- it prevented spectators from seeing his massive tattoo that ran from his upper shoulder down to his wrist.

Ortho takes a glance at Marrisa, giving her a subtle nod and half-way smile. "Hey you, how ya' doing?" Ortho's tone wasn't cheerful, but it didn't lack emotion. You could even say it was neutral, a sound that didn't often emit from the young lad.* - Sat Oct 24 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 24 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight, I'm back. - Sat Oct 24 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gestures for Marrisa to come over to him, wanting her to be as close as possible. He meets her happy attitude with the best casual smile he can muster; he still wasn't used to this 'showing affection' thing. Still, though, he tried his best. If Marrisa was to acknowledge and comply with the gesture, he'd wrap his arms around her waist and pull her in for a sentimental hug.

"I've had the tattoo for years now, just never showed it. And I'm fine. What you been up to?"* - Sat Oct 24 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Hrm. - Sat Oct 24 22:00:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) yawns.* - Sat Oct 24 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his arms wrapped around Marrisa and listened to what she had to say. One thing he had to admit was that it actually felt good having someone there to just hold and get held by, rather than being alone and having to deal with life alone. For the most part, Ortho was satisfied. "Good luck on that. I recently went to Kirigakure and got a few scrolls from the Mizukage, also gathered some information too."* - Sat Oct 24 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glanced down at Marrisa and gave her a nod.

"Yeah, sure. Here or you want to go somewhere?"
* - Sat Oct 24 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) scoops Marrisa up and carries her off.* - Sat Oct 24 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So, uhh. - Sat Oct 24 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Jutsu scrolls. - Sat Oct 24 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) handed them over to her.* - Sat Oct 24 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, I don't. - Sat Oct 24 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'll teach it to you once I have mastered it - Sat Oct 24 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took back the scrolls, looking a bit shamefull.

"Sorry, I.. didn't know.."* - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: It's alright. . I should have been more spacific! - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: *giggles* Can you help me find a way to increase my chakra pool? - Sat Oct 24 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm, let me think. - Sat Oct 24 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Take your time. .  - Sat Oct 24 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Best way I think of is simply concentrating and expanding your chakra outward. - Sat Oct 24 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I guess I'll do that. .  - Sat Oct 24 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I just wish their was an easier way to expand my chakra. .  - Sat Oct 24 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Like a cheat sheet - Sat Oct 24 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd help you with that if I could. - Sat Oct 24 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I know.  - Sat Oct 24 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I just have to take it a bit at a time.  - Sat Oct 24 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Sat Oct 24 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands away within his pants pockets and looked away a bit.

"So, umm."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: Heh, I got away with blowing up the Hospital...That's great. - Sun Oct 25 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) opened his mouth to say something, but was stopped by Saeza's arrival. In an attempt to not be disrespectful, Ortho would pace himself a few yards away and stayed quiet.* - Sun Oct 25 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I asked you to help me with my Taijutsu the other day. . you said when you were more awake?  - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Or did you change your mind? - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: Did I tell her I was going to do that? Huh...I guess I can. - Sun Oct 25 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That's about all I can teach you. I mean...There's this special dance I can teach you to... - Sun Oct 25 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: But I don't know...It's kind of dangerous. - Sun Oct 25 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood stationary as Marrisa and Saeza went at it. He folds his arms across his chest and simply looked on.* - Sun Oct 25 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained on the side, his eyes fixated on his beloved Marrisa.* - Sun Oct 25 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) subtly wraps his arms around Marrisa. He leans forward a bit and plants a passionate kiss on her cheek. Both his hands rest on her hips, a location that Ortho tried his best to not contact with in fear that he'd go past his boundaries. This time, however, he was feeling a bit daring.* - Sun Oct 25 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's grip of Marrisa's hips tightened just a bit as he pulled her in even more. His kiss on her cheek was followed by another on her neck. Slight seduction intended this time around. Rather than pausing, he'd follow up with another kiss in the same spot, then another and another.* - Sun Oct 25 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It was no hidden fact that Ortho was sexually attracted to Marrisa. Right now he was running on sheer instincts, only doing what felt right rather than what he truly wanted to do. He continues to kiss on Marrisa's neck, only shifting his hands ever so slightly to caress her upper waist before sliding back down just before her butt. He kept within that zone, not wanting to make her feel uncomfortable.* - Sun Oct 25 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was tempted to take things to a next level, but the comfort of Marrisa was screaming louder than his lust. The most he did, out of everything that was running through his mind, was subtly cupping Marrisa's bum with both his palms. He'd gently squeeze and release every now and then while continuing to kiss on her.* - Sun Oct 25 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Lust was telling Ortho to progress further, but his mind was telling him to stay in his lane. His head motions upward, allowing his lips to connect with Marrisa's and rest there in passion. His hands continue to caress and massage her butt, occasionally releasing so he can trail up her body before going back to the cheeks.* - Sun Oct 25 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't want to ruin the moment, but Marrisa's statement caught him off guard.

"Your.. reward..? How am I your.. reward?"* - Sun Oct 25 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) still didn't fully understand what Marrisa meant by all that, but he didn't push the matter. He simply smiles and nods his head, not wanting to make Marrisa feel awkward.

"Well then, I'm happy to be your reward.~"* - Sun Oct 25 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm.. going to be honest with you about something. - Sun Oct 25 02:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .You should at least think that perhaps some people are stronger, and think things through. . . - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: She is going to get herself killed one day. . . - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Masa's approach was one thing, but the threat was another. Ortho never took fond of threats, and it's for that very same reason why he stayed quiet around groups. This time around, however, a battle was deemed inevitable.

Masa's statement was acknowledged, but not in the manner she'd expect. Instead of pulling his hands out of his pockets with money gripped, Ortho would string together a set of handseals at an extremely fast pace. Upon doing so, while his chakra was kneading within his stomach, he'd pucker his lips and inhale through his nostrils. Afterwards, he'd exhale through the puckered lips and unleash a massive Fireball.

The assault wasn't done there. By time the Fireball was created and exhaled, another string of handseals would be performed in literally an instant. The switch in Ortho's chakra nature was made and by time the Fireball raged forth, a massive gust of wind was exerted to follow close pursuit to magnify the fireball. Ortho's intent was not to kill the two people before him, but to render them incapable.* - Sun Oct 25 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The assault wasn't done there. With Masa being Vessul's safe haven, Ortho only retaliated the best way he knew how; more jutsu's. Upon Masa's protection, the male would form another string of handseals whilst kneading his chakra. Once the chakra thickened enough, which didn't take long due to his level of control, Ortho would spew a thick liquid substance to bind both Vessul and Masa.

Once they were caught, he'd supply a sufficient amount of chakra beneath his feet and pace himself toward the two shinobi. "So. I'm guessing you two are boyfriend and girlfriend?"* - Sun Oct 25 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, watching Masa cling to Vessul and Vessul acting like a little bitch. "This is sad. I was going to simply take my leave without engaging in battle, but your little girlfriend decided to threaten me. If I was angry, I'd kill her while she clung to you. From the looks of things I can tell you still haven't hit that, so I'm going to let you both live. However, not without a price."

With that said, Ortho would form another string of handseals and allowed a layer of chakra to be summoned within his right palm. Upon doing so, he'd lean forward and gently tap the back of Masa's head. To their eyes, it was a harmless tap but in actuality he placed a seal on her. Said seal would prevent Masa from speaking of what happened here in any manner. On top of that, the seal would prevent her from attempting to attack Ortho from this point on.

Due to Ortho's ability to transition into another set of handseals, the male would repeat the process for Vessul. This time around, however, the seal was placed on the top of Vessul's head.* - Sun Oct 25 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks over to the sink counter and sits on top of it. "So, how ya' doing?"* - Sun Oct 25 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Going to have to heal her soon.. - Sun Oct 25 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed a bit as he climbed down from the counter and placed his hand over Masa's back. Upon doing so, he'd begin applying his healing chakra into her, stabilizing her pain.* - Sun Oct 25 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) simply sighed. He looks over at Vessul and shrugged his shoulders. "I don't want you two thinking I'm a loose cannon. I'm the nicest person you can ever meet, but I don't take threats lightly. I've had my throat sliced after a threat, and after that I promised to never let a threat go unacknowledged." Ortho's voice was subtle and sincere, proving that he truly wasn't out to kill them.

"Your services may be needed in the near future, but I'll be more than happy to pay what is owed."* - Sun Oct 25 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) commended the restraint of Minimasa, even if she didn't realize she was still stuck by his syrup. The most Ortho did, movement wise, was walk back over to the sink counter and sit on top of it. "I'll be more than happy to fund you in your efforts. It's not too often I meet a blacksmith. If you ever need anything, let me know. As for you making me something right now, no thank you."* - Sun Oct 25 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) snapped his fingers, allowing the chakra within the liquid to vanish.* - Sun Oct 25 19:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Darnit.. - Sun Oct 25 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) followed her. "MrStealYaGirl." (omit)

"Name's Ortho."* - Sun Oct 25 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I guess. - Sun Oct 25 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) dug into his pocket, taking out nine hundred thousand paper yen. He'd hand it over to Vessul and give him a nod. "I wish you the best in your smithing."* - Sun Oct 25 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: My back.. - Sun Oct 25 19:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was peer pressured into walking over to Masa and groping her ass cheeks. "You're a brave one."* - Sun Oct 25 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: .... - Sun Oct 25 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks over at Masa. "I'm guessing you want my head on a gold plate?"* - Sun Oct 25 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's not my intention. - Sun Oct 25 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "No. Nothing else, and don't worry about the money. Also, do you wish for me to leave?"* - Sun Oct 25 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you wouldn't mind. . . - Sun Oct 25 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll find you as soon as I get better with my smithing abilities. - Sun Oct 25 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I want to be able to repay you somehow. - Sun Oct 25 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood, and don't worry about repaying me. Consider it a gift. - Sun Oct 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands within his pants pockets and paced out of the house.* - Sun Oct 25 19:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Only two crimes I give a fuck about. Murder and rape. - Sun Oct 25 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Sadly I do not. - Sun Oct 25 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: But they were very adamit about recapturing them. - Sun Oct 25 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself into the village square. Both his hands were firmly tucked away within his pants pockets as he walked with his usual nonchalant posture. His eyes fixed on Index, supplying a nod to him. "May I have a word with you?"* - Sun Oct 25 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) followed close pursuit.* - Sun Oct 25 19:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: What's it? - Sun Oct 25 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You asked me a question the other day, and I wish to expand upon that.  - Sun Oct 25 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Hm? - Sun Oct 25 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hideki's summoning contract and abilities, do you share the same? - Sun Oct 25 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I do. - Sun Oct 25 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You busy at the moment, Kat? - Sun Oct 25 19:49:32 2015
