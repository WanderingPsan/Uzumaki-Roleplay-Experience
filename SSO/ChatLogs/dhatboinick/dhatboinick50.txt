His back is rested against the trunk and his head is raised to the point where the back of his head was rested against the tree as well.

His arms are slumped to his sides and his legs are just slightly raised at the knee --- the soles of his feet planted firmly in the grass so his legs don't slide out.

In all honesty she wasn't a burden to him --- she was far from it. "I don't know if you'd take this the wrong way or not, but I would've come to this decision for anyone else in the settlement. I would've thrown myself over anyone else in the settlement to save their life. Quite frankly Eri, it's a matter of what's necessary and what must be done to give hope that you'll live."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down a bit, "I mean.. that's not a bad thing.."

Was it? Wasn't it?

Ortho shrugs and slowly shook his head. "Yeah.. that's not a bad thing.. I mean.. right now wouldn't be the best of times to start preparing for a child.. It all ends up working out, right..?"

He didn't know if he was trying to console Eri or himself. It was just the common sense thing to say at the moment after analyzing what they've recently been through.

"It'll all be okay. Soon enough we'll be married, have a kid or.. five.. and live in peace.. Yeah.. that's exactly what's going to happen."* - Sun Nov 22 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't lie, he wanted the same thing.

He sighs again and embraces Eri the best way he could without making contact with her lesions. "Have faith in me," he says behind a face full of her hair. He rests his chin on top of her head and looks off into the distance, "I'll make it all work out.."
* - Sun Nov 22 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't want to say he forgot all about that but fuck..

He nods his head, "yeah. We can get it done right now."

Ortho shifts a bit, making it to his feet without moving Eri too much --- her wounds were more in depth than his when it comes to amount. The slightest of moments could cause her to ache and throb. Rather than walking all the way back to where they were before the attack he'd hoist her up in his arms and fly off.* - Sun Nov 22 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) manages to glide himself down in front of the house and carry Eri in.

Once inside he'd head straight for the living room. The house was exactly the same as when they first came. The sweet scent was more transparent but still noticeable. The dim, romantic, feeling was still there and the music still played in the background.

He first sits himself down while keeping Eri in his arms. He eases her down on his lip and looks down at her, giving a smile. Ortho had history in this house but all that didn't matter. Being here, with Eri, made things seem a bit uplifting --- to him however.* - Sun Nov 22 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) snickers.

"Ehh, more or less. I mean I have a form of tattoo, but I actually have a legit artist waiting for me to call him in. Thought we'd get a bit of privacy first. Maybe relax just a bit.. especially after all that."* - Sun Nov 22 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down at her, "tell me what you want right now. I thought the 'wedding day' was all about the bride.~"* - Sun Nov 22 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know I'm not about that mushy gush. - Sun Nov 22 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Maybe food.... food that's so... -so- unhealthy but warm... - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doesn't mean you can't accept the rare moment where you get to order your sensei aro- - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He's doing so well... we both know I'm going to die. - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) did some godfather type shit and snapped his fingers.

Two guards shunshin in. They kneel and bow their head to Ortho, "yes M'Lord?"

"Food. Unhealthiest, tastiest, warmest food you can find in the village."

"Yes M'Lord." Just then they'd form a single handseal each and vanish behind a puff of smoke.

He looks back down at Eri and kisses her forehead, "I was serious about those five kids though. They're all going to share the same name too!~"* - Sun Nov 22 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks.

"I'm.. more looking forward the.. making process. But ehh, three and a half sounds better?"
* - Sun Nov 22 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head, "alright I agree. Three and a pet dog, take it or leave it."* - Sun Nov 22 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded even more, "I mean.. we have to feed the nakes some how right? A few pets here and there wouldn't hurt."* - Sun Nov 22 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a look of confusion.

It was one thing to feel after all that, but to feel unnaturally weak? Eri was in full control and awareness of her body so when she said that he didn't put in past her. He nods warily and gave her body a quick glance.

"Are you feeling any pain..? Or just extreme exhaustion..?"* - Sun Nov 22 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Locked..? - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times.

He didn't know what the hell to even look for medical wise when someone feels locked on the inside. He scans over her body one more time, slowly shaking his head. No matter what though process he establishes nothing in his medical practices helped him come to a cure or even stabilizer.

"You feel.. locked.. How do I counter the feeling of being lock-," his eyes widened. The memory of what Edge said and did flashed before him as he immediately went for her shirt to lift it up. "Locked.. you feel locked.. is this a Root Seal?" Ortho wasn't exactly asking Eri the question but just thinking out loud. He keeps his focus on the seal that was visible on her stomach, trying to figure something out. "I'm.. not even sure my Fuuinjutsu abilities can unlock that."* - Sun Nov 22 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to stare at the seal. He took in its formula, drawing and locks. Everything about it was analyzed and comprehended to a minor degree. Maybe it was his own ambition and determination to save the love of his life but from what he was reading Edge merely placed a chakra binding seal on her. He nods and keeps  a straight face, not wanting to get Eri's hopes up or even his own.

"I'm not exactly sure but I think I know what's going on.. You're going to feel weak because your chakra is being cut short."

To further his analysis Ortho would focus his sensing abilities to just her presence, wanting to see her chakra flow on its entirety. The seal was literally consuming her chakra and discharging way less than what it was taking in. It was directly linked to her chakra circulatory system and being a sheer jackass in the aspect of actually circulated what's generated.

"..I'm not able to unseal you but I can.. almost.. kind've.. assure you that you don't have a bomb planted in you.."* - Sun Nov 22 11:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sun Nov 22 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed.

His right hand shot forward while his index finger stretches out. Just as Eri says "helpless" he'd got to gently press her lips together.

"Enough.. please. Babe listen to me and listen to me good. Everything is going to be fine. I'm not winging any of this, I have a plan.. Everything is going to work out.. Just trust me."

He places his gaze directly in Eri's line of sight. She could tell he was extremely serious, way past their usual role of 'sensei demanding student'. This seriousness was from the heart and soul combined into something.. serious..* - Sun Nov 22 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head.

"No. I don't know it is. What I know is completely different from what you're saying. What I know is we're going to go about this level headedly and we're going to move with caution. We are in a ball part Eri and we're going to play the game. He sealed you, fine. Alright, we can't do anything about that yet. I buy a second mass of troops, allow it to build up and supply them with headbands from Amegakure. The village was disbanded for governmental reasons. I get them the stray headbands and make them use guerilla warfare tactics to take out Sunagakure's north walls.. To assure none of them speaks of anything I'll seal them beforehand and make sure that they don't snitch. Sunagakure would get the impression that this is an attempt from Amegakure not us.."* - Sun Nov 22 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He lowers his arms and looks away.

"I was, and am, serious when I see I'm going to protect my family.. I've made mistakes in my life but I'm going to make sure letting my family fall isn't one of them.."* - Sun Nov 22 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, I know.... - Sun Nov 22 11:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The two guards shunshin back in. The had several bags of fast food from different resturants across the village. They place everything in font of Eri and Ortho before bowing and vanishing.* - Sun Nov 22 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls Eri in closer and leans forward. He grabs the several bags and placed it on her lap --- seeing as though she was on his. He opens all the bags and take out what was inside. There were burgers, fries, cheese sticks, chicken fries. Name it, it was there. Ortho slowly shook his head, "eat up babe.. it's all yours."* - Sun Nov 22 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) just leans back. He raises his head slightly and closes his eyes for a bit, allowing her to enjoy her food. Ortho was more active so even if he ate the fast food he knew that he would have no problem burning off what he consumed. He wasn't really hungry so he just let her have it all. He remains quiet and just.. sat there and relaxed.* - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks a bit. He keeps his head leaned back and eyes shut.

"If I told you what I just thought of I'd be in trouble.~ So I'm just going to say nooooope."* - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tried not to continue his smirk through the kiss, returning it in full the best he can.

"Maybe.. just maybe that 'fat'.. goes somewhere with cushion.~"

His hand would glide gently down her thigh and threaten to squeeze as much of her cheek as he can.* - Sun Nov 22 12:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes slowly opened and squeezes her once more.

"Now, now.. I never that said.~ Lets call it more to hold on to in situations like this.~"* - Sun Nov 22 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs just a bit.

His eyes wander off again before closing.

"A tattoo artist is supposed to be coming but I don't know when just yet. I paid for his services already so we just have time to wait for him to come."* - Sun Nov 22 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thought about it for a few seconds before shrugging.

"Umm.. I mean you're the creative one of us. After your design for the Shinkogakure thing I'm nothing compared to what your mind can come up with."* - Sun Nov 22 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noticed the silence and decided to mess with her a bit.

"Tick tock.. tick.. tock.. tick.. tock.."* - Sun Nov 22 12:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"Makes no sense how creative you are.. I like that idea.. I really like it."* - Sun Nov 22 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Heh. - Sun Nov 22 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) simply held her. He had no problem cuddling and actually enjoyed it a bit --- more than what he'd like to admit. He leans back more into the couch and releases a sigh, completely relaxing himself.* - Sun Nov 22 12:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"One of my.. pasts.. is probably dead.. and the other will probably hate me that I killed my brother. So no worries."* - Sun Nov 22 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed.

He should've guessed the conversation would lead here, but he really didn't see it coming. In all honesty he wanted to just forget about it.

"He's the reason I had the bounty on my head in the first place.. and I got the bounty 'after' the whole sope opera thing.."* - Sun Nov 22 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugged.

"I mean.. Yeah, I guess. I try to be as honest as I can at all times, but he refused to return that favor.. I preached something to one of my.. pasts.. and told her 'one man, one woman'.. or something along those lines.. I can't really 'blame' her.. but.. I don't know.. Index was just a snake.. like not the loyal snakes we work with.. but the snakes that makes you scared to walk in grass.. even if the grass is barely alive.."* - Sun Nov 22 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugged once again.

"Depends on what you mean by 'what will happen'."* - Sun Nov 22 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will she want you...will she try to kill you... - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will you want her? - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Want me? Doubt it. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Kill me? Probably.. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Want her? I'm married. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't know if he should be intimidated that she was focused on that vein or think of it as something casual. He smirks a bit and slowly shook his head, swaying it from left to right as it was leaned back..

"Yes.. I loved her.. loved.. At this point.. at -that- point.. I felt betrayed to the point where I didn't see a point in even thinking I should 'wait' on her.. it's like I swallowed my own wants and opinions to assure her progression and my brother spat in my face while she rubbed it in.. I mean there are other factors that may.. kind've.. come into play but.. like damn.."

He sighs.

"Long story short.. I got you and only want you."* - Sun Nov 22 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) returns the kiss in full. He smiles a bit and nodded.

"Good to know you've accepted the fact that my death in battle may happen. Now all you have to do is accept the fact that you're mine.. even if you cheat at our little games.~"

He leans in again and kisses her before she could rebuttal, staying there as long as he could too.* - Sun Nov 22 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's lips parted a bit. His tongue pushes forward and met Eri's, gently grazing against it and allowing her to claim it for just this moment. He leans in more into the face and tilts his head to the side just a bit. After a few seconds he'd pull back, look at her then went back in --- he gave her the breath she needed.. for a split second..* - Sun Nov 22 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's breath was hindered a bit as well so he knew eactly waht Eri was going through. He pulls back just slightly to allow them to get a good fill of air before leaning in and grazing his lips against hers. He pokes his tongue out as he did so, teasing her a bit.

When she leaned back and attempted to take him with her Ortho complied. He alters their position a bit more, climbing in between her legs and putting just some of his weight on her, but not all. Throughout this he'd continue to tease her by making their lips meet but not enough for a full on kiss.* - Sun Nov 22 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paused to chuckle when he heard Eri whine. He looks down at her and ended up being caught into her suction. His lower lip and sucked in and he welcomed it.

His hands start to trail up her body, attempting to slowly glide to her breasts while working its under her shirt. "You know," he says within the kiss; he speech a little blurred since his lip was being held captive, "I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before they're really married.~"* - Sun Nov 22 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks.

"Ha.. Funny."

He reaches for her shirt with both hands and tugged is opposite directions, popping each button open and exposing her upper body. "I can never get enough of seeing this," he says as he lowers himself to her ribcage and runs his tongue and lips against her skin.* - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rubs his hands up her stomach, caressing every bit of her skin in the process. By time he reached her chest he'd take a handful of both her breasts and squeeze gently, pushing them together a bit so by time his lips trailed up as well he'd put his face between as extend his tongue. He licks as much exposed flesh as possible, taking off her bra after a few seconds. "When has Eri and Ortho done anything 'good'?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stares down at her nipples and licks his lips, "then.. I don't know. There's a door standing between him and us in here. Just a little.. taste.. won't hurt.."

He lowers his head and clamps his lips around her left nipple. The tip of his tongue swirls around the harden nub before retracting and allowing his mouth to make a further suction attempt. His right hand grabs hold of her bare right breast and squeezes gently then focuses on her nipple, pinching and tugging slightly. "Just lay back and let me treat you like the queen you are," he mumbles with her nipple still in his mouth.* - Sun Nov 22 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself accordingly.

"Tell me to stop and consider it done, you know this. You're in complete control, baby.. Complete," he reaches for her hands and ties his fingers with hers. Her raises them above her head and gently pinned then down on the cushion, giving her as much control as he did. If she desired to break away, even in her weakened state, she was able to, "control."

His heads lowers again and his lips softy kisses in between her breasts. He's sway back and forth between nipples and took them both in his mouth for a few seconds, sucking and licking on them with lust.* - Sun Nov 22 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's bulge was nowhere near modest. He felt his member pushing against his pants and took advantage. He pressed his groin against Eri's and starts rotating his hips a bit, wanting to drive the teasing to a new level.

"We're a bit banged up babe," he says then went to sucking on one of her nipples for a few seconds, "but I'm not stopping until you scream my name." He thrusts his hips forward slamming his caged member more on to her mound --- if only he was released.* - Sun Nov 22 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hands were relatively loose.  Eri had literally full control over what Ortho was doing, all she had to do was say something and he'd stop. Still however, he'd release her left hand and drag his hand, which was holding hers, down to his zipper. "Any last ditch efforts?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. He looks down at her and nods, his shocked expression turning into a sly smirk and a 'I see you Eri, I see you' look.

He grabs hold of her hand again and pins it down, adding more pressure in both this time around. He keeps tabs on her reactions to certain things by keeping one eye open. His grips on her palms tighten a bit by and so did the clamp he now had on her right nipple. His hips start to rotate again as he rubs his bulge against her mound, continuing the foreplay and teasing. 
* - Sun Nov 22 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept the teasing going. His licks and kissing went from one nipple to the next; he refused to neglect one. The way he was sucking and licking was like he was trying to inhale her entire breast, she shouldn't put it past him at this point. Lust was making him do things right now that would really be named as a sin for someone who wasn't officially just yet. Still though, he continued sinning with pride.

His hips sway back and forth and rotate in a circular motion. The bulge in his pants only grew bigger as his cock begged for release. He was so enlarged that the infamous aching was starting to form. Ortho keeps up the foreplay for a bit longer, wanting to see if he can get her close to climax just from this. His grip on Eri's hands would gradually tighten and tighten while the pressure of her arms being pinned down did the same. He didn't do it all in one swoop, but eased his way into so she was aware of what was going on --- well.. as aware as she could be while he stimulated her.* - Sun Nov 22 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) heard exactly what he needed to hear. Eri's body starts to squirm and Ortho took the pinning thing to a whole new level. He rests more of his body weight on her mass, but not too much to cause any unnecessary pain. His hands added the most pressure, his hips coming in a close second as he pushes his bulge more on to her. The way her body was reacting made him knew she was ready. With paced movements, while making sure not to abruptly kick her out of her high, he'd let go of one of her hands and reached for his zipper. The front end of his pants was soaking wet, only assuring him even more that Eri was at that point. "Louder. Just me and you.. scream my name louder," he says in a muffled tone. With his cock now unleashed, if he wasn't stopped again, her line his head up with her entrance and push it in as much as her panties allowed.* - Sun Nov 22 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was given exactly what he was working for. He nods his head once and reaches for the inner crotch area to her panties. He grips it and pulls it aside then waits a few seconds, allowing the cold air of the room to hit her mound. The aroma from her almost made Ortho drool, it was the perfect mix of body fluids and cleanliness. Ortho bites down on his lower lips and sways his hips forward and back, allowing the head of his cock to just graze over her lips a bit more before finding her entrance without the guide of his hand. He sets his gaze on Eri and leans on, "I want you to let loose, babe. No modesty, no embarrassment, no nothing.. Just me and you.."

Ortho pushes forth, his head entering and passing her inner walls. He releases a grunt and fights off the straight moan. His hips moves back and forth again, each pulse back sent him to dangerous levels of completely leaving her lips without actually doing it, each pulse forward added anything inch of his cock into her. He keeps this slow and lustful process going up until he was half way in her. Once at that point he'd just stop and allowed himself to throb and twitch in her.* - Sun Nov 22 17:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paced himself out of the village, passing the rubble that was once known as the main gates. His lids are lowered a bit and his hands are tucked away within his pockets. His posture was rather nonchalant for the occasion.

Instinctively Ortho is on edge but his expression didn't exactly visually show that. He released an audible cough to notify the guest that he has arrive to speak with them. If that didn't work he'd sigh and speak, "what do you need?" * - Mon Nov 23 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Yet another person coming for his body. The person before Ortho had to be at least the fourth person thus far, and it's for that reason Ortho shrugs.

"I don't have his whole body, but I think a few remains of his brain is still stuck to the bottom of my old shoes. If one of my guards haven't thrown the pair out yet I'll get back to you in a few weeks' time and let you know when to come pick them up. As for his body, go ask the Gezo Empire."

It was clear that Ortho had no idea who was standing before him. His tone reflected his cold-hearted nature that he has for anyone of the unknown, recent events causing this drastic change in him. He blinks a single time and sets his gaze back on Yuriko.

"Who are you anyways? Another one of his women that says she loved him and wants me dead?"* - Mon Nov 23 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes. Alright it's clear that she knew him but he has yet to figure out who she was. By now he has picked up on her chakra signature and realized that she wasn't ringing a familiar bell. It wasn't until the mention of 'exterior' when Ortho's widened a bit. As fast as they widened is as fast as they lowered back.

The infamous blank expression creeps on his face. No emotions was apparent, it was as if he was dead. His tone however showed some hint of life --- frustration. "Has it really been four years or have I woken up from a coma?"* - Mon Nov 23 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: An actual.. tone in her voice..? - Mon Nov 23 13:03:47 2015

"Because of what I did. Right.. Anyways.. The body isn't here. I told you where to find it."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes lowered a bit more and a sigh is released.

"One man, one woman.." His tone became rough and escalated, clearly booming over Yuriko's rageful comments.

"Stole my heart, endless pain.. a clone in my memory of what I used to be when I had hope and faith."

He slowly shakes his head and watches how she held her head.

"How much do I owe you? What do you want me to do? Kill the scientists? Make them destroy the clone? What? Right about now I feel so numb that I might as well be dead.. Maybe then.. what I want and how I'm feeling could be considered.."

He shrugs once more.

"Then again. Precious Index wanted me dead so in the end you grew to want the same."* - Mon Nov 23 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head.

"Nothing you can say will sway my mind. I know now where I stood and I know now where I stand. You blame me for not being there when I had no information of where the place was. The days leading up to Index's death I asked him numerous times where the place was and when I can visit. It wasn't until he needed 'my' help to cover 'his' ass when he finally offered to take me to where you were. By time I got ready to go he canceled and ran off on a 'mission'."

He starts to chuckles, a sly smirk forming on his face.

"I was willing to go four fucking years.. no one else.. just me waiting on you.. Then you went and got 'love' for him? Now you stand in my face saying you feel like you were just a place holder? I told you that you looked at me different than the others..  expressed that I loved you and I'll be willing to do anything for you..'

His chuckling grew into straight laughter.

"Before you attack me.. That's where we're at? Really now, Ume? YOU BETRAYED ME, DAMN IT! I DID NOTHING WRONG TO YOU BUT SHOWED YOU FUCKING LOVE!.. No, no.. We're not doing this, you see.. We're not going to stand before each other and point fingers. I don't even blame you.. I saw this coming.. I honestly did.. I had a gut feeling this is how things will end up.. I gave you the benefit of the doubt.. sent you on that mission to come back in four years and hoped.. prayed to the GODS I DON'T EVEN FUCKING BELIEVE IN… that you'll come back to me.. that you'll stand before me that flower that tried to talk to some herbs.. But no.. no.. you stand before me the lover of my supposed brother.. placing blame on me for him walking to his death.. placing blame on me for doing my best for you.. rather than treating you like a weapon.. I tried to treat you like a human.."

It was clear by this point his laughter subsided. Sheer anger emitted from his as he raised his right arm and clenched his chest.. specifically over his heart.

"You have to leave before you attack me..? You've done that long ago already.. long.. ago.."* - Mon Nov 23 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) clenched his fists.

"You must think I'm some super hero.  I did everything I could.. everything I possibly could.. You and I came to an agreement.. You made me promise that I'd come to mends with index and move on.. I did that.. I did my fucking part.."

It was clear that Ortho was fighting back actual tears.

"What did you want me to do? I look at you with no emotions because you and him sucked it right out of me.. You think I wasn't aware of the tests and what you've been through? I was only informed of all the bad that was going on and how he 'killed' some scientist and how you 'rewarded' him. That fucking smug look on his face when he talked about those damn games you let him play on you and those damn.."

His jaw clenches, the tears threatening to run down his cheeks but he fought them back the best can.

"Why is everything always my fault? Nothing is ever good enough for anyone. I give my ALL and still I get blamed for everything! You're asking me if I didn't think about you while you were stuck there.. as if I wasn't the one that had faith and hope while SENDING you there.. I did everything.. I could possibly do.. You experienced what I've been through before.. I know how you feel.. I've been there.. I've been through that.. But here we are.. like you said.. the 'girl that really mattered' to Index.. Apparently he's the only guy that cared about you.."* - Mon Nov 23 13:51:34 2015

All the pent up emotions and anger he felt was released. The things he was feeling and hiding from his current relations and relationship finally surfaced and overflowed. He remained stationary, all his attempts to bend at his knees and dash back failing due to his preexisting injuries.

There was really nothing he can do anymore. All his efforts to follow in Hideki's footsteps and carry on his way and views was a fail. All his efforts to walk a path that his family and friends could be proud of was a fail. All his attempts to better himself was a fail. He stood before Ume, a past lover and current love, as nothing more than a stray dog in this world.

The tears poured.

His mind wandered off and time seemingly slowed. Everything dealing with what led up to this very moment flashed before him. The first time he and Ume met, the fight in Kirigakure, the confession of his love, the waiting, the rumors, the hate, the denials, the tears, the drugs, the liquor.. all of it.. every last bit of it flashed before him and there was one thing that really stood out.. one thing that stood stronger than all of that.. regret..

Regret that things are going down the way they are. Regret that he could never live up to the expectations of the ones he cared so much about. Regret that he was worthless and had no reason to live anymore. No reason to even feel pain, no reason to feel happiness, no reason to feel joy, no reason to feel sorrow.. he had no purpose and no reason. He allowed all of this to unfold. He sowed all this and it was time he reaped it.

The tears poured.

Many things have been said in his life. Many things have been done. None of them he looks back on and say he'd redo, despite his regrets. His actions formed Shinkogakure. His words formed bonds. Together his words and actions made a settlement 'home' for many and a safe haven for the distraught. Ortho was a man of many mistakes and regrets, but accepting of what could be.

The tears poured.

He snaps back to reality, watching Yuriko close in even more. At the very last minute he attempts to push backwards. His legs gave away on him and as a result he stumbles back, more than likely her attempt to make physical contact was granted.. but not in full. A single graze over him is made and he falls back first against the ground. The sudden collapse gave him no room to react and the back of his head is slammed into the iron-like turf. His vision is blurred and disorientated, dizziness kicking in.

He releases a grunt of pain and discomfort, using his paining arms and hands to make an attempt to inch a bit more away from Ume. He was completely at her mercy. He looks up at her, but not in the manner she wanted. It wasn't the emotionless expression, but the expression that had so much emotions that labeling one would be nearly impossible. Right now.. he was just done..* - Mon Nov 23 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't obvious to what was going on. He may be physically injured but his control over his chakra let him know that he was being sapped.

By this point the tears subsided. He was drained out of tears faster than the cells were draining his chakra. He looks up at Yuriko and met her glare. The question at hand was easy to answer. The answer was stitched where he heart used to be, forever making its presence felt.

"For the remaining time I live.. and the time we've been away from each other.. love is.. and was always there."

Ortho's lids lowered and he welcomed the complete darkness. His dizziness was getting to him and the pain in his injuries was making sure to not give him an easy time. Ortho releases a sigh and just leaned all the way back, succumbing to what fate have in store for him --- death.. or the torture of continuing to live.* - Mon Nov 23 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

This hatred for him.. it was something he couldn't comprehend. Index walked to Ortho's front steps looking for a fight. Ortho fought back every urge to tear his throat out for endless hours, listening to the gloating and watching the smug look creep on his face. Yet Ortho is the bad guy. Ortho is hated. Ortho is the culprit. Index knew full and well what he was doing and leaving behind while fighting Ortho.. yet Ortho is forced to take full blame.

He was dealt the hand and played the game accordingly. No choices were given to Ortho and no way out was seen. Everything is Ortho's fault and a person he'd die for told him that she hated him over something he had no control over. The person he'd gladly cover with his life on the line just told him that she hated him for something he was forced to do..

Ortho's gaze meets Yuriko's. He had nothing more to say. Her words hit home and assured that he was truly dead. He was breathing, able to eat, able to drink and his heart was pumping on its own.. No matterwhat.. Ortho is still to blame.

He remains quiet. He only nods once and watched as the mass of cells conjured together leap of his body and went about its business. Yuriko-.. Ume.. on the other than hand paces herself off, releasing Ortho's head once more.

He blacks out.* - Mon Nov 23 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) eventually woke up, but remained still. His eyes creeks open and his gaze is set on the sky. There was just silence.* - Mon Nov 23 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's lids lowered just a bit and an attempted smile is formed. "I lost track at one..'* - Mon Nov 23 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || She would've heard a grunt from him externally then noticed his heart rate was a easing down --- as if it was just racing.* - Mon Nov 23 15:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sits up. He grunts and works a smirk through the pain.

"Better be happy I'm not trying to stare at something else all day," he mumbles under his breath.

He quickly gives Eri a coverup smile before making it to his feet and dusting himself off. His movements seemed cautious but still paceful.* - Mon Nov 23 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took grasp of her and flew off.* - Mon Nov 23 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) enters the house with Eri in his grasp.

The setting was still romantic when it came to the flower petals on the ground and the dimmed lights with a faint sweet aroma, but the background music was lowered just a bit and the furniture was a bit different. A third person was in the house, with Ortho's premature consent.

From just looking at the person, identified as a male, they could see he was riddled in tattoos. He was bald with tattoos on his scalps, down his neck, behind his ears and the gods knew what else on his clothed body. Ortho had a sleeve that hid scars so he had no room to judge --- even though head tattoos seemed dumb as hell to him.

Tattoo Artist: "Finally, finally! I thought you two would never show up.. I'm just going to come out and say it.. I drank some of your liquor but I bought some back.. maybe not as cold as the one I drank but.. sorry. Please.. come sit.. I saw the napkin that someone drew on and I think I have the idea that the drawing is a rough draft of what you two want?"

The artist gestures to a seat behind a workshop table. It was a bit bootleg and ghetto but the artist was truly trusted in the cleanliness aspect. He actually made it a priority to always use fresh needles to tattoo his customers with. It's for that reason why he sits down before Eri or Ortho did and uncased a brand new needle and machine.

Tattoo Artist: "Who's first?"

He looks up at Eri then trailed his gaze to Ortho. Ortho shrugs and sighed. "Ladies first?" He worded things to make it a question rather than demand, not knowing how Eri wanted to go about things.* - Mon Nov 23 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head, "I'm all in."

He smirks and pulls a char up next to Eri's, explaining how he wants his tattoo done. Of course, since Eri took the seat first, the artist would follow her exact wishes and supplied her with the tattoo of her dreams.

The artist would look at his handy work before switching to Ortho, following the slightly different steps for this tattoo. Before they knew it they had matching tattoos and was officially married.

Artist: "I now pronounce you husband and wife.~"* - Mon Nov 23 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shoo'd the artist away. Their lips met and Ortho returned the passion in full. He takes her by the waist and pulls her in.

He looks down at Eri, his heart too racing after the Artist's words. "Undying love.. Ortho and Eri.. I like the sound of that," he whispers with a slight nod and smile.* - Mon Nov 23 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wraps his arms around her frame and just held her, keeping his tone soft and hushed as he spoke.

"No it's fine. I say you keep your surname and I'll continue calling you it in puiblic.. at least until all of.. this.. die down."* - Mon Nov 23 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head.

"I do, I do. But I think it's best we play it safe. I told you.. I have a plan for everything, my stu-.. wife.~"* - Mon Nov 23 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arms unwraps a bit as a smirk creeps on his face. His hands would maneuver down the small of her back and over her ass cheeks, gently squeezes with a handful.

"I was hoping we can.. have a little fun for just a bit? Then I plan on.. not attacking Sunagakure."

The last bit was rushes compared to the slow and seductive tone he used for the first part of his statement.

"I'm confident and hopeful.. that the seal on your stomach isn't a bomb.. From what I sense and see.. it's just blocking off your chakra flow.. I might tip of Sunagakure of Edge's plan and see if we can form a deal to get this seal off and prepare them for Edge."* - Mon Nov 23 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) quite literally sensed the change in Eri's mood. He releases a sigh, knowing that maybe going more in depth on how he'd execute everything would be best.

"I'm going to station the troops at the northern wall. I'm going to everything as instructed up until I am to attack. By that point Sunagakure will be tipped off and procrastinate just a bit until Edge shows up. We'll take out Edge in the end, baby girl.."

He gives her ass a playful tap, not too hard but not too soft.

"Faith, my student.. I got you, I promise."* - Mon Nov 23 16:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reaches for her and plant a kiss on her lips. He holds it for a few seconds then pulls away.

"One last mission for you all.. Head for Konohagakure and stay there until I send a messenger bird." His voice is stern and demanding. The expression on his face told that he wasn't taking 'no' for an answer.* - Mon Nov 23 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yo Ortho. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You could use some back up. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gazes into her eyes and nodded, "Konoha. I need you all to just stay there for the time being while I get the army sorted and commence the plan. I'm going to send a messenger bird your way to update you on what I need you to do. Stay away from the settlement until things are cleared and whatever you do, do not activate your Sharingan.."

Ortho raises his left hand and looks at the tattoo around his ring finger. He gives a faint smile and nods.

"Just trust me. This'll work out."

With that, he'd snap his fingers and three guards poof up next to him. One held three duffle bags of money, another held three scrolls and another had a bunch of weaponry.

"Take the bags, they're full of money for the village. These scrolls are the deeds to have this village on this land, a deed for the village to progress and a deed that states the premature trading between Shinkogakure and the other villages except Kirigakure. From this point forth, Eri..  You're the leader of the Village. I'm trusting you... I know this is a lot right now but I know you're ready for this responsibility. Hold down the fort for me while I'm gone." * - Mon Nov 23 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Can't let you do that, Ziare. - Mon Nov 23 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head toward Eri, "see.. I knew you were fit for this role. You're thinking like a leader already."

He takes a glance at Ziare, "if things get to hectic for me I'll send for you. For now just do me this one favor and stay by her side through this."

His gaze found Menma, "you're strong. You're brave.. You're an Uchiha.. Remember that. It's okay to be scared at times, but make sure you turn that fright into strength and protect the ones you love and what you believe in.."

Ortho takes a step back and looks at his family. "Alright.. All of you.. leave.. now."* - Mon Nov 23 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: God, don't say these things Ortho. - Mon Nov 23 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his tongue, fighting back the urge to stop her. He knew this must be done and he believed in his plan.* - Mon Nov 23 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I'm never going to see him again...one way or another. - Mon Nov 23 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed.

Menma's words made him sigh and slowly nod his head.

"L-Later, Menma.. Never goodbye.. just later.."
* - Mon Nov 23 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) approached the outskirts of Sunagakure.

He and his army is fully henged into the Edge, completely resembling him in every physical and audible feature. His army is ready for war and ready to make their presence felt. They all stood like titans against this Olympus of a village, ready to climb its heights and reach for that brace ring.

Ortho and a single Jounin approach the bombs set up by Edge. They take hold of it and winds the trigger back. In moments' notice the bomb is sent hurling forth with the intent to take out Sunagakure's northern walls with relative ease. No remorse is shown and no form of regret is displayed. By this point Ortho would cease all advances into Sunagakure, wanting the plan to reach the second stage.* - Mon Nov 23 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods.

"Pleasure is mine.."* - Mon Nov 23 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) ||

The army observed each progression made toward them. Fear riddled them not, but encouraged their movements. This is a time of war yes, but strategy has never failed the wise.

The carbon copies of Sanoke charged forth and in response the army and head Edge stride back. They held their serious demeanor, but didn't engage in battle thus yet. They continue to spectate, wanting to truly understand the stakes.

Nevertheless some form of action was made. Enough time has passed and it's for that reason why the actions to follow their back track occurred. The mass connect their hand and intertwined their fingers into a multitude of handseals. In a conjoined effort, while organizing each step to back up, launch a massive fireball toward the large group of Sunagakure shinobi.

The Edge that stood out more before the army kept his hands and arms still, allowing the three-point-seven thousand bond with their fire.* - Mon Nov 23 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) ||

The army before him was formidable, but priorities struck. The question was asked why exactly he was warring here today; that question may never be answered.

Izanami's approach wasn't undetected --- it was far from it. The secondary Edge made his presence felt so now it was time for the primary. With the female engulfed in flames and the trigger to even more by Secondary's mist, Primary reacted.

His hands joined together and his fingers locked in a certain succession of seals. Before long his chest heaves and a mass of mud his released from his gullet. Its intention was to impale Izanami in on a whole. To follow thing up, with a slight wince, Primary forms a additional combination of seals and allowed his earth chakra flow to continue. Within the mud came a dragon-like head. Said dragon widens its jaws and unleash a barrage of, now enflamed, mud bullets.

Throughout the process Primary steady his back track. He desired distance between him and Sunagakure's forces.

//

The army as a whole watched Sunagakure's efforts. Lust is plastered on their faces and the common man can could easily compare this thrill to that of a males' first time getting the pussy. Nevertheless, they acting on their lust and transgressed away from the village.

The army of Edge's didn't just back away. They too formed a plan and they too reacted accordingly. Sanoke was possibly the main threat thus far. His clones were surely aiming to take out a mass number of people --- they couldn't have that. The combined forces broke off into sections. They didn't exactly move away from one another but specialties were split for this exact moment.

A large section of the army, rounded to two-fifty, allowed their hands to meet and engage in caressing fingers. Their chakra's flared and immediately a combined torrent of water is launched toward the clones. The second section tied their hands together in sync with the first section --- the signs were noticeably different.

As a result, they'd thrust their palms forward and go to merge a surge of electrical charges with the mass torrent of water. Of course the second section equaled in numbers to the first section so the alliance of their jutsus proved be formidable.

The effort to extinguish the massive fireball from before was rather commendable. Of course casualties weren't triggered but slight burns surely presented itself. Nevertheless the continuation of stepping back proceeds.* - Mon Nov 23 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) ||

The logic was faltered.

The clones were destroyed so at which point would the chakra receivers from them be launched? The destructive force from the grenades was commendable, but not a direct hit. Nevertheless the aftershock rattled the area. The east quadrant of army was sent off balance for just a bit, but they manage to gather themselves for the second portion of the plan.

The massive amounts of weaponry blacked the sky. In a moment's notice, with no hesitation, a selective amount of Edge's allowed their hands to meet and lustfully conceive a ray of handseals. Primary Ortho joined in the efforts. In unison they focused chakra within their lungs and inhaled. With the pucker of their lips and expulsion of air they'd create a massive gust of wind to negate the weaponry on a whole.

Haste guided everyone's movements at this point. While giving the army no time to react, or attempt to react, the massive number of Edges broke off in a full dash to evacuate the area.* - Mon Nov 23 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Gah. I don't want to charge in and fight all of those men myself. Hopefully I  can get some cover. - Mon Nov 23 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) ||

The army has been backing up for quite some time now. Shin's clones did not go unnoticed and quite frankly their speed underground wasn't on par with the army and the two main Edges.

The only threat they had was Sanoke at the time being. Even then there wasn't much of a fight. Majority of the army was long gone but there was a few that stayed behind just to protect the two Edge's. That being said, with Sanoke sending a mass amount of hair his way, Primary Edge reaches over and taps Secondary. A flow of chakra is met and within seconds they both took flight.

The stray army members, about a hundred or so, form a quick series of handseals. Half of them focused on the clones beneath the ground, sending electrical surges forth. The remaining half launched a combining fireball toward Sanoke in specific; a basic fuck you and fuck off to him and his locks.* - Mon Nov 23 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) ||

It is a sad day indeed.

The clone if formidable but after closer looks the attempt to detonate a mass amount of tags without exactly being made of it would hinder the technique useless. In all the technique was superb, but by time the chakra was generated it was nulled by itself.

Trilliam's attack wasn't ignored. In fact, far from it. The boy belongs in prison, not some fail attempt of a hero. Clearly his clay was fast but for the distance he launched the clay and where the two Edge's were, it was all in vain. If anything he took out a good amount of the front line enemies.. from Suna.

The two Edges continue their evacuation.* - Tue Nov 24 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) || Let the true destruction begin..

The chase was almost done, but Sanoke decided to follow pursuit.  Hassan, the clone and the smarter of the two, decided to go about his business.

The army reached the checkpoint needed for the next phase of the plan. The two Edges were just planting their feet back on the ground when the ultimate weapon was revealed.  Several weaponry of mass destruction is presenting to the battle field and as such they were utilized.

With several people now retreating back to their village the army would load the weaponries with the proper ammo and fire them off. Three of the multitude of weaponry would specifically aim at Sanoke. One aimed in the path Sanoke was aiming and the other two aimed for his sides. This was an attempt to continue drawing him closer to them.

With Trilliam still planting clay beneath ground like an idiot, if Sanoke managed to run out of the zone of the nukes he'd be likely to trigger off one of Trilliams traps.

The remaining amount of weaponry and nukes focused on the mass before them --- the entirety of Sunagakure's army* - Tue Nov 24 01:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) was getting annoyed by this point.

Hassan was a renowned Fuuton user, which much wasn't going to be taken away from him. The multitude of shuriken manages to collide with the bombs, but the damage was still dealt.

Primary took the stance. Before the army launched more kunai's he'd instead bring his hands together for a set of handseals. Whilst mimicking Sanoke's approach, Primary would unleash a massive gust of wind. At that very moment the two launchers would chuck their respective explosives.

Not only was Primary's wind destined to off balance, but to cancel out Suna's weaponry. On top of his wind, a selective section of Primary's army would aid in the gust of wind.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) || More and more bombs came raining down on Sunagakure's army.

The deed was done on Primary's part. He did exactly what he was told to do for the sake of this mission --- it was now completed. The army continues to unleash bombs, setting their aim at an angle this time around. Of course it'd arch and aim to explode within the midst of Sunagakure's army instead of going for a straight forward assault.

That being said, the Primary Edge would begin his withdrawal once again, working his way through the army. Meanwhile, the army that was handling the bombs, the excess forces would combine their efforts to unleash hell. Some launched lightning based attacks, some launched wind, some launched water and others launched earth. It was all a onslaught on the army. More importantly, the wind launched was to negate any stray weaponry sent their way before the bombs went off. Of course underestimating the bombs with the allied wind would get someone killed.* - Tue Nov 24 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taiga, Edge(DhatBoiNick) || Little by little the army has been pulling back.

Eventually Primary and secondary evacuated and all that was left was a thousand Edges to hold down the fort. Of course there were casualties, but in the end majority evacuated. The thousand left behind, along with the two bomb launchers, continued their onslaught until all was destroyed.

The war was waged by Edge and at only the cost of a thousand troops he could saw he won the battle.

One section remaining thousand troops brings their hands together in a set handseals before unleashing a conjoined fireball to take advantage of Hassan's jutsu. The remaining section forms their own handseals in sync of the first section then slammed their respective palms into the sand. Just then a massive bridge-like corridor is formed over head to take the blunt of Trilliam's nuke. Sadly, however, a good thirty or so of the thousand are caught and killed. Still, majority is alive.

In response to Trilliam however, a third section placed their focus on him alone. They'd unleash a moderately size fireball --- they took full advantage of his free fall.* - Tue Nov 24 02:56:38 2015
