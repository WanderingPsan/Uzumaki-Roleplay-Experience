<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) brings the jug to his mouth.

"You have free will to train, progress, whatever. Just don't leave the village."

He then takes another swig.* - Fri Oct  2 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was leant against the wall with a jug of sake in his right hand and his left hand tucked in his pockets.* - Fri Oct  2 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had been drinking endlessly for a few days now. His eyes warily pans over to Marrisa, watching her focus on the scroll in hand.* - Fri Oct  2 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pushed himself off the wall and paced toward Marrisa. Each step he took seemed to have more effort behind it than it normally should, the effects of the alcohol dawning on Erebus. Once behind Marrisa, he'd crouch down a bit and take a good swig of the liquor. "Hey, why not take a load off and back to my place?"* - Fri Oct  2 12:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pulls his hand out of his pocket and reached for Marrisa's waist, firmly gripping it and pulling her frame closer to his. Another swig of the liquor was taken before he provided a tipsy smirk.

"I drink every chance I get; it's just that lately that chance was rare. Now, it's about celebration. How about we go in my office instead..?" Erebus' hand will slowly wander to the back of Marrisa in an attempt to get a steady clasp of her cheeks.* - Fri Oct  2 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk only grew thicker as he released Marrisa and paced toward the mansion, expecting her to follow.* - Fri Oct  2 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looked left and right before pushing his way past the secret door.* - Fri Oct  2 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Fri Oct  2 13:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Learn something new everyday - Fri Oct  2 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) sat himself on one of the cushions, patting one that's next to him to imply Marrisa to come sit next to him.* - Fri Oct  2 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) placed the jug of liquor on the opposite side of him. He leans himself closer to Marrisa and drunkely went to kiss her on the neck. "So, how's your training going," he says between each pucker of his lips.* - Fri Oct  2 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's lips continued to caress the skin of Marrisa. His right hand raised slightly and gently fixed itself within her inner most thighs. "That's nice, that's nice. I'll be sure to get you as much missions as you want."* - Fri Oct  2 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's hand continues to wander upward. After feeling the protection she placed on her wonderland, Erebus gave a slight smirk and continued to kiss through he neck. After a few seconds, he'd apply slight pressure to her protective hand; an attempt to sway her mind on just giving him a little bit. Meanwhile, with his opposing hand, Erebus would start the process of working up her upper clothing to her breasts.

"It's not unique treatment. I hand missions to anyone that's a part of the village, it's to hald you all progress."* - Fri Oct  2 13:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) started digging under and fabric he could until he was granted skin on skin contact. Upon doing so, he'd focus his fondling attention on her nipples; he was indeed trying to seduce her and ease the shield on her sacred grounds.

"Show me you have potential and it's all yours."* - Fri Oct  2 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) continued the process of lifting as much clothing as he could, an attempt to release a full view of Marrisa's breasts. Upon doing so, he'd trail his lips from her neck, down to her upper chest and clamped them around her nipples.* - Fri Oct  2 13:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had look of confusion plasted on his face. Everything was fine up to this point and quite frankly, his drunken mind couldn't piece together what he did wrong. He eased back from Marrisa and blinked a few times.

"Marrisa.. I-I.."* - Fri Oct  2 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes wandered off. Of all things Erebus was known for, he wasn't a rapist or molestor. He turns his head and body, facing western, before taking grasp of his jug of liquor. After taking a swig, he slowly shook his head and replied.

"Nothing, Marrisa.. nothing.."* - Fri Oct  2 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplid a shrug, his mind continuing to wander off as he steadily took more and more swigs. With his eyes focusing on a single tile for whatever concentration to liquor provided, Erebus spoke.

"I don't understand why people ask broad questions like that. That's like asking me why I talk the way I talk or think the way I think. There is no specific answer.." Erebus' voice was subtle, but clearly more emotionless than normal.. it was almost cold.* - Fri Oct  2 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, taking yet another swig of his liquor.

"No need to say sorry," he says with the same coldness in his voice. "Listen.. I'll keep my space from now on.."* - Fri Oct  2 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) simply blinked and took a gulp of his liquor.

"The last thing you need to do is mix passion and business together. What difference would it make between now and then..? I'm a murderer, Marrisa.. Not a slave owner or rapist. Forget about whatever.. lust and potential.. feelings.. I had.. or have."* - Fri Oct  2 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You misunderstand Erebus. .  - Fri Oct  2 14:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: it is - Fri Oct  2 14:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hello, Kohaku. - Fri Oct  2 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Erebus. - Fri Oct  2 15:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Whatever. - Fri Oct  2 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) didn't even seem to give Kohaku the time of day. The activation of his Sharingan was the only thing that received any form of acknowledgment from Erebus; even then it was very little. The comment from Kohaku only made Erebus chuckle to himself, the cockiness was commendable. The only movement Erebus made was when he reached up to his mouth, held his blunt steady with two fingers and took a hard hit off of it. Other than that, he simply waited.* - Fri Oct  2 15:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Interesting. - Fri Oct  2 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had to give it to Kohaku, her speed was impeccable. For the most part however, Erebus showed no signs of even caring. The original female approached him with ease, no rebuttal whatsoever. The only thing he did in retaliation to her kicks was fold his arms across his chest while allowing the blunt located between his lips to go slack. His eyes wandered off toward the clone, fixated on the fire-based jutsu being launched in his direction. It was at that moment Erebus got an idea.

In the midst of the attacks connecting against his steel-like body, Erebus would use his amazing attacking speed to quickly grab Kohaku and alter her position. By time the fireballs were to arrival, they'd slam into the female's back.* - Fri Oct  2 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (14 Reflex, 13 Attack Speed, 26 Durability.) - Fri Oct  2 16:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) wasn't trying to be rude or cocky, but it saddened him greatly that these attacks couldn't harm him. He didn't enjoy pain, but he longed to actually be damaged. With an unimpressed facial expression, in response to the eight more SLOW kicks to his face, Erebus simply took the first hit like a champ and followed it up with his own attack. Seeing as though he still had Kohaku gripped, Erebus would slam her down toward the ground whilst lifting his right leg up; an attempt to knee her in the back.. Afterwards, with relative ease, he throws the female away like she was a paper ball.* - Fri Oct  2 16:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Badass. - Fri Oct  2 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had absolutely no care in the world for the fire that covered Kohaku's body. Caring about that is like an anteater caring for the life of a newly hatched ant. Yes, Erebus was engulfed in a small flame of fire, but the most that would happen to him is his blunt being burned out and the majority of his clothes turning to crisps of lint. Erebus' focus returned to the clone as he simply folded his arms across his chest and tried to inhale as much of the THC left in his blunt. The fireballs eventually slammed into his body but, literally, had no effect.* - Fri Oct  2 16:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) didn't bother to acknowledge Kohaku; he felt like she quit too easily. Now he's going to have to find another way to get his logs up before the LC's.* - Fri Oct  2 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) extended his arms, revealing his full wingspan for Takeda. As the torrent of water came crashing into his body, Erebus would turn in place and allowed the liquid to clash with every bit of his body as possibly. Thankfully, by time the flames were extinguished, only his upper body clothing was damaged. His pants was seemingly fine.* - Fri Oct  2 16:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) also had a sleeve, tattoo, of what seemd to be someone falling into a flamming hole. In the midst of the hole was the word "Jashin" in bold italics. The remaining image was other hell-related stuff.* - Fri Oct  2 16:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) strolls up to the main gathering of Sunagakure, hands tucked in his pockets while a newly lit blunt rested at the side of his mouth. His infamous dual scythes hung from his neck by a single thick metal chain and his regular attired seemingly burnt off his body. Erebus' eyes immediately fixed themselves on Hassan, providing him with a nod of acknowledge.

"Good day." * - Fri Oct  2 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) panned the area briefly while keeping his hands fixated on Hassan. It was amazing how physical changes can trick shinobi, but it was also amazing how a shinobi's chakra doesn't change. To Erebus' liking, and his ability to sense chakra, he knew exactly who was in the area. Quite frankly, he didn't care or have any reason to hunt them down. For the most part, however, he simply shrugged them off whilst keeping tabs of their locations.

"I'm aware that I've come unannounced, forgive me. I've come in search of someone and it seems as though I've found them." Erebus' voice was slightly muffled do to the blunt in the corner of his mouth, but his eyes wandered over to Taiga while his faced remained fixed on Hassan's generic area.* - Fri Oct  2 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) reached up to his mouth and took grasp of his blunt. He edges toward Hassan, extending his arm to the Field Commander; he was offering a few puff of the blunt to the elder. Erebus was merely a murderer after all, not a disrespectful person. Nevertheless, whether or not Hassan accepted the blunt, Erebus would give a brief yawn whilst analyze the building mention.

He was in his lackadaisical state of posture; his hands firmly tucked in his pockets, blunt located at the corner of his mouth and dual scythes hanging from his neck by a thick metal chain. Suitengu's description of the man in question was a bit strange; a person that gave off the same aura as Erebus? Is that even possible? Still, however, Suitengu was no liar so Erebus took everything into consideration.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a shrug. "No need to worry, kiddo. I'll handle everything."

He knew that he missed the starting point, but the way Marrisa was smacked by the papers of chakra, Erebus felt like he was viewing the resolution.

An examining the essence before him provided Erebus with the necessary knowledge that this being was exactly who Suitengu forewarned about; there wasn't much of an impressed expression plastered on Erebus' face. Nevertheless, if Suitengu spoke so highly of Nigen, Erebus gave the man his dues --- it wasn't much. A simple sigh came from Erebus as he took a single step forward, allowing the blunt residing in the right corner of his lips to go slack. Afterwards, as if he was a master manipulator over the joint, it went stuff and a hit was taken off of it.

"This is my home and I'm sure anything you have to say to me in private can be said out here. Ease yourself; take a load off, allow yourself to succumb to the serenity of peace. Don't mind the potential death of the female though." Erebus would gesture to Kohaku while saying the last statement.* - Fri Oct  2 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The presence of Erebus was neither heard or smelt. The infamous aroma of Death and Blood didn't thicken the immediate atmosphere, nor did the eerie sound of chain ruffling around enter the hearing zone. It seemed as though, even as an immortal, Erebus was becoming more and more humanoid as he lived in this shinobi world.

Once looked upon, Erebus is seen bare-skinned for his upper body. His dual scythes hung from around his neck by a thick metal chain. Both his hands were tucked in his pants pocket and a nonchalant posture was what he wore. A blunt rested at the left corner of his mouth and he eyes fixated on Seisuke. Despite whatever show of affection the male and the female was displaying, Erebus would still make his presence heard.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's posture was lackadaisical. He had his hands tucked firmly into his pockets, he back leaned against the manors' wall and a blunt hitched between his lips. His eyes wander off from the sky and set upon the frame of Hideki, momentarily examining the Uchiha before him. The sight of sake irrigated the growth of a smirk on Erebus' face, causing the blunt to momentarily go slack.

"I'm listening." His force was muffled due to him taking a steady hit off of the herbal medicine.* - Sat Oct  3 16:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had the ability to prevent his thoughts from seeping on to his visage and actions. The look in Hideki's eyes didn't go unnoticed, just unacknowledged. For the most part, Erebus remained stationary and allowed his eyes to float back into the sky. "Ya'know, Hideki. You and I have yet to battle, be it alongside one another or as counter parts." Once again, Erebus' voice was slightly muffled due to the intake of the herbs.* - Sat Oct  3 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you're looking for a spar, Erebus-sama. Then I'm okay with that. - Sat Oct  3 17:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: What are you up to? - Sat Oct  3 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pushed himself off the wall, allowing himself to stand upright rather than using the wall as support. Behind his back was a sack-like carrier with a bunch of bows within. Erebus gestures to Hideki to hold on for a brief moment as he walked into the manor grabbed his bow-sword and came back out. "Alright, now I'm ready."* - Sat Oct  3 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) took in an excessively hard hit off of his blunt, allowing the entirety of it to shrink rather quickly. The exhaled smoke, after a few seconds, was thick in density and aroma. Erebus gave a slight smirk as he pivoted backwards, taking full grasp of the gripping for his bow. With his opposing hand, Erebus would reach behind his back and gather three arrows. By time friction prevailed against his back dash, Erebus would set the three arrows up and pull back on the durable wire of his bow. From there, after getting in a good aim, Erebus would fire off all three arrows.

Now, the way in which Erebus allowed these arrows to soar off was a bit unique. An attempt was made to mask one of the three projectiles, having the first arrow aim directly for the bridge of Hideki's nose. Meanwhile, in a very tight pursuit, arrow 3 shadowed beneath arrow 2, giving off the illusion that there was only two arrows that were fired off. Arrow 2 and 3 had the same generic aim, Hideki's stomach, but arrow 3 was intended to be the true piercer while arrow 2 was a mere bluff.* - Sat Oct  3 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) swiftly unhooked the strap that kept his sack of arrows tied to his body. He thrusts both the sake and the bow off to the side and welcomed the fireball with open arms; literally. Just as the enflamed jutsu clashed into his body, Erebus would bear hug it the best he could and hold it in place. After a second or so, Erebus would get a better grip on it and attempt to launch the shit back.* - Sat Oct  3 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a sad mug, watching as the remaining of his blunt burn and fall to his feet in ashes. Hideki prevailed in truly injuring Erebus; Erebus' love. The Jashinists' head began to turn from left to right in search of Hideki. Eventually, however, after allowing his advanced sight and hearing to kick in, Erebus found the Uchiha. Normally, Erebus would dash full speed toward Hideki and go for the kill whilst the shunshin delay was activated, but this was a far. Instead, Erebus would remain stationary and smirk. "Ouch.~"* - Sat Oct  3 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a nod of understanding. "Ehh, you win technically. You the only one that got a hit in."* - Sat Oct  3 18:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Galahad(LadyofSpades) says: Let's begin. - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) walked into this tournament expecting to find some weak punk that couldn't take a hit. It was for that very exactly reason why Galahad caught Erebus off guard and possibly ended the fight before it was even started. Still, however, with his eyes fixated on the male before him, the Jashinist moved with haste. From the looks of things, Galahad's technique was moving faster than Erebus could even run; so the only thing left for Erebus to do was block the best way he can.

The main concern for Erebus was to protect his eyes and hearing, everything else he could muscle through. That being said, with the projectiles closing in, Erebus raised his arms and formed a single X before his face. The pain coming from the spikes were excruciated, something that Erebus has never felt a day in his life. A yell between thrill and agony is heard coming from Erebus as he stood his ground the best way can.* - Sat Oct  3 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: I wish...I could drop out. - Sat Oct  3 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || What was Erebus going to do? His muscles were being torn apart and his bones were child play to these spines. The most Erebus could do is continue to keep his guard up as much as he can. Whether or not he was subdued as a result to his defiance, he didn't care. In the name of Lord Jashin, thou shalt not submit to no mortal.* - Sat Oct  3 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's pride was stronger than these spikes. The will of Jashin lived on and quite frankly, no mortal was going to force the likes of Erebus to succumb to their wrath. The pain was unbearable, the speed was unmatched and the power was overwhelming. The spikes truly decimated Erebus. It is for that very same reason why Erebus stood tall, not caring for the outcome, nor caring for the eyes that panned over him as he slowly disintegrated into sheer nothingness. The view of these mortals mattered not to a loyal servant of Lord Jashin.

"I am Erebus! I am the loyal follower of my lord! No mortal shall allow to forfeit my the name given to me by Jashin himself! I will walk down the streets of this mortal realm with my head held high and Jashin's name rolling off my sacred tongue! You have beaten my mortal body, but the wrath of Jashin will rain down on you in due time!"

No more words were said; quietness. Erebus guard was eventually broken, the spikes proving to be stronger than the physical resistance that Erebus harbored; a feat that only one person, this person, could pull off. Despite all that, though, Erebus' existence simply stopped. There was no more smell of sake, or death, or blood, of marijuana. There was just.. nothing..* - Sat Oct  3 22:40:12 2015
