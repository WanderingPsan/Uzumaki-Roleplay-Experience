<br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm not doubting you, I'm just saying if you want to help them go a head. - Sun Nov  1 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: That's fine, but I know you have some genjutsu, so go and set it on him... - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Listen.. I have a mission to run to. I've been looking- - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yeah, no. Not my responsibility. - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Anyways. I've been looking about a house for you. - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's almost done and i need to make the final payments. - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So I'll be right back. - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Leaving me again, big surprise, huh. - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) plants a kiss on his little sisters forehead. "Love you too, Nina." He'd grab her and jump down from the building, gently placing her down before rushing off.* - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks in, several bottles of liquor in his grasp and a blunt between his lips. He sits himself down, placing the bottles on the seat next to him, away from Chi, and looks at her. "Alright, who goes first?"* - Sun Nov  1 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked at Chi, slowly shaking his head before taking his blunt out from between his lips and putting its flame out. "You better hope this doesn't spoil.. Anyways, truth."* - Sun Nov  1 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... What's your favourite thing about me? - Sun Nov  1 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Your innocence - Sun Nov  1 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This shinobi world haven't tainted you. - Sun Nov  1 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Really? Nice. - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Truth me. - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Truth or dare. - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ---- - Sun Nov  1 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is there anything you've done thus far that you regret? - Sun Nov  1 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Nothin' so far... I want to live my life in the positive. - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see. Very well. - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reached for one of the bottles of sake, opening it and taking a firm swig.* - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Truth me. - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Boobs or ass? - Sun Nov  1 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Tough decision. Boobs. - Sun Nov  1 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Dare me. - Sun Nov  1 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh. I dare you to try and do a handstand. - Sun Nov  1 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Naked.. - Sun Nov  1 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Dare - Sun Nov  1 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: I dare you to not have birds n' the bees for a whole week. - Sun Nov  1 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're the only person I've done it with and plan on doing it with, so alright. - Sun Nov  1 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) thinks: Oh..  - Sun Nov  1 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) thinks: I can't wait a week. - Sun Nov  1 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes another swig from the bottle of liquor, casually accepting the dare.. "Truth or dare."* - Sun Nov  1 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Dare. - Sun Nov  1 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his head eyes. "I'm getting tired of making this a innocent game, lets get into the real stuff." He leans forward, placing his left arm on the table at a ninety degree angle and takes a swig off his liquor with the use of his opposing hand. "I dare you to leave your shirt off."* - Sun Nov  1 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: .... - Sun Nov  1 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Touche. - Sun Nov  1 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Dare. - Sun Nov  1 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Lets get into ta' real stuff, take your robe off an' give it to me. - Sun Nov  1 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) complied, disrobing himself and handing it over to Chi. He grabs his bottle of liquor again and took a swig.* - Sun Nov  1 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Take off that thing. - Sun Nov  1 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) points to her sports bra.* - Sun Nov  1 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Dare. - Sun Nov  1 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: I dare you to take me with you when ya' leave... I want ta' help the Organization out. - Sun Nov  1 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright. Next time I leave on a organization mission, I'll take you with. - Sun Nov  1 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Sweet, dare me. - Sun Nov  1 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I dare you to take back the dare for no sex. I'm ready for some head. - Sun Nov  1 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Fine. I take back the dare for no sex. - Sun Nov  1 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, good. - Sun Nov  1 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Dare. - Sun Nov  1 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: I dare ya' to take off all your clothes. - Sun Nov  1 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet. He brings his hands to the tail of his shirt, pulling it over his head and revealing his toned body. He wasn't the Taijutsu type of person, but that didn't prevent him from harboring a six pack. His right arm, from the upper shoulder down to his wrist, was completely tattooed. Seeing as though this was the first time Chi had seen him without some form of bandages on his arms, this image would be new to her sight.

Ortho unbuckles his pants, pushing the clothing off and subtly kicking it under the table. From the looks of Ortho's body, one could tell that plenty of scars riddled his skin, some new and some old. When it came time for Ortho to strip off his boxers, he did it as casually as he would if he was getting ready to take a shower or as if he was only taking off his shirt. His member wasn't erect, not even half way. It was in the early stages of waking up, so as a result it was only five inches long.

Ortho finds his seat back, taking grasp of his liquor bottle and chugs a few gulps down. "Truth or dare."* - Sun Nov  1 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) appears on the roof once more, his arms folded across his chest and looking on.* - Sun Nov  1 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Did Nina ever join the battle? - Sun Nov  1 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down at Nina, whistling to get her attention. "Oi, Nina. Get up here."* - Sun Nov  1 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Why da' heck they still fighting that guy..? - Sun Nov  1 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Is he that strong? - Sun Nov  1 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: I told you. You never want to listen to me. - Sun Nov  1 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: There's so many of them though.. - Sun Nov  1 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Like it's one guy.. - Sun Nov  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: That looks rather unpleasent - Sun Nov  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Do you see him? - Sun Nov  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Yes, but still. - Sun Nov  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Yeah, I'm bored of this fight either way. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Did you even do that Genjutsu idea you had? - Sun Nov  1 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: No. I just left. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Ahh, good girl. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Found that girl you were talking to, and came back. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tries to lighten Nina's mood, playfully nudging her.* - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Ohh? Was she nice to you? - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: She didn't even talk. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: She said hello and went back to being dead or mute or something. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Sounds like her. Takes a lot for her to open up verbally. - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I was trying to convince her to train you, but so many people are asking the same thing of her that her schedule is swamped. - Sun Nov  1 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm going to reserve you private lessons though. - Sun Nov  1 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: If she ever talks or responds. - Sun Nov  1 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Like I said, kiddo. It takes a while for her to open up. She talks freely with me, but it'll be a few days before you get any initial response from her. - Sun Nov  1 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . .They still haven't beaten this guy? - Sun Nov  1 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: I can see that. - Sun Nov  1 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: Maybe I should put my first string in? - Sun Nov  1 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tell me what you've been up to, Nina. - Sun Nov  1 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Training. - Sun Nov  1 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I know you must hate me for being absent so much. - Sun Nov  1 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Yeah, well. - Sun Nov  1 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's demeanor shifted. Suddenly, he was more serious and stern with his words toward Nina. He wasn't trying to intimidate her, but to let her know that every word he whispered was true.* - Sun Nov  1 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I don't want you to feel abandoned, Nina. - Sun Nov  1 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm here for you, no matter what. - Sun Nov  1 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm trying my best to provide you with a safe place to live, to train.. - Sun Nov  1 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: To grow up. - Sun Nov  1 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: Yeah, I get it. Nice to have friends around, but I don't have that luxury. - Sun Nov  1 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) whispers: I grew up fast and friendless, hard to keep my kid side. - Sun Nov  1 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down, focusing his eyes on the roof he stood on top. Nina's words were painfully true, and he's the only one to blame. He vowed to not let their parents' deaths render Nina incapable of having a childhood, but in turn he was the main cause of her mentally being double the age of her numerical existence. Ortho slowly nodded his head, forcing himself to swallow the pill of truth.* - Sun Nov  1 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I hope one day you could forgive me, Nina. - Sun Nov  1 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can't go in the past and fill in the blanks where I should've been. - Sun Nov  1 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Nor am I making excuses, but I am truly.. sorry. - Sun Nov  1 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Should I follow after him?..  - Sun Nov  1 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Tch - Sun Nov  1 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What a load - Sun Nov  1 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Not even worth my time, someone else handle this joke - Sun Nov  1 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Desert Owl officials can handle the prisoners... Whose coming to hep capture the man> We'll need a plan. - Sun Nov  1 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not...Exactly. - Sun Nov  1 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Overpower him. - Sun Nov  1 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Overpower? - Sun Nov  1 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: He possesses power greater than most of us how? - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe I could lure him into a trap... All of that power.. but if.. I've got it. - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: One. - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Makoto are you going to jump back into the fight? - Sun Nov  1 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Who needs to rest and be healed? - Sun Nov  1 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Sup fams. - Sun Nov  1 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Sun Nov  1 07:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll ask again...If I don't get an answer you're all gonna need to go to the hospital - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I'll come. - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Who needs to rest and be tended to? - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: If everyone attack'd him during the phase he was trap'd for, he would have been dead. Two, you all could have keep the attack going constantly without rushing in then he would have fall under the pressure. - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Yes I can take care of you Koji - Sun Nov  1 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: Could try genjutsu maybe. - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Thank you, Bryson. Lord Hassan I'll need to restore my chakra a bit as well. - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I want to know everyone specifically. - Sun Nov  1 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I'm still fine. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So Koji and the short haired woman? - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head rose slightly, watching Nina spin. Her words hit home, but not in a manner that would devastate an already regretful male. Instead, she provided Ortho with enough hope that he could give his little sister the life he never had the opportunity to because of the family tragedy. In turn, one Nina darted off; Ortho would display a brief smile. That smile, however, faded just as fast as it was formed. The curling of the left corner of his lips replaced the smile as the blunt in between his lips stiffened and noticeably shrunk a bit. Excess smoke seeped from Ortho's nostrils as he followed Nina in close pursuit.* - Sun Nov  1 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I assume Ai as well. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes sir, nothing I can't manage through, but it'll be best to go fu power. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: . . . . . - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sanoke, Jiki can you two fight? - Sun Nov  1 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hm. - Sun Nov  1 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? - Sun Nov  1 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) scans the area, attempting to find the reason why Nina led him here.* - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So uhh.. - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This a common place you hand out at or something? - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: This is the most common place when I'm alone. - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck, wrong question. - Sun Nov  1 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Sun Nov  1 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Which is effectively a lot. - Sun Nov  1 07:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's fists clenched and tightened. His anger was boiling and at this rate there was no cooling down. Ortho's pupils shrunk in size as he looked at Nina and listened to what she had to so. Still, in the back of Ortho's mind, he knew that he possibly had no right to be mad. He was barely around and Nina was probably desperately looking for a friend, even if this bastard Index took it to the next level. "Does.. he make you happy, Nina..? Like, happiness that fills that missing piece?"* - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || What was Ortho supposed to say? That she couldn't be friends with Index? He was just going to take up the bad-guy role in this situation and quite frankly, he knew if he was to mend things with Nina that he couldn't afford that. Still, he was willing to go in debt just to assure that she wouldn't get hurt. Ortho understood where she was coming from, and all this was indeed his fault for not being around, but for Index to make such a promise and use it to begin the process of getting what he wanted.. that was foul.

"Nothing, nothing." Ortho's voice cracked a bit, a gear shifting between the tone of sheer anger and fake mellowness. His fists remained clenched, but not as tight as before. He slowly shook his head before putting on a painfully obvious fake smile. "Do you know who his girlfriend is?"

I'm labeled as a bad boy for Marrisa, and I know I'd die for her just like I'd die for you. This is about me knowing what Index is about when it comes to girls. Friends are fine, but anything more I don't agree with. The kissing, the potential touching, friends don't do that..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Ortho. - Sun Nov  1 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah.. - Sun Nov  1 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I was wondering. - Sun Nov  1 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You say you've formed a contract with a snake called Manda? - Sun Nov  1 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I was granted his permission to summon him, yes. The contract was for snakes in general. - Sun Nov  1 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Would you mind summoning him now? I'd like to request his permission as well. - Sun Nov  1 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brings his right thumb to his mouth, biting down on the skin. As blood trickled from the wound, he'd smear the crimson liquid within his opposing palm before forming a series of handseals. Upon their completion, he'd crouch down to slam the smeared hand into the sand.

Within a moment's notice, a massive puff of smoke is spawned. Behind the shroud of smoke was Manda himself. Most of his body was coiled around itself with his head raised. From the looks of things, he was just relaxing.

"What the hell do you want now, Ortho? Someone fucking with you again? Who is it?" Manda's voice boomed through the area once he realized where he was.

"Relax, someone wanted to talk to you." Ortho replied calmly, his usual attempt to ease down Manda. He'd point to Index and gave him that "hurry up and talk before he gets even more mad" look.

Manda: "Ortho, you summon me here because someone wants to use me like I'm some piece of a chessboard game? I should eat you both!"

Ortho folds his arms across his chest, slowly shaking his head as Manda spoke. He rolls his eyes, but made sure Manda didn't see. Ortho and Manda were close, but he had too much respect for Manda to make him see such a act.

Manda's eyes poise on Index. Just like any other snake, his true sense of sight was on the tips of his tongue. As his tongue slithered out of his mouth and fidgets a few times before retreating into mouth again, Manda lowers his head in front of Index.

Manda: "You must be close to Ortho is he deemed it okay to summon me for your sake. The late Hideki was known throughout the Ryuchi cave, but that didn't mean him and I were on good terms. Still, however, tell me your worth.. Why should I assist 'you' in battle?"* - Sun Nov  1 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

Manda: "You speak with arrogance, but not in the manner where it is deemed disrespect."

Manda's tongue slithers out his mouth once more, flicking before retreating.

Manda: "Index is it? Do you possess the same mindset as Ortho? The same views of your Shinobi World? Or even the same morals?"* - Sun Nov  1 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

Manda's head rises from the ground, his tongue slithers out of his mouth once more. Upon its retreat, Manda would release a loud, obnoxious, yawn.

Manda: "Alright, kid. You got it. Just like Ortho, you think on your own and not compare your life to someone else's. You're independent. You can summon me in battle. But I forewarn you, if you do so when I am attending to my wife and kids, quickly summon me far away.. My wife is worse than me.." With that, Manda poofs away.

"..That was.. Yeah.." Ortho slowly shook his head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) listened to what Nina had to say. He didn't overthink it, nor did he underthink it. What Nina felt is what she felt, and in turn he wasn't going to dare reject her feelings. "Me not being around during your childhood is something I vowed to not do. I.. don't expect you open up to me as if I've.. always been there, nor do I want you to feel like you're obligated to open up now that I'm trying to be here."

Ortho leans forward slightly, allowing his arms to rest on the table and his eyes to wander down to his palms. "I was so focused on planning for your future, that I missed out on the 'then' and most of the 'now'. I don't know the pain you must feel to think that you only have one friend throughout your twelve years of living, but damn it Nina.. I'm terribly sorry I wasn't there.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) settles himself at the base of the waterfall, allowing the water to crash on his body. His legs fold over one another as his palms clamped together and his fingers intertwine. His eyes slowly close; allowing him to escape from this shinobi world and retreat into his mind.

"Well look who it is." Ortho's eyes snapped open. Before him was a familiar figure. Long hair, tanned skin and black clothing. The familiarities of the voice rang through his ears, forcing him to stumble on words. "W-What.. Hid-.." Ortho makes it to his feet, using his eyes to pan over the general area. From what he saw, he was still by the waterfall. The only difference was, Nina was absent and in her place was Hideki.

"Look at you, Ortho. I like the new look, reminds me of a young.. me, haha." Hideki's voice sounded, causing Ortho to stagger forward. After taking two steps, he quickly caught himself from moving and pacing back to his original spot. "H-How.. Why-.." Ortho's voice crackles, causing Hideki to chuckle. "I know what you're trying to do, Ortho. I've come to help you. I knew the day would eventually come where it's your turn to unlock our clan right, so here I am."

Ortho slowly shook his head, disbelieving that this was truly happening. He takes in a deep breath, slowly exhaling. "I've been watching you, Ortho. You and I both know that you've been doing all you felt that you can do to protect the ones you love the most. But you and I both also know that in turn, you have gathered a major flaw. Nina is your little sister. Everything you've done is to assure her safety. And because of that, you weren't around as much as she'd like you to be." Hideki's words stung Ortho deep, and immediately he put his guard up. His arms folded across his chest and he looked away, kissing his teeth. "I don't know what you're talking about. I should've been there."

Hideki sighed, raising his arm and points to the area behind Ortho. In response, Ortho would turn to see what was behind him. To his amazement, it was a image of Nina sitting by herself in Sunagakure's village square. Ortho looks away, not wanting to see this. "Ortho, look." Hideki's voice was stern and demanding, and out of respect Ortho complied. He saw a group of kids around Nina's age playing together. Their older siblings joining on the fun as she sat on a bench and watched. Tears swelled in her eyes and she hangs her head low.

"I thought.. this was supposed to help me, Hideki.. I know I'm fucking stupid, I know I'm a lousy brother, I know.." Ortho looks away again, tears flowing down his cheeks. Hideki places a hand on Ortho's shoulder before pointing once more. Ortho takes a look. This time around, it was him on the battle field a few miles off of Sunagakure's coast. He was unleashing technique after technique on the enemies. Ortho's eyebrows rose, seeing the two differences. On one end, despite Nina feeling lonely, Ortho was one of the military shinobi on the front lines keeping her safe and sound. He, within himself, knew that was exactly what he was trying to accomplish.. but the flaw that he couldn't be there for Nina was tearing him up on the inside.

"You see that, Ortho? Nina wouldn't be able to sit there with her life if you wasn't there risking yours. Yes, you weren't able to be there for her, but look at it Ortho." Hideki's tone was released in a 'see? I told you so' manner. Ortho's eyes continued to watch the scenery. He sees him and his squad of Sunagakure shinobi laying waste to the remaining enemies and heading back home. There, he is met by a angry Nina that doesn't know what he's doing when he's away. Then, he sees himself digging into his pockets and taking out his pay from the mission and handing it to her. In turn, she's able to buy a few toys, her favorite food, hang out with her one and only friend, and keep a roof over her head. In the other hand, Ortho is going to an abandoned house to wash up and prepare for his next mission.

The mere sight of Nina being able to stay alive due to his efforts warmed his heart. A smile creeps on his face as he continued to watch. Within him, despite knowing that him not being there when Nina wished he were was a flaw, but he accepted it. He knew in the end, Nina will be happy. He knew once he finished what he had to do, he'd be able to be there for his little sister and help her through her struggles as a teenage girl and shinobi. "..I get it.." Ortho's voice cracks again, but instead of tears of regret, it was a smile of peace.

Ortho's goal was to protect Nina at all cost, even if he was looked at as the bad guy for not being there at a moment's notice. That knowledge always put Ortho in an angry mood, resulting in him lashing out on people and making rash decisions. This, however, this realization allowed him to be at ease. It allowed him to think rationally about certain things and allowed him to let go of that tight feeling in his heart. It put his mind at rest, and in turn it allowed him to simply put.. be at peace.

He takes in a slow, deep, breath. He looks over at Hideki, giving him a smirk. "Ortho, you're a shinobi and a older brother. Your duties of both cannot co-exist. You can do one at a time, and one always leads to the better of the other. If you try to mix them, you'll end up killing off yourself and your loved ones mentally and emotionally." Hideki's words didn't fall on deaf ears. Ortho nods his head in understanding.

"Y-You're right. I accept her anger and I accept that I can't be there at whim. My goal.. is to do what I must as a shinobi to protect her. I 'will' continue to do that, no matter what." Ortho's voice showed confidence and pride. Peace and sanguinity was apparent in his tone. He looks away for only a brief second, closing his eyes and taking in a deep breath. As he released it, he opens his lids and looks back in Hideki's direction. By time he did that, Hideki was gone.

Ortho, in reality, exits out of his meditation. A smile was already plastered on his face and his usual on-edge demeanor was gone and replaced with the look of peace and determination. He stands to his feet and walks to the shore. It was time he got back to accomplishing his goals.* - Mon Nov  2 04:48:25 2015

"It is merely casual conversation I sought. Maybe even business to help fund the village as much as I could. That, Lady Kirie, can be discussed at a later date if you wish." Ortho was going to reply to Jirun's comment of him bugging the Mizukage, but Ortho didn't find the male to be all that relevant anymore. Instead, Ortho bowed his head toward Kirie before pacing off to the side and stand by himself.* - Mon Nov  2 14:41:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) settles himself at the base of the waterfall, allowing the water to crash on his body. His legs fold over one another as his palms clamped together and his fingers intertwine. His eyes slowly close; allowing him to escape from this shinobi world and retreat into his mind.

"Well look who it is." Ortho's eyes snapped open. Before him was a familiar figure. Long hair, tanned skin and black clothing. The familiarities of the voice rang through his ears, forcing him to stumble on words. "W-What.. Hid-.." Ortho makes it to his feet, using his eyes to pan over the general area. From what he saw, he was still by the waterfall. The only difference was, Nina was absent and in her place was Hideki.

"Look at you, Ortho. I like the new look, reminds me of a young.. me, haha." Hideki's voice sounded, causing Ortho to stagger forward. After taking two steps, he quickly caught himself from moving and pacing back to his original spot. "H-How.. Why-.." Ortho's voice crackles, causing Hideki to chuckle. "I know what you're trying to do, Ortho. I've come to help you. I knew the day would eventually come where it's your turn to unlock our clan right, so here I am."

Ortho slowly shook his head, disbelieving that this was truly happening. He takes in a deep breath, slowly exhaling. "I've been watching you, Ortho. You and I both know that you've been doing all you felt that you can do to protect the ones you love the most. But you and I both also know that in turn, you have gathered a major flaw. Nina is your little sister. Everything you've done is to assure her safety. And because of that, you weren't around as much as she'd like you to be." Hideki's words stung Ortho deep, and immediately he put his guard up. His arms folded across his chest and he looked away, kissing his teeth. "I don't know what you're talking about. I should've been there."

Hideki sighed, raising his arm and points to the area behind Ortho. In response, Ortho would turn to see what was behind him. To his amazement, it was a image of Nina sitting by herself in Sunagakure's village square. Ortho looks away, not wanting to see this. "Ortho, look." Hideki's voice was stern and demanding, and out of respect Ortho complied. He saw a group of kids around Nina's age playing together. Their older siblings joining on the fun as she sat on a bench and watched. Tears swelled in her eyes and she hangs her head low.

"I thought.. this was supposed to help me, Hideki.. I know I'm fucking stupid, I know I'm a lousy brother, I know.." Ortho looks away again, tears flowing down his cheeks. Hideki places a hand on Ortho's shoulder before pointing once more. Ortho takes a look. This time around, it was him on the battle field a few miles off of Sunagakure's coast. He was unleashing technique after technique on the enemies. Ortho's eyebrows rose, seeing the two differences. On one end, despite Nina feeling lonely, Ortho was one of the military shinobi on the front lines keeping her safe and sound. He, within himself, knew that was exactly what he was trying to accomplish.. but the flaw that he couldn't be there for Nina was tearing him up on the inside.

"You see that, Ortho? Nina wouldn't be able to sit there with her life if you wasn't there risking yours. Yes, you weren't able to be there for her, but look at it Ortho." Hideki's tone was released in a 'see? I told you so' manner. Ortho's eyes continued to watch the scenery. He sees him and his squad of Sunagakure shinobi laying waste to the remaining enemies and heading back home. There, he is met by a angry Nina that doesn't know what he's doing when he's away. Then, he sees himself digging into his pockets and taking out his pay from the mission and handing it to her. In turn, she's able to buy a few toys, her favorite food, hang out with her one and only friend, and keep a roof over her head. In the other hand, Ortho is going to an abandoned house to wash up and prepare for his next mission.

The mere sight of Nina being able to stay alive due to his efforts warmed his heart. A smile creeps on his face as he continued to watch. Within him, despite knowing that him not being there when Nina wished he were was a flaw, but he accepted it. He knew in the end, Nina will be happy. He knew once he finished what he had to do, he'd be able to be there for his little sister and help her through her struggles as a teenage girl and shinobi. "..I get it.." Ortho's voice cracks again, but instead of tears of regret, it was a smile of peace.

Ortho's goal was to protect Nina at all cost, even if he was looked at as the bad guy for not being there at a moment's notice. That knowledge always put Ortho in an angry mood, resulting in him lashing out on people and making rash decisions. This, however, this realization allowed him to be at ease. It allowed him to think rationally about certain things and allowed him to let go of that tight feeling in his heart. It put his mind at rest, and in turn it allowed him to simply put.. be at peace.

He takes in a slow, deep, breath. He looks over at Hideki, giving him a smirk. "Ortho, you're a shinobi and a older brother. Your duties of both cannot co-exist. You can do one at a time, and one always leads to the better of the other. If you try to mix them, you'll end up killing off yourself and your loved ones mentally and emotionally." Hideki's words didn't fall on deaf ears. Ortho nods his head in understanding.

"Y-You're right. I accept her anger and I accept that I can't be there at whim. My goal.. is to do what I must as a shinobi to protect her. I 'will' continue to do that, no matter what." Ortho's voice showed confidence and pride. Peace and sanguinity was apparent in his tone. He looks away for only a brief second, closing his eyes and taking in a deep breath. As he released it, he opens his lids and looks back in Hideki's direction. The male stood there, nodding his head with a smirk.

"Not only that, Ortho. You must not let the views of others tear you down. You must stay true to yourself and stay on the path 'you' set for yourself. You have no control over other people, so just accept who you are and walk your path." Hideki's words caught Ortho off guard, but in turn he began slowly shaking his head. "..I.. am Ortho.. I defend my loved ones and I walk the path of ending peace.." Ortho's heart begins to race as he said this to himself. "My goal is to see the smile on my family and friends' faces, see to it that they're happy. I accept my place.. I accept my place as their protector.." Ortho took in a slow, deep, breath and momentarily closed his eyes. He allowed this thinking process to sink in deep, allowing himself to sincerely believe the words he spoke. In the end, once he knew for sure he did, he opens his eyes to look at Hideki. He was gone.

Ortho, in reality, exits out of his meditation. A smile was already plastered on his face and his usual on-edge demeanor was gone and replaced with the look of peace and determination. He stands to his feet and walks to the shore. It was time he got back to accomplishing his goals.* - Mon Nov  2 18:08:51 2015
