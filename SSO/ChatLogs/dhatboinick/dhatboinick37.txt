<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || What will did he have left to walk? What will did he have to even respond to Nina's words? Were they even true? Or were they just words meant for him to pick himself off and continue this life of a shinobi?

Ortho remained on the ground. His head was raised and his eyes were fixated on the sky, the same two words were being murmured; "my.. fault.." It honestly felt like whatever 'mind' Ortho had was completely gone, replaced with those two words. It was as if he was attempting to remind himself every time he tried to find some way out of his emotions that this was indeed his fault.

Meanwhile, Index vanishes behind a puff of smoke. It's all Ortho's fault, but the person to perform the jutsu vanishes. The person that declared relationship, on any manner, with Ume was gone. Ortho simply remained on the ground, continuing his murmuring.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. He makes it to his feet and limps drags his way to the corpse. "I need.. alone time.." He crouches down, takes a gentle hold over the body and continues southward. It was time.. he buried the body.* - Sat Nov  7 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stares Nina in the eyes; his expression and the emptiness in his eyes proved that he was void from all emotion. Harsh words, love, pain, none of it mattered at this point. He nods his head in response to what Nina had to say, not knowing what else he had better to do. If it was up to him, he'd become a monk or something and meditate for the rest of his life. "Alight.. then."

Once he was released and fixed back up clothing wise, he'd continue to maneuver to the corpse and take hold of it. If allowed, he'd pick it up and throw it over his should then carry it off.* - Sat Nov  7 04:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: . - Sat Nov  7 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the body down and takes a seat next to it. He glances at it a few times before setting his gaze on the sky. His mind wanders, an attempt to recollect his memory and depict which action he made that was deemed 'too late to fix'. Which action he took that made Ume's death, real or not, hurt so much. Probably it was the fact he vowed to her that she would never have to put herself in the situation where she is the sacrificial piece, now look. An audible sigh comes from Ortho as his emotionless and empty gaze remain fixated on the skies above. 

Owari's touch startled Ortho; he jumps and glances back down at the body. He didn't know why it surprised him, but it did. A look of momentary happiness and serenity comes over him, but was soon vanquished with guilt and regret. "I'm.. sorry."* - Sat Nov  7 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) felt his heart warm up a bit at Owari's smile. He looks away and lowers his head a bit. "With me? In what sense? Most I have now is you, myself and Nina.. Even then I know Nina only wants me to look after he-.. I failed you.." Midway through his sentence, he cuts himself off and turns his head to glance back at her.* - Sat Nov  7 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) alters his posture. He transitions from sitting on his knees to stretching out his legs and sitting on his bottom. His right leg bends at the knee, placing the soles of his foot flat on the ground. He turns to the side a bit, placing his right arm atop his right knee and using his left arm, with his left palm planted firmly on the ground, as leverage to his upper body. Ortho sets his gaze on Owari, contemplating her words. He knew that he took major part in her 'death', and it's for that reason why he may never shake the feeling and thought that he failed her.

When it came to the question, Ortho slowly shook his head. "Keep your.. death.. as is. Informing her of your abilities will lead to leakage of information in the heat of battle."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. "Yes, that is fine. What do you wish to be called?" As he spoke, he'd dig through his many backpouches for his spare headband.* - Sat Nov  7 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Beginning.. of the End.." Ortho nods his head, looking away in the process. "Alright, that works."* - Sat Nov  7 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) made an honest attempt to return the smile and laughter, but it soon faded from existence. "I'll.. take your word for it.."* - Sat Nov  7 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Heh.... can we... go then? I am tired of the ground for a bed. - Sat Nov  7 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. As he makes it to his feet, he'd carefully hook one arm behind her knee and placed the other behind her back. Ortho paced himself toward the house, making sure to take careful steps to not inflict any pain to Owari-. Okay, he knew she couldn't feel pain, but still.* - Sat Nov  7 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: kk ziare u did at least 10 RPies using the parent jutsu, yes? - Sat Nov  7 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) made his way toward the massive house. He carried not a bag or new puppy home, but a full grown person in his arms. From the looks of things, he carried her as if she was the bride and he was the husband; minus the white dress, the tuxedo and the intense need for a honeymoon.* - Sat Nov  7 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ortho, what did I tell you about picking up girls? You better have a condom this time! - Sat Nov  7 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't know why Nina decided to throw a katana at him when he had someone in his arms, but the most he could do was step to the side to evade it. He slowly shook his head, granting her with an empty and emotionless glare. "Hello, Paine." Ortho's tone was as empty as the look in his eyes, showing that recent events truly did a number on him. He paces toward the house and headed inside, intent on finding this woman some place to rest.* - Sat Nov  7 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to pace himself into the house, gently shushing the female in his arms.* - Sat Nov  7 05:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Her name is Paine. I met her a few weeks ago. She's supposed to be helping Nina enhance her Taijutsu. - Sat Nov  7 05:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: No, I intentionally jumped in front of the attack....to weaken it for you. - Sat Nov  7 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And I knew my death...would make Index stop. - Sat Nov  7 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained silent for a while, not knowing how to reply to that without giving it thought. Was it not, in turn, his fault what Owari jumped in front of the attack..? To aid him in not getting hurt, she risked her life? He slowly shakes his head and released a sigh.* - Sat Nov  7 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Did you really think I was dead? - Sat Nov  7 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes.. and no. I knew you can't die, but that doesn't mean I take joy in seeing your lifeless body.. - Sat Nov  7 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: If you knew I was going to come back...why....did you look the way you did. - Sat Nov  7 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..My flower.. drained of life is the last thing.. I want to see.. - Sat Nov  7 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Your death, mimicked or not, is something.. I don't want to witness or accept.. - Sat Nov  7 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You probably will see it again some day....for now... I'll be safe....I don't.... I don't want to see you like that again. - Sat Nov  7 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inched forward, taking a set next to Owari. He reaches forth and places a gentle palm on her cheek. A look of honest, and sincere, love managed to plaster itself on his face as he gaze at Owari. "Look where you lay as a result of you protecting me, yet you worry about my peace of mind. Why are you so determined to walk this path with me..?"* - Sat Nov  7 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's look of love remained on his face. "You are free to walk away as you feel, Owari. Your presence is welcomed, and always will, but I have no control over you.."* - Sat Nov  7 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's look of love remained on his face. "You are free to walk away as you feel, Owari. Your presence is welcomed, and always will, but I have no control over you.."* - Sat Nov  7 06:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was a bit confused, and that was apparent on his visage. "You.. felt.. something?"* - Sat Nov  7 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) whispers: And then...when Index killed me.... disappointment... he saw it...he saw it on my face. - Sat Nov  7 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans forward and plants a kiss on Owari's forehead. "I was torn to shreds at your.. 'death'. But it wasn't completely bad.. A new obstacle has displayed itself.. I should've seen it sooner, and not at the cost of your life, but I will.. 'avenge' you.."* - Sat Nov  7 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "The level of hatred between he and I is unmatched. Our battle is a feat deemed inevitable. It's for that reason why I may have to pick back up on my training, something I haven't done in many months now."

Ortho turns head to the side. He alters his positioning once again, duplicated the semi-relaxed posture from when Owari was first resurrected from the dead. His legs out stretched, one leg propped up by a bent knee and a arm resting on that raised knee. A sigh escapes Ortho as the thought of another battle with Index surge through his mind.

"It's not something that I exactly seek out, but something I know has to happen. It's either that, or we both continue to live in this false reality that we are more than just sibling students.."* - Sat Nov  7 06:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. 

"Explaining why is hard, but explaining what led up to the fight is easy. Simply put: he chose pussy of his brother. He believes I don't see how he operates. He is not as sly as he think he is. He plays little 'games' with females, get them to play by the rules of the game for his own pleasure. He, however, doesn't know how to keep a game just that; a game. The one known as Lera is who he has deemed 'next' on his vagina conquest. When I deemed her 'next' on my to kill list, without knowing beforehand of his intentions, he considered it betrayal.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes. The mention of Katsune and love within the same sentence could make him hurl if he was merely a normal man that knew not of the life of a shinobi. Once again Ortho shook his head, a bit faster than the last time.

"No game should be played with another when love is involved with a spouse. Index is aware of what he does and that he may suffer dire consequences, but his lust, rather than love, clouds his mind. If he truly loved Katsune, then no 'game' would exist. I know firsthand, from seeing his games back when we both lived in Kirigakure, what he is capable of when lust takes over. It's pitiful. Love is more than sexual-.. pre-fertilization, needs."* - Sat Nov  7 07:13:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's expression sulked a bit as he nodded in response to Owari. "..Forgive.. me."* - Sat Nov  7 07:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) understood what Owari was saying. No matter what beef he had with Index, he wasn't going to deprive her of being friends with anyone. Up until their next battle, Ortho would take a step back and allow Owari to do as she please with Index. "Talk with him not for my sake, but for your own. The bond between him and is broken beyond repair, but maybe the crack in your bond with him can be sealed before it's too late."* - Sat Nov  7 07:27:34 2015

He was sorry for what he did as much as you were.... we were getting along...but I don't know what changed...one of my questions pushed it maybe... - Sat Nov  7 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glances at Owari, saying nothing to her for a good minute. Once he finally opened his mouth to speak, his tone shifted.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It would've been apparent by now that Ortho lacked any form of emotions. It also would've been more apparent that there was an empty look in his eyes, rather than the usual determination that he was known for. His posture wasn't nonchalant anymore, but drag-like. He wasn't exactly slouching, but it can be told that there was no longer any form of will in the steps he took.

Ortho makes his way into the shop. He stops at the table/counter and signals for the chef to come over. "No meal, just some sake. Give me three bottles of the strongest you got.." He digs into his pockets, takes out a wad of cash. From the looks of the amount, it was clear he was overpaying the chef. "Keep the change," he says as he grabs the head of the bottles between his fingers and paced back out the shop. "It means you thought on your feet," he continues with the conversation he was having with Owari.* - Sun Nov  8 00:40:06 2015

He reached for one of his bottle of sakes and uncocked it. He takes a few gulps of it, pacing himself closer toward the body of water. Each step her took he squirmed out of his own clothing, making sure not to drop his bottle. By time he reached Owari's side, he too was naked.* - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) examined Owari's body, no hint of modesty as his eyes groped her frame. Her usual milk-like skin transitioned well into the vibrant tone it is now; a sly smirk forms on his face in liking of what he saw. He takes a few more gulps of his sake before throwing the bottle behind him; thankfully he didn't hit the other two bottles that was by the lakes' bank. "Then I'll die in a fit of lust and pleasure." Ortho supplies her with a thicker smirk, one that'll greet her before the episode in Kirigakure between Index and him. He enters the body of water and reaches for Owari's frame, attempting to grasp her by the waist.* - Sun Nov  8 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans forward, gently planting his lips on Owari's check. "My hopes are harbored in you, my dreams are here in reality.. firmly tucked in my arms at this very moment and my goals feel accomplished with you by my side," he says in a mellow tone. Each word he spoke sounded like he meant it, his beliefs backing each syllable.* - Sun Nov  8 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) trails his kisses down her neck, stopping just above her shoulder before inching back up. "I do. At this point.. what ideals I have for politically destroying the Gezo is filler compared to what ideals I have for you."* - Sun Nov  8 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) cups Owari's cheeks, gently squeezing and groping them. His kisses trail back up her neck after reaching her chest, but above her breasts. Once reaching her face, he'd lean forward a bit more and place his forehead against hers, glaring his eyes into hers. "And I take it you feel nothing right now?"* - Sun Nov  8 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued his glare, contemplating his next moves. Should he halt or continue on his current path of lust? "You'd submit to the will of my lust..? With no rebuttal?"* - Sun Nov  8 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes Owari by the thighs and lifts her, wrapping her legs around him. "Because you the ability to say yes as much; as you have the ability to say no." By this point it was obvious that his member held no shame in erecting. With her now wrapped around his body, the head grazes over her mound; only requiring a thrust to enter. He keeps his eyes fixated on Owari's, waiting for her honest answer.* - Sun Nov  8 03:35:53 2015

Ortho replies in a hushed tone, seduction apparent in each word. His hips inch forward slightly, causing the head of his member to push into Owari. Both his hands meet her bottom once again, subtly applying pressure to her own hips on his cock.* - Sun Nov  8 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That feels strange, he's inside of me. - Sun Nov  8 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || More pressure is applied to Owari's hips as Ortho's continues to inch forward. His length slowly being consumed by her as his eyes momentarily shut. A look of lust and, strangely enough, peace cast over his visage; blocking out all signs of regret, guilt and sadness that painted itself days before.* - Sun Nov  8 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had finally been completely taken in by Owari. His eyes all but opened for a second, just to shut once again at the meeting of his lips against hers. Ortho's hips swayed back and forth, allowing his cock to pump in and out of her.* - Sun Nov  8 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) is a man of current lust, but that didn't mean restraint no longer hold shape in his actions. His hips slowed as the push and pull of her hips followed tempo. This turned into a event of releasing one desires, to a possible love-making minus the mutual feeling of love. Ortho breaks the lock between his lips and Owari's, trailing them down her neck once more. "I.. remember you.. questioning the act.. of pre-fertilization .. from.. a human's.. perspective.."* - Sun Nov  8 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "It is a moment.. used often.. for the.. wrong reason.. But.. this moment.. is.." Ortho slips out of Owari. He grips her thighs and wraps them. In a swift movement, he turn her around. With her back now to him, he'd line his head with her entrance from behind. "..is one I will remember even in death.."* - Sun Nov  8 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls Owari close, squeezing her breasts a bit tighter. Thrust after thrust was made until eventually the golden point of this was being reached. He takes in a deep breath and his length twitched inside her. A seductive groan is released with the air he took in. He hips swayed slower and slower until one push was given; he had reached and released.* - Sun Nov  8 05:09:45 2015
