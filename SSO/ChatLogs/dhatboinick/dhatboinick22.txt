<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Awe couldn't describe what Ortho was experiencing. Hideki's eyes told more than just story. It told the fear, the pain and the unknowingness that all allied themselves with the presence of the Shukaku. The fear of knowing that at any given moment his and his friends' lives could end. The pain he felt from knowing that he and his friends were too weak to do anything other than run. The unknowing of whether or not he would even be able to save his friends or himself from this massive beat.

Ortho remained stationary throughout the entire scene; his eyes staring off into the distance as his mind explored Hideki's memories. At the most, when Ortho snapped back into reality, all he could do was stare at Hideki and wonder how suicide hasn't been contemplated yet. If it had, Hideki had a skill for not showing it. Ortho couldn't really say much toward Hideki, but a nod of understanding was given.* - Thu Oct 15 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyebrows rose at Hideki's words. Could Ortho truly awaken these eyes..? Did he even have what it takes..? Ortho barely had a arsenal of Ninjutsu to work with, how would be become strong enough to unlock such an ocular jutsu like Hideki's..?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sat himself down and looks down at the table. He really didn't have anything to say, at this point.* - Thu Oct 15 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised his head slightly and looked at Marrisa. Who would've thought that their brief discussion would lead to some realization within her? A slight smile formed on his face as he glances over at Fujitora. After a moment or two of looking between them two, Ortho would look back down a the table.* - Thu Oct 15 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I already know what Beth and Zenaki are up to right now..*sigh*  What is life?... - Thu Oct 15 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: When Kastya died...They only cared about what happend to the bijuu....When I nearly died..They only cared about my functioning as a shinobi...When I've  lead them to safety, they only followed because of my power.... I care little for shinobi now..My resolve is around my clan and those dear.. - Thu Oct 15 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's gaze shifted once more. His understanding of what was going on was fine tuned, but he still felt out of place. He was looked at as someone who managed to pull Marrisa out of her era of anger and drag her back to her senses, but he was pretty much of a hypocrite. He was able to do that for her, but not for himself.. Ortho still had anger, he still had hate and he still had revenge on his mind. Ortho was lost within the pit of darkness with the dimmest of light in his light. Despite that, however, he just wasn't capable of traveling fast enough, or even effecient enough, to catch that light. 

A sigh escaped from Ortho as he looked at Fujitora. "I've decided to back out of your teachings. Knowing that any form of burden has been placed on you makes me not want to add to that, not to my mention my little sister feels as though I'm trying to steal you away from her. I move with the wind while casting a protective shadow over the ones I love, no matter how strong their own wind is compared to mine. Nina doesn't want me to learn from you, then I'll hustle to learn by myself. As for Marrisa.. she's simply.. Light.."* - Thu Oct 15 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Just don't tell her about the teachings."

Those words echoed throughout Ortho's mind. Why though..? Was it the fact that Fujitora posed a very sensible solution? Or was it the fact that Ortho knew that adding another lie on to the major one for Nina's wellbeing dawned on him. Was it his conscious alerting him that this was a bad idea, or was was it his conscious alerting him that this was a good idea?

For the remainder of their discussion, Ortho stayed quiet. His eyes fixed back on the wooden table while slowly taking in a hit from his blunt, exhaling the smoke through his nose.

"Just don't tell her about the teachings."* - Thu Oct 15 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) strolls up. His cloak masking his slender and nonchalant frame. He takes a hit off of his blunt and slowly exhales the steam through his nose.

"You called?"* - Sat Oct 24 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised his arms, preparing to catch and grip Marrisa. Sadly, however, just as he managed to wrap his limbs around the female they went slack. His eyes slightly widened and, by the expression on his face, Ortho's heart instantly shattered. It took him a moment to merely gather his mind and another to make a verbal response.

"..R-Right.. Uhh, nice.. to see you too." Ortho's voice was cracking due to the bombardment of emotions. His head turns slightly as he attempted to subtly pull away from Marrisa. "Of.. course.. Happiness is never handed to me as easily as it's handed to other people," thought Ortho.* - Sat Oct 24 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) listened to Marrisa had to say. He could understand where Marrisa was coming from, but at the same time he knew the feeling he had within him. His expression went from hurt to nonexistent. There was no longer a point in showing emotions to Marrisa, or anyone in that matter; she was the last person Ortho could look to in an attempt to escape the forsakened world, now that is all done. Despite Marrisa having her arms wrapped around Ortho, the male kept his own appendages slacked to his sides.

"It's fine, Marrisa. No big deal." The tone in Ortho's voice was cold. Anger was more than clear and any form of sympathy was nowhere to be heard. Ortho was simply.. done.* - Sat Oct 24 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath and audibly exhaled. The feeling he had for Marrisa didn't waver, but the situation at hand angered him to endless depths. He provided a mere nod of his head and fixed his eyes on the female.

"You did what you felt you had to do. Nothing I can say or do about it. You're your own person anyways, Marrisa." Ortho gave a nonchalant shrug, but the expression of his face altered once more and forced itself to be its own lie detector. It was obvious that Ortho was hurting on the inside and simply tried to hold that in.
* - Sat Oct 24 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, attempting to assure Marrisa that no animosity was being held toward her. In all honesty, Ortho should've been around more. Hell, if anything, he shouldn't have gone missing to self-meditate. He was obviously the reason why Marrisa deemed it crucial to show that form of affection to another guy --- or so Ortho thought.

"As I said, Marrisa, it's fine. You did what you felt you had to do and say, nothing I can say or do about that."* - Sat Oct 24 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked around awkwardly before side stepping Marrisa. "I'm uhh, going for a swim.. You coming or do you have something to attend to?"* - Sat Oct 24 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) disrobed as well, allowing himself to only bear his boxers. He subtly strides into the body of water, keeping a personal space distance away from Marrisa. He, himself, didn't know she was physically comfortable as of yet.* - Sat Oct 24 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So. . I think. . Hideki is dead. . I haven't seen him in a very long time. .  - Sat Oct 24 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, after telling Fujitora I couldn't be under his teachings I went off to study on my own. - Sat Oct 24 05:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, sure. - Sat Oct 24 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls himself to shore, trying his best not to visually grope the female before him.

"Uhh, ready."* - Sat Oct 24 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's intellect was fine tuned. Not to toot his own horn, but walking into that training session wasn't much of a big deal to him. Still, however, he wasn't a magician with the jutsu's he learned. That being said, after kneading his chakra and allowing a string of handseals to be strung, Ortho would clamp his hands together. Unlike Marrisa's version, Ortho merely released a small gust of wind similar to that of a mere exhale. 

A grunt of annoyance came from Ortho as he took in a slow breath and refocuses. He, afterwards, tied his hands together in the necessary succession of seals. The kneading of his chakra was almost instant as he paced it with the clap of his hands. From there, he'd unleash a moderate sized gust of wind.* - Sat Oct 24 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) granted Marrisa a nod of gratitude for each scroll given. Once he gathered all the scrolls, he'd form a single handseal and placed them within the confinements of a seal located on his body. He'd then go toward his pants and begin searching for his cash.

"How much do you want for the scrolls?"* - Sat Oct 24 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Nothing. . They were a gift. .  - Sat Oct 24 06:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sure, sure. - Sat Oct 24 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed his clothes back on while trying to cop a sight of Marrisa's frame before she was reclothed.* - Sat Oct 24 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes merely widened slightly, but his generic expression remained the same. Once he was dressed in his casual attire, he'd pace over to Marrisa and looked at her.

"Whenever you're ready."* - Sat Oct 24 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Excuse me a minute Ortho. .  - Sat Oct 24 06:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) saw no point in just sitting around. His attempt to go on a small date with Marrisa turned into a quick training session, in which turned to them leaving shortly after; he wasn't complaining though. For the most part, however, this was the best time to catch up on his training. While Marrisa and this Reguel person mingled and gossiped about whatever it was they were gossiping about, Ortho began.

Ortho starts off with kneading his chakra and allowing it to thin once manifesting within his stomach. Whilst doing so, in a slow pace, Ortho would string together a set of handseals while keeping a steady chakra flow. After forming the handseals, he'd clamp his palms together and allowed a miniature gust of wind to be expelled. He'd then look down at his palms and tried to get a steady read of his current chakra levels.

Rather than ending the training session there, Ortho would hastily transition into the next jutsu. His hands formed another succession of seals. The continuous flow of wind chakra made things all that easier for Ortho. After the seals were completed, he'd inhale through his nose to fill his lungs full of oxygen. Upon doing so, once waiting a second for his chakra to mold around the air within his lungs, Ortho would pucker his lips exhale. A continuous monstrous gust of wind would expel outward as a result, only ending once Ortho ran out of breath.

The fatigue of the Great Breakthrough was heavy, but nothing Ortho couldn't handle. His hands formed another series of seals, maneuvering through them with great ease and grace. Upon doing so, whilst continuing the flow of wind chakra, Ortho's chakra would knead within his stomach. As if duplicating the Great Breakthrough, Ortho would follow up with inhaling through his nose once more. The charging up of chakra wasn't as needed. With that in mind, Ortho would pucker his lips and exhale a multitude of times, releasing several air bullets forward.

Ortho's breathing was more controlled this time around, giving him less of a strain to both his body and chakra network. In fact, the lack of strain allowed his natural control of his chakra to be reimbursed to full capacity, giving him the ability to continue the kneading of chakra. This, in turn, allowed him to swiftly shift the flow of his chakra from wind to fire while handseals were once again conjured. The inhalation of air was given but, instead of wind being expelled, a massive fireball was unleashed.

Following the fireball, in retaliation, Ortho started up another jutsu. The handseals were formed and instant switch of his chakra affinity was made. The chakra would thicken and liquefy while adding its own density; in the end, mud was created. Upon doing so, he'd pucker his lips once more as a wave of slick sludge shot forth. It merges with the fireball, forming a massive Mud Fireball.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was off doing his own bit of training. He was called her because Nina wanted to talk and standing around proved doing nothing wasn't his style. Besides, whenever Ortho was around Nina would pout and whine about how he was doing something wrong. The most Ortho could do was let Nina do her own thing while he did is. Still, however, he kept an ear open for her.* - Sat Oct 24 07:34:24 2015

"I know I've missed your past allowances, but this should compensate. If you need more let me know." With that, Ortho would put the half a million yen in a pouch and chuck toward his little sister.* - Sat Oct 24 07:38:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || And this is where the fun began. Violet's approach didn't go unnoticed, and it's for that very same reason why Ortho retaliates in the manner he did. This was indeed a battle to prove himself, so proving is exactly what he was going to do.

As Violet inched forth, Ortho dashed back to keep the distance between them. Upon doing so, while moving, he'd form a string of handseals. The chakra within the male would knead and manifest within his stomach before igniting into a ball of fire. Afterwards, after the proper chakra was kneaded and his handseals were successfully formed, Ortho would unleash a massive fireball.

Luckily for Ortho, Ninjutsu was his bitch. That being said, even with the fireball raging forth and his chakra network ignited, Ortho managed to string yet another series of handseals together and alter the affinity of his chakra. In an instant, after his lips were puckered, Ortho would unleash a powerful gust of wind to magnify the damage of his fireball and the size.* - Sat Oct 24 08:11:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || When it came to protecting Nina and proving that he was fit for the job, Ortho went all out. Still, however, there was a tad bit of restraint. That being said, with Violet forced to retreat to a defensive route, Ortho followed up.

Another formation of handseals were made and the continuous flow of chakra was made. Rather than keeping the gust of wind going, Ortho would alter the chakra to earth based and slam his pants down into the sand below. As a result, massive spikes of earth would shoot up and aim to narrowly graze past Violet's frame. Instead of piercing through her, the spikes would instead gash her limbs and render her incapable.

Following that up was relatively easy. Normally lightning would cancel out earth, but in the conjunction of the two, they were completely compatible. With yet another forming of handseals, Ortho would allow his chakra flow to pulsate and surge through his outstretched arms in a Earth Flash to zap Violet.* - Sat Oct 24 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched as Violet fell to the side, his jutsu successful in their successions. He folds his arms across his chest and simply looked over at Nina and her opponent. * - Sat Oct 24 09:00:35 2015
