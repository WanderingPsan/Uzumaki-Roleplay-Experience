"The day you say it, if.. you ever say it, I want it to be because you feel it and feel that it is right."

He looks down at his bottles of sake, not able to look in Owari's innocent eyes. He mumbles something under his breath, turning his head in the process.* - Mon Nov  9 08:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reached his arm out, attempting to take her hand.

"I'm.. trying to make you understand the pros and cons.

The con is, you're risking your true safety in people you don't know that can.. easily.. steal 'you' from.. you..-"

Ortho sighs, slowly shaking his head. A massive headache was forming.

"Listen.. Flower.. What I'm telling you right now and asking you and suggesting to you is not for my sake, I promise you.. It's just a look from a different perspective of what you're doing.. just an attempt for you to progress forward with no regrets.."* - Mon Nov  9 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The throbbing in his head instantly became more apparent. His eyes presses closed in response and clenched tight. He turns his head slightly, clamping his jaw shut in momentary pain. The grip on his sake bottles tightened, and at that moment he remembered they still existed.

He takes a quick shot.

His mind starts to ease down a bit and the throbbing in his head subsides just enough for him to give Owari an answer.

"I want you to experience emotions and see if you prefer that over none.."

It may not be the answer she wanted, but he honestly couldn't give a yes or no in the current predicament.* - Mon Nov  9 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tries his best to push the matter away.

"Nothing, nothing. I think it's just my body craving the liquor." The answer was rushed and, at the moment, seemed reasonably fitting.* - Mon Nov  9 09:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || 
Thump...Thump...Thump....Thump...Thump

Ortho squinches his face and slowly closed his eyes. His jaw clenches once again and his grip on the bottles of sake tightened. He refuses to take a shot off the liquor; he promised Owari that he'd ease up off of it.

"I..- I like the fact.. the fact that you don't look at me.. me with those ey-eyes.. The ones.. The ones that la-lack judgment of what I tell.. you about-about.. myself."

Thump...Thump...Thump....Thump...Thump* - Mon Nov  9 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would nod his head at this moment, but he couldn't. He was afraid that any sudden movements, even gentle and slow ones, would make his headache ten times worse. He feels him succumbing to the darkness again, his eyes being shut allowing the memories that he fought so hard to forget to flash before him.

Thump..Thump..Thump..Thump.

The throbbing and aching continues, the pace of each throb picking up the more Ortho waited to relieve himself. No, he couldn't; he shouldn't. The liquor should be released from his grip and completely splattered across the floor, but.. that's his quick relief. That's what put his mind at ease ever since.

"my..fault.."

No, not this again. Don't make this happen again. The 'lifeless' body, the blames casted on him, the fingers that pierce through his soul as he sat next to the.. body.

Ortho's head hangs low, the flashing of his memories relentlessly beating against his peace of mind. Imagery after imagery, mistake after mistake.. drip of blood.. after drip of blood.

"my..faul-"

His eyes snap open, Owari's words finally sinking in after a good minute or two.

"Similar.. eyes, yes.. Similar.. eyes."
* - Mon Nov  9 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: It works when Nina does it. - Mon Nov  9 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head snaps to the side. If the entire planet was to suddenly freeze the instantly start spinning two times as fast as it was originally going, it still wouldn't compare to the daze Ortho was in right now.

The throbbing subsided; completely. In its place, however, was the constant screeching of the aching. It wasn't the type of aching that reached a high point, and then teases you with a momentary relief, no. This aching stayed at that highpoint where maybe, just maybe, Ortho would have to submit.

Thankfully, the throbbing stopped. With the lack of throbbing, at the very instant the slap landed, no matter how frail the person giving it was, Ortho gasps for air. It was like he was drowning or.. asthma, anything that allowed his lungs to fill after he purposely held his breath in hopes the lack of oxygen would put the brain's focus on something else, a desperation move he regretted almost immediately. His eyes momentarily closing but opening in three seconds so his head could turn back and allow him to set his gaze on Owari.

He says nothing.* - Mon Nov  9 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: One. - Mon Nov  9 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: It is not your fault. - Mon Nov  9 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Two. - Mon Nov  9 12:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gives in. He takes gulps of his sake, finishing what remained of the first bottle he opened. The rest he dropped. Where he stood currently, he dropped the remaining five bottles. Gravity kicked in and the bottles went to war with the ground; a war easily lost by the five.

"I understand.."

Ortho steps forward, reaching forward and takes Owari by her hands, tying his fingers into hers. "I.. understand." He leans in, just a bit, and repeats himself in a hushed tone once more. "I. Understand."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .....No.... no you don't. - Mon Nov  9 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

No emotions, no expressions, no quick answers, nothing. Why was he broken? Why did it still haunt him? There was obviously more to it than just the lifeless body.. that wasn't truly lifeless. Ortho stares at Owari, taking in each word she had to say.

Silence.

There was no real answer that could be mustered up in just a second then thrown at Owari. There was no real answer that could be conjured in just a second that he'd even believe and deem correct for exactly how he's feeling and thinking. The 'dead' body had an impact on Ortho, but that impact was soon over looked when Owari was reborn. Yet, guilt lingered for her having to step in, but it wasn't her 'lifelessness' that dawned on him and casted a rain shadow over him.. It was something else.

"I lost.. my brother.. over pussy."

Ortho's words rolled off his tongue relatively easy; well, easier than even he thought it would when he finally had the proper sentence to form to explain exactly how he feel. At that moment, when he said that to Owari, he was tempted to reach out for her and just hold her like a soft pillow and just embrace it, but he allowed her to keep the distance she formed between them.

"Over.. pussy.."

The disrespect, the hurt and the sheer anger Ortho felt for that realization is what haunted him. Was he so worthless that common pussy to Kirigakure would have Index, his brother, ready to take his life? Not to mention the promise they made, in which Ortho was the only one to upkeep? That.. That is truly what haunted him.. The betrayal of his brother.

Then, there was the fact that he was blamed. The fact that Ortho was blamed for it all that Index's piece of pussy was almost killed. So what? There was a pub three blocks away, Index could get pussy from those women anytime, but he chose to betray  him over Lera.

"Over.. fucking pussy.."* - Mon Nov  9 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||
The lies Index spreads. The lies of him being so mutual standing person where he was doing what he thought was best for both people, stopping one from killing the other. Some form of trickery to put the blame on everyone but himself, on the person that can truly see through his bullshit and know exactly what his intentions were.

Who was Ortho to deny these claims anyways? Owari obviously believed Index, and Ortho sure enough wasn't going to put a wedge between the trust Index and she had. The most Ortho did was slowly shake his head and subtly talk, no emotion; just emptiness.

"Right, yes. He and Lera were truly good friends. I stepped out of boundaries for attempting to claim her life.."* - Mon Nov  9 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||
Gone.

Ortho finally did it. He finally did what he, thought, he was trying to prevent. Owari heads for the door and he just stood there. In the middle of Hideki's house as she left. His parents left, Hideki left, Ambrocio left, Takeda left, Index.. left, Nina is on her way to leaving, now Owari. He has no one now.

Ortho remained silent, not knowing what to say or do.

Tears flow down his cheeks. No facial expression was given, but hot tears flow down his cheeks. He opens his mouth to say something, anything, but no sound came out. Just tears..* - Mon Nov  9 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||
Owari was right. The current Ortho that existed wasn't pleasant. He knew that, she knew that and everyone else knew that. How does he pull himself out, though? How can he just forget about what he honestly believed and know, and just accept that Index supposedly did what he felt he had to do for a 'friend'? Ortho didn't place fault in Owari, she said the complete truth on what she believed and heard; Ortho can commend her for that. Just Index's story is getting to everyone and slowly, but surely, turning them against him

Should Ortho stop Owari? Should he just make the attempt to explain what he's feeling? Everything that he was going to say has been said already. Index is full of shit, Index only cares for Index and his lust, Index just wants pussy. Ortho didn't want to be a broken records compared to Index's fine-tuned CD. He stammers for words and takes a step forward, but only a faintly audible vowel, the 'ow', managed to slip out before his voicebox shut off.

Anger swelled and in a swift swoop he turns and punches the wall. Ortho was no heavy weight boxer and he didn't focus on his physical strength but even that short burst of anger fueled his punch enough to send his fist breaking through the wall.

Tears continued to pour down his cheeks.* - Mon Nov  9 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || This was Ortho's problem to deal with. This was his hurdle to come over and Owari didn't deserve to harbor that burden.

Ortho's fist was peeled from the wall and he was lowered on to the floor. Tears continue to stream down his face as his arms wrap around Owari. From sheer instincts, he held her tight and close. He placed his gaze on the sky, remaining quiet while his facial expression finally altered. Subconsciously his was over the 'robot' thing. That burst of anger and breaking something did so much for him that just allowing himself to accept the fact was becoming easier and easier..

Silence.* - Mon Nov  9 13:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The tears eventually stopped, but the silence remained. The hold he had around Owari went from tight and needy to gripped and thankful. He stares at the back of her head, slowly shaking his own. "Thanks," he says in a hushed tone.* - Mon Nov  9 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but smile. "And a 'sorry' is the last thing you want to hear?" he whispers again.* - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans in and pulls Owari a bit closer, "go and do that operation. Then we'll start working on -your- goals."* - Mon Nov  9 15:00:41 2015
