<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shook his head, "couldn't sleep. I felt tired as hell before, but I don't know what happened as soon as I rested my head."* - Sat Nov 28 00:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Wonder how long they expect me to stand around here.. - Sat Nov 28 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: The last thing I need to do is wait for this damn Raikage to properly use his power.. - Sat Nov 28 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed a bit.* - Sat Nov 28 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This is getting annoying.. I need a way out of this village.. - Sat Nov 28 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stood there as quiet as ever. His eyes, however, was fixated on Akarui.* - Sat Nov 28 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Meh. - Sat Nov 28 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times, saying as he watched Akarui pace off. He slowly shook his head and pushed off from the mountain side and slowly followed her --- in a nonstalker-ish way.* - Sat Nov 28 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't fully grasp what was bothering Akarui. Of course just spectating didn't do much when it came to figuring out people such as Akarui --- it wasn't a bad thing that she was that complicated to figure out, it just had to input more of an effort for a mediocre level of output.

He paces himself cautiously toward the female, keeping himself at a safe distance and enough for her to possibly pick up on his approach. To aid in his efforts of not startling her he'd clear his throat with an audible cough, "ahem.."* - Sat Nov 28 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was taken aback by the dull greeting. Now he was sure something was wrong and the thought that he may have been the cause made his chest tighten a bit. He looks over at one of the waitresses and held up two fingers, a common gesture for how many bottle of sake you'd like. The waiter noticed how Akarui was postured at the table and made it a priority to hasten her movements and bring the cups over. When she did, Sogeki would take a seat next to Akarui, making sure not to make physical contact and placed the sake in front of her and in her view, suggesting that the sake would help her better than the tea.

"I'm sorry," he whispers to her. His tone was sincerely apologetic. He honestly believed he was the cause and wanted to repent for whatever sin he committed, "I.. won't do it again.."* - Sat Nov 28 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) would normally try to rebuttal and calm Akarui down but after all they've talked about and what he's shown her about him.. he felt extremely disrespected and sincerely hurt. His eyes divert to the cup of sake and he simple nods, grabbing for it and bringing it in front of him. Sogeki stood to his feet and takes out of bundle of cash. He rummages through the papers until pulling out enough to pay for the two cups.

The look on his face made it known that he was getting ready to shed tears. He didn't know if Akarui could hear, but his heart was pounding so fast and so heard that it was like his chest could burst at any minute. Still however, Sogeki was a man and wasn't going to shed physical tears --- he was torn on the inside though. At most his eyes watered, "you.. really think I'd do something like that..? I apologized because I thought you were regretting the hug from the other day.. I would never-.. I.. told you that I won't try to hurt you." That was all he was able to muster up, his voice cracking through each word formed. He slowly shakes his head and turns to walk out the shop the same way he came in.

His hands tuck themselves in his pockets and his lead lower slightly as he paced off, saying no more.* - Sat Nov 28 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Oh. . .kage. - Sat Nov 28 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: This is hilarious. - Sat Nov 28 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: But I could care less... Once I show the Toads this letter... It's over for him, even if something happens to me.. Good luck summoning anything now. - Sat Nov 28 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes diverted and simply nodded, "I understand."

He continues to step further and further away from Akarui, his path being set on the exit. "Maybe.. it's best if you're alone to gather your thought. I don't wish to be a burden." His voice is soft but audible, easily comparable to hushed tone without the small hearing window. His eyes are slightly lowered, showing that what she said still rang through his mind. He suffered from depression before and found that being alone and gathering his thoughts helped a lot --- he wasn't sure if that'd be the case with Akarui.

"I'll.. talk with you later I guess. And.. you're not losing a friend.. I just understand where I stand now.."* - Sat Nov 28 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: ... - Sat Nov 28 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was stopped in his tracks. His eyes widen a bit and he looks over his shoulders at Akarui, "a what..? What are you starting to get?"

His voice was uplifted a bit, but not in a joyful manner. It was serious without the small hint of 'tell me now or self'. The remaining amount of Sogeki's body turns with his head to completely face Akarui, expecting an honest answer. "It's just you and I here.. what are you getting?"* - Sat Nov 28 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't know how to react. Quite honestly, the last thing he wanted to do was be the cause of her mind swirling. It turns out that he was right for apologizing and he was right for placing the blame on himself. If anything, Akarui's words weren't extremely disrespectful for hurtful --- they were true. He was better off molesting her physical because the mental torture he put this weak minded female through is way worse.

"I.. didn't mean to do this, Akarui.. I just.. I'm sorry." He takes a step closer to Akarui, hesitantly trying to comfort her --- obviously to no avail.* - Sat Nov 28 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) did her one better. Instead of sitting directly in front of her, he'd sit across from where he originally positioned himself. He listened intently on what she had to say, almost immediately shaking his head, denying her statement.

"This-This is my fault. I didn't intend to put you.. through any of this.. I-I'm sorry.. If it'll make it easier on you," his voice begins to trail off, "I'll.. leave you alone.."* - Sat Nov 28 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I-I... - Sat Nov 28 06:40:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked up, immediately shaking his head. "Forget about that.. focus on telling me what I can do so you won't be confused anymore.."* - Sat Nov 28 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes shot down, "sorry.."* - Sat Nov 28 07:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head and nodded a bit. "I guess you weren't joking about all of that being too much.. I should've listened," he said in soft voice. His eyes remained lowered to the table between them, refusing to make contact with Akarui. "I.. don't know how I'm going to make it up.. to you."* - Sat Nov 28 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: That's not what I wanted to know. . . - Sat Nov 28 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes shot up and looked at Akarui. He takes a gulp and nodded his head, understanding what was being asked of him.

"I can't say it's 'just' lust as easily now as I did before.."* - Sat Nov 28 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Feelings -are-.. involved a bit. - Sat Nov 28 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Del. - Sat Nov 28 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Rio. - Sat Nov 28 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Have his time. - Sat Nov 28 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Yes.. and no - Sat Nov 28 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes because I -want- there to be feelings.. - Sat Nov 28 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: He is making me more confused. . . - Sat Nov 28 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: No because I know.. it'll make things complicated for our friendship.. - Sat Nov 28 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And by feelings being there.. I mean from you.. and from me.. - Sat Nov 28 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . So you're stopping yourself from having feelings. . .? - Sat Nov 28 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Not.. just from me.. or just from you. - Sat Nov 28 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: I'm. . .confused. - Sat Nov 28 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Is.. that what I'm doing. - Sat Nov 28 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed..* - Sat Nov 28 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: I-I need to figure things out eventually. . .and why I'd have these feelings towards K-Kari as well. . .s-so for now can we just pretend this didn't happen. . .? - Sat Nov 28 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened.* - Sat Nov 28 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "no it's fine. I promise. I understand."* - Sat Nov 28 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I want to hug him again. . .but. . .that's still a lot. . .and he didn't seem to like it before. - Sat Nov 28 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: I-I'm glad. . . - Sat Nov 28 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded.* - Sat Nov 28 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Sat Nov 28 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Um. . . - Sat Nov 28 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: W-Wanna eat with me? - Sat Nov 28 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. maybe I should g- - Sat Nov 28 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..S-sure.. - Sat Nov 28 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no.. - Sat Nov 28 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I thought that's what you wanted... - Sat Nov 28 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: It's fine.. - Sat Nov 28 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked over at the two cups of sake he was originally paying for. He grabs them and drank them back to back with no hesitation, releasing a grunt after it all to show that the liquor was properly satisfying. He nods his head, chuckling to what Akarui had to say. "My lips are sealed.~"

His eyes glance at Akarui for just a brief moment, supplying her with a smile with the gaze. He wasn't implying anything, but reassuring her of the promise he made just a few days ago. Nevertheless, he'd nod his head once more and continued. "Besides.. Who would believe I'd be on a date with you? It'd be like some mortal getting a chance with a goddess --- just doesn't happen."
* - Sat Nov 28 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but laugh.

"It's true, it's true..!~"

He noticed Akarui's earlier comment and just smiled, "don't.. worry about that... Knowing you're comfortable is good enough."* - Sat Nov 28 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) chuckled once more, scratching the back of his head. "Eh, maybe I'm not so different. I mean.. maybe when it comes to my fighting style, but everything else.. I'm just the average Joe with different morals."

His eyes venture off to Yuriko, resting on her for just a bit. "Haven't seen her around here before, have you?" He uses his head to gesture in the females' location, expecting Akarui to turn around and look. * - Sat Nov 28 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: See. . .that's what a godess looks like. I'm no where on that level. . .go get it if you are lusting after a godess~ (ICly teasing) - Sat Nov 28 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shrugged. "Must be a new graduate," he says in a neutral tone. He didn't know why Akarui chose to whisper, it's not like they were talking bad about the female. "Yeah, she looks pretty good. Perfect is an understatement. She's.. freakishy doll-ish" Sogeki blinks a few times, slowly shaking his head in disbelief. "If anything, she might be Takuma's type."* - Sat Nov 28 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I kinda wanna go talk to her. . . - Sat Nov 28 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: But it'd be rude to Sogeki. . . - Sat Nov 28 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) glanced back at Akarui and slowly nodded his head, "I'm okay. I think we should invite the newcomer. Not really.. nice.. to leave he hanging around her. Knowing the savagery of Kumogakure, someone would try to mug her on the spot."* - Sat Nov 28 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Uh-oh. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: If she screams stranger danger, I'm leaving.. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'm hungry. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Eenie. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Meanie. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Minie. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Moe. - Sat Nov 28 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stayed a safe distance away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He gets up and trailed after Akarui, backing her up in the suggestion.* - Sat Nov 28 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Clumsy. - Sat Nov 28 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: u ded. - Sat Nov 28 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked down at Akarui like nothing happened, "mybad." He glances at Yuriko and steps off to the side, allowing passway for both ladies. "Uhh, after you two."* - Sat Nov 28 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's brow rose as well. Yuriko's glance caught his attention and he just smirked to himself, slowly shaking his head. He didn't say anything out loud but he sure enough knew the type of game being played here. If anything he'd remain completely quiet, pacing himself to his previous position, across from Yuriko, and looking off into the distance --- a wall behind the two females.* - Sat Nov 28 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why do I go into these buildings with strange smells. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: It always ends up with people trying to feed me disgusting things. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes divert to the nearest waiter and he pokes his head up a bit, getting her attention with just that motion. His face was pretty common in the shop so she'd just nod and bring over the usual; a few cups of sake --- those "cups" being the entire bottle. He smiled devilishly at the bottles, taking one and popping off the cork. "Cheers," he murmurs as he brings the bottle to his lips and downed a few gulps.* - Sat Nov 28 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh sake. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Maybe I could drink sake. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Sake makes me feel weird, I wonder what it feels like now. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: But I'm alone, maybe that's a bad idea. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No no, I won't dink. - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *drink - Sat Nov 28 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Such a cute name~ - Sat Nov 28 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: She reminds me of like a perfect sister. . .if her perfectness wasn't kinda creepy. - Sat Nov 28 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Nice to meet you Yuriko-Chan.~ - Sat Nov 28 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus returned to Akarui, "I'm fine. I enjoy a good smoke and sake, that's all." He glances at Yuriko and takes a drink from the bottle, "pleasure is ours."* - Sat Nov 28 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: -0 - Sat Nov 28 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I wonder if the carpet matches the drapes. -omit- - Sat Nov 28 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't mind the stare. In fact, he welcomed it and greeted it with another swig off of his sake. To top things off Sogeki would grab for one of the free bottles and offer it to Yuriko, "name's Sogeki. I know Akarui doesn't drink, but surely someone of your.. fanciness.. could hold your liquor."

This was a game to Sogeki. He wasn't trying to try anything slick, but that first stare down made the arena open and he was determined to be the winning gladiator. A smirk creeps on his face and thickens with each second that go by, his offer of sake still standing strong.* - Sat Nov 28 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was going to win.

He lets go of the sake but leaves it directly in Yuriko's line of sight. Unless she was able to suck her eyeballs in and protrude them through the back of her head, that bottle was going to be in her focus. His smirk subsides a bit, it was clear he was doing a better job of masking his part in this competition, even if he was truly the only participant. Akarui seemed have the questions and conversation running so all Sogeki did was sit back and gulp from his bottle every now and then.* - Sat Nov 28 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: She is talking strange. - Sat Nov 28 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Did I say something wrong? - Sat Nov 28 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: H-Huh No, No. . . - Sat Nov 28 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Just thinking. . . - Sat Nov 28 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) noticed Akarui's awkward state and simply sighed. "Is that where you just came from?" He continues the conversation, keeping his voice leveled and eyes focused on the bottle of sake he put in between her.* - Sat Nov 28 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Come on.. drink it.. - Sat Nov 28 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: You know you want to... - Sat Nov 28 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I must have upset he. - Sat Nov 28 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *her. - Sat Nov 28 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || "This is a three way conversation you know." He looks at Akarui, smiling a bit. "No need to be uncomfortable."

He glances at Yuriko's bottle of sake and placed his, now, empty one off to the side. He grabs a second, that was in the middle of the table, and opens it just to take a few gulps. "Bottoms' up."* - Sat Nov 28 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: for you know - Sat Nov 28 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (well... every now and then) - Sat Nov 28 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times and places his bottle on the table, pushing it away from the edge without placing it directly in front of Yuriko. He stacks his arms on top of one another and rests it on the table as well, setting his gaze on Yuriko. He sizes her up and down a bit, allowing his smug to slowly wipe away. "I suppose someone as.. fancy.. as you has come here for sightseeing? Or am I out of line for asking?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded toward Akarui while keeping his gaze on Yuriko, "yeah. What she said. You like them?" His smirk slowly grew back, but not for obvious reason. In actuality, he enjoyed this little battle between them. It wasn't exactly a 'battle', but just the stakes at hand.* - Sat Nov 28 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Drink.. the sake. - Sat Nov 28 11:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched her fingers trail over the bottle. His eyebrows furrowed in a chuckle managed to escape. He grabs for his bottle and easily downs three gulps, forcefully placing it back next to her bottle and leaning in a bit more with his arms still stacked on top of another. "They say each mountain in Kumogakure is bigger than the last. Think you've seen it all yet?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) vic.tor.y.

His smirk grew as big as it could. He nods his head and takes his own gulp of sake, grunting a bit at the slight burn in the back of his throat. "How long you plan on staying?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She is a savage amongst savages.. - Sat Nov 28 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: But I invented the art of Savagery. - Sat Nov 28 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded again and reaches for a third bottle. With his free hand he'd signal for a few more, the waiter been watching him down the sake for a while now. He opens the bottle, popping the cork off, and brings it to his lips. Instead of taking a powerful hit he'd instead sip and gently place it back down on the table. "O-..Only family member you say? How is it back where you live? You said somewhere near Kirigakure? Is it as.. wet.. as the landscape of the infamous Mist?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: They seem to be having fun, drinking and such. . .maybe I should use this time to sneak away. - Sat Nov 28 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I will not lose to a mediocre savage.. - Sat Nov 28 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I am the savage.. - Sat Nov 28 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She is a savage! - Sat Nov 28 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I will not lose! - Sat Nov 28 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched the bottle meet her lips and the liquid pour in.

Victory shall be claimed be the King of Savagery.

He releases his grip on his bottle of sake and leaned back off the the table, allowing their two bottle to have a stand off of their own. Of course, even though Sogeki was on his third bottle, his was lighter than Yuriko's first. He didn't mind the statistics at hand but still he had to assure himself that no foe can triumph over him in his own natural element --- it was basic Savageology.

"Is the travel there strenuous? As far getting to the island, the winds, the natural elements and all that good stuff?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. He was officially intrigued. From the stories he heard about the atmosphere of Kirigakure, both village-wise and country-wise, there was nothing to smile about. His eyes narrowed on the Female of Perfection and allowed his smirk to once again be known on his face. "And I suppose the level of.. barbaric.. statures that have been circulating about Kirigakure doesn't intimidate you? I mean sure your island is registered as Kirigakure territory, yes?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: They seem to be having fun, I think I am going to slip away. . . - Sat Nov 28 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: If Akarui leaves, she gets an arrow in the knee. - Sat Nov 28 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: -omit- - Sat Nov 28 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus shot off in Akarui's direction. He noticed the faintest of movements in an attempt leave. Naturally he felt like it was the attention given to Yuriko that put Akarui off, but the foe before him was putting up a fight that he couldn't possibly lose or all his savage-points were stolen. The last thing he needed to do was lose to Female of Perfection and have her sway her hips across his land of savage like she didn't do what she just did.

He was conflicted.

Sogeki's gaze lighten a bit, transitioning from determined to more welcoming. "Tell me, Akarui. Does a simple sip of sake not interest you?" Of course this wasn't a clear request that she stayed and joined the fun, but it was as close as it'd get whilst he battled with his newfound arch enemy.* - Sat Nov 28 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded in understanding. "State your favorite drink and order it, it's on me."

His eyes set back on Yuriko, "you own the entire place or just the structure you live in that so happens to be on that island?"* - Sat Nov 28 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Even some of the ocean space for privacy. - Sat Nov 28 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ......... - Sat Nov 28 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Watch he tries to kidnap me for ransom. - Sat Nov 28 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Cause that will go over well. - Sat Nov 28 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) pats his pocket, feeling the anorexia in them. "Well then.. You're big ballin'."* - Sat Nov 28 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I suppose. - Sat Nov 28 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It was inheretance. - Sat Nov 28 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmph.. - Sat Nov 28 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Most I inherited was a bow and arrow. - Sat Nov 28 12:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times, placing his complete focus on Yuriko.* - Sat Nov 28 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: A.. weapon..? - Sat Nov 28 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: yes. - Sat Nov 28 13:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...That is the part that is difficult. - Sat Nov 28 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There have been several who thought I was the one to be their weapon. - Sat Nov 28 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And they died. - Sat Nov 28 13:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Why can't you be your own weapon then? - Sat Nov 28 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened even more. It wasn't even his seventh bottle and he was already seeing some real.. interesting things. He leans forward a bit and leaned his head to the side, watching Akarui.. comfort.. Yuriko. Instinctively, as the savage male he is, he'd bite down on his lower lip and make the best attempt he could to divert his mind to the possibilities of him being able to ---

"Anyways," he says behind a cough. "If this is a topic you can't touch.. we're free to change it at your will."* - Sat Nov 28 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in understanding, "very well." He reaches for his bottle of sake and took a light sip, letting the air thin a bit before speaking.

"So.. how big of a mansion we talking?"* - Sat Nov 28 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...It almost covers the entire island. - Sat Nov 28 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's a big island. - Sat Nov 28 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: 'Mansion'. - Sat Nov 28 13:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ...I feel like I messed things up. - Sat Nov 28 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed a bit. "Envying you is an understatement, haha.. Riches isn't something I would mind.."* - Sat Nov 28 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I feel like I have to look out for this girl~ - Sat Nov 28 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It...isn't all that. - Sat Nov 28 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked at the money, slowly shaking his head. "I.. really appreciate this.. but I want to earn.. my riches.."* - Sat Nov 28 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Take it. - Sat Nov 28 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: Instead, just give Sogeki a hug. - Sat Nov 28 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: He loves those. - Sat Nov 28 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: More than money. - Sat Nov 28 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked down at the money, his mind wandering off.* - Sat Nov 28 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Aye. Let me fuck. Now. - Sat Nov 28 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 28 13:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: That looks nice. . . - Sat Nov 28 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Dem hips though. - Sat Nov 28 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Omit - Sat Nov 28 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: M-Maybe I should have asked for a hug too. . .no one has ever actually returned my hugs. - Sat Nov 28 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's gaze was set on the money. The life he lived wasn't an easy one; that much was clear at how he was able to admit slight jealousy over Yuriko's riches. His eyes locked on the wad of cash and he slowly shook his head, "s-so.. much.."

He was hugged and the briefest of contact sent shivers up and down his spine. The sheer softness of Yuriko's skin was unbelievable --- there was no way someone this soft could be a weapon. At most she was the one in danger from certain people refusing to not have more physical contact once making the faintest with her. He released a sigh and slowly shook his head, rubbing his cheek against her as a result.

"Consider.. this a loan then.. I have to pay you back before I die.. no matter what.. If you truly wish for me to have this gift, swear to me that it's actually a 'loan'.."* - Sat Nov 28 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) eyes remained on the fuckton, compared to what he has been exposed to in funds up until this point, of money.* - Sat Nov 28 14:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why didn't you take a loan? - Sat Nov 28 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He took a loan. - Sat Nov 28 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: N-Noooo My hug. . . - Sat Nov 28 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: I don't need the money. . .that hug was worth more than the money. . . - Sat Nov 28 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...It was? - Sat Nov 28 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: To me~ - Sat Nov 28 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I am going to have to give hugs more often! - Sat Nov 28 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: - - Sat Nov 28 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Sat Nov 28 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You told me to stop. - Sat Nov 28 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Sat Nov 28 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looked up at Yuriko. He blinked a few times then glanced at Akarui just to set his gaze back on Yuriko. This change between focus continued in his own little silence, only being able to watch as the fact that two females were in front of him 'hugging' it out with a fuckton of money in front of him along with booze. This entire day went from emotional findings, to new girl on the block then "let's have a three-."

Sogeki shook his head, allowing his mind to rattle and clear some of the lustful steam --- he wondered if they can see that steam seep out from his ears. The most he did, sound wise, was release a very low cough to clear the lump in his throat while leaning over just 'slightly' to apply pressure on his.. lap.. and prevent certain responses from happening.

This was truly a dream come true for any male.* - Sat Nov 28 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) really didn't know how to react. What he was seeing was amazing. Before him were booze, money and two fine chicks in the midst of an intense Hug War. How does a guy like Sogeki, or any guy in that matter, react? To top things off, one of the two females knew exactly what she was doing in an attempt to rile Sogeki up and have him possibly beg for the opportunity to act on his lust.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) really didn't know how to react. What he was seeing was amazing. Before him were booze, money and two fine chicks in the midst of an intense Hug War. How does a guy like Sogeki, or any guy in that matter, react? To top things off, one of the two females knew exactly what she was doing in an attempt to rile Sogeki up and have him possibly beg for the opportunity to act on his lust.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) noticed Yuriko breaking the hug and got slightly disappointed. He was desperately trying to hide his liking of the scenario, but to no avail. He blinks a few times and slowly shook his head, watching how she downed the sake more than he did before. Either she was beginning to like the taste or she was so out of it by this point that the 'taste' wasn't a 'taste' at all. Nevertheless Sogeki, himself, slowed his pace since he was on his seventh bottle --- he sip-sipped the liquor.* - Sat Nov 28 14:36:22 2015

It's not like he had a problem with two of the three. The first, however, he wouldn't mind if they relieved him. Still, Sogeki kept his thoughts to himself --- it was sad that he wasn't able to control the lust shown on his face.* - Sat Nov 28 14:43:12 2015

"Have mercy," he says within the safety of his mind. His eyes shut for just a small amount of time, enough for him to register what he's witnessing first hand. His head slowly shook and takes a deep breath, releasing it in an attempt to straighten himself.

After a few seconds he'd form a smirk on his face and open his eyes. He takes a sip of his sake and leans back a bit, accepting the fact that he was aroused and it wasn't his fault.* - Sat Nov 28 14:51:44 2015

"Don't know.. what just went down. Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut... I call redo." He was obviously in a tipsy state by this point.

By far Yuriko had the best hug known to man, that's a given, but Akarui was never known to hug anything or anyone. If air asked Akarui for a hug, the chick would probably curl up in a hinata-ball and faint.

Sogeki leans to the side a bit and returned the hug, daringly placing his hand at the small of her back and strictly keeping it there. His shoulder and chest area neatly tucks under her bust and heaven came closer than ever before --- by someone not Yuriko because god- Gezo damn that skin is soft.* - Sat Nov 28 15:25:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . - Sat Nov 28 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed, "alright Takuma.. She gets it.."* - Sat Nov 28 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed and paced off. "Let's go Akarui."* - Sat Nov 28 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lead her to only body of water in Kumogakure. The bank wasn't soil-like in comparison to what it'd be for other villages, it was extremely dry due to the lake being man-made to just carry fresh water. The bank was at least a foot or so higher than where the surface of water was.

He stares down at he reflection and simply sighed. It was clear that he was still extremely pissed off and fed up of the whole hinata act, but he kept his tongue tied about it. "Keep your head up when someone ask you a tough question or a question you don't like. You seem vulnerable when you look away," he says in a very stern tone.* - Sat Nov 28 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He didn't want a pity hug. He wanted a hug where Akarui was completely into it and wasn't a nervous, or wary, wreck over it. He wanted a hug where he didn't feel like any wrong move and he'd either get slapped or yelled again. All of this was just to make up for earlier and he knew it.

Sogeki's arms were pulled and manually wrapped around Akarui, but they went slump in the same moment she released her grip on them. He raised his chin a bit and looked off into the distance, saying nothing. It was clear that this hug wasn't doing what it was probably intended to do.

"Yes, Akarui. Whatever you like."* - Sat Nov 28 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "nothing is wrong."

He turns the hug in pull, making sure to keep his hands on her upper back. If anything, we had his hands at the back of her shoulders than anywhere else. Deep down he wanted to be more intimate with Akarui, but faith and hope was slowly seeping out and on that matter. His hug, in a general basis, was exactly what she wanted. He kept his hands at a safe place, he hugged her back and she had someone to cry to.

"Everything will be okay," he whispers. There was annoyance still in his voice, but the effort of holding it back and being sincere could be heard,* - Sat Nov 28 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: Y-You're stupid. . .I-I said you could touch anywhere back there but my b-butt. . . - Sat Nov 28 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm.. okay with this. - Sat Nov 28 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) whispers: J-Just this once. . .I-I need to try new things still. . .right? - Sat Nov 28 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sighed deeply. He honestly felt like this was going to backfire on him and he just accepted that fact. His head slowly shook and his hands trailed down her back, gliding over skin and what little upperbody clothing she had until finding the small of her back once again. He continued to look off into the distance, tightening the hug with the aid of his better gripping.* - Sat Nov 28 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: . . . - Sat Nov 28 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) had no reason to move his hands. Want and selfish desires was a factor, but he was so fed up on the indecisive train of thought that he refused to be the track said train ran on. He keeps his hands strictly on her lower back, threatening to find the beginning on her butt without actually doing it. 

"It's a strain, but not nothing I can't handle. I told you before: if you're comfortable then I'm fine. It's.. no big deal I gues.."* - Sat Nov 28 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: He is sick of me. . .I know he is. - Sat Nov 28 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's brow rose at the sight, but remained quiet. He didn't feel it was his place to make any announcement. He simply nodded in Kari's direction while glancing down at Akarui. "No need to thank me.. it's fine. Do whatever you feel is right, nor worries."

With that, Sogeki would pace back a few feet and turn to look down at the waters' surface.* - Sat Nov 28 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) simply watched.* - Sat Nov 28 22:44:28 2015
