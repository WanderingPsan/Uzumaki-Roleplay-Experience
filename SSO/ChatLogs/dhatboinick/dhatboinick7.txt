"Your turn."* - Tue Sep 22 17:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm.. - Tue Sep 22 17:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looks down on his black outfit, then at the outfits presented to him..

"Not exactly.."* - Tue Sep 22 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Let me see if I have anything darker - Tue Sep 22 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So.. Uhh.. You're not going to strip too? - Tue Sep 22 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am a Seamtreess and a ninja. . Not a prostitue sir. . - Tue Sep 22 17:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wasn't suggesting that you were.. - Tue Sep 22 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Only fair seeing as though you don't have an official establishment for your customers. - Tue Sep 22 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am in public half naked. - Tue Sep 22 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And you are not. - Tue Sep 22 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes slightly widened at the sight, but he quickly regained composure. He inched forth a bit, trying to get a bit closer without alarming her too much.* - Tue Sep 22 17:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow, listening to her words. A slight chuckle overcame the male, finding the thought amusing to say the least.

"Attraction to is in fine print at this point. I am not a tyrant, so ravishing you is not my goal. Seducing you is however."* - Tue Sep 22 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmm. Yes, I'll surely by this. - Tue Sep 22 17:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) takes a subtle step forward, attempting to minimize the distance between them. His right arm raised a bit, an open palm residing at the end. He places said palm on her hip, pulls her in even closer and looks into her eyes. Erebus was known to be a demonic being that was driven by the word of his religious god, but even he had tendencies. With his free hand, Erebus would take out a wad of cash and glide it down Marrisa's arm and into her palm.

"No, no. I wish to pay you for patients and efforts."* - Tue Sep 22 17:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, nearly feeling the nervousness seep off of Marrisa. He didn't blame her though, he knew of his reputation. With her still gripped by the waist, a little less than before, he locked eyes with her.

"I am a being a understanding and I seek truth. Those who judge the different and refuse to understand are who I seek to eradicate. I am not a cold-blooded killer that acts with no cause, for I do have one. Traveling with me will be dangerous, but I do reside in Konohagakure a lot."

The look on Erebus' face told a story of both disappointment in how Marrisa was treating him, but still he understood exactly where she was coming from.* - Tue Sep 22 18:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Besides. . I am no slouch in the fighting depeartment. . Even if I am only a Genin - Tue Sep 22 18:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's grip on Marrisa's hip eventually vanished, resulting in his arm hanging down to his side. His eyes trailed from her stomach back to her face as she spoke, examining her frame. A sigh was released from Erebus as he took a step back.

"You don't have to force yourself to do anything.. As I said, I'm not a tyrant.."* - Tue Sep 22 18:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lesson one big boy, No one forces me to do anything. - Tue Sep 22 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am going to be the greatest Fan ninja of all time. If I didn't mean what I said, I would not have said it.  - Tue Sep 22 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit, the words of Marrisa not sitting right with him. It wasn't that he thought she was lying, but the fact that he wasn't used to hearing someone say such things. Nevertheless, Erebus grants Marrisa a nod.

"It's fine. I should've been more expectant of that though, it's just nature."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My fighting style is rather unorthodox. - Tue Sep 22 18:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't use ninjutsu at all. - Tue Sep 22 18:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Damn. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If you truly wish to venture with me, however, it'll be easier to progress forward.. - Tue Sep 22 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: As I said. I would not have said I plan to if I didn't - Tue Sep 22 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. When do you wish to head out? - Tue Sep 22 18:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Whenever. . I've been here for days with no one to talk to at all. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, we'll head out to Konohagakure right now. - Tue Sep 22 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll fund the caravan. - Tue Sep 22 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) takes out a black pouch, unzipping it reveal a bundle of cash. He takes a few bills out and hands it over to a Cavarvan driver, allowing said driver to escort them to the hidden leaf.* - Tue Sep 22 19:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Big village. .  - Tue Sep 22 19:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) allowed Marrisa to take her seat first, taking his afterwards. He picks up the menu placed before him by the chef and already knew what he wanted just from a glimpse, ramen with extra meat and a cup of sake. Once Marrisa ordered her desires, he'd place in his and have the money ready for the chef.* - Wed Sep 23 00:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) noticed her reach for money and placed a his hand on hers. He slowly shook his head, suggesting that she didn't need to do that.* - Wed Sep 23 00:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' eyes wandered off as he began eating his ramen. He wasn't bored or anything, but it was clear that he had a lot on his mine. Seeing as though he picked up an important role within Konohagakure, there were pressing matters to think about. Nevertheless, though, he did make it a priority to communicate with Marrisa.* - Wed Sep 23 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh? - Wed Sep 23 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll be sure to get in contact with them shortly. - Wed Sep 23 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) continued to slowly eat his ramen; not so slow where he could be compared to a turtle, but average paced. He supplies Marrisa with a slight shrug followed by a brief explanation.

"I suppose you could call them business partners; the male that is. The female is his spouse."* - Wed Sep 23 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) turns his head slightly, setting a subtle gaze on Marrisa. A chuckle escaped him; the question was amusing to say the least.

"Why wouldn't I? You're not ugly in one bit, so I might as well try. Long haul..? I don't know yet."* - Wed Sep 23 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) kept his voice mellow and attitude neutral, showing no deception to the situation. Honesty came a long way, and Erebus wasn't the type to lie to no one for any reason.

"Lust is more of a stimulator than alcohol. I won't like to you and say I have lust for you, but I also won't lie to you and say I seek a future with you in a long-term spouse manor. However, I'm also not saying there isn't a chance for that. I can't see in the future."* - Wed Sep 23 01:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) took grasp of his sake, bringing it to his mouth for a sip. The teasing words of Marrisa only caused him to smirk, a subtle chuckle following close behind. He turns his head to her once more and glared at her with a neutral expression..

"How about you just let go of that and give it to me..? It'll be in safe hands."* - Wed Sep 23 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) raised his right hand a bit, edging it toward her left thigh.

"I mean, we could just say this been our tenth or so date. It was a long caravan ride here anyways, so technically this is our third or so date."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) glides his thumb back and forth against Marrisa's skin, getting a subtle feel of her temperature and maybe any goosebumps for nervousness. His touch was soft and lustful, signs that he was really trying to play his cards right. For the most part, however, he made an attempt to edge his hand up her thigh, but on the inside where her sacred mound was; mainly toward the back of her.

"A kiss.? That's all?" Erebus' voice was playfully whining, like a kid wanting to bribe his crush to give him more than just a peck on the cheek.* - Wed Sep 23 01:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' attempt to get a quick squeeze off of Marrisa's tush was stopped. Before he could rebuttal to such blocking, he was caught off guard by Marrisa's pressing lips. He wasn't complaining at the fact that he got a kiss, but her backside was still calling his name.

Erebus was a renowned cold-blooded killer, yet Marrisa found it to be a game to play with his lustful mind. As their lips departed, Erebus made another attempt to edge his hand forward some more, but didn't apply any serious strength or pressure so he would get what he wants without her subtle permission. Whether or not he was allowed to, Erebus was stand to his feet as well and give her a smirk.

"I suppose you're right. I'll be heading out anyways, important matters to attend to and all that."* - Wed Sep 23 01:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a nod, accepting to obvious invitation. His fingers clenched a bit, squeezing her bottom before releasing and trailing off of her.

"Sure thing just let me know which house and shop you want and I'll be sure to get it for you." Erebus salutes her with the respect she deserved as a woman and walked out the build, heading toward his predetermined destination.* - Wed Sep 23 02:02:40 2015

It was pity how Katsune was willing to send them on such a suicidal mission for no reason.

Nevertheless, Shin and Beth were back safe and sound, postponing Erebus' plans for Katsune.

A few minutes passed by before Erebus raised his head slightly and allowed the female a decent view of his face whilst his hoodie was on.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) watched Marrisa pace over, her trembling legs having no modesty of their presence. A slight sigh escaped him; he didn't understand why people tried so hard in simply spars. With a shrug, Erebus would refocus and speak.

"When you get a bit of rest, we're going out for something to eat; I'm a bit hungry."* - Wed Sep 23 15:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pivots forward, aiming to leave the current training location. His head shifts to the right a bit, sending a quick glance over toward Marrisa.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Details you must obtain from Katsune. I've already washed my hands of the economical standings of the village. As for the shinobi numbers, five-hundred the last I heard. - Wed Sep 23 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Wed Sep 23 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Would me becoming a gezo private benefit the village? - Wed Sep 23 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Seeing as though you'd need to take the infamous Private Exams to be a true Jounin, yes. - Wed Sep 23 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right . . . I could message Niza to get in contact with Gezo and ask them to prepare the private exams for me so I can take them. - Wed Sep 23 16:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still want to get a bit stronger. - Wed Sep 23 16:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need more stamina and chakra to last the exams though . . . Perhaps even more ninjutsu strength. - Wed Sep 23 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's pitiful how you shinobi reside on ranking to determine your power. - Wed Sep 23 16:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: By your system, I'm a mere Genin --- yet I can kill you all at will. - Wed Sep 23 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I was just a genin recently . . . Though I could take on Jounin. - Wed Sep 23 16:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way . . . If it benefits the village . . . I'll become gezo . . . - Wed Sep 23 16:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If my plan was to go through, even the Gezo will bow at my feet. I don't seek just equality of the different, but to rip this shinobi-system apart and glue it back together in a perfect image. - Wed Sep 23 16:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 16:39:53 2015

The eerie sound of metal dragging against the dirt grouping itself with the nauseating aroma; Erebus has arrived. His head was held low to a slight degree, providing no ability to view his entire face; the hoodie he wore aided in the lack of visuals. Erebus' path was set, edging toward Hanabi with no words being said. Once reaching a few feet away from her, the cloaked Jashinist halted; his jaws audibly cracking open. A sinister release of breath filled the immediate area, increasing the smell of death and blood around him and Hanabi.* - Wed Sep 23 23:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) edged forth once again, allowing his self to circle around Hanabi.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There is something I noticed under Zetsumo. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whenever we were sent on a mission, I was always the one and only person that said we should stop and plan before we leave the village. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's honestly terrifying. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me and Orakuru almost died on our first mission together because we just ran up to the enemy camp. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He didn't think we needed a plan. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We 'did'. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I said I will keep reminding myself to plan even if the mission sounds simple and easy. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Having squads with appointed leaders that know what they're doing...I can see some sense in that. - Thu Sep 24 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) has been listening in all this time. He had his chained scythe's hanging from around his neck and his head lowered slightly, remaining quiet as Kilm and Katsune spoke.* - Thu Sep 24 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for the jounin . . . Going to be a while before we get some . . . Need them to be Gezo Privates if they are to be real jounin. - Thu Sep 24 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The Gezo. . . - Thu Sep 24 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Na. If I say anything the Gezo will kill me. - Thu Sep 24 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Anything else to discuss? - Thu Sep 24 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like to know more about a dead woman named Kastya. Other than that no. - Thu Sep 24 15:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Was still alive when I just began working for Kumogakure. - Thu Sep 24 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People say she had a demon living inside of her. Know anything about that? - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mmh . . . Hard to remember . . . - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I only mostly knew common knowledge. - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The demon does ring a bell though. - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anything else? - Thu Sep 24 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing I'm ready to ask about. - Thu Sep 24 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Thu Sep 24 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm ready to go on any mission . . . If you've got something for me that is - Thu Sep 24 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're anxious to go on missions, Kilm; that's admirable. At the same time, however, you're going about things the wrong way. - Thu Sep 24 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Becoming a Jounin is your goal, fine; missions don't get you there. - Thu Sep 24 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not putting down your efforts, but think of things at a bigger picture. - Thu Sep 24 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There's no true requirement for Jounin other than passing the exams. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm getting missions so I can be more battle ready. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It doesn't hurt to get better. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The missions you're asking for will end in your demise. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What doesn't kill me makes me stronger . . . You've probably heard that phrase before. - Thu Sep 24 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's right. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No matter how strong you get, I won't make you a jounin unless you've proven other things to me. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That phrase is a contradiction, but I see your point. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- On the other hand. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can handle it. You're stronger than a C class ninja in most ways. Zetsumo taught you a lot of techniques. - Thu Sep 24 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or...bring people with you if you prefer. - Thu Sep 24 16:32:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You could've atleast called him a friend. - Thu Sep 24 16:37:58 2015
