<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: After a bit of tweaking and thought, it eventually worked. - Tue Nov 17 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you say so. - Tue Nov 17 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just seemed logical to me. - Tue Nov 17 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That logic goes far, Hatsujin. You should give yourself more credit. - Tue Nov 17 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll give myself more credit once I can use it effectively. - Tue Nov 17 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll see what I can do for you. - Tue Nov 17 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh, alright. - Tue Nov 17 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anything we can do for now? - Tue Nov 17 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't want to have you fab too much in Ninjutsu. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So for now, just bear with me. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . .I meant in general. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Sitting here is. . .a bit meh. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood off the side. His hands are firmly tucked away within his pants pockets and he had a plain expression plastered on his face. He wore a black tank-top that could easily be called a size too small because of how it clung to his slender, but still muscular, body. His black pants were a bit baggy, but fit him just right --- despite it being sagged to below his boxers' waistband. This time around Ortho only wore one bandage on his right arm, just enough to cover up certain things. Ortho's hair was also changed a bit. Rather than having hair cover half his face, he'd have everything pulled back and held by his head bandages, exposing the entirety of his face.

"Yeah, we're good," he says in a leveled tone; it could be labeled as almost 'demanding' and, or, 'straight forward'. He gave a slight shrug and continues, "I spoke with her about certain things as well. The same thing dealing with basic Fuuinjutsu and other ninja arts. I have to figure out how to train you two effectively."* - Tue Nov 17 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Ortho. - Tue Nov 17 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? - Tue Nov 17 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Do you have time to train me a bit today? - Tue Nov 17 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What are you looking to learn? - Tue Nov 17 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Um...... - Tue Nov 17 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: I guess.... Anything right not. - Tue Nov 17 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: I want to learn as much as I can. - Tue Nov 17 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I need you to be specific. Learning has to be selective from the start so you know what path you want to progress to. - Tue Nov 17 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you currently take most interest in? - Tue Nov 17 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Um..... - Tue Nov 17 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Raiton, Suiton, and Kenjutsu. - Tue Nov 17 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you know so far? - Tue Nov 17 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Raiton chakra flow. - Tue Nov 17 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: okay sorry back - Tue Nov 17 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's it? - Tue Nov 17 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Pretty much. - Tue Nov 17 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then.. - Tue Nov 17 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sensei, you wanted me to learn that genjutsu diffusion thing right? - Tue Nov 17 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes his hands out of his pockets and scratches the back of his head with one. "I suppose I can teach you a quick lightning jutsu right here and now," he says in his leveled tone. He glances at Mitarashi, sizing him up a bit. From the looks of things the guy wasn't that physical build type of guy so Ortho knew he had to increase the boys' arsenal to contend. "Let's start off with the handseals." Ortho brings his hands to chest level, in Mitarashi's immediate line of sight, and began tying his digits together in numerous ways. He runs through the necessary handseals several times, keeping the pace moderate for the male to follow along. "As you know, lightning based technique requires a spark and constant vibration. This technique, similar to your Chakra Flow, is a more enhanced version --- all the while canceling out the weaponry enhancement aspect. That being said, as you generate the chakra and allow it to vigorously vibrate and pulse, you flow the chakra to your arms and release it. Keep in mind that you need to concentrate on the building up and release. The transition from your main source of chakra to your arms is the easy part, but the release and build up is tricky."

Throughout the stern lecture Ortho weaves the necessary handseals again. Ortho only gave a demonstration on rare occasions --- he wanted to assure himself, and the student in question, that the skill was comprehended and executed based on their own knowledge. That being said, he'd turn his attention away from Mitarashi and set it on Eri, "I did, yes. Are you ready to learn or have you found a way to learn it already?"* - Tue Nov 17 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "One thing about this technique you have to keep in mind is: it's not you using any form of nature affinities. It's strictly you stopping you chakra and rebooted it," he says in a leveled tone. He looks at Eri, sternly looking at her with his gaze and making sure he had her attention. He brings his hands to chest level once more and allowed the single handseal that was required for the technique to be weaved. "Like a I just said, you need to center your mind and focus on your chakra flow. From there, take grasp of your flow and abruptly halt it. Now, don't halt it for too long or you'll end up passing out or even worse.. die. When you start your chakra flow back up, give it a sudden push. Don't make it continue on its previous pace, push it to its limit. You'll know it worked when you feel like you're having a minor anxiety attack, but you're under complete control in the meantime."* - Tue Nov 17 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit as he watched Eri's attempt. "Focus more on your flow. Don't think of it in the manner of 'sections', but rather a whole unit. Attempting to chip away at your chakra will only have you feel the effects without actually performing the jutsu. Try again." Again Ortho's voice was straight forward, his plain expression making this stern situation all that much serious.

His eyes trailed off to Mitarashi, watching his flow of lightning slowly fade. "Add more chakra to it. Don't hesitate on the release, but be careful at the buildup. Make sure to make the transition smooth or your chakra would get lost in the process."* - Tue Nov 17 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) should've known this would've happened. He slowly shook his head, sighed and lowered his eyelids a bit. A sense of guilt overcame him and he just looked away for a brief second. "Yes, of course. Take your time, Eri. You've been working hard lately, you deserve a break," he says in a leveled tone. Despite his tone, however, his expression did show a bit of emotion, but not enough for it be to extremely noticeable off the bat. If anything, if the look on his face was noticed, it could be identified as a teacher being concerned about his student.* - Tue Nov 17 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: . . . - Tue Nov 17 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. Eri's posture was different as she strolled back into the village. For some odd reason she was more unwavering than she was when she departed. He didn't find this to be a bad thing, but he wondered what happened in that time lapse of her absence. To set things off even more, her statement completely caught him off guard. Ortho made it a priority to not get his villagers involved with what affairs he personally had with Kirigakure, but here he has his prodigal student basically asking for him to include her in the entire thing.

"I'm going to be honest, Eri. You've been on a fast track when it comes to your progression, but sending you on the front lines is asking you to commit suicide --- I can't do that. Simply put, the only thing you can do until the time is right is continue training, continue learning and I'm sure in no time you'll be able to take out armies with me." Ortho's voiced didn't sway with emotions, it was on a leveled tuning field and his expression was as plain as ever. "Do you understand?"* - Tue Nov 17 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'ma just creep away on that note. - Tue Nov 17 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but smirk. It wasn't look long ago he was in Supaiku's current position. He had to commend her though, to come to such a realization in a short amount of time --- it took him days upon days to do such a thing. He nods his head in approval.

"You've proven yourself from just saying that, Supaiku. I know you can come over any obstacle; I'm not worried about that; not in the least. We're at the stage in your progression where there honestly isn't much to do but to continue your training. Of course there are times where I have to leave the village for meetings and quick battles; I have no problem taking you with me. I'm confident in you holding your own when I'm there, but to send you out to war alone, I'm not doing that. You follow in my footsteps, but you cast your own shadow.. remember that."* - Tue Nov 17 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Shit... - Tue Nov 17 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) thinks: I can guess that the bird he just recived isn't good news. - Tue Nov 17 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks around, panic clear in his head movements. "I'm sorry to ruin this sentimental conversation but everyone pack your things, your heading to Amegakure.."* - Tue Nov 17 06:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. Izanami's approach was welcomed with open arms, but no hug was given. The unsheathing of the katana made Ortho smirk, the swift launch of it made him a bit excited.

Just as the blade was to make contact with the Ortho, the male sidesteps and grabs her wrist, bending it back a bit. At that point, a snake slithers from his sleeve and begin to wrap around her arm. "Surprise."* - Tue Nov 17 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grew thicker.

Izanami's retaliation was commended by Ortho, and as such a proper rebuttal is made. The spark of flames that engulfed Izanami was common knowledge to Ortho by now, Marrisa long since spammed it against him --- Wind Armor alike.

The snakes did coil around Izanami and were burnt to a crisp. Ortho forms a quick handseal and allow a sudden stream of chakra to rush up his throat and out puckered lips toward the child; soaking her completely. Not only that, but the aimed to knock her back in the process.* - Tue Nov 17 08:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He knew for a fact that he wasn't going to be able to dodge this technique fully, but he took his chance. He jukes to the right, trying his best to evade. However, his forearm is grazed slightly and just that was enough to burn him to a minor degree. Not to mention his entire arm begins to spasm.

Retaliation was a must so he'd quickly unsheathe a kunai and flow chakra through it. Just then, wind engulfs the kunai and began to spin while levitating of his palm. "Haven't used this in a while, sorry if I'm rusty.~"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's right arm was shot so he was only able to use one kunai, rather than shuriken. Even then, however, he'd only have one arm to work with once he launched the kunai forward.

"Ohh look at this. An old fashion standoff.~ Who's going to win?~

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's kunai glides back down to his palm and stops rotating. "By all means, you win. You're the only one that got a hit in."* - Tue Nov 17 09:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stares down at the scroll. His eyebrows furrow inward from anger and his body begins to shake. "Damn it, Nina.. I told you to stay in the fucking village.. I TOLD YOU TO STAY! WHY DON'T YOU EVER LISTEN TO ME!?"

He throws the scroll down and immediately went for the bird that rested on his shoulder --- it was expecting a reply soon. Ortho grips it by the throat, forming a single handseal with his free hand. Just then, with the hand that gripped the bird, a white snake unravels from Ortho's sleeve with widen jaws and intent to swallow the bird whole.

"EVERY FUCKING TIME! SHE GETS HERSELF INTO TROUBLE FROM THROWING HE FUCKING HISSY FITS THEN GETS HURT! NOW LOOK! I HAVE NO ONE ELSE, DAMN IT! NO ONE!'

This may seem bizzare but Ortho was actually yelling at the bird as it was being eaten. Clearly the bird wasn't the cause but the fuck else was going to explain this? Who was going to explain why Nina had to leave Shinkogakure and get herself into some fucked up situation?

Tears begin to flow down Ortho's cheeks, his chest was heaving and his head was lowered and slowly shaking.. "I have.. no one else.."* - Tue Nov 17 09:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But I guess i'm a bit dulled to that by now. - Tue Nov 17 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Ortho.... you don't really feel all alone. - Tue Nov 17 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You know you aren't alone... - Tue Nov 17 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: If these people weren't here now... You know I'd be holding you... I want to hold you so bad. - Tue Nov 17 09:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Remember, you have... me. Right? Me? - Tue Nov 17 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's free hand shot forth. He grabs Hatsujin by the collar and draped him up, pulling him closer in sheer anger.

"She's dead damn it! She's dea-.. No.. she's probably.. faking.. yeah.."

His head starts to vigorously shake back and forth, his mind refusing to accept the fact.

"Yeah, she's throwing a fit right now because her nail broke or something.. and.. and she's waiting for someone to take her out shopping or someth-.."

The angry expression fades from Ortho's face, his head continuing to shake. His grip on Hatsujin was released and instead he starts to pat the male on the shoulder.

"She.. can't be dead, man.. She..-" Hatsujin was pushed back, forcing Ortho to have no one to pat. His eyes divert down to Eri, tears continuing to flow down his face. Her words didn't fall on deaf ears, but his mind just couldn't register right now.

By this point Ortho's snake was done swallowing the bird and coiled back into his sleeve. Ortho continues to look down at Eri, slowly shaking his head now. "I told.. her.. not to leave.. I begged her to just.. stay and train here.. I did everything, asked.. everything.. said everything.. I-I.. I tried.. I really did.."* - Tue Nov 17 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I know you did, you really did but she was her own person. You can't do anything about it now but move on and let it change you ... do what needs to be done to avenge her when the time is right but for now you need to -calm down-. - Tue Nov 17 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You lied to me? - Tue Nov 17 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, holding it in for a few seconds. He stares down at Eri, nods his head. She was right after all and so was Ziare. He had to get a hold of himself and he had to calm down. Ortho says nothing.. his eyes just lowered a bit and shrugs. "..Fine.."

With that word his entire breath was released and he turns on his heels. "I'll.. be in the house.." Of course, unless he was stopped, he'd pace off to the northern structure.* - Tue Nov 17 09:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Tue Nov 17 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was sitting in the living room. He was slouched back with his head lead hanging low. Tears flowed down his face but there was no heaving of his chest of hysterical behavior. He heard the window opening and movement, but let's be honest.. he wasn't in the mood to be a investigator and go check it out. The only thing he did movement wise was bring his hands together to slowly form three handseals. Just then, a metal plate would spawn with a whole bunch of sake bottles on it..

"I told.. her to stay in the village," he murmurs to himself. "I.. told her.."* - Tue Nov 17 10:07:08 2015
