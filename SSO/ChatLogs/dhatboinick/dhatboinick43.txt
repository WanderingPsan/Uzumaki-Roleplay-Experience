<br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched the tactical retreat from Yan and the clones. A steady nod of his head was made as he swooped down to the ground at the fastest pace he possibly could. Seeing as though the Subterranean Voyage technique didn't grant magnetic field sensing of what was on the ground, Ortho took advantage of that.

Handseals are quickly formed as he began flying over the generic area. He's about seven feet off the ground and charging chakra through his body. As he continues to circle around the area, he extends his arms and faced his palms downward. At that moment, he'd begin sending surges of chakra through the earth, hoping to zap Yan and as much of the clones as he possibly could. It was a luck of fate at this point, but a tactic move to draw Yan out.* - Fri Nov 13 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || These clones were becoming a pest. Ortho surveys the scenario at hand and came to a quick decision. With a multitude of clones planning, and actually are, coming at him.. he'd react with their arch enemy. A set of handseals are formed in haste while his chakra quickly kneads within his body. At that moment, he'd begin unleashing a constant stream of lightning toward the Yan that was aiming to punch him and whichever remained attempted to close the distance between them.

Throughout this process, Ortho would maneuver through the air; a tactic to make sure that this became a one on one battle between him and Yan once more.
* - Fri Nov 13 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || This battle was intense. Yan was pulling off amazing feats of strategy to defeat Ortho and it was all commendable. The only thing that Ortho found annoying was the clones. A slow shake of his head was given as the mass of spikes came his way.

There was an easy counter to this and Ortho was going to exploit it. Unlike Ortho, the spikes were being affected heavily by gravity. As the sored through the sky at Ortho, all the Uchiha did was burst further up into the sky until the point where the spikes couldn't reach him. Upon doing so, he'd start to travel southward in an attempt to place his positioning over the original Yan.

Through this process, Ortho runs through another series of handseals. His lungs fill once more and his lips puckered. Just as his position in the sky rained over Yan's head, he'd look down and unleash another gust of wind. Following the wind came a unique handseals. Once the handseal was formed, a puff of smoke would emit from him and out came a shadow clone. This clone descended at such a rate with the gust of wind that it was almost blinding. The clone would string his own set of handseals and unleash a fireball to engulf the wide spread wind. The intentions were clear and simple; finish off Yan.* - Fri Nov 13 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't done. Not by a long shot.

His clone lifts his weight at the last second, activating the same jutsu Ortho was using to fly. Now, the clone wasn't about to take off back into the air; instead he breezes through a series of handseals and quickly needs his chakra. At that point, he'd crouch and unleash a devastating amount of electricity toward Yan's direction.

Ortho, in the meantime, started his descent back to the ground. Last he remember was Yan agreeing to a one on one, no pussy shit. Smack talk was spoken and now when it came time to throw hands, Yan wanted to hide behind clones and tactics that his speed/reflexes/and other stats couldn't even aid him with. Now, it was time for Ortho to stop being modest and unleash hell on this guy.* - Fri Nov 13 08:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noted that Yan's speed couldn't contend at the rate. The clone was already close to the ground due to the aid of Ortho's gust of wind and other factors. That being said, seeing as though Yan screwed himself over, the clone's electricity manages to zap the male of Sunagakure.

Ortho, the original, decides to add to that factor. Seeing as though this is another RP Round, and it took Ortho the same amount to ascend, it's a clear fact that he's touched ground once again. That being said, with handseals forming and a discharge of electrical chakra, Ortho aids his clone in the effort. In turn, with Yan's Ninjutsu Defense proving fodder to both the levels of electricity, Yan is easily deemed dead from the shock.* - Fri Nov 13 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walks off.* - Fri Nov 13 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's shadow clone was dispersed. He pats himself of, places his hands within his pockets and starts his pace back to Shinkogakure. He hadn't noticed Eri throughout the fight, but as he was walking he caught glimpse of her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) strolls up to the river, grabs his sleeveless jacket by the tail and pulls it off. He wasn't a complete caveman so he did manage to wrap it up in a little ball-slash-fold thing and drop it at the bank of the river. "So," he says with a smirk. "How we doing this? Clothes or no clothes?" He begins unwrapped the bandages from his right arm, openly exposing his scars and tattoos around Eri again.* - Fri Nov 13 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "You talk like you would've allowed something to happen~." He rolls the bandages up and looks down at his arm, flexing it a bit. He was surprisingly accepting of his scars this time around than he was when he first showed Eri. He shrugs a bit, wiping the thought of how he got them out of his mind and moved on to his other arm. "Stop playing and come in. I might each let you lay on me again if you're a good girl.~"* - Fri Nov 13 09:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you thought he was 'meant to leave'..? - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I thought he was meant to lay in my bed. - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...then leave. - Fri Nov 13 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Fri Nov 13 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Your honesty makes me respect you that much more. - Fri Nov 13 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ... you are a little insane. - Fri Nov 13 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you avoiding saying.. unorthodox..? - Fri Nov 13 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Or is that just not coming to your head at all? - Fri Nov 13 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Unorthodox is not insane. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It is simply strange. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Though you are strange. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So you honestly rather call me i- - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Why thank you..~ - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why do you enjoy that? - Fri Nov 13 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Being strange? Come here so I can tell you. - Fri Nov 13 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) offers his hand to her.* - Fri Nov 13 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Strange is misunderstood. Once I'm fully understood, my weaknesses are exploited. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Only a few people in my life I allow to exploit me. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You sure like to show me things that I shouldn't know. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gives a rather big smile. "Consider yourself lucky. Trust and respect makes even the cautious a daredevil."* - Fri Nov 13 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. He suspected that this was legit a 'business meeting' rather than him subtly trying to get some; confessions. "When it comes to snakes, I'm as good as it gets. Not to toot my own horn, but no one has reached the level of summoning and.. prowess.. as I. What you saw was just the icing."* - Fri Nov 13 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. "I'm going to be completely honest with you. I'm lusting for you. That's clear as day and I have no shame in admiting it; you're attractive and that just shows I have good taste in women. I didn't take my 'chance' the other day with you on my lap because you were basically out of it. I may 'crave' intercourse, but I don't 'crave' it enough to basically rape. I never will. My history with lovers is dark.. they all end up leaving in one way or another. If it's not me having to break away because of their motives, it's me being put on the backburner, willingly, for four years. So now, I see you as the ideal female to allow me to.. selfishly.. bury my remaining feelings and lust into.."

He slowly shakes his head, looking away. "Not going to say it was a smart idea for me to allow you to put a kunai to my neck.. but now you know you caught me at the right time at the right place. That will probably never happen again."* - Fri Nov 13 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) went quiet for a bit, thinking about the answer. He places his focus on Eri and shrugs. "I think at this point I'm -in- love. I promised to not disclose certain things about her, but let's just say that waiting these four years is only for a -chance-, rather than a sure thing. I mean.. I'm willing and all, but there are people that have more characteristic to being 'snakes' than I do.."* - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave another shrug. "More or less. Maybe a few shots of feelings mixed in there rather than me sounding completely pitiful, but beggers can't be choosers."* - Fri Nov 13 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Explain. - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I guess you can call it.. more than friends with benefits..? - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But.. friends with benefits.. - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than no.. strings attached. - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What emotions are you wanting? - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe just on- - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Haha, something you might not be able to give.. - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Compassion..? - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, I don't think that's the right one.. - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Then why me? - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn.. okay, take your time. - Fri Nov 13 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why you? Can't answer that. That's too close to a rhetorica question-like feeling. But the feeling im looking for involves compassion.. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just not -only- compassion. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe.. just maybe actual lust back? - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...how is it rhetorical? - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not, but it gives off the vibe. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just a question that can't be answered right. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I don't see why not. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why you? Because it just seems right that it -is- you. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The business meeting with you on my lap was strictly for you. I'm not going to say that temptation wasn't there but I wanted to see you through to the end.. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you being so cold just makes me want to warm you up.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Then why do -I- feel right? - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because you don't feel wrong. - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That is not a very good reason I hope you know. - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's the best I got. You feel right because you just have... - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Am I really going to say this..? - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, nevermind.. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Say it. - Fri Nov 13 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You.. have actual emotions and feelings.. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And know.. what you want.. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .....I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: The fact I am rude, selfish, and other negative things don't bother you? - Fri Nov 13 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nope. - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everyone is like that in some way. - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So your excuse is I am just more of those than others? - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're more independant - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) returns the kiss in the same manner her received it. He pressed his lips against hers while inching his arms for her waist. He swiftly pulls her body in more, but still allowed her more than enough room to break away from both his grip and their lips as she pleased. He raised an eyebrow while looking at her, running his tongue over his bottom lip.* - Fri Nov 13 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks and slowly shook his head, "and I'm the shark?" He follows her out of to the shower, watching her walk in front of him; pretty good sight.* - Fri Nov 13 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "You're playing a game that won't finish any time soon.. You know that, right?" He walks over to his jacket and picks it up, using it as a makeshift towel.* - Fri Nov 13 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugged. "Mhm. A game of chicken. Money says you break first."* - Fri Nov 13 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How much are we betting? - Fri Nov 13 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have four million in my pants pocket right now. - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Guess I better not lose. - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Implying you have a chance at winning?~ - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If I do lose what do you want in return, I can't pay that. - Fri Nov 13 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know yet. I'll think on the spot -when- I win. - Fri Nov 13 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that's not fair. - Fri Nov 13 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I find it funny that you think I'll actually make you bet anything. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This just a free pass for my to cop some feels and see what your breaking point is. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You think it's fair to even play this game? Of course you won't stop me if I touch you. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sits himself on the ground next to her, smirking. "You gonna call a quits before the game even starte-"* - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Actually.. not true. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm somewhat.. ticklish.. - Fri Nov 13 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why you making it harder on yourself? - Fri Nov 13 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I like the challenge. - Fri Nov 13 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...very well. - Fri Nov 13 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You starting or do you want me to go first and have you lose sooner?~ - Fri Nov 13 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How do you want to play? - Fri Nov 13 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: One thing at a time back an forth? - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sure, sure. - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) instantly knew that Eri was a cheat. He bites down on his tongue as her hands inched around his back and down to his boxers. He, in turn, reached behind her back and glides his hands down as much as she did. He knew for a fact his heart was racing, probably to the point where it can be heart as much as felt with her pressed up against him. As her fingers continued to inch, so did his; he applied mere squeezing and fondling that she did, why not exploit the chance? The look on Ortho's face didn't comply with all the cockiness he was displaying before, but again.. Eri was a cheat.* - Fri Nov 13 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. It was clear that he didn't even know if he made the right decision in denying the fact that there was a problem, but he was also determined to win. Instead of inching his fingers in between her cheeks, he would inch them more in between her legs, threatening to graze his index and middle finger over her lips and hole. "..G-Give me.. you best shot," he halfheartedly says. He knew he may end up regretting this.* - Fri Nov 13 16:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down hard on his tongue, trying his best not to clench; knowing that was a form of submission. Ortho, in turn, pushes his two fingers past her lips and into her hole. To take things a step further, he extends his thumb and runs it through her cheeks; resting it on her pucker as well. "Ju-Just give up already."* - Fri Nov 13 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't believe this. He actually, for the first time ever, bit off more than he could chew. Despite his attempts to tough things out, he slowly shook his head and whispered the magic words. "chicken.."* - Fri Nov 13 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pouts. His hand slips out of her panties and he glances over at his pants pockets. "Take it when I'm done with you. I got something.. more for you."* - Fri Nov 13 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What is that? - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let me show you.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I told you I would think about it. - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Didn't say I was going to try and fuck you. - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Such harsh words.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Don't act like you don't like it. - Fri Nov 13 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans over Eri, takes her by the shoulder and gently lays her back first against the grass. He stares down at her and inches his head forth, daringly going to kiss her on the neck. "Let me.. please you," he says in a hushed tone.* - Fri Nov 13 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) trails his kisses down her neck and to her upper chest, "wherever it leads.~" He reaches down for her panties and hooked them with two fingers, attempting to pull the down to her mid thighs. "Just lay there and let the shark be a shark."* - Fri Nov 13 16:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Why couldn't you just call chicken a few minutes ago?" He releases his grip on Eri's underwear, gliding his free hand up her thigh and to her mound. With his hand that was gripped, he'd completely raise to her side before slightly overpowering her and pinning her arm down into the grass. "Like I said, I don't do rape." The most Ortho was doing at this point is subtly massaging her mound, looking down her expression and waiting for a solid 'no'.* - Fri Nov 13 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's grip altered. Instead of pinning her arm down, he'd open his hand rest it hers; gently intertwining his fingers with hers. It went from pinning her down to simply holding her hand with no form of pressure applied. He continues to rub her against her lips, inching closer and closer to her entrance but doesn't actually go that far. Ortho's eyes narrowed in on her expression, seeing and feeling her mixed reactions. It was obvious something was on her mind and in return he leans in and whispers in her ears. "You're in control.. A simple 'no' and you'll have it your way."* - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) adds just a little bit more pressure to her mound, continuing to trail two fingers up and down her lips. By this point the fabric of her panties was trapped into a camel toe, his index and middle fingers aiding in its creation. Ortho leans his head on slightly as their eyes met, listening to what she had to say and understanding. Eventually, with her eyes momentarily closed, he inches the rest of the way in and presses his lips against her cheek and glides it down to her neck. "The pace doesn't matter. Kiss and don't tell, keep it between us. Conflicted mind and feelings and I'm all ears for the first sign of a no."* - Fri Nov 13 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pushes more on into her lips, the only thing hold him back from completely submerging his fingers into her was the thin underwear. Even then, he managed to get two fingers in; forced to stop by the first joint of both fingers. "Just me and you.. Countless hours of training and me teaching you," he says in a hushed tone. He begins nibbling on her neck, gracefully gliding his teeth and tongue against her skin before closing his mouth and puckering his lips into a kiss just below her ear. "Sex and friendship, whatever you like."* - Fri Nov 13 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly pulls his fingers out and trails up more. He bends the two fingers at the first joint every so often, completely caressing her lips and clit before trailing back down and entering her as much as he panties would allow. With her hold his other hand, he tighten his own hold but still let her have the tighter grip; assuring her that she was still in control of everything and had free will. He picks his head of slightly and extended his tongue to just outside the cage of his teeth, parting his lips a bit so as he sway his head toward her face, his tongue trailed across her skin. When he did make it to her face he'd pause a bit to tease her, wanting her to anticipate when he was going to plant his lips against hers.* - Fri Nov 13 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smiles a bit, his tongue still slightly hanging from his mouth. With Eri raising her head to kiss him, he'd meet her most of the way so she didn't have to do much; like he said at the start of this wall, she just needed to lay there and let him please her. His fingers once again extract themselves from out of her and trail up her lips to her clit. There, they circle on the nub --- gently and gracefully to continue driving her crazy. After a few circular motions he'd inch up his hand more, attempting to hook her panties by the waist. He stops there, giving her room to remove his hand while he physically asked permission to pull them off.* - Fri Nov 13 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls her panties down inch by inch, pacing himself accordingly to her moves and facial expression; his eyes were half-open to keep track of her expression. Within seconds her panties were down to her ankles and ready to be departed from her body. Ortho, with the hand he used to pull her panties down, takes hold her left leg and bends it at the knee, causing one ankle to slip out of the underwear. From there, with her leg still grasped, he pulls it all the way up to his shoulder and rests it there. He didn't want to exactly break the hold she had of his other hand for the sake of lifting the other leg so he just twists her body to the side just a little; allowing their lips to continue their wrestling and giving him leverage. Ortho was full erect,  but didn't dare to pull his boxers down just yet. Instead, he sways his hips forward, lining the tip of his member with her entrance; one fabric off just to tease her with the blocking of another.* - Fri Nov 13 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was teasing himself just as much as he was teasing her. The lust between them was picking up and Ortho didn't know if he'd be able to hold back for long. Still, he decided to ride things out for as long as he can. His hips continued to sway back and forth, he even added a bit of a circular motion to enter his tip from different angles each time. With their mouth now departed, he went for her neck. He acted like a suction cup and took her skin into his mouth, nibbling and licking on it. A few more moments and he knew that he'd have to go all the way with her.* - Fri Nov 13 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) complies, but at a good pace. Not too fast, not too slow. He reaches in between them and grabs his boxers by the waistband, pulling it down. By time it reached his cock he has to pull the waistband to the max and over the member. Ortho manages to wiggle his way out of the boxers, but not without intentionally rubbing his naked tip against her clit and lips; more teasing until they got what the both wanted. Before he knew it, his boxers were down to his ankles. He raises one knee, tucking it under him a bit for leverage and allowed his ankle to slip out. At that point, he lines his cock up with her entrance and slowly, but surely, pushes his way in.* - Fri Nov 13 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans his entire body in. With the tip of his cock already lined with her entrance, the slack in his body only push him in deeper. He didn't go all the way in one go so he'd pull his hips back until he was barely left inside her then go back in, digging himself deeper. This process continues until finally he based out in her; in which point he stays completely in her, wanting to feel her wrap around his cock and squirm through the rest of her body.* - Fri Nov 13 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) could practically feel Eri let go of her control, a sly grin forming on his face. A few seconds after her release, Ortho would begin swaying his hips back and forth. This was starting to me more than just a quick fuck session, but potential love making. Ortho releases a groan, showing her that he was enjoying this as much as she was. He brings his free hand to Eri's breast, cupping and squeezing while making an attempt to work his way under her bra.* - Fri Nov 13 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) did their thing without cumming in her. As they both cleaned up he'd smirk and nod his head. "Yes, of course. No pain no gain.~" Once he had his clothes on and Eri began walking off, he'd hop just a little and kept ascending. Once high enough, he'd burst off in the opposite direction.* - Fri Nov 13 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No, I have no reason to do so. But the village is going under lockdown soon for the sake of a possible threat which we were simply warned of and I'd like to allow you a chance to leave because I know not when we will go back to all clear. - Sat Nov 14 02:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I won't let my words be used for something that happens in the future. - Sat Nov 14 09:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods his head toward Eri, momentarily disregarding Hatsujin. His tucks his hands within his pants pockets and heads south toward the main exit. Just before he came out of Hatsujin's eyesight Ortho pauses, "what's done.. is done." With that, he continues walking.* - Sat Nov 14 09:33:26 2015

He extends his arm, offering the scroll to the female. "This is the contract I had to sign for the Snake summoning. Understand that the snakes of Ryuchi Cave isn't.. normal. If you disrespect them, they'll eat you whole.. and not in the way you wish them to do. If you show you're unworthy, they'll betray you mid battle.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, I do accept, Sir. - Sat Nov 14 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) extends his arm again, offering the scroll to her.* - Sat Nov 14 09:54:46 2015

Throughout his statements, Ortho would perform the necessary handseals for the summoning technique. Then, he'd do them in reverse to show her.* - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sits himself down on the grass, watching her be teleported. "Remember.. prove your worth.."* - Sat Nov 14 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Eri's arrival wasn't anything short of abrupt and random. From the moment she shows up she would hear the eerie sound of rattling. The cave itself was pitch black, but in the distance, deep within the cave, a flicker of light could be seen. Should she choose to continue forth is the first test, and possibly the hardest. The cave was as intimidating as it gets, easily comparing to the infamous Killing Intent technique.* - Sat Nov 14 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The cave was riddled with snakes of all sizes and colors. Each gave Eri their undivided attention as she progressed further and further into the cave.
