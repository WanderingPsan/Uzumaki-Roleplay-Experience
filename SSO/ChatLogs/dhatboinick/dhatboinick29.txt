<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It's common knowledge by now that Ortho was the ideal generalist. His abilities, as a shinobi, have proven to allow him to adjust to pretty much any situation. This time around, however, Ortho's proficiency inside the arts of Fuuinjutsu would prevail.

He seats himself on the ground, allowing his legs to fold over one another; granting him the common meditative posture. From within the confinements of his black cloak, Ortho would then extract a single scroll. The scroll was red in main color, but the ends were black. He unravels the scroll then placed it on the ground before him. Upon doing so, he'd then extract a small case of ink and a single pen. It was clear that he was planning on writing something, or even drawing.

He takes a moment to allow his mind to wander; he knew what he wanted to do, but he just had to think on how to effectively do it. It didn't take long before the metaphorical light bulb flickered on over his head. With a sly smirk, Ortho opened the casing of to the ink and dipped the end of his pen in. Once getting the pen nicely moisture, he'd move on to the scrolls' canvas. There, instead of writing, he'd begin tracing the outliers of a flower.

Within the petals of the flowers were individual markings, similar in shape in size but easily recognized of being different from one another. As Ortho began the inner most part of the flower, he'd carefully take the pen off of the canvas and dip it back into the case of ink. That brief moment between dabbing the pen in ink and carefully carrying back over to the canvas allowed his mind to refresh and gain more focus. The plan for the inside of the flower was to make a trigger-like effect for the seal.

"Alright, so if I was to draw that then place this next to it, once the person does this, that will happen," thought Ortho as his hand began to sway back and forth while the tip of his pen formed the necessary markings. Before Ortho knew it, he had managed to successfully draw the trickiest part of the entire seal. Still, though, he wasn't done. "Seeing as though the trigger is as it is, maybe it's best that the actual sealing and unsealing be two different methods. The trigger would act on both, but only if that was to happen." Ortho's mind continued to register and analyze his ideas, all the while he continues his drawing.

The middle of his lotus flower was where he'd be able to personally seal content into the scroll, along with forming a trap that once the scroll is opened after content is stored, and the content would lash out. Once Ortho was done with the inner drawing, he'd look over at his work of art and commend it. Thankfully, no mistakes were made and all was going to plan.* - Fri Oct 30 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet and dusted himself off. He'd crouch down to pick the unraveled scroll up and carried it off, making sure not to make it ravel back up in the slightest.* - Fri Oct 30 15:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) already knew what he wanted from Sunagakure's weapon shop; Kunai's, Poison Bombs and Explosive Tags. He wanders around the shop for a while, making sure to pick up the best of each item he needed. Not only that, he made sure to pick up as many of each as he could. Once reaching the cashier, the skeptical look he was given. Of course, like anyone else on a mission, he'd ignore the look and pay for all the supplies. By time he was check out, he managed to take a solid count of everything he bought; Thirty Kunai's, Fifteen Poison Bombs, and Fifteen Explosive Tags.

Once again, Ortho would take hold of his unraveled scroll, with the seal on it, and carry it off with the bag of supplies. Eventually, Ortho found himself settling into a nice house. He didn't know if anyone owned it, but it didn't matter since he wasn't looking to live there. He places the unraveled scroll on the dining room table and began the process of configuring the trap.

He started by taking each explosive tag and neatly wrapping them around the hilt of the kunai's. Seeing as though there were double the amount of kunai's than explosive tags, Ortho could only wrap fifteen of the kunai's. Upon doing so, he'd carefully stack the wrapped kunai's on top of the scrolls' canvas and formed a single handseal. That handseal was what was required to seal and unseal things from his lotus flower.

Ortho would then move on to the remaining kunai's and poison bombs. Seeing as though he could wrap the poison bombs around the kunai's, he'd instead place the small bombs within the gripping circle at the end of the hilts. This adds the effect that the kunai was completely harmless. Also, the wrapping of explosive tags around the first fifteen hilts was to possibly deceive the victim. Once each poison bomb was placed and each kunai was rigged, he'd stack them on top the same lotus flower and reform the handseal.

Ortho would extract his pen and case of ink once more, dipping the tip of the pen into the ink and began the process of drawing once more. Seeing as though the necessary weaponry was sealed, it was time for Ortho to put the finishing touches in. This time around, he'd draw a seal that would cause the explosive tags and poison bombs to go off once the initial trigger, the spawning of the barrage of kunai's, was activated. Afterwards, once completing the final stages, Ortho would ravel the scroll back up and carefully tucked it away.* - Fri Oct 30 16:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's stroll came to a stop. His eyes wander off a bit until finally resting upon the feminine physique of Rymei.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Rymei's reaction was anticipated. In all honesty, Ortho didn't blame her for being on guard. This shinobi world was a hell of a death trap, and in turn there was a reason for her to expect the unexpected. In turn, Ortho kept his calm and made sure to keep his arms folded across his chest. "Have I truly been gone that long? I suppose you and I had a brief conversation back when Hideki led me here. For memory refreshing purposes, my name is Ortho."* - Fri Oct 30 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) examined Rymei's frame once more, wandering why the defensive posture was yet to be released. Still, he put no blame in her. "I want to say something flattering, but then I'd be lying. I came to find a place to possibly rest my head along with a few friends of mine. The common village system is corrupt, and this place seemed like the best fit. On top of that, now that I have seen you, it is a decision I have not yet regretted."* - Fri Oct 30 20:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took his seat, allowing himself to be placed across from Rymei. Once again his eyes wandered across her frame, admiring the sight like any other male would. He, however, was more respectable with it by not making any verbal comment. His face remained straight, not wanting to give off any sign that he was checking her out. "Anything you want is on me."* - Fri Oct 30 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's expression remained subtle, not minding what Rymei ordered in the least bit. Ortho, however, was a liquor man. "I'll have your finest, and strongest, sake." Upon saying that, he'd glance back at Rymei. "I'm guessing the formal 'getting to know you' bit is out of question?"* - Fri Oct 30 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: What did you need to know? - Fri Oct 30 21:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm going to get into the real deal, if you don't mind. - Fri Oct 30 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 30 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Quite frankly, I wish to know what makes you... you. What has occured in your life that makes you who you are before me now. - Fri Oct 30 21:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: That...I don't like talking about. - Fri Oct 30 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head nodded slowly. "I understand. Forgive me if I stepped over my bounds." His eyes wandered off a bit, silence striking the two of them. Thankfully, however, a waiter walks up with what they ordered. Upon arrival, the waiter would give Ortho his specific order before turning to Rymei and supplying her with the same. Out of customer respect, the waiter would take a brief bow and paced away. "I've only been to Genjigakure a handful of times. Each I can distinctively remember seeing you. Do you have a family here?"* - Fri Oct 30 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) could easily relate to Rymei's reasoning. He too felt like some factors in his past should remain just that; the past. It must be a whole other level of pain and sorrow for Rymei to think that her complete upcoming should be placed away in a box to never be opened again. Maybe Ortho was just jumping the gun, but maybe if the gun wasn't so close to the ground Ortho wouldn't find it so easy to jump over. "I know not of your past, but from the way you stay alert I must commend you. Not many shinobi hasten themselves for battle as you did back at the training grounds."* - Fri Oct 30 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't see the point in two people being at the beach, but only one going into the water. He understood where Chi came from, so in turn he'd pace himself out of the water and toward her. There, he'd flop down on to the ground back first and look up at the sky. His arms would raise and fold to the back of his head, acting as a pillow. "Is it that you can't swim or you're scared of water?~"* - Sat Oct 31 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Ahh, okay. I get it." Ortho remains calm about the reason given to him; a true show of his maturity. His eyes slowly close, allowing him to further the relaxed state he was in. "I haven't seen Mana lately. Is she okay? I found someone that's willing to train her in Taijutsu."* - Sat Oct 31 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There was silence.

Chi's question didn't fall upon deaf ears, but a hastened answer wouldn't do justice. Ortho's mind began to wander, his eyes remaining shut in the process. What was the true definition of peace anyways? How do you even achieve it? And once you have achieved peace, how do you maintain it? What does it take to allow the shinobi of this world to just take a step back, analyze things and move toward peace? These questions are what Ortho thought about on a regular, and it's these questions he seeks the answers to.

"We lack understanding. The water, grass, wind and all that understand that they need one another to thrive.. so they make it their priority to move in a manner where, in the long run, they get some benefits from helping the next. We, as shinobi, have yet to open our eyes and see that."* - Sat Oct 31 00:53:45 2015
