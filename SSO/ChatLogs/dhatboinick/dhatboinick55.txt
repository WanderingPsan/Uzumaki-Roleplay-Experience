They were grown males and females, surely she knew, despite his own desire to not seem like a thirsty asshole, that holding hands is close to nothing. He didn't rebuttal to what Akarui was attempted to do, he just played it off like nothing even happened.* - Sun Nov 29 02:04:09 2015

They all knew Akarui was the type to be embarrassed from just hugging herself, now she's trying to be all loving to Sogeki?

He sighs.

"One step at a time Akarui, we know you're not ready for that," he says in a hushed tone while gently pulling her off and straightening her clothing. "Rushing will get people hurt.."* - Sun Nov 29 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) got serious. He paces himself away from Akarui, ignoring her warning all together. His eyes fixate on Takuma and narrows, allowing him max focus. In a swift movement Sogeki reaches for his bow and unsheathed three kunai's. "Fake out," he murmurs to himself.

He loads the three arrows, while masking one beneath another, and cocked the string back. Upon doing so, while aiming just above Takuma's head, Sogeki would let go. One of the three arrows was launched in a specific manner, let's just label that arrow as "Arrow Three".

Arrow Three acted as Arrow One's shadow. Meanwhile, Arrow Two was specifically aimed for Takuma's chest. Arrow One, while aimed for the top of Takuma's head, would enter the males' immediate line of sight. In turn, Arrow Three, whilst in the shadow of Arrow One, would aim directly for Takuma's lower peripheral --- his nuts.

Of course each arrow had something unique to them but depending on the outcome of this attack, Sogeki would hold off.* - Sun Nov 29 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's narrowed. What a thrill this was. Quickly, with the massive gulf of fire raging forth, Sogeki would leap forward in the generic direction Takuma was heading. At that moment, would tucking his body forward and going for a summersault-like maneuver, he fully roll and stop in a position that placed him with one knee on the ground and three more arrows unsheathed.

His loaded one of the three arrows and let it fly toward Takuma's location. Of course, like the previous three arrows, there was a trick attached.* - Sun Nov 29 02:51:05 2015

He wasn't extremely scared by them, but if he had a choice to have one crawl over his body or not, he'd choose the latter without hesitation. Still, with it lunging itself at Sogeki, the man with an unmatched level of pride stood there. He held his breath, clenched his fists and closed his eyes, determined to remain perfectly still. "Okay, okay," he stammers a bit while emitting a hushed tone. "I-I get the point.. call it off.."* - Sun Nov 29 06:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) wasn't having that. "Okay..!-," he takes in a deep breath, "..okay.. you win this round! call it-.. call it off..!"* - Sun Nov 29 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || "Deep breaths, deep breaths, deep.. breaths.."

He gathers his mind and slowly shook his head. He knew that the spider wasn't his worst fear, but forget that. He wasn't going to take any chances with a spider copping feels. No sir.

He looks at Kariudo and heard her girlish laughter, it gave him fuel. He immediately takes out an arrow, specifically one from the poison compartment of his sack. The end of the arrow, the most destructive, is dripping in purple liquid. He'd aim that end right to Kariudo's line of sight and inched himself closer to her. He made sure not to make any form of physical contact, but still made actions that he was either leaning in slowly to plant a kiss on her while threatening to have the arrow pierce through her neck.

"Which one you rather?" he asks with a sly smirk on his face. "The arrow that's dripping in paralysis poison.. or for someone you barely know to plant a kiss on you?" With each word he'd inch closer and closer to Kariudo, invading her personal space without making physical contact with their bodies. However, the tip of the arrow just 'barely' glides over her neck. "Even if you choose the kiss, just imagine me paralyzing you and having you all.. to myself.~"* - Sun Nov 29 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This sounds like something Shiro-chan would do to me.... - Sun Nov 29 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) tilts his head to the side a bit and continues to lean in. Their lips were so close that the mere heat off of Sogeki's breath could be felt, but there was no physical contact. When she raised her chin they were so close to grazing one another that Sogeki had to back up just a bit then reenter the atmosphere without actually kissing her. His arrow, on the other hand, trails down her upper neck and down to her collar bone until finally reaching a steady amount of clothing and fabric.

"I mean.. if it was up to me..? I'd been slice through all this, lift you up and just take you as my own.~ But let's not forget my lucky arrow here. He's going to join in on the fun by subduing you with just the.. slightest," he apples a little pressure to her upper chest, right above her right breast, "tiniest," he applies more pressure, "smalleessst~," even more pressure, "little," he backs the arrow up and brings it back to her neck, grazing it against her skin slightly but cause absolutely no damage, "poke."* - Sun Nov 29 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: F-fuck... - Sun Nov 29 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's torture only continued. He backs his head up and smirks while looking Kariudo in the eyes, "there's only one way to find out if you'll like it or not.~" There was absolutely no reason for him to back up to say that, but it was all part of the blame. The arrow leaves her neck and goes back to her chest, pressing directly on to her breast this time around. He then leans his head back in, clearly puckering his lips for her to see and tilting his head to the side. He was really going for a kiss. If she didn't stop him, she was to expect a full on lip to lip transaction between them. Either she caved or she don't.~* - Sun Nov 29 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was a bit surprised.

Their lips were officially locked and the arrow that applied pressure to her right breast went slack. His arm dropped altogether and his eyes remained opened. His focus was on Kariudo's visage, scanning for any form of emotion. The only thing he could find, which honestly disturbed him because of what was said mere seconds ago, was disgust. He knew that he was a savage and he knew that he lived the savage life, but disgust? His breath wasn't stinking, unless she didn't like the smell of sake. His mouth didn't taste sour, unless she doesn't like the aftertaste of more sake. She didn't even have to worry about him trying to wrap his arms around her and take a firm hold of that ass, unless she secretly wanted to and was using this disgusted expression as a way to cheat her way to victory.

He chuckles through the half-kiss. Clearly she didn't return the kiss, but more than likely just the hint of more persuasion can do the trick. He reaches behind him and dips the, now dried up arrow, in the poison containment within his sack. At that point, while leaning in even more to apply additional pressure to her lips, since he can't see her extra arms prevent hurt from hurling --- if she hurls he's suiciding, Sogeki extracts the arrow and reapply it to its previous location.

He, for one, was oblivious to a spectator. In all honest? He wasn't even doing anything wrong. He was abiding by the rules set and working his way to victory like any other determined person would.* - Sun Nov 29 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was deep into the kiss. Hell, he was more than deep into the kiss. Quite frankly, he was enjoying the hell out of the kiss. To him, before he was pushes off and mistakenly cutting Kariudo, this was all a competition he was winning. This was a game that he could be checked off his list and claim himself to be victor. In reality, however, this game was a dead tie. He caved once and Kariudo caved once. Of course he planned on continuing until he officially claimed the victory as his own.

The weakness in Kari's push didn't go unnoticed. Sogeki was well aware of it, but misinterpreted it fully. He thought that she was so weak in strength because the appliance of more pressure had her lusting, his chest broadens with pride. Suddenly, the familiar stammering voice is heard and he looks around. He no longer had his arrow gripped so as he looked over at his shoulder at Akarui and waved for her to come closer, it didn't look like anything much was going down. He was still oblivious to how long she has been standing there and how much she saw, but it didn't matter to him --- he did no wrong.

His gaze set back on Kariudo and he smirks, "say you quit and I'm the king!" The infliction of poison to Kariudo was also obviously oblivious to him.* - Sun Nov 29 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...Holy -shit- that hurt. - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: When did he get me? - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I didn't even feel it. - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) still saw nothing wrong about any of this. His perspective was completely different from Akarui, and of course her biased impression on all guys kicked back in and instantly labeled Sogeki as one of the bunch. The comment given to him by the female only set him back for a few minutes, he shook his head in shock.

Was he truly at fault for enjoying the taste of victory? They didn't even kiss, it was just him applying pressure to her lips as she just stood there attempting to assure that he didn't best her in the competition. There was nothing perverted or humanly wrong about what they were doing. Of course he couldn't exactly blame Akarui for reacting the way she could, but let's be honest here. Sogeki should be able to fuck any girl he wants and get caught in the act by Akarui without there being and repercussions. The level of fuckery that Sogeki has been putting up was way more than what Akarui was viewing. He interpretation of it all, without even hearing a side of the entire story, was wrong in comparison to exactly what was going on.

Kariudo tumbled over and Sogeki instantly knew what was going on. He smirked to himself, but not much to make it seem like he truly enjoyed the situation at hand. Yes, in his mind, he was the victor of his battle, but he was still wary of Kariudo's response to the poison. Being 'worried' was an overstatement, but still.. he wasn't going to chase after hinata while someone with their head screwed on right as slumped over on the ground. By nature he rushes to Kari's side and began aiding in any way he can. He knew the poison he created and he knew how it'll last, but necessary steps were required to be taken before he gives her the vial of healing. * - Sun Nov 29 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: And K-Kari just took it. . . .she didn't even get sick. . . - Sun Nov 29 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Both the people I like. . . - Sun Nov 29 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Why. .  - Sun Nov 29 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes. The same old sob story. He heard it plenty of times and honestly didn't feel any type of way. He knew the truth behind this all and he knew what was going on; Akarui's sobbing was in complete vain. If anything, Sogeki was sick and tired of it. He raised his head and looked over at the female.

"The last thing I need is that sob story. You're sitting there crying over something you don't understand. You have selective thinking and it's going to get you hurt in the end. Before you jump to conclusions and consider the worse, tighten up and ask questions. I've played your game long enough."

Sogeki's voice was surprisingly harsh. It was obvious that he was fed up of the same old routine and the stupid confusion Akarui LIVED in. The way she acted, the way she talked, the way she thought, the way she went about things.. it was all so "ugh" and massively annoying. He couldn't get mad at her for being her, but when it came to situations where she has to actually 'think' and not have someone hold her hand throughout the entire process, he wished that she was just someone more.. confident. It sickened him at this point to see her sobbing over literally 'nothing'.* - Sun Nov 29 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't care less if Akarui was sad, happy, serious, playful or anything in those categories. He was fed up of the entire situation. He was fed up of her mood swings, he was fed up of her beliefs that made close to no sense, he was fed up of how she played the victim, he was fed up of her voice, he was fed up of her actions, he was fed up of her.

Here questions and statements was so close to being over looked and placed on a backburner that it was almost unbelievable. The level of disregard that he was willing to display because of the anger  HE harbored couldn't be verbally expressed, and it's for that reason why he took the time out to bite down on his tongue and quickly consume the first wave of blood that spewed from the wound. He slowly shook his head.

"A simple competition between she and I. It was nothing more and it was nothing less. The reason she tumbled over is because a stipulation in the competition managed to get the best of her."

Throughout the explanation Sogeki finished preparing the antidote. He takes out a needle, gathers the liquid-based solution and injected it into the side of her breast --- the same breast that was the victim of the initial cut. In just a few moments Kariudo would begin to having feeling in her body

Side Note: He indeed had her on his lap. He was sitting down on the ground with one leg extended out as a pillow for her head and the other slightly raised by the knee while the sole of his feet firmly contrasted against the ground to add leverage to his posture.* - Sun Nov 29 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Jeez, sometimes she's worse bi-polar thanme. - Sun Nov 29 09:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) didn't bother to answer those two questions. The look of disgust, in a more generic basis in comparison to selective of certain situation that Kari displayed a few minutes ago, plastered itself on his visage. This entire conversation got on his nerves and made his stomach turn and do endless loops. Anger swelled within the deepest pits of his body and it was clear, from just his slight movements and excessive twitching of random muscles across his body that he was extremely close to the edge.

He keeps his poised on Kari's face. He checked her eyes, the color of her face and any coldness in her temperature. If everything checked out fine he'd lean back, placing his hands on the ground behind him and just sat there until she was able to move and talk. He didn't doubt, with her level of defiance that she's displayed thus far, that in a few minutes she'll attempt to sit up and walk the remaining side effects off.* - Sun Nov 29 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stayed there in he leaned back state and kept his eyes on Kariudo. He had nothing more to say and most likely won't even speak of this situation again unless the subject was brought up by someone else.

He released a sigh and slowly shook his head to himself --- never before has he felt such.. hate.* - Sun Nov 29 09:13:23 2015
