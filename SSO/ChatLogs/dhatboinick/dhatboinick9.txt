<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, watching Paine settle herself into the seat. Her actions were hesitant, and that's what Erebus really wanted to figure out; why was she so quiet and distant compared to the others? "No, it's fine. Whatever makes you feel comfortable..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened, he didn't expect much of laughter from Paine. A small smirk formed on his own visage as he watched her. Paine's words rang through his ears and he felt like he had some form of understanding on why she was so quiet.

"Around me you can talk as much as you want. I am a being that pass no judgment on anyone; everyone is equal in my eyes."* - Sat Sep 26 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stared intently at Paine, only being able to view what her white cloak and hat didn't manage to cover; that wasn't much. His arms were stacked on top of one another while they rest on the table. Just when Paine was going to reply to his comment, the waiter arrived with the drinks. Despite the waiters' arrival, Erebus didn't break the visuals he had on the female; he was determined to have the type of understanding where comfortableness was all that was available around him.

He reaches for his cup and lifted it in the air, clinking it against Paine's; granting her wishes. Beforehand, though, Erebus spoke. "To no judgments, just understandment."* - Sat Sep 26 17:16:22 2015

They weren't exactly intruding, but Erebus did pick a secluded area in an attempt to make Paine feel as comfortable as possible. Still, however, this was a public place and they had all right to be here as well. Whilst shrugging them off, Erebus would look back at Paine and gave her a subtle smile; let's not forget that Erebus natural emitted evil, despite his efforts.

"Just you and I, Paine. You don't have to worry about them."* - Sat Sep 26 17:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || "A home is any place you go and have the ones you love the most there. A place is known as home when you're able to lay your head to sleep and not have to worry about the outside world. A place is known as home wherever you're the most comfortable.

You have to understand that not everything is in your control. You may not be able to protect someone that's in pain now, but if you continue to strive hold your head up, soon enough their pain will be numbed; whether or not they are not around  to see you achieve that power.

The only path you should take, as a being within this Shinobi world, is the path that makes you feel and know within yourself that you're doing the absolute best for yourself. Care not for the judgment that the others place on you. The only person you should trust is yourself, for the only person you have control over is you. Feelings blind you, yes, but at the same time they will enlighten you. If you see that your feelings are clouding your vision, the only thing you could do is wipe those feelings away and open your lids.

These questions are nowhere near odd. They're your questions and I'm here to answer 'em for you."

Erebus looks down at his cup of sake, lifting it to his lips and taking a sip.* - Sat Sep 26 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet as well and made his way around the table. With his cup still grasped, he'd take a final gulp before placing it down and reaching his arm out; he was suggesting that Paine took his hand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) firmly, but gently, grasped Paine's hand. Intimacy was involved, but more of an attempt at mutual standing points for them two. Erebus, being the usual ruthless one, wasn't used to this, but he'd stop at nothing to allow Paine that satisfaction of knowing someone 'different' existed and it wasn't just her in this terrible shinobi world. With her hand grasped, he'd attempt to tie his fingers with hers while giving a subtle smile, listening to her speak and guiding her out of the shop. Using his free hand, though, he'd take out a wad of cash and placed it on the table to pay for the drinks.* - Sat Sep 26 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || "I don't really utilize Ninjutsu or Genjutsu. I'm more of a close-combat type. This is also going to be my first time actually training too, I've been looking for someone to supply me with some scrolls on Taijutsu techniques, but I've had no luck."

Erebus raised his arms, stretching out his muscles. His cranium began to roll around in his three-sixty degree fashion, allowing his neck to loosen a bit as well. His eyes momentarily closed as he took in a slow, deep, breath. He centers his mind with his intake of air and flushed out any outside interferences as he exhales, serenity and focus.* - Sat Sep 26 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || "I am a mix between Kenjutsu and Taijutsu. I don't treat either as a backup, for I tend to mix the two into a fighting style. I just need to find someone willing to pass on some Taijutsu knowledge."

Erebus released another breath, allowing his centered mind and mental focus to continue. He begins the process of disrobing his upper body; his movements were slow paced and seemingly calculated. Each intake of breath was scheduled and each outtake of breath was preplanned, everything was moving in a steady flow. Erebus' eyes remained closed, providing no outer visuals to distract him from the task at hand. A steady concentration was formed with his mind, body and senses; the perfect meld for the perfect training session.

Now that his body was less weighted down after stripping off his upper clothing, Erebus began the regimen. He starts off with allowing his frame to hop in place, an act of preparations for the upcoming technique. Using the moment gathered from hopping, Erebus pivoted forward; each step he took was coordinated. After a full stride of merely four steps, tying his final step with a snap of his ankle to become aerial bound, Erebus stretched his opposing leg forward. The sheer thrust of his leg snapping forth and the speed at which he was moving caused a miniature gust of wind to pass through the area; Erebus was truly picking up on this technique and his overall speed. 

For the most part, however, Erebus was attempting to perfect this technique. One fault, for the time being, Erebus had was the sheer lack of continuous moment. Yes, he was an expert at the infamous Dynamic Entry, but to perfect and master it was his goal. Whilst launching himself forward, Erebus was only to have that short burst to rely on for impact. If he was able to have a constant flow of moment whilst momentarily airborne, then things will be a lot easier. Erebus still had to figure out exactly how to do that, or at least come to some form of assumption.* - Sat Sep 26 20:12:09 2015

Each step Erebus took only caused the air to thicken with the stomach-rattling aroma, relentlessly attacking the sense of smell. His head raised slightly, allowing him a better view of the mass of people before him. A single grunt is heard, it echoed throughout the area and within an instant Erebus dashed forward.

Whilst traveling at top speed, the God of Death set his destination on Izanami. Caring not for her wellbeing, Erebus would grab the child and dashed backwards, creating room between them and the group. Erebus grips one of his scythes, placing the blade to Izanami's throat and smothering her nose and mouth with the opposing palm.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || A messenger bird swoops down and drops a scroll before Erebus. After picking it up from the ground and reading it, the Jashinist looks up at Yumiko; she had nothing to do with the scroll in hand. It took Erebus a few seconds of thinking before opening his mouth to give Yumiko a steady answer. "You're allowed to stay."

His voice was subtle, but a bit of aggressiveness was apparen; that was his usual tone. Without much being said afterwards, Erebus would pivot forth and head to leave the area, unless stopped.* - Sun Sep 27 10:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Sun Sep 27 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Because of my history with Zetsumo isnt it? - Sun Sep 27 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Sun Sep 27 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You certainly move fast. - Sun Sep 27 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Pressing matters deserve haste. - Sun Sep 27 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not going to lie, though; never thought I'd get an reply from you. - Sun Sep 27 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood before Suitengu, arms folded across his chest and observant eyes. His pupils scanned over the boys frame, taking in what physical features may have been altered since the last time the spoke; Suitengu's eyes seemed to have progressed. Erebus, being the skeptic he is, said nothing; he figured that any questions that needed to be asked would be answered in due time. Nevertheless, however, Erebus made up his mind to keep Suitengu under his direct wing --- the last thing that needed to happen was people hunting the boy down for whatever reason.

With a nod in response to Suitengu's request, Erebus would unwrap one of his arms and extend a palm to Suitengu; an offer for him to step forth and accept the fact that security and guidance will be provided. Erebus rink of demonic aura, but even a demon had a favorite son; Suitengu just might be Erebus' favorite. If Suitengu was to take Erebus' lead, the Jashinist would place his arm on Suitengu's shoulders and paced alongside him away from the village.* - Sun Sep 27 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There.. is something you must know, Suitengu. - Sun Sep 27 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Okay. - Sun Sep 27 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I managed to take over Amegakure. - Sun Sep 27 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I took out all two-thousand remaining forces and replaced it with my one-thousand seven-hundred. - Sun Sep 27 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. Then congratulations on your victory. - Sun Sep 27 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was extremely observant. He sought out any form of reaction from Suitengu, anything that'll register as emotional discharge.* - Sun Sep 27 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Would you rather Amegakure or Konohagakure? - Sun Sep 27 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in understanding, not bothering to question the decisions of Suitengu. For the most part, Erebus was going to allow the boy to progress at a rate he felt most comfortable at; only interference that was going to be provided is if Suitengu seemed to run off path. With a pivot forward, after momentarily stopping them to talk, Erebus continues his trail alongside Suitengu.* - Sun Sep 27 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) is seen walking into the garden leading to the Hokage's manor alongside Suitengu. Just like a father strolling with his son, Erebus' arm was around Suitengu's shoulders as the progressed forward. Upon meeting the midpoint of the garden, Erebus would stop their trail and look at each person before them.

"If you don't already know, this is Suitengu. He is to be treated with respect and care, each wish he has must be granted to the best of your abilities. Anything you can't fulfill must be reported to me and I'll handle it personally."* - Sun Sep 27 10:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I hope we can get along. - Sun Sep 27 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) lowered his head a bit, not allowing Suitengu's words to fall upon deaf ears.* - Sun Sep 27 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hmm..? Sure.. - Sun Sep 27 10:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looks toward Yumiko.* - Sun Sep 27 10:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Erebus if I may ask, why did you bring Suitengu here? - Sun Sep 27 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) led Suitengu toward the manor.* - Sun Sep 27 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My business. - Sun Sep 27 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, take a seat. - Sun Sep 27 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No need to stand. - Sun Sep 27 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've noticed his eyes before, but I am not the one to ask questions that only time will answer. - Sun Sep 27 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .. I see. There is something important I will have to tell you, it involves why I asked to come here. - Sun Sep 27 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh..? What might that be? - Sun Sep 27 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The only movement provided from Erebus was him slowly leaning back in his chair. From just looking at him you could tell that he was registering everything said in his mind; knowing Erebus, he was probably devising some plan or method on how to use this news to his advantage. Still, however, the overall facial expression to Suitengu's words remained the same; nonexistent.

"What are your feelings toward the idea of banding together with them..? I'm sure you expected my curiosity with your eyes, along with the news of theirs, to flare up, no?"* - Sun Sep 27 11:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I don't like the idea. - Sun Sep 27 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: When I am around another one of them.. I just feel the -need- to harm them. To kill them. - Sun Sep 27 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I have always been well at keeping my feelings bottled down, but this is different somehow. - Sun Sep 27 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Tell me, Suitengu: at what cost would to seek out their deaths? - Sun Sep 27 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... I would take every cost required to have them all dead before me.  - Sun Sep 27 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Sun Sep 27 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you share the same abilities as Zetsumo? - Sun Sep 27 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I do. - Sun Sep 27 11:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet and snapped his fingers. As if on cue, two Jounin leveled NPC's would arrive behind a puff of smoke. Erebus points to Suitengu while eyeing the guards; they already knew what the deal was. Afterwards, while supplying Beth was a nod of goodbye, the Jashinist departs.* - Sun Sep 27 11:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm. Is it through blood or any body fluid? - Sun Sep 27 12:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd like to demonstrate something to you, but it's a bit unorthodox. - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you willing? - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: ...Well..Okay.. - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Plant a kiss on me. - Sun Sep 27 12:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm sure. - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's palms found Yumiko's hips, gripping her tightly as he leaned into the kiss. With no fear or hesitation, his lips parted slightly and allowed their bodily fluids to merge. Both his eyes were open, no real emotions displayed within them. Their lips continued to press against one another, no real rebuttal coming from the Jashinist.* - Sun Sep 27 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's lips broke away from Yumiko's, allowing them both the freedom to speak. As if taking full advantage of the departure, Yumiko provided Erebus was a skeptical response to his lack of side-effects. "Lets just say I've worked my way past the normal means of death."* - Sun Sep 27 12:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's ears twitched, the comment of Asteroth not falling upon deaf ears. His head slowly turned as his eyes set on the blonde female, narrowing as she approached. With his hands still on Yumiko's hips, he's shift a bit to have her seating upon his lap.

"Repeat what you just said.."* - Sun Sep 27 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) whispers: (Indeed. Im a demon summoner. I summon demons from Jashin's realm or w/e - Sun Sep 27 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) subconsciously squeezes Yumiko's left thigh as Asteroth approached. He set his gaze on the worker, providing her an emotionless expression.

"We'll take your finest meal and your finest drink."* - Sun Sep 27 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Smile...? - Sun Sep 27 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Mhm.. - Sun Sep 27 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I'm but a typical villager..Will you show me a smile?..My leader? - Sun Sep 27 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Leader? But Katsune's the Hokage. . . - Sun Sep 27 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..A smile.. - Sun Sep 27 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) seemed as though he was really trying to piece together the request. He was able to smile, yes, but now when put on the spot like this. Erebus looks up at Yumiko, seeing as though she was slightly levitated due to her being on his lap, and allowed the edges of his lips to crook a bit. They curled in a legit attempt to smile, it seemed to be a strain for Erebus but the effort to actually smile was shown.* - Sun Sep 27 12:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's.. the best you're getting. - Sun Sep 27 12:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) casually looking away, having no words for the situation at hand.* - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So, uhh.. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: *cough*.. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yeah, don't Erebus. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi, listen. - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) nodded.* - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Does he even believe that himself? - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What a nice business meeting. - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm gonna have to buy a milkshake with a straw. - Sun Sep 27 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's the only way to drink something right now. - Sun Sep 27 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Such a good man.~ - Sun Sep 27 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Cheers? - Sun Sep 27 13:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Erebus of all people, unbelievable. - Sun Sep 27 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I bet there are times when Erebus wants to kill himself . . . Tries to do so and fails cause of his immortality. - Sun Sep 27 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) thinks: I'm sure he means well. - Sun Sep 27 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: These people. . To do this. .-- Despicable.. - Sun Sep 27 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looked toward Yumiko, astonished at how she assumed he was going to pick up bill. A sigh escaped his lips as he alters Yumiko's position on his lap and dug into his pocket, taking out a wad of cash. The bill was five thousand, but Erebus took out a hundred-thousand. He changes his gaze toward Asteroth and gave her the fakest smile possible.

"Five-thousand for the bill, Ninety-five thousand to get your attitude fixed."* - Sun Sep 27 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Oh shit. - Sun Sep 27 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) thinks: Compassionate I see. - Sun Sep 27 13:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Milkshake with straw. - Sun Sep 27 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) grip on Yumiko's thigh loosened, allowing her to shift and wiggle her way to sit next to him. He tucks both his palms into his pants pockets while nonchalantly leaning back a bit, listening to the words Yumiko had to say. Erebus, within himself, knew that he was nowhere near being good or sane, but to allow Yumiko to dream was his priority at this point and time. Still, however, he had to make some form of rebuttal.

"Longer you stay at the bottom of that river, the more likely you are to drown; clean or not."* - Sun Sep 27 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Wise words...You didn't just take me here for an interview...Did you? - Sun Sep 27 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes.. but no. - Sun Sep 27 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You answered my only two questions, but the rest was for my personal wants. - Sun Sep 27 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Personal wants?...Someone powerful of this world has those?..Hm, well..I like to see alittle effort~.. - Sun Sep 27 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: *Takes his right hand out of his pocket and placed it on Yumiko's left thigh, inching it up little by little. - Sun Sep 27 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Even the most sinister and demonic of beings have wants. - Sun Sep 27 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Well, I am a virgin to -demonic- shadow lords...Ya  manage to convince me well enough..I'd not mind what you do..I'm not afraid of any demon..After all..Even death smiles..When Life gives him a gift, right? - Sun Sep 27 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm not as demonic as most may think. I do rink of death and blood, but if I don't see a reason to kill, I won't. - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Death do smile, though, but not as often as you think. - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: *Erebus continues to inch his hand up Yumiko's thigh, slowing down the pace a bit as he neared her sacred region*. - Sun Sep 27 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: I-if you want such...I'd rather not it be here... - Sun Sep 27 13:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Then lets get out here. - Sun Sep 27 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: To be violated infront of others is not what I wish..You lead. - Sun Sep 27 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet, allowing his hand to take Yumiko's and aid her in standing as well. Afterwards, after pacing toward the exit, Erebus would look over at the waiter and speak. "Put their bill on my tab. I'll pay you personally when they're done." Whether or not an answer was given, he wouldn't know; he continued to pace out the exit.* - Sun Sep 27 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) leads Yumiko to the infamous Aburame clan house; a house that was yet to be claimed by said Aburames.* - Sun Sep 27 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not the biggest of places, but still roomey. - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) inched forward, sly smirk forming on his face as he watch Yumiko strip down to nothing but skin. However, just as he was about to get his hands on the female, a bird swoops in and supplied him with a scroll. An agitated look set itself on his face at that moment as he unraveled said scroll and read its content.

"Damn it," he thought as he looked at the seductive female before him. "Listen, I really have to go, but I -will- be right back. Just wait here." With that, he'd turn on his heels and rush out the door.* - Sun Sep 27 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) enters the mansion, hands tucked in his pockets and a nonchalant pep to his step.* - Sun Sep 27 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You called? - Sun Sep 27 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: so now its either u get the pussy or potentially get 90% of ur organization killed - Sun Sep 27 14:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Lead the way.. - Sun Sep 27 14:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied a nod, walking around the desk and taking a seat in the farthest chair; he knew how she liked her space.* - Sun Sep 27 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Flexus was a very important man. - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was there some brilliance to that idea that I'm not aware of? - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Walked up, saw a group of people, thought Kilm and Baen were being attacked, took one of the people hostage, found out what was going on, released the hostage, heard the stories being told, found out Flexus was dealing with people from both Kirigakure and Konohagakure, told Baen to dispose of him. - Sun Sep 27 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm aware he was dealing with Kirigakure too. - Sun Sep 27 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What makes that bad? - Sun Sep 27 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Kirigakure long since placed my name on their hitlist. - Sun Sep 27 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Naturally if I'm on it, so are anyone I'm affiliated with. - Sun Sep 27 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wasn't a Kirigakure ninja. He was unafilliated. - Sun Sep 27 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was using him. - Sun Sep 27 14:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I never let him learn anything confidential, unless my bonehead subordinates were. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When I showed up, he was speaking information that only us, as a Konohagakure unit, knew. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I fail to see where I went wrong in having him killed. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What was he saying. . ? - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You may not have. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I just want to know how things are. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He spoke of information pertaining to our plans of revolution. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Our plans to politically take over Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not to mention the Sergeant of Kirigakure, Hassan, was present.. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Revolution? - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How did Flexus know about that and not me? - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You do know about it. The whole "destroy the Shinobi-system" thing is what he called "revolution". - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I asked the same question, how do he know about any 'revolution' and I didn't..? - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then he explained.. - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess it's for the best you killed him. - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yan. - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lemme go ahead and say I'm not judging you. If I look tense it's because this job has been a lot more stressful than it could be. - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied a shrug.

"I'm used to judgment by now, Katsune. Even if you -were- judging me, I wouldn't be able to tell; it's a common sight and sound to me."* - Sun Sep 27 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It seems to me that I'm still a figurehead. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looks over at Yumiko, pacing himself closer to her whilst stripping off his own clothing with each step.* - Sun Sep 27 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: We need to make up for lost time. - Sun Sep 27 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) inched a bit closer, taking his belt buckle into his grasp and untangled it. As a result, his pants would drop and reveal just his undergarments."Come now, I had to deal with that before it got too late."* - Sun Sep 27 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) shot his hand forth, cupping her butt. He seductively looks at Yumiko, allowing his fingers to gently graze against her mound from the back. "Stop playing games.. Get on your knees."* - Sun Sep 27 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's fingers trailed down Yumiko's ass, getting a good feel of what she had to offer. The seductive scenario relentlessly pulling on his member, having it beg to be released from the confinements of his undergarments; soon. A smirk of arousal plastered itself on Erebus face as he hooks the panties of Yumiko with a single finger and pulls the fabric aside, viewing natural mound. He brings forth his opposing hand and inched two fingers to her clit, gently rubbing against it get the stimulant liquids going. Soon enough, after forcing his natural lubricate to soak her mound; Erebus unravels his behemoth of a member out of its clothed cage and poised it to Yumiko's entrance.

Whilst having no real reason to restrain his urges, after lining the end of his cock with Yumiko's hole, Erebus thrusts his hips forward and drove himself in. He didn't bother to savior the feeling of her pussy wrapping around his dick, Erebus simply pulled his hips away and slammed back in; thrusts that could be heard across the entire room.* - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) continued to pump his tool in and out of Yumiko, giving her no form to break to recollect her mind and body. His hands wander across her ass until reaching her hips and taking a firm grip, relentlessly squeezing and occasionally seductively releasing to give her a firm swat across her meaty cheeks. His own back arched, but only slightly to give his hips a bit more leverage as he rammed into her. Erebus' eyes focused on what he could view of Yumiko's face; he was intent on having seeing her tolerance, no matter the situation at hand. "Submit to me, Yumiko.. Submit to me..!" He wasn't exactly yelling, but his voice was surely elevated at this point.* - Sun Sep 27 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had no intentions on easing his thrust, nor did he have a reason to. His grip on Yumiko's hips altered as he leaned forward and too a firm grasp of her orange locks, tugging back to add a rough flavor to this intense intercourse. A groan of pleasure escaped from Erebus, something he was not ashamed of either; Yumiko was doing a wondrous job of handling the behemoth of meat that was penetrating her. A reward must be given to Yumiko, and it was an reward she would be granted. With his opposing hand, Erebus would trail his fingers across her ass once more, providing her with another smack before lowering his finger next to her second hole. First, however, he retracted his thumb and moistened it with his saliva before returning it to its proper destination. Following another hard thrust into Yumiko, Erebus would siege his finger into her anal cavity and allow it to rest there from this point forward.

Meanwhile, while continuing to pull her hair back and have her face completely exposed for view, Erebus relentlessly pumped himself in and out of her glorious region.* - Sun Sep 27 15:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave Yumiko's pussy a few more thrusts, aiding her in her efforts to ride out the orgasm that dawned on her; he wasn't so ruthless that he'd suddenly stop her climax and leave her high and dry. Still, however, Erebus was nowhere near done. His finger pulled from Yumiko's asshole, releasing an audible pop. A maniacal smile came over Erebus as he pulled his hip away and lined the end of his monster with Yumiko's secondary hole. His opposing hand kept its grip on Yumiko's hair as he leaned his upper body forward and questioned her.

"Where does your loyalty stand from this point forward?" His voice was subtle and in a whisper, a scary sound nonetheless. The tip of his cock could be felt pulsating in preparations to invade her virgin bum.* - Sun Sep 27 15:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was running on nothing but fuel of lust. Yumiko's words didn't fall on deaf ears, but his want to be the first to explore her secondary hole was yelling just as loud. Erebus slowly released the grasp he had on Yumiko's hair, gently gliding his hand down her back whilst leaning forward to seductively kiss her sweating skin. His member was still moist from running rampant within her pussy, so with a slight push forward, as he leaned over her upward poised bum, he attempted to have his head enter her anus. Despite this, however, he gave her complete room to object to his wants.* - Sun Sep 27 15:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || It seemed as though Kirigakure couldn't catch a break. No matter the timespan, Erebus managed to find his way back to Hidden Mist and potentially cause some form of chaos --- all without having to lift a single finger in battle. Nevertheless, he was here now and it may be a different story this time around. He may just have to battle and he may just have to assert his authority over this shinobi world and break this little ninja system; may. Still, though, he bear no sort of visual impulse to reenact his thoughts, just the same sinister aura and the same eerie sound of chaining ruffling around.

Everything about Erebus' arrival was the same quite frankly, nothing really different other than the absence of his pitch-black hoodied cloak. Not like that made much of a difference, the aroma of Death and Blood still filled the air and caused the intake of a breath to be more of a chore rather than a natural habit; more than likely those around would have to cascade their nostrils using their palms. Erebus' steps were more precise than usual, as if he preplanned his stroll beforehand and already devised a plan on how to go about things --- something that Erebus may have been known for; may. For the most part, however, the facial expression that harbored itself on Erebus' face was blank; no real reason for someone as dark and religious devoted to show any emotion when they were on a set path like Erebus.

All together Erebus was just Erebus, giving off no vibes other than his usual demonic stature; been there, done that right? His head was more raised than usual; it'd normally be slightly lowered so his hoodie could have more of an effect of covering his visage, but now that he didn't have his cloak worn there wasn't much of a point to hide his face. The two scythes that were connected by a chain still hung from his neck, so naturally they'll be in full view of those around. Still, there was a lack of ill-intentions in his movements, but there was just that eerie feeling of each centimeter or inch he paced was precise and preplanned; was Erebus up to something?

The Jashinist stood before the crowd of people, providing no specific person with any specific eye contact; one could easily infer that he was staring off into space, all while subconsciously staring at them. It wouldn't take much to get Erebus' undivided attention --- or anything close to undivided; by nature and experience, Erebus learned that coming to Kirigakure with your attention on a single person would either leave you dead, or blame being placed on you for one of their own being dead. It's ironic, though --- Erebus was Kirigakure native; birth-wise that is. As he stood before the mass of people, he simple exhaled; an audible outtake of breath that rink of even more Death and Blood.* - Sun Sep 27 17:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The situation at hand was pretty simple. Either you made assumptions of Erebus, or you don't; it's not like it would've made much of a difference anyways. Erebus was here on a mission, not from a set village he was on a payroll for, but more than likely his own whim. Still, though, that didn't exactly explain the precise steps to his movements. Hell, it didn't even explain the off-setting stare he provided; that wasn't even relevant anymore now that Zenaki took it upon herself to attract Erebus' attention. His arrival, for today, was just all different. His approach, follow-up actions and even the clinking of the chain connecting his scythes --- everything was just off compared to how it usually was; what could it be?

Erebus' eyes trailed into reality, taking its time to find Zenaki and giving her his complete visual attention; visual. The wave was answered, but to most it could be labeled as unorthodox --- to others it could be normal, it mainly depended on the type of person you were; Erebus provided Zenaki with a nod. His right arm slowly raised, cracks could be heard singing from his shoulder with the steady movement; it was rather impulsive of how deep and painful the numerous cracks sounded. At the end of his arm was a single outstretched finger, his index to be more specific, whilst the remaining was tucked into his palms. A point was provided toward Zenaki, and soon after his arm flipped over --- if his palm was to be opened, it'd be facing the sky. Erebus' extended index would curl and unravel a few times, suggesting that Zenaki paced herself closer; still no ill-intentions displayed --- maybe Erebus sought to have a discussion with the female just as he did with her nephew.* - Sun Sep 27 17:51:47 2015
