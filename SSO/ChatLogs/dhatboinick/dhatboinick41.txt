<br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The stitching process was successful. The skin was properly aligned and the wound was patched; another good job.

Ortho trails around Kiyoko's body, examining her frame in the process. Every now and then he'd stop to clean a scratch and scrap, but nothing major. Not until he reached the front of her body. There, his eyes widened. The gashes on her shoulders, upper chest, lower chest and arms were so filled with sand that they didn't even leak blood.

He stands to his feet, preparing himself to patch the shoulder gashes. He takes grasp of the scooping utensil and alters Kiyoko once more. The water pressure immediately pours over the wound, beating away at the chunks of sand. With the scoop, he'd pull out as much as he could, relying on the water to wash away the loose grains deep in the wound. "Am I out of line for thinking you might possibly love Lera?"

Small talk was attempted to help Kiyoko displace her mind from the entire process. The thing about this shoulder wound that made it a long process was the fact that each fidget and twitch Kiyoko made would cause the muscles to move. As a result, he had to take double the time to just cleanse it; he felt bad for her when it came time to stitch.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Finally, despite all the movement of pain from Kiyoko, the wound was properly cleansed.

By time he started stitching, he went back to the basics by gently using two fingers to squeeze the skin together. There, he'd begin. One stitch at a time was made, weaving the needle and lasting 'thread' through with the aid of a secondary utensil as a gripping for the needle. It's funny how that one little technique of his fingers sped up the entire process for this wound. Of course Kiyoko would still feel pain, but compared to the previous wounds, this was relatively fast.

"One thing I learned since being a shinobi, or living in this shinobi world, is that it's best you come to terms with your feelings first. Then, when you do that, express yourself to the person that means the most to you." Ortho moves around to Kiyoko's immediate front, readying himself to once again scoop the chunks of sand from the last remaining wounds; three left to be exact. Ortho pulls the chair, with Kiyoko, closer to him so when he crouched down; the water fell right on her wounds. It was lucky for her that the remaining wounds were in the same generic place.

Ortho starts with the first chest wound. It was located a few inches in between her breasts. It was no hidden fact that the lords blessed Kiyoko was a commendable sized bust, so Ortho would take grasp of her hand and pull it up to her left tit, where the gash started from. Once he did so, he'd apply as much pressure as it required so that she got the idea that he wanted her to continue that, no matter what. It's either that, or he had to apply the pressure himself and cross whatever boundaries he may have. If her hand lowers even a bit, he'd swat it away and do it himself.

The extraction of chunked sand began. This wound was deep, but there were really only two main chunks of sand that he broke into halves so the pain could be lessened just a bit. Of course the pain that came with this would make Kiyoko feel like it was a lifetime, but it only took four minutes for him to extract the chunks and allow the water to handle the rest. Since he knew that the pain was great, he'd momentarily stop the patching process and allow her to feel a bit relieved.
* - Wed Nov 11 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He grips her breast and applies pressure to it, allowing the skin between the bust to close. There, with his free hand, he'd begin stitching the wound close. The skin in between her breast was soft compared to the other places, so the needle able to be manipulated with ease and grace. Before he knew it, he was done. For Kiyoko, it was hell.

"Come on, talk to me. Focus on my voice. What do you think about finding yourself before telling Lera if you actually love her?" Ortho was actually showing emotion now. He knew the pain she was feeling and it was also the last few that hurt the most. He hoped that compassion and a switch of topic for her mind would help her.

Meanwhile, he starts with second to last wound. This gash was horizontal rather than diagonal. It was right under her beast and the water that trailed down her body did a great job wearing down on the chunks of sand. Scooping what was inside was extremely easy; the water pushing out what remaining grains were left. It took less and less time for Ortho to clean these two wounds, and it's for that reason why he decided to just clean the last wound after finishing the second to last one.

Ortho begins stitching up the first wound he cleaned out of the two. It only required six stitches, but he knew that the fidgeting of Kiyoko's body would make this drag on. So, while lifting the breast he grasped, allowing her skin to flex for a bit then retracting, he starts the process. Those six stitches went by relatively fast. The last wound however was a killer. It was the deepest and largest in length. It needed twenty fucking stitches to patch up and had about seven chunks of sand clogging it.

He slowly shakes his head and began. He alters his position again and did the same for Kiyoko, making the water fall directly on the massive injury. Every three or so chunks he extracted, he'd take a sixty second break for Kiyoko to relax and gather herself. This wound definitely took the longest. In the end of the cleaning, it took about thirty minutes of torture before Kiyoko was entering the patch phase.* - Wed Nov 11 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) reached for Kiyoko's hand, tying his fingers into hers; giving her something to squeeze with all her might. "Hey, hey. Look at me, just me and you. Come, look at me Kiyoko. Focus on me. You're almost done."

That one little pep talk, while his eyes transitioned from the wound to her eyes a few times, allowed Ortho to go through three stitches. "Talk with me, Kiyoko. What has she been teaching you? What are your natural elements?" Another three more stitches; six down out of twenty; good pace. "How do you like it here in Sunagakure? Have you ever wanted to travel?" Two more stitches down. If they kept at this pace, by time she answered his questions in her dazed state, he'd be three stitches away from done.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Just as planned. The talking kept her awake and distracted for the most part. Three stitches were left and completed in haste and care. He kept his hand locked with Kiyoko's, gently squeezing to physically remind her that she had him grip for her usage. "Good, good. I'm able to use wind as well. Traveling is definitely my forte though. I can't stay in the same place, but Sunagakure is pretty.. welcoming."

That last few statements did it. Kiyoko was completely patched up and Ortho was done. Throughout the entire process, he noticed signs of a concussion and other than the rewrapping of her head, there wasn't much he can do about it. To help her out with the pain from the stitches, however, he goes into the medical kit and takes out the weakest numbing medication there and inject half into her. It won't completely get rid of the pain, but make it tolerable.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stands up. He too was obviously soaking wet from dancing around in the shower with her so it didn't really matter what else he did at this point while there. He reaches behind Kiyoko, unhooking her bra. He remembers that there were stitching on one of her shoulders, so he made sure to not make the strap run over it. At that point, he throws the bra to the ground.

Ortho moves down to Kiyoko's lower half and leans her body a bit to pull her panties down; throwing it off to the side with the bra. He stands up, gets a rag and lubes it with soap. The bathing sequence began. At this point, he starts with the places that weren't stitched up; her legs, outer and inner thighs and abdomen. When it came to her more intimate area, he just did what he had to do; not immaturity displayed. The most care was placed on the areas of the stitching, gliding the rags over her skin so the stitches don't rip but her skin was cleaned; that was just her back.

Ortho moves on to Kiyoko's front, starting at her neck and slowly progressing down. Eventually, he managed to run over her breasts, in between and simply clean her off. "Just so you know, it's called a concussion. It's not severe, but it'll take a little less than two weeks for it to completely heal."* - Wed Nov 11 02:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to run the rag over her body, allowing the water to rinse off the excess blood and soap. Soon enough, she was completely clean-.

His head perks up and he looks over the door leading to the bath, "eh? We're almost done, no worries. Do you need healing as well?" Before Mitsunara could answer, he'd lower his head once more and continues the process. All the while, his eyes following where his hands trailed to; it wasn't like he was trying to fuck now was it?* - Wed Nov 11 02:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes a step back and let the water completely rinse Kiyoko off. He had to admit, she had an amazing body, but this was business. He walks over to the shower gauge and set it to off. From there, he'd walk past Kiyoko and head for the bedroom. When he returned, he had a fresh towel that he sure Yan wouldn't mind they used.

Ortho begins drying Kiyoko off, starting with her upper neck and slowly trailing down her body. He was sure to be extra careful over her shoulder stitches then picked up the pace up until he reached to her two back stitches. By time he was done with her back, he moved to the front of her and began drying off his her legs. When he reached her upper thighs, he subtly separated them and does what he had to. Eventually, he had dried off her entire body.

"We're almost done," he shouts for the people at the doorway. He stands Kiyoko up, using his own body as leverage, and wraps the towel around her frame. "I don't have to tell you to take it easy now do I, Kiyoko? Not excessive movements, none of that. Just take care of yourself." With that, he'd wrap her left arm around his neck, and his right arm around her waist, then lead her weak and covered body out.

He, himself, didn't have his shirt on. His lower body was still clothed, but his shirt was just off; it was clear nothing happened.* - Wed Nov 11 03:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || She was actually on her feet with his aid; he was getting ready to carry her to the bedroom and handle their bus- kidding. He leads her out of the bathroom. He quickly scoops his shirt from the door, that's what he was going to place her in.* - Wed Nov 11 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) did have her lay flat, but the look on her face made him change that. So, he instead leaned her up against the wall as she sat. He takes his shirt and strings her lowered arms into the sleeves. Then, without making much movements for her, he pulled the shirt up and over her head then pulled it down over her impressive bust. Sadly for her, that same impressive bust made the shirt stop just before her belly button.

"Well then.. Uhhh," he says out loud. His eyes were staring at her bust, but not to visually grope her. A light bulb flickers on over his head. He forms a series of handseals and a outfit spawn. A pair of loose sweatpants was in that outfit and in turn he placed that on her.

"I don't just carry around panties, so next time your girlfriend or whatever is around you can have her place them on you. For now, have my shirt and sweatpants."* - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hers, Kirie's, Elon's and Violet's. - Wed Nov 11 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Just because she is loved? This torture, I'm guessing you can't tell me why Lera was named or you'd have to kill me? - Wed Nov 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I was forced to mentally relive the death of my parents, the death of my sensei and the betrayal of my student-sibling. - Wed Nov 11 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: All the while.. I was physically beaten for not wanting to help Kirigakure with supply funds to them.. - Wed Nov 11 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you saying Lera caused this? - Wed Nov 11 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm saying her name was called as one of the people amongst the ones who physically tortured me.. - Wed Nov 11 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The mental torture was avenged, just not at my hands. - Wed Nov 11 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You realize in a world of shinobi, the biggest fear is not of your enemy but of your leader? - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Perhaps she didn't have a choice. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I assure you.... I have heard of none of this, or you. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I wouldn't have mentioned her if I did, for her sake. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's for that.. different perspective why it's easy for me to forget about killing her.. - Wed Nov 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: And allow her to be erased from my hit list.. - Wed Nov 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But not forever..... - Wed Nov 11 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I'm not having a good head start on that am I? - Wed Nov 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckles, glancing over her body again. "A few battle scars, but you'll make it." He leans in and speaks in a humorous tone, "I'd say I battled like four wolves with my bare hands if I were you."* - Wed Nov 11 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't know, Aza is pretty scary. - Wed Nov 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm. Aza? The one everyone was attacking? - Wed Nov 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you for sparring her life.... I hope that soon, or in the future at some point. I can convince you not to kill her, even after my death. - Wed Nov 11 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tell you what.. - Wed Nov 11 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Make a single promise to me and I'll make sure I won't seek her death.. even after you are gone. - Wed Nov 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What is the promise. - Wed Nov 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks Kiyoko in the ears, all emotions vanishing from his visage. "Become -the- best medic. Not the best you can be, but -the- best.. ever."* - Wed Nov 11 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || eyes** - Wed Nov 11 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks. What Kiyoko was saying sat right with him, letting him know in turn it's the person willing to stop at nothing to just help who become the best. "When I said.. the best, I didn't mean being able to heal someone who cut in half in just a few seconds. I mean becoming known for your compassion for others and have everyone turn to you in trust. In turn, with everyone coming to you, you 'will' become  the best.. So I still want you to promise me.."* - Wed Nov 11 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Good. Consider Lera off my hit list. - Wed Nov 11 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: As if she was never there,~ - Wed Nov 11 04:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're welcome, Kiyoko. - Wed Nov 11 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think my friends might want to see me now, but...seriously...anything you ever want. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll keep that in mind, haha. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I placed her on your bed, Yan. - Wed Nov 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hope you don't mind. - Wed Nov 11 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "It's fine. I only murder the people that deserve it, I save the lives of the innocent."

He focuses his eyes on Yan. "That leads me into the next topic. I heard you wanted to take my life.."* - Wed Nov 11 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Hoo boy. - Wed Nov 11 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: This is about to be reallyyy funny, isn't it.. - Wed Nov 11 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..Shitttt. - Wed Nov 11 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Swear to god, I'm gonna be pissed... if either of you idiots kills the other. - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: How about instead of going straight to 'Meet me the fuck outside.' - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We all get dressed up fully, get shit in order- and talk this out, like cool little fonzies. - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ehhh? - Wed Nov 11 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed.

"I am a man of morals and honor. I will not deny that I killed people within the mist, but I will not belittle myself with lying and say I did it without cause. You are a man that I heard vow to avenge the innocent; the people I killed were not innocent. Elon and Violet, the only two I killed, aided Kirie in my torture. Kirie asked me for funds so she can buy more jutsu scrolls. I already heard of her mooching skills when it comes to scrolls so I denied her. Next thing I knew, I was under a genjutsu that made me relive factors in my life that still haunt me. My parents' deaths, my sensei's death and my brother's death. All three I was forced to relive. Meanwhile, I was physically whipped lashed.. When I healed up and made it back to Kirigakure, I heard that Kirie was already dead and I sought out Elon and Violet's lives.. I claimed their lives for what they did to me.."

Ortho slowly shook his head again. "If you and I are to fight again, I want it to be one on one.. Shinobi against shinobi, man against man.. I also want it to be in a battlefield where your own prowess are at full usage.. That way if I were to win,  no one can say I had the advantage in any way, shape or form." Ortho's gaze shifted from Yan to Mitsunara then back to Yan. "I follow by the rules and morals.. My name was tainted when only one side of the story was told, not both."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "I must get going anyways. I thank you for hearing me out though."* - Wed Nov 11 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: That's literally it. Aha. - Wed Nov 11 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) formed two handseals then opens his right palm. From behind a sudden puff of smoke came a jutsu scroll labeled "Fireball Jutsu". He pivots forward, slowly pacing himself toward Daiki. Once within arm's reach, Ortho would offer him the scroll, "knock yourself out kid."* - Wed Nov 11 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded.

"No problem, just make sure to grow stronger and that'll be all the repayment I request."
* - Wed Nov 11 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gently pats Daiki on the shoulder. "Good, good. I'll see you around." With that, Ortho made an attempt to maneuver around the boy and walk off.* - Wed Nov 11 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hmm? Because he has Some money for me..  - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolled his eyes. "Should've guess it was him," he thought to himself. Ortho takes out a wad of cash, places it in a pouch and thrusts it Marrisa.

Now, at this point, something ran through Ortho's mind. He sighs a bit, slowly shook his head and extracts even more money; double of what Marrisa asked for. This time, he chucks it toward Marco.

"I'm not asking you to not hate me, but I can respect a man that works for a living rather than have everything handed to him. It's for that very same reason I choose to befriend and help men and women alike. I hope your business florish with the material you're able to buy with that."* - Wed Nov 11 05:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was going to get straight to the point. He reaches out for Marrisa's hand, examining her body as she stood before him. If she were to accept it, he'd lead her to the bed and subtly bend her over. First, however, he'd plant kisses on her neck while speaking. "Are you sure you want to do this?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Wow. .  - Wed Nov 11 08:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: This place is amazing . - Wed Nov 11 08:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah.. spent a lot of money to get it build. - Wed Nov 11 08:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inches toward the settlement. The two guards by the gates bowed out of respect and were given a nod of gratitude from Ortho himself. The guards placed their immediate attention on Marrisa and began unsheathing their respective weaponry. At the sound of metal being exposed from their holsters, Ortho would look over his shoulders. "Easy, guys. She's here to train today. Let her by." With that small instruction, they'd eye Marrisa up again before granting her free access to the settlement; sadly, they only had the mindset that this was the first and last time she'd show up.* - Wed Nov 11 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Come along, Marrisa. - Wed Nov 11 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, Marrisa. - Wed Nov 11 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: First things first, do you wish to do an all out spar, or something ele? - Wed Nov 11 09:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's up to you. You are in crage here.  - Wed Nov 11 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Charge** - Wed Nov 11 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..This is my settlement, yes. You have also have a say. - Wed Nov 11 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: There isn't really anything I can teach you.. at least I don't think. - Wed Nov 11 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You've always been more advanced than me when it comes to jutsu count. - Wed Nov 11 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Speaking of that. .  - Wed Nov 11 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? - Wed Nov 11 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I have a jutsu for you. . but don't teach it to anyone else.  - Wed Nov 11 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: and don't let Lera know I taught you..  - Wed Nov 11 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow.

"Alright then-," he was caught off. "..Right.."* - Wed Nov 11 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) accepts the scroll and looks it over. He blinked a few times, trying to remember where he had heard the name of this jutsu before. "I know.. I've heard of this somewhere before, but where-," something suddenly clicked and a light bulb flickered on above his head. "Ahh, yes. Index used it against me when we were fighting. Useful technique.."

He unravels the scroll a bit, reading its first bit of information. The jutsu was relatively easy, but it's the simplicity of it that made it all that complicated. It was nearly too simple for such a useful technique. Still, however, he went at it. By time he was finished with the first paragraph, using it as a bit of a summary of what's to come, he nods his head. "I see, I see.. Thanks, Marrisa.."* - Wed Nov 11 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick)  continues to read from the scroll. The more he read is the more he kind've got mad at himself. He couldn't lie; the jutsu was really simple; it baffled him at the thought that he didn't just teach himself how to use it from just looking at Index do it. A sigh came from Ortho as he slowly shook his head, the content being so easy for him to comprehend.

"You've always been in use to me, Marrisa," he says with his eyes continuing to scan through the scroll. "I understand that I was harsh, but you and I both know tough love gets us farther than soft words and open hearts." Ortho's tone was plain and straight forward. He knew as much as Marrisa did that what he said was completely true. For them to progress, they just had to be hard on one another. Completely cutting her out of his life wasn't the plan, she was still a shinobi and an ideal ally.

Another sigh comes from Ortho. This time around, it was for both the discussion at hand and what the third paragraph of the scroll had in store for him. "Is this really the shit that Index mass use..? Like holy shit it's easy," thought Ortho. His eyes lower a bit, showing a 'duh' expression. He continues to read on, intently taking in all the words.
* - Wed Nov 11 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. Instantly his weight was relinquished, gravity being trumped by Marrisa's implementation of chakra. He looks down at the ground, seeing his shadow no longer being attached to his feet. "Y-Yo'," he stammers. He wasn't even at the part of levitation of the scroll, and thankfully that small demonstration from Marrisa aided a lot. A smirk creeps on Ortho's face as he cross his legs over one another like he was a floating monk.

At this point, he'd place the scroll on his lap and began reading once more. "Alright, where was I," he says to himself. His eyes peel from left to right as he entered the fourth paragraph. This was indeed the part where the scroll told his to center his chakra, like he was performing suiman, and allow it to slowly lift him from the inside rather than keeping a steady flow at the bottom of his feet. Seeing as though he was already levitating, Ortho would instead try to lift himself further into the air.* - Wed Nov 11 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You are doing great! - Wed Nov 11 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ehh? I can tell it's going to be a pain to master, but I'm grateful. - Wed Nov 11 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Thanks again. - Wed Nov 11 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Yea. .  - Wed Nov 11 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am still working on it myself.  .  - Wed Nov 11 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's progression was going superbly fast. Marrisa's small intrusion was no intrusion at all, but the holy push of knowledge. A thankful smile was given to her as he finished reading the fourth paragraph within the scroll. By time he started the fifth, he knew that he was still a head of the game. His smile slowly transitions into a cocky smirk at the thought.

The fifth paragraph was as expected. The most it talked about was using that same centered chakra to levitate further off the ground. The whole point as such was to add more usage to the technique from an early standpoint. That way, when it came down to mastering the jutsu all together, it was relatively easy. The only problem, according to the scroll, was the fact that the jutsu was just time consuming mastery wise, something Ortho wasn't exactly worried about.* - Wed Nov 11 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glanced fown at Marrisa. Quickly. he'd jolting to the left in attempting to evade the wires. A smirk formed on his face as he straightens his body and began to zoom off. At this point, it may turn into a race.* - Wed Nov 11 09:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down at Nina.

"I met someone by the name of Kiyoko in Sunagakure. Surely you know I practiced in the medical arts, and I put that practice to use. I saved her life and I made sure she was in stable condition before I left.. During the process, I found out that she was Lera's new girlfriend..

I lost a brother over Lera.. and I 'lost'.. a loved one.. I'm pretty sure I almost lost my baby sister too.. And for that reason, even though Kiyoko was Lera's spose, I still healed her up. On top of that, baby sis'.. I made a promise to Kiyoko and Sunagakure that I will -never- go after Lera's life again.. And if I ever do, the entire Sunagakure army can have my head..

You mean too much to me, Nina.. I don't want to see you hurt anymore.. I've lost you before, I refuse to do it again.. Apart from you, I have no one else in this world.. It was always you and Index... and you know what happened between Index and I.."* - Wed Nov 11 20:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rolls his eyes as he glances toward Index..* - Wed Nov 11 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. He begins pulling off all his armor and chainmail, planning to enter this battle natural. No armor, not weapons, just what they had in jutsus and fists.

"Very well."* - Wed Nov 11 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stops his outer layer disrobing, narrowing his eyes on the scroll. Thankfully, there was a copy at Ryuchi cave that automatically saved everyones contract.

He didn't know if Ryutaro smoked or ever smoked, but at this point it didn't matter. Ortho lights the blunt and offers it to Index. "This is my settlement. Don't have a legit name for it, but your hose is to your left.. Welcome home, Index."* - Wed Nov 11 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the blunt in the right corner of his mouth. "You know we dont shake hands," he says with an extended fist. "Bump it."* - Wed Nov 11 21:19:34 2015

Ortho brings his hands to chest level and slowly began the process of forming seals. "This is a more advanced level of the basic water jutsu you know. Rather than spurting out a quick torrent, charge it up as fast as you can and as much as you can. From there, launch it." Ortho runs by the handseals a few more times and continues to talk. "Simply center your chakra in your stomach, like you'd do for the jutsu you already know, allow it to liquefy. At that point, expel it. Remember to add as much chakra as possible."* - Thu Nov 12 01:08:16 2015
