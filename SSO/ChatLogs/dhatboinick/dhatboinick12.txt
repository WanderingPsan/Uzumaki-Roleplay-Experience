Despite his head being slightly lowered, Erebus was aware of the arrival of Kilm and Katsune; his hearing was well trained. For the most part, the Jashinist stood stationary; the only movements he made was to slightly alter his posture to fold his sleeved arms across his chest.

"Tell me, Katsune; has your cause altered since you and I have met?" His voice was cold, matching the aroma of Death and Blood that often tagged alongside him.* - Wed Sep 30 17:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who's been inside your head? - Wed Sep 30 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' head slowly raised and turned, allowing him a good look at Katsune as she spoke. He honestly don't know why he was so tolerant with her and her little puppy, but their cause was commendable; naturally he'd want to see them achieve their goals and represent their cause. A single grunt of annoyance was released from Erebus, Katsune's question echoing through his mind.

"It's amusing, Katsune. You ask me who's been in my head, but I've only been taking your words into consideration and acknowledgment. Kilm's input has been registered on occasions, but for the most part it's just you. I've tried to set myself apart from you Shinobi. I've tried to take a step back and figure out the exact level of trickery you Shinobi are capable of, but the capability to manipulate others baffles me at times. You, Katsune, are the only person I can honestly say send chills up and down my spine. Not in fear, definitely not in fear, but in the fact that you drive me to near insanity. You see, your latest update, if you can call that an update, where speaking of my plans is even an option only made me reopen my eyes. Not saying anything is wrong with your thinking process, but I will be the first to tell you that it's not right."

A shrug was given to Katsune and Kilm, easily detectable even through the thick cloak Erebus wore. He takes a few steps toward the two Shinobi, closing the distance between them by just a tad bit. His movements were sloppy, showing that he had no intention to attack or do anything that could harm their wellbeing; knowing Katsune, she'll overthink things and take it has Erebus attempting to raise the hell of Jashin on them.

"You ask me who's been in my head as if penetrating my mind is as easy as you playing with Kilm's feelings. I've come here not to battle, but to set the record straight; your lives were close to ending by me. Betrayal is one of those sins that cannot be forgiven --- under normal circumstances. The benefit of the doubt has already been granted by you, Katsune. There's nothing more I can give you. I've managed to single handedly rebuild Konohagakure and hand it over to you while it entered its stable faze. You spoke of continuing Orakuru's dream, but you haven't done anything to make that dream a reality. Keep in mind, this is not me talking down on you; this is me telling you what's going on my mind. Let's be honest, Katsune --- if I wanted you two dead, I would've been slit your throats. You are attempting to manipulate yourself to the end of your path, also known as Orakuru's dream. You won't last long.

You have numerous people out for your head and I've been paid a hundred million to take you both out. I'll be returning the money and let the person know that I found you both dead already. The rest.. is on you two."* - Wed Sep 30 18:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: God damn it. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) said nothing more. His body pivoted forward, maximum speed being reached off the bat. With the gripping of his two scythes, one in each hand while the chain dangled between, Erebus went to close the distance between him and the two shinobi. Knowing full and well that Kilm would make an attempt to save his wannabe lover, Erebus aimed to strike him down first. No remorse was provided, just the sheer will to assassinate before things dragged on.

A thrust of his right scythe was provided, aiming to pierce through Kilm's throat completely. Whether or not it was successful, Erebus would follow up with a quick slanted slash for Katsune's frame; aiming to gash her from her upper left shoulder down to her lower right hip.

[ 12 Strength, 13 Attack Speed, 18 Taijutsu, 10.2 movement speed. ]* - Wed Sep 30 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Many factors had to be taken at this point. From the moment Erebus realized the delay in Katsune and Kilm's original arrival, despite being forewarned of Erebus' arrival, the Jashinist ordered the two-thousand guards to withstand a tight security on the outskirts of the village. That being said, Katsune will be handled by them when the time came. Kilm, on the other hand, had Erebus to think about. Yes, Kilm was fast, but Erebus was just a tad bit faster.

Just as Kilm went to dash off, Erebus followed close pursuit. An attempt, by Erebus, was made at this point. When Kilm went to dive into the ground, Erebus used his superb attacking speed to take grasp of his clothing using one hand. From there, using the opposing hand that still had the scythe gripped, a slice at Kilm's throat was made.

The guards on the outskirts of the village, as appointed by Erebus earlier, which is why Katsune didn't detect any ambush when she was trying to be sly and search for one, would make an attempt at doing anything possible to capture Katsune alive.* - Wed Sep 30 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had no reason to really pursue them. Apparently having guards set up whilst expecting a battle to be engaged was godmod, so that was negated OOCly. Kilm was indeed faster so that was a plus for him and Katsune got away. Erebus was left manicaly laughing, plans were already being formed within his head.* - Wed Sep 30 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Kilm and Katsune are now enemies. - Wed Sep 30 19:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) sits himself in the remaining chair behind the wooden desk. By looking at his face, those around could tell that Erebus had a lot on his mind. Recent activities left the Jashinist in a tight spot, relentlessly battering his mind in slight disarray. Still though, counting Erebus out for the count would be a big mistake. As he sat behind the desk, he leans in and began going through some paperwork. He remains quite for the most part, but still kept an open ear for anyone that spoke toward him.

Suddenly, a mission scroll was tossed on his desk. At first, Erebus was prepared to snap the neck of whoever chucked the item in the first place, but a quick reanalysis of his judgment calmed him down and allowed him to think rationally. He lifts his head and looks at the person that threw the scroll; Marrisa. With a grunt of annoyance and slight anger, he fills out the paper work for her mission completion and filed it away in the proper cabinet.* - Wed Sep 30 23:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) strolls up, hands tucked in his pockets and his dual scythes hanging from around his beck by a thick metal chain. Almost instantly, at his arrival, he poised his eyes upon Taiga and spoke.

"I'm not going to ask questions, nor am I going to suggest a better. Pack your things and lets go."* - Thu Oct  1 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hello Erebus! How are you today? - Thu Oct  1 19:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Yes Sir? - Thu Oct  1 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) reached into his right pocket, extracting a single wad of cash. Said cash was neatly rolled and sealed by a rubberband, which was also labeled. Erebus looks at Marrisa and hand her the money.

"Take this as your payment for the mission and I'll file the paperwork later."* - Thu Oct  1 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) hadn't been in contact with Marrisa in a few days. The reasoning for that he didn't know, but he was going to take full advantage here and now. As Marrisa leaned in to half hug the Jashinist, the male reached behind her and took a nice grasp on her bum, seductively groping in. Whilst doing this, however, Erebus kept a straight face. When their body departed, he would give a slight shrug.

"Whenever you ask, I suppose. I've been a bit lazy lately and I'm backed up on paperwork as is, but missions I make a priority for you all."* - Thu Oct  1 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looked around a bit, a visual suggestion that they were currently outside rather than in the mansion. In an attempt of not trying to be rude, Erebus shrugs once more and pushed himself off of the wall; his destination was inside the building and toward the cluster of papers on the wooden desk. After a minute or so of digging, he finally finds a suitable mission. Erebus places the paperwork inside a scroll and writes the letter A on it. Once returning outside, he hands the scroll to Marrisa and placed his focus on Suitengu.

"How you doing?"* - Thu Oct  1 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied another shrug; a common thing for the Jashinist lately.

"Ehh, not bad nor good I suppose. I heard you fought well against Marrisa here, I'm guessing you were thoroughly entertained as well?"* - Thu Oct  1 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It went well. Though, she doesn't seem very confident against those who utilize Katon techniques. She nearly gave up immediatly when I used my own, had I not pressured her it would have been boring. - Thu Oct  1 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' focused remained on Suitengu. The look on Erebus' face was a bit stern, but rather compassionate compared to the demonic stature of his normal facial expression. A lot was on his mind, which could also be told by looking at him.

"Tell me, Suitengu. Has your ocular prowess enhanced lately?"* - Thu Oct  1 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: ...More Doujutsu talk... - Thu Oct  1 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Soon enough we'll hunt down the remaining. Allowing them to progress any further would make it nothing less than a hassle. We'll start with 'you know who' and slowly progress to the ones in Kirigakure. - Thu Oct  1 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: No. Not yet. - Thu Oct  1 20:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes ventured off, resting on Reisen and narrowing.

"Who might you be?"* - Thu Oct  1 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied a nod to Reisen's response. Her voice was delicate, but that didn't subdue the roughness in Erebus' tone; he was naturally a brute. Still, however, compared to how he could intentionally be, he was more kind in this discussion.

"Alright, Reise; state your preference in battle."* - Thu Oct  1 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) lifted an eyebrow; Reisen's answer was unique compared to the responses he got from these other amateur shinobi. With a spark of interest apparent in his voice, Erebus continued the questioning.

"So you're a master opportunist, or just a master manipulator of your opponent?"* - Thu Oct  1 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Suitengu. .Wanna fight again? I wont give up as easily this time. .  - Thu Oct  1 21:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) provided a nod as well.

"I'm guessing you don't have one then? A weakness that is."* - Thu Oct  1 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's expression altered slightly. Reisen's words felt a bit contradicting to her prior statement, but who's to tell what truly went on in her mind? With a slight shrug of his shoulders and the tucking of his palms into his pants pockets, Erebus leans against the mansion.

"To understand yourself more, you need some form of comparison. You mortals compare yourselves to other mortals for justification of your own progress. It's a natural occurrence. Are you saying that you don't do that?"* - Thu Oct  1 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) lowered his head a bit. Reisen's words registered themselves in his mind, but they weren't anything new. He already formed a serenical standing within himself, one where only his cause and understanding existed. The comparison he made between himself and others was only to fuel his ego and drive stay on top of the mountain while forming rock slides against the climbers.

"Comparison can be virtuous or wicked; it all depends on the person doing the comparing. Whether you compare to boost yourself subconsciously, or compare to look down on yourself. In the end, comparisons are made. If you think about it, in battle comparison is the battle field."* - Thu Oct  1 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Thu Oct  1 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) listened to what Reisen had to say, taking in each word into consideration.

"You target numerous points of views when it comes to comparison; that's commendable. Yes, you're pinpointing your own weakness, but the best way to cover said weakness is to acknowledge it and progress forward. If you take your weakness into consideration and, as you say, flex your way around a person's ability, does that not aid you? Is that not a comparison to your own capabilities and your opponents' abilities? Whether or not you acknowledge your weakness first or your opponents ability to target your weakness, some form of comparison is being made. Hell, you won't know you have a weakness if a comparison isn't made between what you can handle from what you can't handle; it takes the comparison between yourself and another for that.

Fate determines if you are beaten or not. Sure, you can progress yourself to slightly change fate, but it's still fate at the end of the day. If the comparison continues to run rampant in your mind, then the only thing you can do is choose a said; boost yourself with the comparison, or look down on yourself. Hate, however, that isn't a comparison. Hate is nothing more, or less, than a straight forward feeling you mortals have toward those who questioned your cause, spat in your face, killed your loved ones, or all of the above." * - Thu Oct  1 22:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Takeda was the picture perfect example of what was wrong with this shinobi world. Judgment is passed around too easily, while understanding is scarce. It's something that pushed Erebus closer and closer to the edge, but for their wellbeing he firmly plants his feet and shoves back. The closed mindedness of these shinobi sickened Erebus; it didn't make sense to him how these mortals could all be so similar, but they differentiate themselves due to irrational judgment. It was a feat that both amazed him and poked at the sleeping lion within his cage of anger.

Irritation was plastered over Erebus' face. He stood with his hands tucked in his pockets and his back leaning against the mansion walls. His posture was slack, almost lazily despite the wall keeping him vertical. He hasn't said anything in a while, a clear sign that he was truly angered. This difference in his facial expression could be dated back to the conversation between Takeda and Yumiko, which really wasn't long ago. Still however, without saying a single word out loud, Erebus' mind kicked back in gear and plans began sowing themselves together.

"Soon enough these shinobi will awaken. They've taken the pill of idiocy and slumbered on the bed of snap-judgment for too long. The understanding I have formed for these shinobi isn't faring in their favor, and that is their own faults. I've come to a single conclusion thus far: they all will parish. My decision can be altered, but these mortals possess not the ability to wake from their stagnation and change their own fate. It is for that single reasoning why in due time, if they do not change their ways, they will be sent to the gates of Jashin's hell. It is for that single reasoning why in due time they will be forced to wake.."* - Fri Oct  2 00:05:32 2015

The conversation between Suitengu and Takeda took a turn for the better; Erebus honestly thought Takeda was going to talk his way to death. With a slight shrug of his shoulders, Erebus made an attempt to ease the lingering tension.

"So, uhh.. The kid placed a good question; if it's not exactly paper, what is it?"* - Fri Oct  2 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pushes himself off the wall. His hands remained tucked in his pockets as he paced southward, a nonchalant energy in his movements. Just before he got too far, he'd look over his shoulder and called back to anyone listening. "Going to go get some sake; if you're of age, come along."* - Fri Oct  2 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Im good. - Fri Oct  2 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a nod and continued to walk off.* - Fri Oct  2 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's arrival in the shop was subtle. He didn't attract much attention by the other customers, nor did he make an attempt to; everything was just laid back. After surveying the shop for a few seconds, as he paced himself further in, he took a seat at the first free table. His attention was almost immediately taken by the bar. In return, the waitress supplied a nod from across the room. She stacks a bunch of cups on top of each other and grabs two jugs of liquor. Once bringing it over to Erebus, the Jashinist wasted no time it opening the first jug and pouring himself out some. At the moment, he had no idea Kohaku entered the shop.* - Fri Oct  2 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's attention transitioned from the glorious sake to Kohaku. The look on his face slightly altered, but it remained its surprisingly joyful composure; it was clear that Erebus enjoyed a good jug of sake. After supplying Kohaku with a nod of acknowledgment, Erebus takes a swig of sake.* - Fri Oct  2 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You didn't have to come, ya'know.. - Fri Oct  2 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Neither did you. - Fri Oct  2 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: But here we both are. - Fri Oct  2 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, erebus...While we're here, tell me about yourself. - Fri Oct  2 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: About myself...? - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets see. - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) lifts the jug to his mouth once more and takes a swig.* - Fri Oct  2 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm known as the infamous religious brute.. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've made it a priority to make an attempt to understand the minds of you mortals. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see no reason to kill unless it's to further progress me to protect and strengthen my cause. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If it was up to me, sake will be the official drink of the world. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) takes yet another swig.* - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right.. - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well that's nice. - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: When did you become so into your religion? - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's actually a good question. - Fri Oct  2 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For as long as I can remember I've been in tuned with my religion. - Fri Oct  2 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Were you raised into it? - Fri Oct  2 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wouldn't exactly say raised, but yes. - Fri Oct  2 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm..? - Fri Oct  2 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) glanced at his beloved jug of sake and takes a swig, supplying an audible gulping sound.* - Fri Oct  2 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So why did you.. - Fri Oct  2 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Like.. - Fri Oct  2 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: You know. - Fri Oct  2 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly? - Fri Oct  2 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes. - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I planned on killing you in the far future. - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) said that as if it was normal.* - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: But that's not the case anymore. - Fri Oct  2 02:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No reason to. - Fri Oct  2 02:20:22 2015
