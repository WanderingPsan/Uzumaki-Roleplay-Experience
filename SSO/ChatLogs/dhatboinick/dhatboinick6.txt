Eventually, after only a minute and a half, he managed to find a mission. He places the paperwork within a scroll, located within the desks' drawer, and chucks it toward Pandora; if she caught it or not, it wasn't his problem.* - Mon Sep 21 16:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) fidgets behind the desk, impatiently tapping his foot on the tiled floor. His glare was fixated on the entrance of the office, obviously expecting someone, or something, to burst through at any moment. The look on his face showed mixed expressions, a tie between annoyance and anger. Those around him at the moment would be able to slice the tension in the room with a butter knife, it's almost uncanny how much tension a single person can emit. Nevertheless, though, Erebus remained seated.* - Mon Sep 21 18:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: ..It doesn't take this long for a reply to be written and sent back.. - Mon Sep 21 18:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet, grabbing his cloak and scythe. He paces around the desk, destination set on the exit of the office.* - Mon Sep 21 19:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' presence could be heard and smelt; the thick aroma of death and blood filling the immediate area, forcing the intake of air to be more of a chore than normal. His upper blade on his scythe continuously scrapes against the stone mountain, giving off the eerie warning of something sinister arriving. Erebus' progression halts, his head lifting slightly so he could examine the situation at hand; nothing too threatening to say the least. He purposely makes visual contact with Amai, allowing her to remember that there was a demon still on her case, just not as much as before.

Nevertheless, Erebus was here for business purposes; he'll collect on Amai's bounty at a later date. With an audible exhale of breath, usually the signal of Erebus' philosophical speech, Erebus set his gaze on Niza.

"I have come to collect on your generous contribution."* - Mon Sep 21 19:19:28 2015

Whilst shrugging off the approach, Erebus takes grasp of the pouch and seals it away within his cloak, looking back up at Niza. A nod was produced, Erebus' gratitude clear from just that moment. Instead of leaving, however, the Jashinist edged forward, pacing himself to close the distance between him and the mass of people.* - Mon Sep 21 19:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's head snaps to the left, an audible crack exploding from his neck. His glare pierced through Maloth, providing the bulky caveman no sanctum of peace; sheer demonic intent in Erebus' presence. Slowly, but surely, Erebus' stare upon Maloth transition to Amai; his anger flaring.

"It's a pity, woman. You beg for the aid of Niza and others, but refuse to repent for your sins. You, Amai, are the definition of contradiction."* - Mon Sep 21 19:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I have no sins to repent for. - Mon Sep 21 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Interesting. - Mon Sep 21 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's focus was shifted back to Maloth, but almost immediately granted back to Amai; he had no reason to acknowledge the behemoth. For the most part, however, Erebus' anger seemed to die down a bit; possibly due to the fact that for the little time he did pay attention to Maloth, the clear display of idiocy was amusement in itself. A chuckle escaped Erebus, filling the air in a cold and uncanny sensation; still, he stared down Amai.

"Your attempt to hide from judgment is futile. In due time, woman, you'll reach the almighty gates."* - Mon Sep 21 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Tsk... - Mon Sep 21 19:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We still need to have that talk... - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We'll see about 'having no sins' then. - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) listened intently to Amai's words, allowing them to seep through his ears and register within mind. If Erebus was a normal being, her attempt to talk her way out of this would've worked; but Erebus' determination to her talk no jutsu was Madara level. Another chuckle escaped from Erebus, finding the situation amusing.

"You talk big for a mortal hiding behind another. Your sins are that of betrayal and cowardice, along with idiocy to your own path. Your ultimate sin, however, is you lack of. You have no morals; you are nothing more than filler to this world. When I am ready to recreate this dimension, I will surely see to it that your legacy duplicates your relevancy; nonexistent. Because of that, I am the true sinless being here."* - Mon Sep 21 19:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head throughout the monologue Amai presented. It was all in vain, but her determination was commendable.

"I consider myself not a God, but the sword and shield of one. Your claim of me being as mortal as everyone else within this world is laughable, for I am nowhere near as pitiful as you. I need not to watch your every moves, for even you admitted in your first attempt to plead your case that you've sinned, and you have yet to repent for them. Your betrayal to Niza and your village was when you allowed your idiocy in battle to allow yourself to be captured, your lack of relevancy is one of your many sins.

You state that that every being has shown cowardice, yet here I stand. Here I stand in a village that I am foreign to, looking a native in her eyes and standing toe to toe with her meat shield prepared to force your repent. I act not high and mighty, for acting is a pretentious deed; I -am- high and mighty. I am by far nowhere near a saint, you contradiction in clothing. Being a saint is the deadliest of sins, for being a saint is showing cowardice and betrayal; all of which you are and have shown.

And still, here you stand.. hiding behind your fellow villager. If you truly cared for him, you wouldn't allow him to act as a shield within your battle."* - Mon Sep 21 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Me? A saint? - Mon Sep 21 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I impregnated a whore and got in my feelings over it...I am no saint. - Mon Sep 21 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: And this my lord, is where she perish. - Mon Sep 21 20:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: That's laughable...considering what he's done... - Mon Sep 21 20:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Well Quan, I might be joining you and roki soon bud. - Mon Sep 21 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but release a spine chilling chuckle, the continuous attempt by Amai was truly amusing. She managed to break away from Maloth, ample time for Erebus to act accordingly. With the female's departure, Erebus would pivot forward. He cared not for the safety of Amai, so restraint was nonexistent. For the most part, though, Erebus just wanted to hack off limbs. He started off with slashing for her elbows and shoulders, following up with slowly ripping through her thighs.

Something clicked in him though, as if a calling stopped his movements. He looks up at the sky, supplying it with a nod. Instead of attacking, he simply walked off.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) smirked.* - Tue Sep 22 08:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' eyes wandered from the corpse to Katsune. His eyes narrowed a bit, watching the physical reaction Katsune displayed in the presence of the corpse compared to her verbal reaction. A nod of understanding came from Erebus as he gestured for Katsune to come take a seat next to him.* - Tue Sep 22 08:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: We have much to discuss. - Tue Sep 22 08:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 08:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) watched as Katsune took a seat, allowing her to drag the chair away as much as she see fit. He had an understanding that he wasn't the friendliest of people due to his history with the infamous Scythe, so her actions didn't offend. Erebus released a sigh, leans back in the chair and shifts his head a bit so he was able to stare at the massive paper work on the desk. There was a difference in Erebus right now, a more humanoid aspect to him rather than demonic and religiously driven.

"Tell me what this village means to you. Not what the past leaders had you do or think, but your inner feelings as a whole."* - Tue Sep 22 09:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes momentarily shut as Katsune spoke, allowing her his undivided attention. The words that rolled of her tongue were understandable, he could tell from just the way she formed her sentences that she was genuine; he was opening himself for deception. By time Katsune was finished speaking, Erebus' eyes slowly opened and his head turned so he could look at the female.

"I suppose me taking leadership of Konohagakure was easily predicted, but there's more to all this than meets the eye. I wish not to hold this position for much longer, but pass it down in due time.."* - Tue Sep 22 09:14:52 2015

"Then take the spot.."* - Tue Sep 22 09:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) points to himself.

"I'll be your sword, armor and shield. Your honesty of being cowardice unless forced to take action made it easy for me to come to this decision of letting you have the position. Let me handle the military aspect of things and you handle everything else. I already gathered a million and a half worth of funds for the village. The rest is on you."* - Tue Sep 22 09:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It'd be possible, yes. - Tue Sep 22 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Still, I need you to keep something in mind.. - Tue Sep 22 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: They weren't forced to go there. - Tue Sep 22 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: They have free will to leave as they please. - Tue Sep 22 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're sure? I've had letters from Zenaki. Her explanation of the situation was pretty weird. - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We were still trying to figure out whether she was forced or not. - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We weren't gonna be rash. - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Someone named Ushinawa was holding Suitengo, Zetsumo's son. That's very uncharacteristic of that man -- especially carrying 'that' boy of all children. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki is his aunt. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She had to follow for that reason. We're not sure what the context to that is. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Come to think of it, they did show up with Ushinawa. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki's not sure whether she's allowed to leave or not. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A sticky situation to say the least. - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you wish to happen? - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's in our best interest to bring them home for a lot of reasons. We owe that to Zenaki, and as for Suitengo....well, the two of them 'would' be very valuable too. - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...I want them to want to be here. - Tue Sep 22 10:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: She'll be retrieved once you get a reply. - Tue Sep 22 10:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Might . . . Might not . . . Not sure. - Tue Sep 22 10:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. I must go on this mission alone then. - Tue Sep 22 10:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The Zenaki mission? - Tue Sep 22 10:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wanted to go a personal view of Amegakure. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than barging in and causing trouble, wanted someone with access to be my escort. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, not sure if we'd still be welcome or not. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Quick question, though. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: None of you were willingly allied with him? - Tue Sep 22 10:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He claims some people were....but I'm not sure. Most of us were forced or tricked, or baited in through some way or another. - Tue Sep 22 10:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like to suggest Kilm lead this mission so he can get practice -- but you're also better suited I suspect. - Tue Sep 22 11:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pushes back with his chair, allowing himself to stand to his feet. He walks over to the side room, gathering his robe and scythe, placing both on. Afterwards, he heads out the mansion; Kilm was expected to follow.* - Tue Sep 22 11:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' arrival was heard and smelt. The aroma of death and blood seeped from his body, forcing the inhaling of those around to be more of a chore than normal.

The eerie scraping of metal against stone wasn't available and the strong odor of death and blood wasn't as noticeable.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) took in a slow, deep, breath. His eyes momentarily close, the thoughts in his mind echoing and rampaging. Swiftly, Erebus unsheathes a kunai from his leg holsters, the tip against his wrist. A quick back-dash was followed afterwards, creating space between him and Himura.* - Tue Sep 22 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I can't leave, I have to wait for some things to happen. - Tue Sep 22 13:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes snapped open, the words of Mitsuru breaking the concentration he was trying to develop. The kunai he had pressed against his left wrist was gracefully slicing the skin, allowing blood to drip down his feet. Moments later, with his skin slowly transitioning into that of a demonic stature, Erebus would alter his stare from Yan to Himura, keeping tabs on them both.* - Tue Sep 22 13:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It only means Himura is probably not capable of beating him. - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was aware of the sleep-standing Mizukage behind him, leaving him no room to effectively evade the fireball without any precautions. As the fireball edged in, the Jashinist welcomed it with opened arms; literally. As it clashed into his body, he would bear hug it to the best of his ability, skidding back on his toes as in the process. Just before the massive ball of fire was to explode from the lack of kinetic energy, Erebus used his own strength to launch said fireball into the air; it dispersed there.* - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alright... - Tue Sep 22 14:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It sounds like you're more worried than I am. - Tue Sep 22 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I am a shinobi of honor, Himura is capable of holding his own, I wouldnt intrude on a fight between men, one on one. - Tue Sep 22 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Unless the new one decides to destroy the plaza. - Tue Sep 22 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Without paying for it. - Tue Sep 22 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) remained in his spot, taking the blunt force of the fireballs. His only purpose of doing this was assure the sleep-standing Koeki was safe; all part of the deal to assure she doesn't die.* - Tue Sep 22 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Gonna need to step my game up for this one. - Tue Sep 22 14:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: The man's wife died and he already bounced back to hit on more ladies? - Tue Sep 22 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: Man I wish I had that kind of resolve. - Tue Sep 22 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Someone get Koeki out of the way... - Tue Sep 22 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: Its a lot more fun to smoke with others around.. - Tue Sep 22 14:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) thinks: I swear if that tag causes collateral damage, i'm going to wring Himura's neck out. - Tue Sep 22 14:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: No love. - Tue Sep 22 14:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) dashed forward, seeing the explosive tag being unraveled and placed on Himura's kunai. With haste, not wanting to give the Chuunin a chance to form the handseal necessary to detonate the tag, Erebus would attempt to use his reflexes and speed to grab hold of the soaring kunai and chuck it back to its owner. Even if the tag was to explode in his grasps, Erebus had no worries.* - Tue Sep 22 14:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Damn, she has me thinking of the old lines.. - Tue Sep 22 14:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Why....Why Almighty Sage. - Tue Sep 22 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) didn't even suffer a scratch from the explosion. He simply emerged from the black smoke, eyes fixated on the sergeant Hassan. "I seek not to fight any longer, but my feud with Himura is not over."* - Tue Sep 22 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Did I just hear that correctly? - Tue Sep 22 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hmm? - Tue Sep 22 14:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) takes out three hundred yen, chucking the pouch it was in toward Hassan.* - Tue Sep 22 14:46:49 2015
