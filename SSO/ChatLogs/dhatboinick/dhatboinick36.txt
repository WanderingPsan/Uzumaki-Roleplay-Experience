<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) looks at the Mizukage as if he was a traitor. "Can.. you not whisper!? The devil's daughter-" he points to Nina, "-is right there!?"

Just as he shouted that, he'd bring both his hands to his mouth and covered it. "Oops.."* - Fri Nov  6 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) attempts to walk out the door. He looks at Nina, then U-Turns to take the long way.* - Fri Nov  6 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Before anyone does anything. - Fri Nov  6 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) gives her a quick glance before momentarily looking away. He does a double take with widened eyes. "Oh.."* - Fri Nov  6 06:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: . - Fri Nov  6 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. He examines Ajisai's frame, allowing his eyes to soak in what he saw. He skin was extremely pale, but everything else was pretty normal. For the most parth, the katana seemed familiar but nothing was said about it. "Ehh? Did you just graduate?"* - Fri Nov  6 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, frowning as Ajisai spoke. "Ohh, she's a cocky one huh!?" he thought as he stepped closer. "So, Mrs NonShinobi! What's your name? Ehh!?"* - Fri Nov  6 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Rude. - Fri Nov  6 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in approval. When Nina reentered his peripherals, he'd back step. Nina once already tried to kill him, so there was no point in leaving himself open for another attack! Nevertheless, he'd puff is chest out to make himself look muscular, a taunt for Nina --- he made sure she couldn't see this. Once she was out of eyesight, he'd turn to Ajisai and gave another nod. "Alright, alright. So, I'm going to ask you this once and once only..! Do.. you like.. sake!?"* - Fri Nov  6 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) 's frown thickens in response to Ajisai's comment. To make things worse, the Mizukage wanted him to go mingle with the death trap known as Nina --- no thank you!

"Fine.. Be like that..! But one of these days, you'll be forced to share a drink with me!"* - Fri Nov  6 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Pft. - Fri Nov  6 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: ... - Fri Nov  6 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She thought she could run.. - Fri Nov  6 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Fri Nov  6 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) sat down with authority!* - Fri Nov  6 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: You thought you could run, didn't you! - Fri Nov  6 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't run at all, I said I was going to get sake. - Fri Nov  6 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This liquid is awful. - Fri Nov  6 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) looks from left to right, checking to see if the coast was clear. His posture becomes more relaxed and his voice became more subtle. In his mind, by the tone of Ajisai's skin, Ketsu believed it was Ume. Even though he believed this, though, he had a hint of doubt due to her amazing acting skills. To assure himself, he'd keep his part of the disguise going.

"Having a drink with me will rock your world! I am Ketsu the Gets'Your Girl!"* - Fri Nov  6 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened a bit, but quickly narrowed back to normal. The mention of peace flipped a switch in him, and in turn he gave a nod of agreement.

"Ahh. So you.. samurai's.. want peace huh?" Ketsu's voice was lower than it previously was. His tone lacked the excitement and childishness; it was more.. serious.. with a hint of nonchalant.* - Fri Nov  6 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. He leans forward a bit, once again looking from left to right. "Are all samurai females as.. you know.."* - Fri Nov  6 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) lifted his arm and extends his finger to her. He wasn't pointing at a specific spot on her body, but her in general. "Are they like you? So.. plain?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) ducked his head.* - Fri Nov  6 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi.. - Fri Nov  6 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: I was joking.. - Fri Nov  6 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Uhuh. - Fri Nov  6 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) released a sigh. He scratches the back of his head. "Let's cut to the chase.. How many years you had to train to use that thing?" He gestures to the katana. Quite frankly, we was trying to see how far he can take this conversation before any hint of 'Ume' came up.* - Fri Nov  6 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Two, I've only been a full samurai for a couple of years. Before that I helped around the temple. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Quick reply.. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Come over here.. - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) pats the cushion next to him.* - Fri Nov  6 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider the chance to be on a diet.. - Fri Nov  6 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) pats the cushion again.* - Fri Nov  6 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) raised his arms in submission, locking his eyes with Ajisai's. For a few seconds he'd make no sudden movements, just subtly progressin one of his hands toward hers; the one that gripped the katana. The expression of his face was pretty much blank.* - Fri Nov  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) clenches his jaw, slowly shaking his head in response to Ajisai's last question. His hand continues to inch closer slowly, attempting to gently rest it on hers. It was clear that he wasn't trying to disarm her by forcefull means, but to possibly ease the.. false?.. tension.* - Fri Nov  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) took the sudden jerk of the katana as an opportunity. He leans his upper body back a bit, allowing the blade to momentarily swish through the air. With the same hand he used to inch closer to hers, Ketsu grips her wrist and pulls her closer. His eyes narrow, an attempt to make sheer eye contact with her. By now, the blade would be off to the side, still in her grip, with his own hand wrapped around her wrist. He says nothing to her, just kept the eye contact going.* - Fri Nov  6 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Being that I have paid for the mansion to be fixed, I'll be there if you need me. - Fri Nov  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) leans in close, keeping his eyes fixed on Ajisai in the process. He unclenches his jaw, parting his lips slightly and begin using that as his source of breathing; each intake and exhale of air being subtle. No words said.* - Fri Nov  6 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Let go of me.... - Fri Nov  6 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, keeping her in place.* - Fri Nov  6 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) shook his head once again. He releases her wrist, saying nothing in the process.* - Fri Nov  6 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) raised his opposing hand, the one that didn't previously have Aijsai's wrist gripped, and places a finger under her chin. He straightens her head and leans in some more, leaving only a inch between them before physical contact could be made by their lips.* - Fri Nov  6 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: How do I keep pretending, I don't want to deny him this. - Fri Nov  6 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) leans in, but only to have his lips glide against hers. Rather than planting a full kiss on her, that subtle contact between their lips was made. He trails his arms down her body and wraps them around her waist, keeping them there for the time being. He pulls his head back and attempts to make eye contact with her. A look of curiosity forms on his visage. He still hasn't said anything.* - Fri Nov  6 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) shook his head once again. "Nothing, nothing." He leans in, arching his head a bit and plants the kiss on her cheek. Once retracting his head, he'd loosen the grip he had on her body until she was eventually freed. He'd turn his body slightly and face the table once again. Both his hands raise to his head and rub through his hair, his fingers extend and retract every so often; giving him a good scratch of his skull.  "Pretty good disguise. I thought I did a decent job, but you topped me easily."* - Fri Nov  6 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) glances at Ajisai, removes his hands from his hair and chuckling. "Weird how..? Uneasy or something?"* - Fri Nov  6 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: And it tasted terrible. - Fri Nov  6 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) chuckles. "Yeah, it does that. You'll get used to the taste if you keep drinking. If."* - Fri Nov  6 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think I will.. - Fri Nov  6 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || A smirks creeps on his face as he gave a nod of approval. With a lack of modesty, he'd pan over her body with his eyes before looking at her. "Uh huh.~"* - Fri Nov  6 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) didn't exactly know how to reply to that, so he nodded and gave a basic answer. "Alright, uhh. Are you talking about down.. there..?"* - Fri Nov  6 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || "Alright, alright. We probably shouldn't do this here. Go ahead and find a nearby house and I'll be right there." Ketsu stands to his feet, offers his hand for Ajisai to use as leverage to get up and sends her off. Meanwhile, he'd go over to the Bartender. He whispers back and forth before handing over yen in exchange for a few magazines/scroll/whatever. From there, he'd pace out the pub after Ajisai.* - Fri Nov  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) enters the house with the magazines/scrolls in hand. He walks over the to table and sits next to Ajisai, places the picture books down and sighed.* - Fri Nov  6 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) takes one up and shows her the cover. On it was a half naked female that only had a see-through night gown on. "It's.. how I'm going to help you."* - Fri Nov  6 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Those clothing don't look very useful for warmth. - Fri Nov  6 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) opens the magazine to the first page, showing it to Ajisai. The page had multiple females in similar clothing. Each stood facing the camera, and viewers of the page, with their breasts exposed. Their lower bodies only had thongs attached, and even then it didn't do much to hide the intentionally made cameltoes.* - Fri Nov  6 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: See.. something you know you don't have..? - Fri Nov  6 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) takes a glance at the page then instinctively looks down at Ajisai's before returning back to the page. "Those are nipples. They harden when a female is aroused, cold and other stuff. They belong on your breasts." Ketsu would point to the number of nipples on the page then turn to look at Ketsu to see if she was able to comprehend just a little.* - Fri Nov  6 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) blinks. He watched her go silent for a few moments before turning to him like nothing happened. He blinks a few more times, panning his eyes over her body out of curiosity to see if it really was that easy for her change. "Uhh, next is.." he flips the page and shows her a female sitting on a chair with her legs wide open and propped up. He mound was bare from any form of panties and pubic hair. She had two fingers separating her lips, giving the viewers a full show of what she had. "This is a vagina, the thing I told you about that females have."* - Fri Nov  6 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) 's raised an eyebrow, watching as she leaned forward to get a better look. "Y-Yeah.. Uhh, apart from that I'm not exactly sure what else you're missing."* - Fri Nov  6 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He watched her going to that state of sheer concentration, remaining quiet to not break it. When she turns to look at him, he'd blink a few time before nodding. "Sure, sure. Just.. you know.. take off your clothes."* - Fri Nov  6 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I meant check the book but.... - Fri Nov  6 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) tried his best to excessively stare at her body as she disrobed. He kept his gaze on her, now smaller, breasts and trailed down to her bound. An audible sigh escaped Ketsu followed by a cough. He looks back at the magazine in his hand and flips through a few more pages. Each new page had something similar to the previous, but a difference was clear. "The rest of the stuff is just.. pre-fertilization stu-," he was cut off at a clear image of a man taking a female from the back. He knew something like this would be shown, but the placement of the image, after the previous page only showed something less vulgar, caught him off guard. "-Pre-firtilization stuff."* - Fri Nov  6 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. Maturity made awkward moments easier to live through. "When it comes to this magazine, it is another hole a male put his.. tool.. into to help in this pre-fertilization process."* - Fri Nov  6 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you need another one? - Fri Nov  6 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Pleasure. - Fri Nov  6 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: Some people like the feeling.. - Fri Nov  6 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I can't feel pleasure... - Fri Nov  6 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) continues to flip through the magazine, allowing her enough time to examine picture after picture. For the most part there wasn't anything missing, but for her curiosity he'd keep scrolling through. At one point in the magazine, a page was triple folded so he had to turn the book to its side and allow the page to fall to its full length. On the page was two different pictures that featured the same two females.

The top picture was of a female providing the male with oral favors while the second picture, below the first, was the end result.

Ketsu remained calm, but clances toward Ajisai before going to fold the page back up and continuing to flip through. "Uhh, uh.. No, I think that's it."* - Fri Nov  6 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) closed the magazine and placed it back on the table. He releases a sigh and leans back first against the wall, entering his nonchalant posture. He glances at Ajisai, taking in the sight of her body. He quickly averts his eyes, biting down on his bottom lip a bit. "Y-Yeah.. That's was all."* - Fri Nov  6 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hm... he's acting like Index was. - Fri Nov  6 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) gulped. Temptations were clouding his mind, but he did his best. He kept straightens his head and looks forward. "Uh-Uh.. So, um."* - Fri Nov  6 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: . . . Right. - Fri Nov  6 17:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I don't like the idea of being 'taught' things, it makes me feel weak and helpless. - Fri Nov  6 17:57:45 2015

He quietly smears the blood in his opposing, forming a quick succession of handseals afterwards. No words were said, no sudden movements were made. He acts completely casual as he crouched down and placed the smeared palm on to the grassy ground. Just as he did so, the immediate area is engulfed in a shroud of white smoke.
 
Out from behind the smoke came a massive purple snake, charging toward Lera's general area. Of course, since Manda, the name of the snake, knew of the current plan, he'd purposely avoid the Mizukage. Ketsu, who was placed on top of Manda's head would string together another series of handseals, allowing his chakra to knead within his stomach. Afterwards, when the handseals were complete, he'd inhale one powerful time. His lips pucker and his chest deflate, unleashing a powerful gust of wind toward Lera.* - Fri Nov  6 19:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) ||

Ketsu: "Manda.."

Manda: "I know."

Lera's attempt to submerge herself beneath ground and escape was humorous. Ketsu hops off Manda's head, allowing the massive snake to utilize his burrowing abilities to chase after the female. Once, or if, the snake was to catch up to the female, he'd attempt to swallow her whole. He, while that was going on, turned to look over at Ikaro. "Stay out of this. This is between me and the people that fucked me over!"* - Fri Nov  6 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || There seemed to be a misunderstanding in what exactly Manda is capable of. This massive snake was rather fast for his size, and it's for that very same reason that Lera may have screwed herself over. With her extracting herself from the ground and attempting to take flight, which increased her speed a bit, Manda was right there. Lera, whilst underground, was still slower than Manda as is, this little speed boost did little to nothing for Lera. By time her feet left the ground, it's most likely that Manda was right under her, still attempting to swallow her whole.

Ortho, on the other hand, had Ikaro to worry about. While Manda did his thing, with the now aid of the ANBU Agent, Ortho strung a series of handseals together. Ikaro must feel like he is Frieza or something, his talking screwed him over. Ortho's blackened pupils lighten a bit, then dims into a new color. As his sharingan activates, his jutsu was ready. Before Ikaro went to launch the bubbles forward, Ortho would stretch his arms out and send a devastating pulsation of electricity forward. Ikaro, you talk too much.* - Fri Nov  6 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm rooting for Ikaro and erm . . . Lera. - Fri Nov  6 20:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || Misunderstanding after misunderstanding; let's not make this a trend. Yes, Lera had a plausible way out of this, but do she really think Manda was any different structure wise from regular snakes? Let's be honest here, Naruto got out of the snake from the use of Multiple Shadow Clone, not a damn kunai or finger tips. That being said, while using his natural snake abilities to alter the muscles in his throat, Manda would shift Lera and the samehada around within his body. On top of that, the inside of Manda, like every other snake that was digesting something, was extremely slimy. As a result, when the samehada went to be used as a wedge, it simple slipped out of place. By this point, Lera's frame would begin to be squished and suffocated by the inside muscle of Manda.

Ortho, with Ikaro now coming in for the snipe, narrowed his eyes. The oncoming bullet was fast, but it wasn't something he couldn't counter. With it raging forth, from the distance at which it was coming from, Ortho ducked and evaded. Upon doing so, with handseals once again rapidly stringing together, Ortho allows his chakra to knead with haste. Just as the bullet swooped past him, after he ducked and evaded, Ortho slammed his palms on to the ground again. A massive dorm would life around Ikaro as a result, quickly encasing the male completely.

Ortho wasn't done there. He didn't want to underestimate Ikaro, so he formed another succession of handseals; the same as before. Once again, he'd knead his chakra and slam his palms down, aiming to create yet another dome around Ikaro and the first dome. Now, it was a double dome.* - Fri Nov  6 20:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || There was a reason why Ortho wanted to capture Ikaro in the two domes. Another succession of handseals was formed and his combination continued. With Ikaro now sinking below ground, just like Elon and Violet did, Ortho goes to his Earth Style chakra nature. He slams both his palms into the ground, causing a barrage of spikes to form through the earth and riddle the generic area where Ikaro was with it. The intention was to pierce through the body of the Hogo. Yes, the body of a HOGO.

The next formation of handseals was what will define this battle, or so Ortho believed. The Bamboo Shoot was just the beginning, and whether or not Ikaro was hit, Ortho continued the onslaught. He forms another set of handseals and stretched his arms out, aiming to submerge the area in lightning. To make matters worse, he'd place his palms on the turf to have the electricity surge below the surface as well.

Manda was over there handling his business. It was until the sudden rush of mud, which no handseals were apparently done for but was going to let slide since it's whatever, that Manda had to throw Lera up. Snakes, unlike humans, threw up their food on a daily basis. It's for that reason why Manda went on the onslaught again when Lera was expelled from his body. Instead of trying to swallow her, he simply tried to crush her under his weight.* - Fri Nov  6 20:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || This battle was getting annoying. Ortho couldn't comprehend why Ikaro just didn't but out and mind his own business. Hell, if anything, Ortho didn't even want to fight the damn Hogo. For the most part, he wanted to claim what was rightfully his; Lera's life.

Ikaro extracts himself from beneath the ground, Ortho stares at him and slowly shook his head. "I'm no push over, Ikaro. Mind your business and leave me to my work!" That being said, with another set of handseals being weaved together, he'd fill his lungs with air. Upon doing so, he'd began exhaling in intervals, sending off a multitude of air bullets toward the Hogo.

Meanwhile, with Lera trying everything to get away from the onslaught, Manda halted his descent to her body. Just as he did, he saw Mizumi come in for the clutch in an attempt to subdue Lera. As a result, Manda would maneuver his war around the two, lessening the room Lera had. If she took flight, he'd be able to react. If she burrowed, he'd be able to react.* - Fri Nov  6 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) formed a single handseal, causing the root seal he placed on Manda to activate; the snake's body goes limp and he is knocked out cold.* - Fri Nov  6 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) smirked. Index's presence felt harshly. Manda was now under Index's control and now Ortho was left in the dark. Fine, let's go ham. He faced Ikaro, taking his words into consideration. "Because it's what Hideki would want, and in turn what Erebus would want.. And in turn what Ushinawa would want.. And in turn.. What Tethys would want. Peace, ultimate peace. Understanding, serenity of understanding. That, Ikaro. Is why the previous biased generation of each village.. must die. Soon, my death of my generation will happen.. but until then, Lera must fall."

In a moment's notice, Ortho dashed full speed toward Lera, allowing two handseals to form. He keeps Ikaro in his peripherals while extending his left arm toward Lera. At that moment, with her dazed from shunshin, he'd have a multitude of snakes to creep from his limb and bit into the female's face.. inject paralysis venom.* - Fri Nov  6 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) saw the color of chakra within the manipulated water and knew exactly who was controlling it at his point; damn it Ikaro. Ortho's focus transitioned toward Index, growling. "Get the fuck out, Index! NOW!" With that, instead of going straight for Lera, he'd allow the snakes to retract into his body. With that, he'd formed a series of handseals. His lungs filled for just a brief moment.

Rage was filling within Ortho's mind as he expelled a powerful gust of wind. He placed all he had into it, wanting its concussive damage to hit everyone, ally or foe. "ALL I WANT! IS PEACE! THIS IS MY STEPPING STONE TO PEACE, EITHER YOU'RE WITH ME OR YOU'RE AGAINST ME!" On that, the wind raged through the entire area; from Ikaro way over to Manda's KOed body.* - Fri Nov  6 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || "I've accepted the fact, Hideki. I've accepted the fact that not everyone can be as determined as I, and in turn not everyone can have the level of understand I have grasped. You told me that no man shall die peacefully if they do not die at the hands of fate, for it is fate that determines whether are goals are met. I stand here, right now Hideki, a man willing to die in the name of my way.. the name of my goals.. the name.. of Ortho."

Ortho hovers his right hand over his right bicep, applying chakra to the seal in the midst of his tattoo's. In an instant, a bulky bag is spawned and gripped. He brings the bag to his mouth and clamped down, holding it there. As the water came his way, he'd begin trailing toward Lera, hoping to evade the water. At this point, he'd form a series of handseals and allow a massive gust of wind expel forward. Right after, with the pouch now shot forward toward the dazed lera and the gust of wind making its presence felt, he'd form another handseal. This handseal was the activation of the fifteen exploding tags located in the backpouch. He was going to, literally, nuke the female.* - Fri Nov  6 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || The water proved efficient. It managed to catch Ortho, but just as the final handseal was made to set the explosive tags off. Now that Ortho was trapped in the prison, he used the water to shield him from the concussive damage of the explosive tags; thank you Ikaro. The explosion would scatter the water and send Ortho flying back. "S-Stay out of this, Ikaro! This isn't your fucking business!"* - Fri Nov  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) left the group as soon as kilm died.* - Fri Nov  6 22:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) wasn't done by a long shot. Now that Lera was in the Mizukage's grasp, Ortho took his stand one more. Handseals were woven together and the kneading of his chakra commenced within his stomach. Just when the time was right, now that Lera harbored a layer of earth around her body, Ortho would send off a pulse of electricity to zap Lera. His intentions was not to kill her, but to knock her out.* - Fri Nov  6 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: If anyone dies then I guess I get to talk to someone and confess that i've been watching all this time. - Fri Nov  6 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) paced himself toward Lera, grabbing her limp body and falls to his knees. He places his hands around her neck and began to squeeze, watching her almost lifeless body submit to his efforts. However, as the process went on, tears began to pour down his cheeks. His view on Lera changed, like an out of body experience struck him.

How would he feel if it was someone else doing this to Nina? Lera was indeed loved by people, and that was proven here today. A massive brawl just for her death, despite the sins she have commited. Ortho slowly shook his head. "Damn it, Hideki. Why the fuck you have to make me see things the hard way even in death..?" Tears continue to pour down his face as Ortho released Lera neck and instead hovers them over her body, beginning the healing process to her.

"This.. isn't the way.."* - Fri Nov  6 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) 's hands continue to hover of Lera's body, allowing his medical ninjutsu to continue healing her up. He stabilizes her wounds and sped her natural healing process up. "I warn you all.. don't fuck with me. I tell you, the day I decide to go rogue, all of you get fucked up.. I tried to play nice, I tried to stay in the background, but you fuckers kept pushing me.. Now, look you dumb bitch.. Forced to get healed by the person that fucked you up.."

Ortho's words were audible to the surrounding area, but it was clear who he was talking to. "You fucking owe you, you dumb skillet nose ass bitch.."* - Fri Nov  6 23:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) formed a handseal, allowing the seal on Manda to deactivate. The large snake begins to fidget in place before his eyes open and he raises his head a bit. 

Ortho: "Thanks for being loyal, Manda.."

Manda: "Shut up.. Blame Index.."* - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) turns his  head to look over at Index.* - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) stood to hit feet, allowing his arms to drop to his side. Just like the gaze Index granted him, Ortho returned in. Lera was properly stabilized and just needed some rest. She'll be good to go in a few hours. "You have beef?" Ortho continues to stare at Index, his tone of voice lacking any form of emotions. "You jump into my business yet again, so you must have beef. Fuck everyone else here, let's settle this shit like men."

Ortho side steps everyone, setting himself in the open for Index and the others to see. "Come, Index. Tension been too high between you and I. You have that look in your eye that you're angry, release that anger. And you won't just be Katsune's BITCH."* - Fri Nov  6 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Welp. - Fri Nov  6 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Guess I'm meeting someone after this fight. - Fri Nov  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsu(DhatBoiNick) || Begin.

Words weren't needed at this point. Words couldn't even properly fit in this puzzle of a standoff; it'll only reign as an understatement. Index against Ortho, Ortho against Index, two completely different views going at it. 

Ortho made the first move, breaking off southward, which was to his left, and began the process of weaving handseals. His eyes remain fixated on Index, not wanting any reaction to go unnoticed. The kneading of chakra was surprisingly apparent due to the intensity from his concentration. The chakra that was molding itself would flow to his lungs, merging with the air that he was taking in through his nostrils. At this point, with each step her took, Ortho would unleash two air bullets. By time he was done, Ortho managed to unleash twelve bullets forward.* - Sat Nov  7 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Betrayal is a word used too many times by these other greedy Uchiha's. They find every bit and piece of life where mistakes are present to deem something as betrayal, and it's for that reason why Index and Ortho are going at it. Two fine shinobi butting heads because one walks into something he knew nothing about and instantly deemed the actions as betrayal. It's pitiful for two people that shared the same sensei to go at it in the name of betrayal.

The mud wall did little to prevent Ortho from continuing his attack. The efforts of Nina and Ajisai were overlooked for just this moment; rage proving to cloud Ortho's mind. Another set of handseals were woven together, and with Index's line of sight being blocked by the wall, it was a matter of coming up with a counter. Upon the handseals completion, Ortho slammed his hands atop the ground, causing a dome of earth to quickly form around Index and the mud wall.

Afterwards, to continue the combination, Ortho weaves yet another set of handseals. Once again his hands slam on to the earth's surface, this time around spike rampage toward Index. Seeing as though the spikes were forming beneath the ground and protruding up, the whole point of the dome was to prevent the once 'brother' from evading. The only way possible to evade by normal means is to burrow beneath ground, and we know from how Violet and Elon died how that goes with these spikes.* - Sat Nov  7 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Erg, Ortho, why aren't you listening... - Sat Nov  7 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || A hole was pierced through the done, causing the spikes to easily be destroyed. Haste continues to guide Ortho as he takes a single step forward. His hands raise to chest level and quickly surge through a set of seals. The lightning from Index was nearing, but no hesitation was given in response.

Nina's jutsu managed to push Ortho back, sending him tumbling over with relative ease. This, however, didn't stop the enraged male. If anything, it only made him angrier. Despite this, however, he makes it to his feet and continues with his response. By this point, the lightning jutsu from Index was closing; Nina's Great Breakthrough weakening it just a tad bit.

Ortho his lungs with oxygen and puckers his lips, he would soon after unleash his own gust of wind. This, in turn was specifically aimed toward the hole Index made with his lightning. Following the gust of wind was another formation of handseals and the expulsion of a massive fireball. The initial wind was to negate the lightning and to aid the fireball closing trailing after.* - Sat Nov  7 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) broke off into a full sprint, aiming to close the distance between him and Index. Another set of handseals were woven together and his chakra rapidly kneaded within his stomach. Just as he puckered his lips to expel the jutsu he prepared Ajisai stepped right in the crossfire. It was one thing to launch jutsus at him from a distance to get him to stop, but even he had boundaries to not harm Nina and Ajisai when they stepped head first into the line of battle.

Ortho's frame stopped, his eyes momentarily transitioning from Index to the pale skinned female. It rests on her for a few seconds before panning the area for Nina. His anger was clouding his mind, but these two females in his life were acting as a united ray of light piercing through. His fists clenched and he placed his focus back on Index, saying nothing.* - Sat Nov  7 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "I've respected Index, I've come to terms with Index, I've eaten with Index, I've drank with Index.. Index is- was.. my brother. He is the only person after Hideki died that looked me in the face, told me like it is and made me understand myself. But he's a sellout! All he does is make movements to better his petty ass girlfriend. I basically asked him if he is still a rider because everything he does is for her. I get it, he loves her, that's his spouse. But how many times is he going to butt into my business and act like he knows anything about me when all he does is climb up Katsune's pussy when the tough gets going!? I've sat with myself day in and day out wondering how I should mold my goals and plans to make sure his and my path's don't cross! I've done everything physically, mentally and emotionally possible! Yet he looks at me with those eyes.. those eyes of hatred and anger when I didn't even do anything to HIM! No more, damn it..! I WON'T ALLOW HIM TO LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M SOME PIECE OF TRASH! LIKE I'M SOME.. ANIMAL!"

Ortho didn't even bother to let Index talk; he sidesteps Nina and Ajisai both. Using the chakra he had kneaded beforehand, he'd pucker his lips and unleashed another massive fireball.* - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Is this really what it comes down to? Is this really what fate had in store of us as a shinobi? The whisper in the wind being the dying breath of someone that stepped in front of the bullet for a person that has done nothing but commit sins? The hopes of at the cost of her life, the next person would be able to open their eyes and transition into a serene state of mind? The hopes that as her soul left her body, a level of understanding and wisdom can be achieved to the next person? Is this really what it comes down to?

Ortho's eyes widened. He stumbles for words, but couldn't pull himself together to find them. He watches Ume's body go limp after her dying speech, a final cough made and blood trickle down the side of his mouth. Ortho would fall to his knees; positioning himself by Ume's lifeless body. His head slowly shook and his eyes swell with tears. "N-No.. not agai-.. No, damn it.. Ume, wake up-.. I'm sorry, Ume-.. UME! I SAID GET UP!"

He takes her by the shoulders and shook her; no response. Eventually the tears that swelled in his eyes would overflow and seep down his cheeks. "Get.. up, Ume.. get up.." Ortho's strength completely left his body as he leans forward, bowing his head over the body. "This.. wasn't supposed to happen, Ume.. I told you not to ever do that.. I was supposed to protect you two.. I'm.. sorry.."* - Sat Nov  7 02:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "It's.. my fault." Ortho spoke, his voice was hoarse and low. "..m-my.. fault."

How could this happen? Where did he go wrong? What turn did he take in this life where everything would come crashing down on him? What decision did he make where everything he believed in, everything he felt was right.. turned out to be false and.. wrong? How can he turn back time, or even hit the reset button? Reset everything to the exact moment he made the wrong move, chose the wrong choice, said the wrong thing, did the wrong action. Just.. a reset.

"..it's.. my fau-..fault.."

Tears no longer trailed down his cheeks, that feat were no longer possible. His head went from slow shakes of denial to nods of acceptance. Acceptance that he was a screw up; acceptance that the path he chose was completely wrong. Acceptance of the fact that fate couldn't be changed, just postponed. Acceptance that no matter what he did or say he will eventually succumb to the darkness. Acceptance that no matter how far, or how fast, he runs darkness was inevitable.

Ortho would remain still, only moving to raise his head to look at Index. "..my.. fault." His eyes remained in their crimson state, the single tomoe swirling before resting at the corner. Despite this, it can be told Ortho no longer had a soul or peace of mind; he was just.. there. "my fault.." Ortho continues to absent mindedly stare of Index, doing nothing. Whether or not Index truly wished to kill Ortho didn't matter anymore. To Ortho, everything he stood for shattered. He just.. sat there at the mercy of fate..* - Sat Nov  7 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || What did Ortho have left? What did Ortho have to look forward into? Index's words stirred anger in him, but he just didn't have the will to act on it. Index was just the ideal hypocrite. He had everything to ask for. He had a spouse that didn't have one foot out the door, yet he chose to intrude on something good Ortho had going. Index had riches while Ortho had to play bitch to multiple kages just to make a living. Index was simply put, a lie. He preach that Ortho's way was wrong and against Hideki, but everything Index did was for his own selfish gain. Ortho wasn't a saint, but he made movements that he knew Hideki would want. Index, on the other hand, did things that were best for him and the piece of vagina he was getting from Katsune.

Still, however, the complete blame was placed on Ortho. The riddle of life was solved and Ortho being the one to get the short stick out of the bunch. His eyes trailed after Index, watching him walk off. Ortho slowly shook his head, voiding himself of all thoughts that the man he wants loved like a brother was now his number one enemy. All for what though? That part has yet to be clear. Hell, it must've been some random ragefit that Index was going through while trying to reap what he didn't sow. Nevertheless, Ortho remain quiet. He lifts his head and stares at the skies above.

"..my.. fault.."* - Sat Nov  7 02:51:05 2015
