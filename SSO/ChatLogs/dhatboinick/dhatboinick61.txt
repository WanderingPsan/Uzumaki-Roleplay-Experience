<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) looks up at her and blinks a few times. He places the bottle on the table and brings both his hands to her stomach, slowly trailing it up.* - Mon Dec  7 11:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) tugs on the fabric over her breasts, "off."* - Mon Dec  7 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched strip off the bra, smirking a bit. "Come.. let's go to bed." He stands, with her in his arms. He lays her down and climbs, pulling her close and just chilling till they drifted off.* - Mon Dec  7 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah, I see... Mrm... always wanted to visit this place. How you guys holding up lately, then? - Mon Dec  7 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Pretty good. - Mon Dec  7 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) strolls up the infamous mountain of Kumogakure. His hands are tucked away within his pants pockets, his bow is firmly wrapped around his body and his quiver of arrows is strapped to his back. His attire is casual, but still battle ready. His eyes pan over from person to person, taking in the sight before him. His attention remained on Mitsunara the most, but doesn't say anything to her. Instead, with his gaze still placed on her, he'd speak to Takuma.

"Since when was Kumogakure a sight-seeing fest?"* - Mon Dec  7 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: No idea man. - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: People just come and go, I wonder if our guards are just being lazy. .  - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Come to the wrong place, we don't have many swordsmen. - Mon Dec  7 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in on Mitsunara, her explanation striking his interest. He was trying to locate a headband upon her frame to back up this Kage Permission'd leave. Still, he doesn't audibly question her words on that aspect. He simply nods his head.

"The most you are going to get is me. I major in archery, but give me a zanbatou and I'll prove it's nothing more than a feather."* - Mon Dec  7 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) obviously found the headband on her arm.* - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: I should go talk to my toad buddies. - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Forever alone status. - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's expression lightened. Of course the average man would register her words as something sexual and something that must be enhanced upon, but her words were true when it came to the blades he weild.

"I'm afraid not. I have plenty of money to buy one and I have plenty of knowledge within the Fuuinjutus arts to seal one, but I simply don't."* - Mon Dec  7 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yo, real quick. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Are Sunagakure's guards still on edge? - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Eh? A bit... not as much? Plus.. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: The new Kazekage's a lot more lenient about letting people in. - Mon Dec  7 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright. . .I'm going to go visit. - Mon Dec  7 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I ask 'cus I can stand to lend you a normal sword, and use somethin else. - Mon Dec  7 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmmm. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: A regular katana? - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Eeer.. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Not that proficient.. - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: How about you give me time to go buy a Zanbatou and we'll go at it? - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure, if you know a place you can get one reasonably soon. - Mon Dec  7 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head and paced off, placing his destination to the local shop.* - Mon Dec  7 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) strolls back with a zanbatou hitched to his back.* - Mon Dec  7 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reached over for the hilt, his right hand firmly gripping the massive blade and unsheathing it. He brings the silver end of the blade tot he ground at his feet.* - Mon Dec  7 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in once more, taking in the sight before him. With the zanbatou in his grasp, and Mitsunara pulling out the stops before it could even begin, Sogeki does the same.

He inhales silently and focuses his chakra, allowing it to circulate and vibrate throughout his frame. Just then, as he prepared his stance and weaved the massive blade back into the air, a rush of electrical power engulfs the massive blade.

Rather than waiting for Mitsunara to charge forward, he did the honors. He starts with cocking back his arm, the one gripping the Lightning Blade, and heaved it forward. The set path was slanted and aimed for Mitsun's upper right shoulder down to her lower left hip.* - Mon Dec  7 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is noticeably holding back.* - Mon Dec  7 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) thinks: I;ll be sure to use my weapon on her. - Mon Dec  7 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: ... - Mon Dec  7 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's focus shifted to her retaliation. Of course, with her more than likely attacking at full pace, Sogeki eased back in hopes of evading. By time he did such an action he'd alter the grip he had on his zanbatou. As a result, the wide frame would send the katana slightly off its course.

Following that movement, he'd turn on his heels and extend his arm. He chose to pick up the pace a bit more and spun around, allowing the same lightning encoated blade to threaten heaving straight through Mitsunara. Of course, this was a feint, he'd instead threaten to just cause a light gash into her hip.* - Mon Dec  7 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was sent off course as well, normally his restrained strike was enough. The lightning coated blade met the katana and they clinged, of course he made this possible in an attempt to allow room to be formed between them. The fashion in which she attacked did, however, cause a slight cut in his shoulder.

He smirks.

"Well, well. Seems as though you won.. First to draw blood.~"* - Mon Dec  7 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) chuckled a bit, strapping his zanbatou to his back.

"Forgive me.. I was outmatched from the start.~"* - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Somehow... I doubt that. The strength to swing around that big 'ol thing... - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: But not to pierce my skin with it? - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'm not buyin it. - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hahaha. - Mon Dec  7 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think Sogeki has seen me yet. - Mon Dec  7 22:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) shifts his gaze to the Raikage, "yes.. the pleasure is mind."

He speaks up to the Raikage. "I request your audiance."* - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Of course. - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: So much for that. - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: You know any good swordspeople elsewhere, Alberto.. - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Del.. - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Rio? - Mon Dec  7 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: And he ignored me, *mental sigh*---Ouch...I should stop doing that..it hurts. - Mon Dec  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Mon Dec  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) points to Menma. "Ask him," he says while trailing after the Raikage, glancing at Kariudo on the way.* - Mon Dec  7 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...have your discussion, Sogeki. - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He looks well.... - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) walks over the desk, placing himself dangerously close to the Raikage. He slams his palms on the desk and became eye-level with the villages' leader.

"This is a matter that has been bothering me for the last six months," he says with a very stern voice. He lowers his head dramatically and sighed..

"The village is.... in a deep depression of this matter and I need to bring it to your attention." He raises his head and slowly shook it.

"We need more liquor."* - Mon Dec  7 22:16:44 2015

I am not asking to drown my sorrows, but to go home after a long day of training and relax."* - Mon Dec  7 22:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's why that portion has been covered for sometime. - Tue Dec  8 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Hm.. - Tue Dec  8 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Let's view it now. - Tue Dec  8 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) naturally wore all black. His focus was set on the Raikage before him and no words were said. The renewal of everyone's grievance put a bad taste in Sogeki's mouth, making his detach from worldly affairs by nature. His lids lower and he diverts his eyes for a brief moment. There really wasn't a point in Sogeki's life where he was willingly open with his feelings, but the respect he had for the fallen shinobi of his village was displayed

It wasn't until the Raikage began to speak when Sogeki lifted his head, attentively listening to each word that rolled off of his Lord's tongue. He can't lie, he wasn't expecting something like this. At most, he was anticipating a speech about the lost lives and how the new generation and the next generation must thrive to make the past generations proud, but a form of revolution was sparked in mere seconds.

His eyes widen. Sogeki tucked his hands away, confining them within his pants pockets. He nodded a subtle four times throughout the speech, but remains quiet. Nothing the Raikage, at this point, can do that will sway Sogeki's loyalty and pride for Kumogakure. It wasn't a matter of what the Raikage does, it's a matter of what the Raikage does that'll make Sogeki catch a body for his sake. That.. was the level of loyalty this savage had for his leader and village.

No verbal response is given.* - Tue Dec  8 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: I will not doubt be in danger from here on out. - Tue Dec  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: But what I intend to pass down to you. - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Is the fact that we are to be a free people, and even if Sunagakure intends to subjugate us. - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: It will fail. - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: For our people demand to be free, and they will have to kill us all before they can call us Sunagakure. - Tue Dec  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Missions can wait. - Tue Dec  8 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reached behind his back and extracts a single arrow. "This one arrow Lord-Raikage," he says in a delicate tone, "has enough poison to stop an elephant in his tracks.. in mere seconds. The explosive tag alone is magnified tenfold that can take out a house.."

Sogeki looks up at his leader, "make them come. Win.. Lose.. Draw.. I'm no one's bitch. Sunagakure has a problem with us branching off? Then we'll just have to cut down the tree."* - Tue Dec  8 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Me? I'm just a wandering monk. I used to live here a while ago. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You? - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yeah, was there for awhile. - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Got taught a technique, and left. - Tue Dec  8 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: What is the point of serving a village...Everyone around me is dead... - Tue Dec  8 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You've returned, Kuro. - Tue Dec  8 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: What kind of name is Kuro. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: This man is a fuckboy. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes, I have. I haven't visited in a while, so I figured I'd see how things are going. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: After all, this is still my home. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I suppose it is. - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I take it you've gotten word? - Tue Dec  8 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Word of? - Tue Dec  8 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) wanted to know what was going on, but didn't feel like scrolling up and reading the RPies.. so he was hoping Takuma could summarize?* - Tue Dec  8 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) is guessing he don't have to catch a body then?* - Tue Dec  8 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded, allowing Kari to take his arm.* - Tue Dec  8 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) hand** - Tue Dec  8 02:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: For the time being. - Tue Dec  8 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sunagakure shinobi who are present - do not harm them, simply keep an eye on them with our forces, along with Konohagakures. We will ensure everything goes down smoothly. - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What's going on? - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Are you going to request their forces to leave? - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That is a thought. - Tue Dec  8 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What's going on for the village to be on high alert? - Tue Dec  8 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kumogakure's independence. - Tue Dec  8 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Kumogakure's independence? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I haven't been keeping up with village news, but can you explain to me what do you mean? Independence from what? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Lord Raikage. - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, and I will explain in a second? - Tue Dec  8 02:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think such a task is dangerous for you right now, though I will permit it under one ondition. - Tue Dec  8 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To say she was a leader is an insult to Kumogakure. We let her go where she wishes. - Tue Dec  8 03:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This is gonna be fast probably. - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) brings his right harm over his chest and hooks the back of his elbow with his left arm. He twists and tugs on his right shoulder, allowingthe entire arm to be stretched out. "Whenever you're ready."* - Tue Dec  8 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) just watched her, keeping his promise of giving her a head start.* - Tue Dec  8 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Should've picked a game I know she can win with ease as well. - Tue Dec  8 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) forgot about that aspect. Now he didn't feel bad about choosing this game to play. Instead, he'd dart off to the side in an attempt to evade the webs, but not exactly chasing after her yet.* - Tue Dec  8 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Made this all that much more interesting!~ - Tue Dec  8 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Ugh. - Tue Dec  8 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded. He felt like this was the right time to start chasing her. He strides forward, but not at top speed --- he still had a plan.* - Tue Dec  8 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Erg... - Tue Dec  8 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) dashed forward, just deciding to catch up to Kariudo and catch up to her. He'd swiftly wrap his arms around her waist and lift her up a bit, saying nothing.* - Tue Dec  8 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ugh... - Tue Dec  8 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Fucking bullshit. - Tue Dec  8 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: This game sucks. - Tue Dec  8 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hmph. - Tue Dec  8 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) would remain silent. After lowering her back down he'd let go and bring his right hand to her left cheek, gently gliding his thumb over her skin.* - Tue Dec  8 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) brings his other arm back to her waist and pulls her in a bit more. He places his forehead against hers and continues to run his thumb over her cheek. "Six months," he says in a hushed tone, a bit of whinning could be heard.* - Tue Dec  8 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded against her. "Yeah.. A lot."* - Tue Dec  8 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Did you do any training? - Tue Dec  8 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Half ass'd like I said, but yeah. - Tue Dec  8 05:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Savages don't write letters. - Tue Dec  8 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mhm.~ - Tue Dec  8 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: They just make up for lost time. - Tue Dec  8 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) leans in a bit more, threatening to place a kiss on her.. but teasingly doesn't.* - Tue Dec  8 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) allowed their lips to graze against each other, but backs away. He smirks a bit before pulling her in even more and leaning in to softly press his lips against hers.* - Tue Dec  8 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's hands contrasted Kari's first set. Instead of trailing up her body they'd lower, stopping just before he met the curves of her butt. His head leans to the side a bit throught he kiss and he presses more into her, taking charge a bit before she broke away. He looks at her and runs his tongue over his lips a few times, taking in her sweet taste. "You."* - Tue Dec  8 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirks a bit more, "thought I said I could never get enough.~"* - Tue Dec  8 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Sort of wasting your win.~ - Tue Dec  8 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's right hand cups her cheek and squeezes. "Doesn't feel like it.~"* - Tue Dec  8 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kisses her on the cheek, slowly sliding his other hand down.* - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You know what to say if you get -that- feeling.. - Tue Dec  8 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You're still in control right now.~ - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I am? - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. - Tue Dec  8 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Right now.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: When are you going to take my control away? - Tue Dec  8 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't know yet. Soon though.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) raises his hands up her body a bit just to lower it. This time however, he aimed to trail in her pants to cup her cheeks.* - Tue Dec  8 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Mmmmm.. - Tue Dec  8 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't know.. - Tue Dec  8 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Here is out of the question? - Tue Dec  8 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) presses his middle fingers more in between her cheeks. He leans in to softly kiss her neck, "it's still.. up to you.~"* - Tue Dec  8 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) squeezes a bit more and continues to kiss her neck. He pulls her more into him, wanting there to be no space between them. "Depends on what -that- is on your mind.~"* - Tue Dec  8 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .. - Tue Dec  8 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Y-you know what I mean, S-sogeki. - Tue Dec  8 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) heard her whine but continues to kiss her neck, inching more up to her jaw line.* - Tue Dec  8 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mhm.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: S-so are you gonna stop playing around or say what you want? - Tue Dec  8 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I did though.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I said 'you'. - Tue Dec  8 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Okay, Mr. Vague. - Tue Dec  8 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) smirked behind his last kiss, Kariudo's pull catching him off guard. His hands slipped from behind her and he'd swiftly aim to grip one of her wrists and subtly tug hard enough to spin her around. From there, in that same motion, he'd step up more against her and rest his chin on her shoulder. "I want to claim you," he'd whisper into her ear.* - Tue Dec  8 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) led both his up her stomach, setting his path to her breasts. "Talk to me," he continues in a whisper, "what do you say?" Eventually, he'd find the bottom of her two petite humps and just massage that area.* - Tue Dec  8 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) actually understood why she was so worried. He nodded and leans his head more into her neck, softly kissing her on one the sweet spots he found --- the back of her ear. Both his hands trail back down her body and climb under her shirt just to inch up her stomach and go to cup her bra'd breasts. He fondles her humps and occasionally focuses on the nipple area --- all while he made sure not to pull her bra away.* - Tue Dec  8 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kept one of his hands on her breast while sliding the other one down her body, aiming to slip in her pants and to her mound. There, he'd go for her clit, only using a single finger to graze over it. Every few grazes he'd apply a bit of pressure on to the nub and rub in a circular motion, easing up at the moment where he felt a loud moan would come as a result --- just the tease her. The hand that remained on her breast finally worked on the inside of her bra, cupping and grabbing her hump before focusing on her nipples. Anytime he pressed down on her clit, he'd find one of her nipples in her grasp and pinched just slightly. His lips, however, quickly took her earlobe into his mouth and gave full access for his tongue to make its presence felt.* - Tue Dec  8 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) pushed his more into her pants, cupping her mound completely. Two fingers found her entrance and those two fingers curled slightly. He threatened to enter her and stretch her after the six months she went untouched. He hears her whine and only chuckled, "cum first." Just as his tongue found the root of his mouth to form the 'st' part of the word, Sogeki inhaled to scoop her earlobe back in and fondle it. By this point both her breasts were firmly pushed over and out of her bra and her nipples were properly stimulated for the time being, so he'd inch his hand down to her waist and sway her hips back and forth while he continued to tease her pussy lips and entrance, wanting to send her to that point of return, but not too soon.* - Tue Dec  8 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: LOL - Tue Dec  8 07:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Should we go up there?---...crap.. I can't help... - Tue Dec  8 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll.. go. - Tue Dec  8 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. stay clear. - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, okay... - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Stay safe. - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) moves his hands and turned, "right." His demeanor completely changed and he paced off.* - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was pulled back and met with a kiss, one of which he returned with the same level of passion. Once they pulled away and he heard her words, he'd nod and smirk. "Always, babe. First three kills is for you.~" He grant her yet another peck for good measures then darted off at his top speed.* - Tue Dec  8 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: .... - Tue Dec  8 08:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: How many lives you wish for my to claim? - Tue Dec  8 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Take that number and double it, call it the Rage of Eiyu! - Tue Dec  8 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) extends his fist, smirking.* - Tue Dec  8 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: me* - Tue Dec  8 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk only grew wider, the confidence that he seemed to lose long ago returning. The King of Savages, Sogeki, was here for war --- a setting he considered home. The war being within Kumogakure was just him throwing a party within his fine housing scheme --- a marvelous standpoint from the eyes of someone like him.

"i'm considering that to be your request of 'all'. Very well then, Raikage. Go sip some tea and finish some paper work, I'll handle things here."* - Tue Dec  8 08:18:20 2015
