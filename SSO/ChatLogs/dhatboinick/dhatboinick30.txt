<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's attention was immediately captured. Marrisa's ocular standards altered, and in a fashion that only one other person could do to his knowledge.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pace into the main square was lackadaisical. His hands were tucked away within his pants pockets and his facial expression bared no emotion. Upon his arrival, before granted even the slightest of greetings, Ortho was met with news of conflict. He released a sigh and slowly shook his head, glancing at Marrisa.* - Sat Oct 31 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hello to you too, my love. - Sat Oct 31 13:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes wandered off, settling upon the frame of the Raccoon Sage. A nod of greetings was given, "Greetings. I wish I would say I heard much about you, but am not a liar." Ortho's tone was subtle and nonchalant, a mix that proved he was in his mellow state of mind.* - Sat Oct 31 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: We shall continue this talk later. - Sat Oct 31 14:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his hands tucked within his pants pockets. He provides a nod toward the Raccoon Sage, "I wouldn't mind." With that, he'd turn on his heels and pace toward the Tea Shop.* - Sat Oct 31 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took his seat across from Marrisa. He settles himself in, leans back into the chair a bit and once again entered his completely relaxed state. The Sage's summoning of tea caught Ortho's attention, the aroma alone was unique must be commended as such. The description of the drink only raised its authenticity. A nod of gratitude was given to the Sage, but no words were said. Anyone that knew Ortho could tell the Raccoon that he wasn't the talkative type, so in turn Ortho's presence was merely to attend to the Raccoon.

Ortho brings the cup to his lips, taking a subtle intake of the aroma once more. His eyes momentarily close, allowing most of his senses to shut off for this brief moment of smell. After a second or so, he'd reopen his eyes and take the first sip. His eyes widened past the normal nonchalant level. Ortho took quick fond of the tea, and because of that he hastened to take another sip once cooling down the tea a bit. "I must give it to your land. A commendable feat for whoever combined these herbs for the first time to make tea, it is rather delicious."
* - Sat Oct 31 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The Raccoon's speech was listened to intently. No hint of disrespect was implied nor shown, just Ortho's full attention. "A proud ma-.. male.. you should be. If it was my forefather that did such, I'd be proud to spew his name out of honor."* - Sat Oct 31 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow, noticing the sudden change in the Raccoon's demeanor. He didn't know whether or not it was safe to pursue the topic so he simply made an attempt to lighten the mood. "Corruption often overshadow honor, but honor always prevail." With those words, Ortho took another sip of his tea.* - Sat Oct 31 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took another sip of his tea, allowing silence to rain down for the moment. The Sage's suggestion was expected, and in turn Ortho answered honestly. "I am the ideal generalist when it comes to my shinobi-wise abilities. I dab into medical ninjutsu, elemental ninjutsu, fuuinjutsu, and a little bit of Taijutsu. Despite this, however, I thirst knowledge. Knowledge to make a difference in this world. I'm going to be blunt with you." Ortho placed his finished cup on the table and turned to look at the Sage. Ortho's pupils were empty, absent of emotion. "I wish to destroy this shinobi world and build it back up. Pain is more common that peace, and if peace was to reign, pain has to be destroyed. This village system was attempted without the consideration of failure. In turn, it is time for a new hypothesis to be tested.."* - Sat Oct 31 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "I know not of Ushinawa first hand, but I am the predecessor.. of his predecessor. The one known as Hideki, the late Hideki, is my idol and is- was.. my teacher. He shared the views as Ushinawa, so in turn I must as well."* - Sat Oct 31 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) would remain still and silent, allowing the invitation to register within his mind. Peace was the goal and it's for that reason why Ortho managed to come to a decision. "It seems as though there is a conflict here, haha. I too have been putting together a organization. Peace being what we thrive for. This is a conflict because to the outside world, the people that submit to this village system, we are common thugs that would do anything to uphold a far sight of peace. Still, however, I am not of this outside world. I accept your invitation, and so does the rest of my organization."* - Sat Oct 31 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head once more, confirming the Sage's skepticism. "Yes, will be combining. It I the only plausible thing, it'll also prevent confliction of interest."* - Sat Oct 31 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "We keep the name the Sage presented to me. Seeing as though my organization and I are joining yours, I suppose you can take the leader role above us. The display of plans and the agreement or disagreement is likely to be the best way to go about this."

Ortho's gaze shifted, all this time he was looking down at the table. His eyes settle on Kilm. "I ask you one question though.."* - Sat Oct 31 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes? - Sat Oct 31 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Anger surged before Kilm, emitting from Ortho's body demeanor and the look in his eyes. "Marrisa is the love of my life. I displayed my affection for her to you and Angetsu before. In turn, I see to it that her life is completely safe as long as I have breath in my body. With that in mind, I ask you to be one hundred percent honest with me. Katsune; does she have a standing point in your organization?" * - Sat Oct 31 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a slow, deep, breath. He allows his mind to settle, taking his cup of tea and gulping it. The tea was warm by now and easy to push down his gullet. Ortho was a renowned drinker, smoker and eater when in anger so he took four crumpets, stacked them on top of one another and chomped down. "Very well, Kilm. Consider yourself to have a loyal soldier by the name of Ortho."* - Sat Oct 31 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Glad to have you, Ortho. - Sat Oct 31 15:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick)  took in a slow, deep, breath, allowing his chakra to knead within his body. He brings his right thumb to his mouth, biting down and causing a trickle of blood to expel forth. Upon doing so, he'd smear the blood in his opposing palm, performing a series of handseals afterward. Once the handseals were complete, Ortho would crouch down and slam his palm into the sand.

A massive shroud of smoke surround the training field, blocking out everyone's view from each other. Once the smoke was cleared, a single figure could be seen. After proper analysis, Ortho could be seen on top of the infamous Manda's head.

"..What the hell is this..? Why have you called me forth, Ortho? I was in the middle of helping my wife shed." The massive snake spoke, his tone obviously showing he was annoyed. "Be easy, Manda.. I thought I should let you get in on this fun." Ortho pointed down at Kilm and his Raccoon Sage. "Ahh, I see. Very well then." Manda's tongue slithers out his mouth, a sly smirk forming on his face.

"Make your move, Kilm," shouted Ortho. * - Sat Oct 31 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: Must be nice... - Sat Oct 31 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Manda remained stationary, only watching the Raccoon and Kilm approach. Many battles have been fought together between Kilm and Ortho, and in turn they knew what each other was naturally thinking. "Ortho," stated Manda. "On it."

With that, Ortho weaved together a series of handseals. His lungs rapidly fill with chakra and oxygen, merging to create more enhanced form of wind. Upon doing so, Ortho would pucker his lips and unleashed a massive gust of wind. Not only was this wind used to negate the senbon's, but to possibly create a sandstorm-like effect. 
* - Sat Oct 31 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

Ortho: "Manda."

Manda: "Shut up."

Ortho jumps off Manda's head, allowing the snake to do his thing. Ortho forms another series of handseals, allowing his chakra to seep throughout the immediate area. He knew that Kilm was a formidable opponent, and from how Manda got serious at the Raccoon's approach Ortho knew that the Sage was no push over.

By time Ortho's handseals were completed, he'd slam his palms into the sand once again. From deep below the earth came a multitude of spikes, each aimed to subdue Kilm and the Raccoon. Still, however, damage was intended but not severe damage.

To follow things up, whether or not his initial attacked work, Ortho straightened himself and weaved more handseals. This time around, with Manda starting the process of slithering in between the spikes and use the new terrain to his advantage, Ortho fills his lungs with chakra and air once more. This time around, instead of unleashing a massive gust, he'd instead send off seven blast of wind. Four aimed at kilm, three at the Raccoon.

One air bullet for Kilm's chest, one for the right of kilm, one for the left and one for above his head. This was an attempt to give Kilm no choice but to burrow underground to evade.* - Sat Oct 31 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) ||

Manda and the Raccoon were going at it. Manda having to slither between the spikes created previously as the Raccoon following close pursuit. The Raccoon indeed got some good hits on Manda, but it only provoked the massive snake. Manda wasn't used to taking damage, so rather than resorting to the sneak and hit tactics, he'd turn to a head up battle. The next time the Raccoon came in to hit Manda, the snake would use his massive length to swat the creature away.

Ortho, on the other hand, had Kilm to worry about. Now that the male was airborne, Ortho took full advantage. While taking a page out of a recent ally's book, Ortho would string a set of handseals together. Once again his lungs filled with air and chakra, and once again he unleashed a massive gust of wind. Rather than centering the wind, he'd sway his head from left to right.

The wind was aimed toward Kilm and intended to cover a massive amount of space below Kilm. Ortho's combination continued with the proper preparations of handseals and the spewing out of a massive fireball. Now, the whole point of the gust of wind was not to center on just Kilm, but to enhance the fire's frame, giving Kilm no freedom to land descend without damage --- or so Ortho attempted.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks to Paine, giving her a nod to signal "it's okay" to what she whispered.* - Sun Nov  1 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took a steps steps forward, placing his hands within the confinements of his pockets. His focus on the battle at hand was just being made. He saw Nina going toe to toe with Trilliam, a person he knew could be a commendable opponent. Ortho raised a single eyebrow, skepticism of the battles turn out rampaging through his mind. "Has Nina always been this defiant to give up in battle," Ortho asked himself as he extracts a blunt from his left pocket. Upon bringing it to his lips and lighting it with the lighter he extracted from his right pocket, he'd take a hit and place his hands back. "I've missed out on so much in her life. I can't go back in time to fill in the places I should've been, but I can surely make sure I'm there for her now and in the future."

Ortho's mind continues to wander as he spoke out loud, in a low volume, to himself. "If anything happens to Nina, I don't know what I'd do. Tch.. and to think that she acts like she the older one." Ortho chuckles to himself slightly, his eyes mainly focused on Nina's movements. "She sure takes after mother.. Maybe that's why she and I always go at it." Ortho sighs to himself, slowly shaking his head and smirking. "Nina doesn't know how much I love her. She's my baby sister that acts grown, but she means well.. I promise you, Nina.. No matter what, I got you." He takes another hit off his blunt, allowing the excess smoke to slowly seep from his nostrils. He remains quiet from this point on, but allowed his mind to continue to wander.* - Sun Nov  1 02:18:40 2015
