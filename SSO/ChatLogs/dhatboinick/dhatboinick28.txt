<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had to move with haste and grace. As Ortho stated before, there was no room to slack off and play games. "This is a water style ninjutsu. Basically, all you do is knead chakra within your stomach and allow it to thicken. This requires a two part thicken process. The first part is to turn the chakra into water; the second is to apply more chakra to make a syrup-like addition. Upon doing so, you simply spew the result out. You are able to get caught in this jutsu, so I suggest you be careful." During his quick lecture, Ortho managed to slowly weave the necessary handseals together numerous amount of times for Masa to see.* - Thu Oct 29 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paces himself back in front of Marrisa, granting her with another warm smile --- or what he could muster up with the blunt at the left corner of his lips. "Alright, are you ready?"* - Thu Oct 29 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Of course - Thu Oct 29 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lead the way. - Thu Oct 29 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Where too? - Thu Oct 29 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) points to the right (OOC left).* - Thu Oct 29 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, what do you want to do first/ - Thu Oct 29 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Taijutsu was never Ortho's strong point. He knew this for a fact and that's why he made it a priority to keep all battles at a distance so he can unleash hell with his Ninjutsu. This time around, since it was indeed a training session, Ortho readied himself. He slid his footing to shoulder length and slightly bent at the knees, allowing a bit of leverage to be granted in his favor. Upon doing so, while tucking both elbows into the sides, holding his left arm at a ninety degree angle and his right arm at a forty-five degree angle, Ortho waited.

"Let us begin, baby girl."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Marrisa was a fair distance away, but her speed was so great that Ortho could barely keep up. Still, however, an attempt was made to counter. Marrisa's strike was intended for Ortho's midsection, so I retaliation Ortho aimed for Marrisa's noggin. His left foot quickly lifted off the ground as his right heel began twisting. As a result, a powerful round house kick was short forth. The initial kick, for Ortho, was both an attempt to land a hit but still be used as a feint. Whether or not it was to make contact, Ortho would keep hold of the momentum he gather and bend on his right knee.

Upon doing so, the young lad would place both his palms into the grass and turn while lowering his left leg. The intentions were to quickly legs weep Marrisa.* - Thu Oct 29 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's foot was indeed redirected, and as such he was now spinning in the opposing direction. One could say that he was opened for an attack, but his calm state of mind allowed him to quickly rationalize a counter to Marrisa's counter. With the new rotation provided to him by Marrisa's redirection, Ortho would follow through with his leg sweep. Rather than him coming clockwise, he was now coming counter clockwise. In turn, manage Marrisa aid Ortho in his attack.* - Thu Oct 29 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained cool and collected, not trying to make such a hand gesture get to him. He simply chuckles and nodded his head. "And apart from what we've done so far.. have you..-" Ortho would imitate the hand movements Chi did.* - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks a bit. He reenacts the movements once more, making sure to pull his finger in and out of the hole.* - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But I didn't want to bring it up and make you feel like you 'had' to. - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: No pain... no gain. - Thu Oct 29 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) begins looking around the room. He was tempted to suggest they do something right now, but was actually too shy. Yes, Ortho of all people was too shy.* - Thu Oct 29 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. - Thu Oct 29 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... O-Oh.. did I say too much? - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no. You didn't. - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. temptations.. - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... To do what? - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Stuff. Here.. - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right now.. - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... What's stoppin' you? - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You not being over here. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) moves himself half way closer to Chi.* - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Coming over here? I thought this was a business talk? - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I thought we ended the business talk at the other house. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... I see. - Thu Oct 29 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leans back, allowing his back to rest against the wall. Chi's actions quickly aroused Ortho, causing stiffness in his member. A noticeable tent in the front of his pants is made, and with pride he reaches forward and pulls his zipper down. With less restraint came a half-aroused meat that only had the thin fabric of Ortho's boxers as confinement. "Well. This meeting is about sheer pleasure."* - Thu Oct 29 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || For the first time in a long time Ortho was able to allow lust to take over his mind. Chi's movements led Ortho to hastily trail after her. As he did so, Ortho would reach in front of his member and completely release it. By this point, he was fully erect and nine inches stood tall and on command. Once Ortho reached Chi, he complied with her wishes to be rough. He takes a handful of her hair and pulled back, enough to cause slightly pain but not enough to make him feel regretful. He'd direct Chi's face to the very tip of his member, allowing there to be no room between her lips and his cock.* - Thu Oct 29 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's grip on Chi's hair only tightened. The bobbing of Chi's head and the moisture of her mouth around his cock forced Ortho to release a groan of sheer pleasure. Ortho's opposing hand reached behind Chi's back, taking grasp of her clothing and tearing it off of her frame. Upon doing, he'd focus on her bra; that too was torn from her body. As a response to the oral favors Chi was given him, Ortho would sway his hips back and forth.* - Thu Oct 29 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his eyes fixated on Chi, watching his cock slide in and out of her mouth. A smirk of lust formed on his face as he hips continued to pulse back and forth. Just as Chi's gag reflex began to kick in, Ortho would pull his cock completely out of her mouth and forcefully turn her around --- placing himself behind her as she fell to her hands and knees. He takes his member by the base and steadily lines himself with the entrance of her pussy, pushing only the head in. Once she was nice and lubricated from her own juices, Ortho would send one thrust in.* - Thu Oct 29 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Chi's words didn't fall on deaf ears. Instinctively he knew not to bust inside her, and in turn she found it okay to deny her ability to speak. His right hand trail over her lower back until it eventually found her ass cheeks. He gives it a swat, making sure to add enough strength to cause the pain Chi loved so much. His left hand glides up Chi's back, taking grasp of her hair once more and pulling back. After a few more swats, Ortho grabs Chi by the hip and began moving her frame back and forth on his cock. "Sh-Show me what you can do.~"* - Thu Oct 29 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was laying down relentless thrusts into Chi at this point. Both his hands gripped her and squeezed her ass cheeks as her hips synced with his. Swat after swat came for her rear, it was obvious that he was fully embracing her love for pain. To add leverage to his thrusts, Ortho would lean for, placing his hands to the side of her body and pump his hips downward.* - Thu Oct 29 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's thrusts weren't faltering. He kept up the pace, the depth and the pressure. The second he felt the series of twitching with Chi's pussy, he'd pump three more thrusts into her before altering their position. Whilst keeping his cock inside her, he takes her by the hips and forces her to learn of the desk. Now, she was on top with her back facing Ortho as he leaned against the wall. For leverage purposes, he grabs her by the back of the neck and pushes her face down into the table while holding her hip with his opposing hand.* - Thu Oct 29 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Relax. - Thu Oct 29 14:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had arrived in Sunagakure after a long travel from Kirigakure and decided to get a quick stroll. This stroll, however, came to a stop when he took notice of a person off in the distance. As he approached the person, he'd tuck his hands within his pants pockets and allowed his blunt to transition to the right corner of his lips. From the looks of the person, Ortho could tell that he's seen them before, but never held a proper conversation. After pacing himself a few more feet to get a better look, he'd speak. "Greetings."* - Thu Oct 29 15:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes fixed themselves on Index, slowly shaking his head in the process. He didn't know the full story, nor did he need to know.

I hope you're able to see before it's too late." On that note, Ortho would turn on his heels and head toward Sunagakure's exit.* - Thu Oct 29 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The caravan ride to Konohagakure from Sunagakure with Marrisa was quiet. Tension was afoot and Ortho knew it. What transpired in Sunagakure between Marrisa and Katsune weighed down on even him, filling him with anger. The sheer fact that the level of one sided thinking displayed from Index, a brother-like figure to Ortho, only made Marrisa's lover want to do something he knew he'd end up regretting. Still, though, it all made sense. In a metaphorical standing, it was wife against wife, and the husbands had a choice to make. But was that enough reason for Index not even subduing his spouse? Was that enough reason for Marrisa to be targeted and insulted by Index and Katsune?

Ortho slams his fists into the mansion's wall. He was nowhere near the strongest of shinobi, but in the fit of rage even his punch caused a few cracks. Pain rushed up his arm, the base being his knuckles. The fit of rage Ortho was in numbed it down a bit, but still he had to resort to using his opposing hand to grip the injury. A deep grunt came from him. He turns to look at Marrisa, analyzing the love of his life and only wishing he had showed up sooner to defend her, rather than having her there alone before Katsune. "M-Marrisa.."* - Thu Oct 29 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Rage continued to fuel Ortho, but the gentle touch from Marrisa only proved to temporarily defuse his bomb. His wound began its healing process, Marrisa's chakra speeding up the rate. With his opposing hand, he'd gently place his palm upon Marrisa's cheek and leaned in to kiss her forehead. "You never have to silence yourself. You are second to no one, nor are you anyone's bitch. Speak with pride, speak truth. In this world, my love, that is all you have."* - Fri Oct 30 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) momentarily glared at Marrisa, allowing her to speak her mind. Ortho was in no position to belittle Marrisa for her thoughts, and in turn he planted another kiss on her; on her nose this time around. "I wish for you to keep this to yourself for the time being. Allow things to die down and play out, then I will be sure to make a move. Tell no one else."* - Fri Oct 30 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's sensitive side was short lived. Anger swelled within him once more. His eyebrows arched in and his face reformed into a slight scowl, the perfect imagery for his mood. Still, however, he kept a gentle palm on Marrisa face. "I need you to promise me that you won't say anything. This isn't a matter of you being tempted to, or anger guiding your actions. You need 'not' to say anything until the time is right, Marrisa."* - Fri Oct 30 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his gaze on Marrisa for a brief moment, allowing his arm to lower from her face. He had nothing more to say, nor did he wish that he did; for the time being it was best that they took their mind off of the recent events in Sunagakure. Ortho knew what he had planned, and in turn he hoped Marrisa heed his warning. A sigh escaped from between his lips as he broke the glare he had on Marrisa, placing his focus on the skies above. "In due time, Marrisa, all shall be understood and taken care of."* - Fri Oct 30 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Emotions was never something Ortho managed to hone in on. As a result, while Marrisa sat before him in a clear wreck of emotions, the only thing he could do was place a hand upon her shoulder; an attempt to comfort her. Ortho was a human, and every human experience pain and sorrow, so as Marrisa went through this phase of grief Ortho's own stomach turned and his heart ached. He bites down on his teeth, kneeling down to Marrisa's level and taking her into his arms. He supplied her with a hug of security, hoping that maybe his intentions would ease down her pain.* - Fri Oct 30 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's embrace of Marrisa only tightened, allowing his chest to be the bucket for her dripping tears.
