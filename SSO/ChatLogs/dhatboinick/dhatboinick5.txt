Nevertheless, with Baen ready to depart, Erebus advanced forth; stopped almost immediately by Koeki.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The sound of metal scraping against stone filled the area. A sensation of sheer evil and something sinister filled the air, thickening the atmosphere; the arrival of Erebus was both felt and heard. His movements were near lackadaisical, but purpose-ridden nevertheless. The cloak Erebus wore provided a hoodie, and that hoodie did its purpose of concealing most of Erebus' face; only thing that could be seen by anyone looking at him was merely his upper lip down to his chin. An exasperating exhale of breath came from Erebus, a sound that many could tie into just how sinisterly different the Jashinist truly was.

"I've come to hear the sins of Amai; it is time she repents." Erebus' voice was soft, almost whisper-ish, but still audible enough for everyone to hear. His tone of voice replicated the aura that came from him, sheer evil and death.* - Mon Sep 21 00:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The fact that Amai thought Erebus would stand by idly for her to prepare her jutsu is what made this scenario laughable. A quick withdraw of Erebus' scythe sounded as he pivoted forward, intentions to stop Amai from drawing whatever it was she had in mind. With the scythe now gripped, Erebus allowed three devastating attacks to rain down on Amai; starting with the top of her head, then her throat, finishing with across her chest from her upper right shoulder to lower left hip.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had no beef with Mamoru, but if the kid wanted to get involved then so be it. Erebus' initial slash was barely negated, providing Amai with ample time to haul ass if she choose to. For the most part, however, Erebus refocuses and sets his gaze on Mamoru. Following the negation of their blades, Erebus would take another step forward, allowing his entire strength and momentum to reside behind his next combination of attacks.

Starting off with a horizontal sweep of his scythe, Erebus aimed to gut out Mamoru completely. Following that slash, whether or not it was evaded, Erebus followed suit by proceeding forth with a vertical slash; starting at the pelvis and inching up to Mamoru's lower chin. These strikes, however, were purposely not lethal, but to simply draw blood.* - Mon Sep 21 00:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: And I think it's better off that she be alive and with us now, than be dead and have us mourning her today. - Mon Sep 21 02:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For right now, many things could be labeled as the outcome. The destruction of the villages as a whole is not what I seek, but the system from within. - Mon Sep 21 02:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am willing to go down the political route, but if force is what is needed in certain case I have no problem taking that route. - Mon Sep 21 02:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The sound of metal scraping against stone could be heard drawing closer into the courtyard. Erebus, the black cloaked being, edged forth toward the group; his head was lowered ever so slightly. The smell of blood and death almost immediately filled the atmosphere, providing Erebus with no safe haven if he were to attempt a surprise attack. He edged forth, stopping merely a few feet away from the general location of the group.

"You and I must speak now, Koeki. Battle is pointless now, for you have seen a glimpse of light already." Erebus' voice could be compared to that of a whisper, soft and subtle but still emitted that same sinister chill he was famous for.* - Mon Sep 21 03:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' head lifts, allowing Koeki the ability to view the little skin his hoodie didn't cover; his upper lip to his chin. The posture Erebus presented wasn't readable; the cloak he wore was too thick for that. Nevertheless, despite the unnatural behavior Erebus was known for, no ill-intent was shown.

"What have you learned thus far, Koeki..?"* - Mon Sep 21 03:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: That i'm not fit for the title of Mizukage. Things are not always as they seem. *pause* I've learned that we've brought upon alot of hate on our village. - Mon Sep 21 03:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: This village system is tainted. It grants close to no freedom for the newly spawned within the shinobi world. - Mon Sep 21 03:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A Genin is restrained to a cage while a Jounin is able to roam his beliefs. - Mon Sep 21 03:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It is a Jounin that is most likely to break free and rogue, causing a ripple effect of destruction and heatache. - Mon Sep 21 03:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Whereas, if you all a Genin to be uncaged and allowed his mind and life experience to grow from the get-go, future heatache will not exist. - Mon Sep 21 03:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That, in turn, will allow each of you mortals to find yourself on the proper path for yor goal. - Mon Sep 21 03:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: Remove those ranks? - Mon Sep 21 03:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: That is not an easy process. - Mon Sep 21 03:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Especially if the Gezo still hold power here. - Mon Sep 21 03:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: But my plan doesn't interfere with them for only the rank of Kage exists. - Mon Sep 21 03:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Eliminate the certain control a Kage have over the rest of Shinobi.. - Mon Sep 21 03:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That only leaves a figure head the place in orders for knowledge based scrolls; key word: knowledge. - Mon Sep 21 03:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: We raise the blackmarket into something more organized, allow the regular civilains to not fear hiding from the Gezo, but rather have them form their own franchises. - Mon Sep 21 03:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A political standing where you mortals have more of a say in your lives rather than be killed off in the name of refusal to understand the different. - Mon Sep 21 03:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: But wouldn't that bring about anarchy. - Mon Sep 21 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It would require unorthodox decisions to be made, yes. - Mon Sep 21 03:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: But rather than it being a necessary evil, it's a necessary deed. - Mon Sep 21 03:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am not forcing this upon no one, rather hear their starting thought process so I don't waste my time with pursuing them. - Mon Sep 21 03:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Tell me, how many times have a 'middle-ground' worked in this current system? - Mon Sep 21 03:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There is another way you can view this picture, Koeki. - Mon Sep 21 03:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When it comes to the understanding of the different, this new way of the world will allow a person to be able to find his, or her, way to a mass of people that share their views. - Mon Sep 21 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A place where snap-judgment isn't relevant in the least. - Mon Sep 21 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It is misunderstanding of the different that cause war, for misunderstanding leads to the lack of tolerance. - Mon Sep 21 03:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow your mind to ponder on that. I'll be back for an answer shortly. - Mon Sep 21 04:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The smell of blood and death quickly filled the atmosphere, thickening the very foundation of the air; a breath took two times the effort.  The eerie sound of metal scraping against stone occupied the hearing zone of even those not intending to listen. Erebus' presence was devised around the smell and hearing senses, a feat that only a few could pull off by just doing undignified actions in the name of supporting his own cause. His black cloak sheltered foreign eye sights from surveying his build too much, the hoodie topped things off by forcing the lack of full view to his face. Erebus' head was slightly lowered, but he was still noticeably fully aware of his surroundings.

His pace came to a halt, mere feet away from Katsune. A sinister release of breath is sounded, but not words followed by.* - Mon Sep 21 08:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's understanding of these village systems was rather extensive; at the right identification even the most suspicious could roam free. This village, be it controlled by Amegakure or not, was still a public place and harbored a lot of merchants; that's where the money for its most recent constructive development came from. Long story short; this place is home to the black market. Nevertheless, Erebus had to admit that his approach to the mortals of this shinobi world was unorthodox; something he took pride in. Still, however, they couldn't wrong him for entering a place where merchandise is sold the most.

Nevertheless, Erebus was granted access to this place as long as trouble didn't trail after him. He stood before Katsune, words not yet spoken. He edged forth, allowing the infamous scraping of metal against stone to momentarily fill the hearing zone once again. Still, despite his advances, there was no ill-intentions in his actions; just extreme suspicion. Erebus' jaw creeks open, the sound of bones cracking sounding off as it did so.

"State your sins," he spoke. His voice was relatable to a whisper, but still audible enough to be heard and clear enough to be understood. His tone, however, would send chills up and down the spine of a normal mortal with fears, for his voice was that of death.* - Mon Sep 21 08:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And now, walk backwards. - Mon Sep 21 08:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's motion was cut short, both verbally and physically. Her words rung through his ears, circulated around his mind a few times and settled in his stomach; anger swelled. He remained quiet from this point forward, only releasing another audible breath of sinister aura; there was nothing more for him to do now.* - Mon Sep 21 09:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: The disrespect of these mortals have not gone unnoticed, my lord. - Mon Sep 21 09:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: An ultimate understanding of the different will be established --- in due time. - Mon Sep 21 09:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Forgive her, my lord, she is of the not-knowing. - Mon Sep 21 09:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's body twitched, noticeable even through the thick cloth of his cloak. The fidget was followed by a quick snap of his head, his neck straightening and his head raising so he can get a good survey of Katsune's frame. That single motion caused more cracking of bones to surge through the campus, but still no ill-intent in his movements for the most part.

"State.. your sins," he attempted to say once more. This time around, though, slight anger was apparent in the whisper-like speech; lets not forget the sinister aspect.* - Mon Sep 21 09:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) Erebus remained stationary.* - Mon Sep 21 09:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I speak not again; state your sins. - Mon Sep 21 09:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If there's a god I'll confess my sins to him. Not 'you.' - Mon Sep 21 09:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's pupils seemingly vanished, his anger manifesting and fueling his chakra even more. Still, however, restraint was shows as he glared at Seisuke. "I've grown restless, Seisuke. It is time my plans begin.."* - Mon Sep 21 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest, the top of his scythe scraping against the ground due to the shit in his posture. He looks on, glaring at Seisuke momentarily before giving a demonic growl.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pivots forth, sidestepping the sleep-standing male before him. He grants no one a look of farewell, just his paced steps. The eerie sound of his metal scythe running across the ground would fade as he departed, so did the smell of death and blood.* - Mon Sep 21 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: Hm?.. - Mon Sep 21 14:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The stinging smell of death and blood surfaces throughout the immediate area, having no mercy on the sense of smell of for even the untrained. Along with the scent of death was the smell of blood, thickening the atmosphere and forcing those around to apply more effort in inhaling. The eerie sound of metal scraping against the ground became more and more apparent as the cloaked being closed in on the group of shinobi. By looking at him you could tell his head was lowered slightly, despite the hoodie that hung over his cranium.

Erebus' pace came to a halt, mere feet behind Beth. No words were said from the Jashinist, just the audibly release of breath; the sound of the devil himself.* - Mon Sep 21 15:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) raised his head slightly, the sound of cracking joints emitting from his neck. His eyes fixated on Shin, examining his frame for a moment; wasn't much to look that. Still, however, Erebus knew better than to judge a book by its cover; even if the book had no words of worth in it. His focus transitioned over to Taiga, repeating the same examination for him as he did Shin; the outcome was the same, but the noticeable fear in his actions only amused Erebus. Once again, the focus Erebus had was altered and set upon Ushinawa, a person that Erebus easily considered an ally; have things truly changed in the Uchiha's mind?

Another release of his breath sounded, annoyance clear from within it. However, instead of verbally expressing that annoyance, Erebus remained calm and allowed his attention to be captured by Beth; an ugly woman to say the least. He greeting fell upon deaf ears for the most part, but was acknowledge in the slightest way possible --- a grunt. Erebus allowed his eyes to fixate upon Ushinawa once again, deciding a response was owed after a good analysis of the people around.

"Change is a problem not for me, but notification of such is." The voice of Erebus was cold and sinister, giving off the feeling that it was the devil himself preaching his demonic words.* - Mon Sep 21 15:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's advance into the courtyard halted; the eerie sound of metal grinding against the ground seizing. A thick aroma filled the area; death and blood could be identified within it. Erebus' head was momentarily lowered, preventing the view of his face from behind his hoodie. No words were spoken from the black-cloaked being, just the release of a sinister breath.* - Mon Sep 21 16:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) surveyed the vicinity, eyeing each person momentarily. As he neck stretched so his head could shift from side to side, the sound of joints snapping could be heard.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looks toward the sand bending shinobi, eyeing her up and down.* - Mon Sep 21 16:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in on Pandora's headband as she spoke. He leans forward a bit, allowing his elbows to rest upon the desk before him. "My name is of no importance for the time being. Just know I am the newfound leader of Konohagakure until further notice." His voice was soft and subtle, easily compared to a whisper, but still audible for Pandora to hear. "So you're from the Village Hidden in the Sand..?"* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: No. I refer to myself "of the Sand" as it pays homage to my primary specialty. I can manipulate the sand that I'm standing on right now, as well as the sand in my gourd. - Mon Sep 21 16:41:36 2015
