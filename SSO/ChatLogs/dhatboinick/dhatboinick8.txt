<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had been standing in the same spot for a few hours now, contemplating what the next steps in his plans were and how he should execute them for high success rate. The first thing he knew he had to do was enhance his ally-ship horizon; more the better for the time being. Within the sanctum of his mind, Erebus began processing the abilities of everyone he's seen thus far; taking a mental note of potential components to the people in which he wants to in list into his organization.

It didn't take long for him to find the first person he wanted to recruit; they were a Konohagakure native. A sly smirk formed on Erebus' face as he slowly opened his eyes and raised his head slightly. As if Lord Jashin himself was looking after Erebus, the person the cloaked man had in mind was located nearby. With a push off of the mansion's wall, Erebus would pivot toward Pandora.

"May I have a word?" His voice wasn't as sinister as it usually was, but there was a hint of it hidden in each syllable.* - Thu Sep 24 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' focus was on Pandora for the most part, but that didn't mean Flexus went unnoticed. For the most part, however, the amount of food Flexus chose to consume was appalling; a feat that Erebus didn't want to learn how to do. Nevertheless, Flexus wasn't much of a threat for Erebus to acknowledge at the time being.

With his gaze still fixated on the large busted female, Erebus continued to speak. His voice continued to show a lack of sinister apparel, but still there were signs of lingering aspects.

"I've taken notice in your ability to manipulate your sand; it's an achievement that not many people hold on within their trophy case. Maybe you and I could talk about some international business affairs?"* - Thu Sep 24 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied a nod, a look of relief appearing on his visage. He imagined that a bit of convincing to just hold a private conversation with Pandora was going to be a hassle and a lot of work, but luckily Pandora wasn't the type to let his reputation alter her mindset. For the most part, however, Erebus was level-toned, forcing the demonic stature of his voice back by a large margin.

"I wish to speak in private; not every business discussion should be hosted in public."* - Thu Sep 24 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) granted Pandora with another nod, appreciating her lack of unwarranted judgments of him. His gaze broke off of her visage and began the intimate search of a place to lead her to. For the most part, Konohagakure's foundations were well known throughout the shinobi and villagers, there was no true place where they could talk in private. Still, however, an attempt had to be made. He turns on his heels, allowing himself to face southern before pivoting off in that direction. For the most part, Erebus was winging the trail, but he assured himself that some form of privacy was going to be met and upheld.* - Thu Sep 24 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' lead ended in the two finding a secluded park with a small pond. Two statues decorated the area, paying homage to honorable shinobi's that died for Konohagakure's righteous cause; how true that was could easily be argued, but this wasn't the time to hold a debate. Erebus stepped off toward the pond, allowing himself to stay above the surface. He turns to look at the hovering female, examining her body and face.

His observant nature wasn't that of sexual gratitude for himself, but to examine the book of Pandora before reading her contents --- metaphorically speaking. Once his eyes and mind wrapped around the entirety of Pandora's body a few times, from her head to toe and back up, Erebus released a breath of serenity; it was clear that even he knew that what they were about to talk about would be a mouthful along with being a brain teaser.

"First things first," he started off, a sigh pouring out by time the second syllable rolled off his tongue. "I wish to understand your beliefs of this Shinobi World." It was clear that Erebus' sentence was a statement rather than a question, a few people managed to confuse the difference between the two already.* - Thu Sep 24 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The mention of religion forced a reaction out of Erebus. It was miniscule, but apparent if Pandora was truly surveying Erebus' actions. In response to the word, the cloaked Jashinist's body convulsed; it was almost instinctive. Erebus wasn't angered, but he did find himself in a marginally tough spot; his urge to preach the word of Jashin growing. 

With a restraint on his compulsions, Erebus listened intently on Pandora's words; he didn't want her thinking that this meeting was just some fruitless efforts on her part. Upon Pandora's finishing words, Erebus supplied her with another nod, finding that her beliefs, nonreligious, were similar to his.

"Your mindset is admirable," he begun with a praiseful tone, "You share similar views as me, but, if I may, you are looking at things at a smaller picture. Yes, tranquility is a righteous goal, but doesn't complete harmony of the world sound better to you?"* - Thu Sep 24 21:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The distinctive smell of Death and Blood filled the courtyard leading to the Academy, the air thickening as a result. Taking in a breath was more of a chore at this point, the aroma relentlessly attacking the nostrils with those that harbored a sense of smell. The eerie sound of ruffling chains could be heard, a replacement to the infamous sound of metal dragging against ground.

Two scythes hung from Erebus' neck, both supported by a metallic chain. His black cloak supplied a hoodie that prevented the full view of his face, only allowing observes the ability to view his upper lip to his lower chin. Erebus' stride came to a momentary halt, his head rising slightly so he could have a proper look at what he was dealing with. The straightening of his neck sounded off several cracks, spine chilling sound effects for those who haven't gotten used to Erebus.

A release of breath came from Erebus, audible to everyone with a sense of hearing. No words came from him, nothing to be said just yet. For the most part, with his eyes wandering from person to person, Erebus remained quiet unless directly acknowledge with verbal greetings.* - Fri Sep 25 06:40:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's head jerked to the left, his body remained still. With his eyes locked on to Koeki, piercing a hole through her soul, the Jashinist released another audible breath. Words weren't granted to the bunch, however, but the increase of the infamous Death and Blood aroma was provided.

The words of Koeki fell upon deaf ears, he cared not for the weak stomachs of Kirigakure; they were a bunch of saps anyhow. The only mortal amongst them that Erebus commended was Hassan, and that was due to the lack of judgmental standing the old man harbored; a feat that made Erebus plan to work on immortalizing the Sergeant without religious means.

Erebus' stare on Koeki rained true, not faltering for a second. Still, however, his remaining senses were fixated on those around him; knowing these weaklings, they'd attack if someone sneezed the wrong way.* - Fri Sep 25 06:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) provided a nod. Not to Koeki or her request, but to himself on realizing what he must do to ensure that his plans were not altered due to these mortals. Erebus' eyes broke away from Koeki, slowly sliding to the left until falling upon Suitengu. Along with the transitioning of his eyes, Erebus' head followed pursuit as well; cracks sounding off with each half-inch his neck moved. A glare of emotionless standards fell upon the boy, only a single opening of Erebus' jaw provided since he's been here.

"I come to talk with the boy." Erebus' voice was sinister at its full extent, but no sudden movements of his body followed the words.* - Fri Sep 25 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: .....Uh, no? - Fri Sep 25 06:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's visual focus altered again, setting itself on Violet and narrowing. He cared not for the rebuttals of Koeki and Fujitora, he was used to their insolence thus far. Violet, however, stuck her nose into business it had no place in; now it was time for him to rip her nostrils out and feed it to her with a cup of her own blood to wash it down with.

The mind of Erebus waved back and forth, decisions had to be made on exactly how he was going to execute his ideals. Within seconds, which seemed like hours in his sinister mind, Erebus' pupils dilated; his stare on Violet relentlessly molesting her soul.

"Intrusion is the sin of trickery, for it is snakes that manage to slither inside places they don't belong." Erebus spoke once again, his voice easily compared to a barely audible whisper. Still, however, it was comprehendible for its desired target, Violet, to hear.* - Fri Sep 25 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Hmmm... - Fri Sep 25 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) watched as Violet readied herself for battle, an act that would have been vital but Violet was so low on the food chain that killing her would be equivalent as exhaling a half of second more than usual; fodder. Erebus remained stationary, providing the female with no satisfaction of rebuttal to her need to be some form of hero against a person that didn't approach as a villain. No words of Erebus suggested battle, nor did any of his actions; the Jashinist was relatively calm whilst pacing around the courtyard.

Despite all that, however, there was just that one person within the bunch that had to test the killer. There was that one person that made the killers efforts of not drawing more blood than he already have be in vain, just that one person that ruins it for everyone. Violet was that one person. Still, though, the gratification of engaging in battle with the female wouldn't be granted from Erebus. Instead, while poising his head to imply that he was refocusing on Suitengu, with his eyes still fixated on Violet, Erebus spoke toward the boy again.

"Trust is not something I have earned of your thus yet, but I assure you that I have no ill intentions to your being. A single discussion, supervised by a person of your choosing, is all I seek."* - Fri Sep 25 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) found it saddening how Violet's attempts to uphold some form courage fell upon deaf ears and blind eyes. There was a standard that needed to be met before a threat could be deemed as such, Violet was far from that standard. She was strong in her own right, yes, but the lack of knowledge she harbored forced her to a just another upcoming fish in this ocean of sharks. Nevertheless, Erebus granted her the proper acknowledgement she deserved; none.

His gaze shifted from Violet, setting upon Suitengu. A nod was given to the child, an understanding was met from Erebus and the request would have been granted. Erebus, for the most part, paced his way back; his destination being set on the outskirts of the courtyard. His movements outward were precise, allowing him to keep full peripheral view of everyone while expecting Ushinawa and Suitengu to follow.* - Fri Sep 25 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The intrusion of Fujitora, the infamous traitor of Sunagakure as Flexus explained, nearly sent Erebus overboard. A simple discussion was all the Jashinist sought, but the interference of these fodder-known Shinobi made it all a hassle. With a clench of his scythes and a piercing glare toward Fujitora, Erebus glared at the male.

"Leave us be.."* - Fri Sep 25 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Poetic Justice...He once wanted my wife dead..I once wanted him dead, when we faced one another no blood was shed..Now that one is fallen, the other must take up the role and live ahead..This boy both the son of a former enemy and nephew of my new lover..I am a lawful man of my word. - Fri Sep 25 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' venture away from the main square of Kirigakure wasn't long. It ended a good distance away, but still reachable if anyone desired to catch up and eavesdrop. An attempt to supply Suitengu with the potential feeling of security by allowing him to pick a supervisor of their meeting was made by Erebus, a feat that he didn't usually depend upon, but a feat that was deemed necessary. Ushinawa was a trusted person in Erebus' mind anyways, so it wasn't a problem for the questioning that was planned to go unhindered.

With his gaze fixated on the boy, Erebus examined the situation at hand; the situation being what physical features the boy harbored besides his unique eyes. For the most part, Erebus viewed him as just another adolescent that possibly had his head screwed in tighter and better than a lot of the grown shinobi's. Still, however, Erebus passed no judgment on the child.

"I shall not riddle your mind with hypothetical lectures, for I seek an understanding of your mind. I am a being of many judgments, all casted upon me whilst I pass none on others. That being said, I wish for you to allow me within your mental and supply me with an explanation of what you wish to accomplish in later dates."* - Fri Sep 25 08:33:42 2015

His build, however, was commendable for his age; most kids weren't as fit, but average due to the mix between eating and playing. This small observation set an impression in Erebus' mind on Suitengu's part.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) pushed himself off of the wall in which he was leaning back first again. His hands were securely tucked in his pants pockets and a nonchalant pep was in his step, a different attitude was shown from him. Erebus paced toward the exit, expecting Kilm to follow. Each step he took, the chain that connected his two scythes would rattle; the eerie sound of chain that only enhanced the demonic chills sent by Erebus.* - Sat Sep 26 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll allow you the first move. - Sat Sep 26 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed in on Kilm, watching his handseals intently. Almost instantly, as if the kneading of chakra was done beforehand, a large ball of fire began its descent over Erebus. Now, most would panic over such a jutsu, or even the thought, but Erebus has been to all major nations thus far and he has met a ton of people with this same exact jutsus. The first time around he was fooled, but being the being he was, he learned from his mistakes. That being said, with the temperature quickly rising, Erebus took grasp of one of his scythes and steadily cut his own wrist. The pain, despite him being able to tolerate it, would cancel out the Genjutsu just before the illusionary fireball made impact.

Erebus' eyes remained shut; an attempt to give Kilm the impression that he was still caught in the Genjutsu, seeing as though the Genjutus naturally shut the victim's eyes. To place a cherry on top of the scenario, Erebus would go as far as putting on the most believable act of his shivering in fear.* - Sat Sep 26 11:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) welcomed the massive water jutsu. The only thing he did to counter was send a steady flow of chakra to the soles of his feet as traction, a form of counter to the blunt force. Still, however, as the sound and the tsunami of water neared in, Erebus' eyes snapped open and his arms formed a X in front of him; merely to guard himself.* - Sat Sep 26 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Jashinist or not, Erebus made sure to train his body to tank the brute force of physical and ninjutsu based attacks. Too many people have been defeated because they were paper thin to even the weakest of techniques, Erebus wasn't going to follow that trend. 

With Kilm forming a single handseal and slamming his palms into the ground, Erebus reacted. The Jashinist pivoted forward at top speed, narrowly escaping the development of the barrier. Rather than attacking off the back, however, Erebus simply scaled around Kilm; his plan was to keep on the move and find an opening.* - Sat Sep 26 12:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) tucked his hands back into his pants pockets. He turns his back to the group of people and heads out of the mansion, setting his destination to Konohagakure's clinic for stitches.* - Sat Sep 26 14:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he set his sight on Paine. Her words were easy to comprehend, the stuttering he could easily look last. For the most part, however, his curiosity is what really attracted him to her. Erebus never understood what caused stuttering in people, or the natural nervousness that followed with said stuttering. As his gaze fixated on the female, the Jashinist supplied her with a nod in reply to her question. Soon after, though, he had a question for her.

"Would you mind attending me in a quick drink of sake?"* - Sat Sep 26 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) kept his hands tucked securely within his pants pockets, an attempt to show Paine that no ill intentions were discharging from him. For the most part, however, Erebus' natural aura of sheer evil rained true. Still, though, he did his best to make the female as comfortable as possible. In his mind, Erebus decided that if anyone was going to be allied with Konohagakure and live there, he must form some understanding with them to where trust was earned.

"I think it does, but if you don't like it I'll pay for some tea instead." His voice was subtle and soft, a contrast to what it usually was. Their stroll to the local shop wasn't long, so small talk was just enough to not make the travel boring.* - Sat Sep 26 16:13:13 2015
