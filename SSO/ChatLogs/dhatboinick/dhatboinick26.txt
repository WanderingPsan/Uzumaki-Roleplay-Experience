<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's attention was indeed altered, transitioning from nonexistent to fixated on Chi. Upon seeing her, Ortho would supply her with a nod of greetings. "Hello, Chi. How're you doing?"* - Tue Oct 27 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) unfolded his and dug into his pants pocket, extracting a wad of cash. Once handing it over to Chi, Ortho would simply shrugged his shoulders. "Ehh, I'm good. Still scroll hunting."* - Tue Oct 27 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looked at Chi, supplying her with another shrug. "We've checked every village but Kumogakure, they're all empty. Don't think there's anything more for us to do until the black market is open again."* - Tue Oct 27 07:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Sure, I have a few.. jutsu's.. I can teach you." Ortho nodded his head, allowing his tone of voice to stay casual and mellow. He'd then gesture for Chi to lead the way, wanting her to pick a place.* - Tue Oct 27 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah. Remember, I promised it to you. - Tue Oct 27 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Oh, yea... I guess you did - Tue Oct 27 08:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I should be asking you that, you're the one that I want to make sure is comfortable. - Tue Oct 27 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he watched Chi nervously scratched herself. Seeing as though he took notice, and that the two of them became relatively closer due to recent events, Ortho took it upon himself to find out what was wrong. "Is everything okay?"* - Tue Oct 27 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There was nothing wrong with welcoming physical pain, was there? Like, was it really that awkward for someone to be able to bear pain to the point that it turned them on? Hell, in worst case scenario, this was a good thing for the common man that wanted to just let loose and be rough with his partner in bed. Yeah, this was actually a good thing.

Ortho simply smiled, showing no ill judgment toward what Chi said. He simply gestured for her to come closer. Within that gesture, however, he signaled for Chi to disrobe; it appeared that he thirsted for her body once more.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Is that? - Tue Oct 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arrival was nowhere near subtle. His usual nonchalant lean to his posture was absent, but substituted by a sloppy slouch. His usual clean skin was slightly dirtied by, what it seemed, to be blood. Ortho had two things gripped in his hands, liquor in one and a blunt in the other. A half-unconscious expression was plastered on his face, but was allied by a slight smirk. It's clear that Ortho is completely wasted, or at least heading there.

"Yo', wha' ya'll up to?"
* - Tue Oct 27 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hello Ortho, I'm just observing this young man's training. - Tue Oct 27 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mashai(Novaraven747) says: XD* - Tue Oct 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brought the large bottle of liquor to his mouth and took a strong swig. The gulping from doing so could, literally, be heard from where Ortho stood and down to the end of the training grounds. "Ahh, that's the good stuff," he says as he looked at the bottle while bringing the blunt to his lips. After taking a firm hit off of that, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and returned once the excess smoke escaped his mouth and nose.

"Training ya' say? Nice, nice."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Tue Oct 27 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched as Marrisa approached him, immediately taking another swig of his liquor. He releases a sigh of satisfaction and nodded his head.* - Tue Oct 27 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mhm, what - Tue Oct 27 14:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Eventually you won't have to ask me to get you anything! You can have all the money in the wor- - Tue Oct 27 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No, I don't. Chi, Mana and I were clothed! But when it came to my massage that they paid for to loosen their muscles in an unorthodox manner, they mere had to strip off their top. - Tue Oct 27 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I learned that method with you, so I owe all money I make to you! - Tue Oct 27 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took two more swigs from his sake and another hit off his blunt.* - Tue Oct 27 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: You. . Chi told me you taught her Taijutsu naked. . So she could learn the moves better. . Ortho, I am not mad. . I just want the truth. . I'll only be mad if you lie to me. - Tue Oct 27 14:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Nope, that's not how it happened. We stripped off our outer layer of clothing, yes. We weren't naked though. They had on their undergarments and I had on my boxers. - Tue Oct 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Only time 'nudity' was involved was when Mana requested my massaging. - Tue Oct 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Even then, she wasn't completely naked. - Tue Oct 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: . . Oay. . Thank you for telling me. You enjoy your extra work.  - Tue Oct 27 14:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: I am not mad. I am thakful you told me the truth. - Tue Oct 27 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) accepted the kiss on the cheek, feeling a bit disrespected. He slowly shook his head and paced off, getting one last glance at Marrisa. He had nothing more to say so he simply took another swig of his sake and walked off.* - Tue Oct 27 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yeah, okay.. - Tue Oct 27 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: Sorry love. . I dislike the taste of Liquor - Tue Oct 27 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Uh huh. - Tue Oct 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued to walk off.* - Tue Oct 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Chi's approach was much more than seductive. It could easily be labeled as mesmorizing, and in turn Ortho granted her with a smirk of approval. Blood surged down to his member, forcing it to stiffen in lust and cause a tent in the frontal part of his pants; still, however, he wasn't fully erect. By time Chi was within arms reach, she made the unique request. Ortho was a man that kept his word, so the request didn't fall on deaf ears. As a result, with no words said, Ortho took the sports bra by the front and, with a single pull, ripped it off of Chi.

Once her breasts were exposed and the view of her nipples was made, Ortho wasted no time in cupping them whilst placing her nipples in between two fingers. He squeezed tightly, a bit more than what he'd usually do due to the knowledge that Chi enjoyed pain.* - Tue Oct 27 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's appearance was much neater than before. His clothing was clean, his skin was washed and his hair was less raggedy. He still carried a blunt and a massive bottle of liquor, but he was more controlled in the pace at which he used both. Ortho remained quiet as  he entered the Village square, not saying anything to anyone; he didn't even bother to make eye contact with anymore.* - Tue Oct 27 16:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) placed the bottle of liquor down by his feet, making sure to keep it a safe distance so he don't accidentally knock it over. After doing so, he would place the blunt at the right corner of his mouth and take a slow hit off of it. Excess smoke escaped his nostrils as he looked up at the sky, watching the clouds go by. "I wonder if you're watching, Hideki.." thought Ortho.* - Tue Oct 27 16:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his head raised and eyes fixated on the sky. He remained quiet, only sound coming from him would be the occasional intake of the blunt followed by the audible exhale of excess smoke.* - Tue Oct 27 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mashai(Novaraven747) says: But he understand why he's in there. - Tue Oct 27 16:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Arata's approach was rather sudden, almost catching Ortho off guard. Still, however, haste guided the male. And it's with haste which Ortho brought his hands together and began the swift process of stringing a series of seals together. Upon doing so, still with haste leading each movement, Ortho would pucker his lips and spew a thick torrent of liquid forward. Of course, whilst the handseals were being formed, Ortho's chakra would begin kneading and thickening within his stomach. In turn, in hopes of catching Arata before physical contact was made, Ortho intended to bind Arata from head to toe.* - Wed Oct 28 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Perfect.

The syrup didn't play its part as it should, but it did leave an opening for Ortho. Whilst Arata spun to deflect the syrup, Ortho would make a back dash. During such dash, the young lad found his hands together once more in a succession of seals. Chakra kneads within his lungs during a large intake of breath, in which it was soon expelled through puckered lips. Upon its expulsion, the wind magnifies to create a powerful gust of wind in hopes of pushing Arata back; of course this was timed so once Arata stopped spinning, he'd be left open.* - Wed Oct 28 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Judging by his personality...the -weakness- in it. . . - Wed Oct 28 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was in the interrogation jutsu when he said....he did not make that happen on purpose. - Wed Oct 28 07:41:13 2015
