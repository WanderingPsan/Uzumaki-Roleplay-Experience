<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Stand down Lera. - Sun Sep 20 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) raised his scythe, dragging it from the body of Jin. Blood dripped from the blades, providing the Jashinist with more than enough fuel to begin the required ritual. He cared not for the massive fireball coming his way, he simply damped his right foot in the puddle of blood and began tracing out the Jashin insignia.

He starts off by forming the circle, dragging his foot along. By this time, the fireball would've crashed into his and burned most of his clothing; still, he didn't care. Erebus followed the circle up by forming the upside down triangle, finalizing the first stage of the ritual.

"Look at me, Lord Jashin! I've done it! I've finally granted you what you seeked of me," he barked as his body began to transition. His main skin tone darkened to a pitch-blank shade as outlines of white followed close pursuit. By time his transition was complete, Erebus' skin resembled that of a white skeleton on a black backdrop. "This is the moment I've been waiting for!" With that final battle cry, Erebus raised his blooded scythe and drove it into his stomach. A look of sheer lust overcame the Jashinist as his head fell back in ecstasy. "Ahhh, yes.. That's the good stuff.."* - Sun Sep 20 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || An explosion sounded off around Erebus, the entire area filling with nothing but combustible oxygen and flames. Despite all their efforts, however, Erebus could be heard laughing sinisterly throughout the entire process. While using the mask of the massive flames, as he just stood in the midst of it, Erebus would thrust his scythe toward the clone of Lera, allowing the entire weapon to go flying from his grasp. However, something that they may have overlooked, the scythe had a rope-like aspect to it. Whether or not the scythe managed to disperse the clone, Erebus would tug on its cord to retract it back into his grasp.* - Sun Sep 20 12:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) took the wind bullets head on, his body convulsing with each hit. Still, however, he had no reason to fight anyone here; Jin was an exception. Nevertheless, however, Erebus emerged from the flames with his arms folded across his chest. Looking at him, you can tell that his skin tone was back to normal and he was out of his demonic transformation. His eyes set upon Seisuke, paying Lera and her clone no mind. "Speak, Gezo Representative."* - Sun Sep 20 12:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: ..? - Sun Sep 20 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) released a grunt of annoyance, watching the clone pivot forth. He knew he could take the hit on all together, but his interest really wasn't with Lera or what she felt like she had to do in the name of heroism. That being said, with the clone thrusting its arm forward, Erebus would simply side step it and grabs it by the hair. From that point, while using the momentum of the side step, Erebus would swing the clone around and launch it toward the original Lera.

It's at that point Erebus returned his focus to Seisuke. "Interesting; very well, as long as it doesn't interfere with my rituals, I'll join."* - Sun Sep 20 12:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head, shrugging at the reasoning Seisuke gave him. He achieved his goal, so it was time to make another one and go from there. With his burnt closing and slightly scratches skin, Erebus gives Himura a nod; a sign of mutual respect and condolences. "I'll be off now, Seisuke. I've done what I could for the majority of these people, the rest is on their shoulders," Erebus spoke as he gripped the hilt of his scythe once more and began pacing down the courtyard. Each step the Jashinist took, the Scythe would echo a loud-pitch screech from metal dragging against stone.* - Sun Sep 20 13:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's approach out the gates of Genjigakure could be heard and smelt. The rink stench of death and blood emit from his body as his scythe dripped of the crimson liquid. That very same scythe was located on his back as the upper most blades dragged against the turf below. Still, one he caught glimpse of the conversing group, Erebus remained quiet. He lowered his head a bit, removing what eyesight anyone could have of his face. Whether or not he was exposed location wise due to his scraping scythe  and rink of death and blood, he still remained quiet.* - Sun Sep 20 14:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Because they want something... - Sun Sep 20 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) edged forward, lifting his head up a bit to stare at Hideki, his jaw inch open; cracks sounding off across the field.

"Survival is a mortal instinct, a commendable.. mortal instinct. Ushinawa, you have proven to me that you.. are indeed worthy. Despite what altercation we had before, you shall be granted permission to the gates of my lord."* - Sun Sep 20 14:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's narrowed, trailing off of Hideki's frame and feel upon Mariana's. For the little time he's been around her, accounting the numerous occasions from before, she has been hostile and deemed it fit to prepare for battle.

"If I sought to battle, woman, you wouldn't be standing here with the free will to prepare for such. Ease yourself, for I only come in verbal alliance. That, woman, is my last warning," his voice was soft and sinister, a true resemblance to his visual apparel. Erebus' gaze shifted once more, setting itself upon Ushinawa.

"You are not worthy of death, no. You are worthy to dine amongst gods such as myself. I have already stitched my name within the fabrics of this shinobi world; it is time you do the same. This village system is tainted with sin; sins that can not be forgiven. You, Ushinawa, are destined to walk alongside me, Erebus the Immortal, and allow these other.. mortals," his eyes glazed back over to Mariana and Hideki, "rue the day that they question us.."* - Sun Sep 20 15:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: .... - Sun Sep 20 15:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: So his name is Erebus. - Sun Sep 20 15:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, providing Ushinawa with his sign of disapproval. Whatever maturity Ushinawa sought out within Kirigakure didn't exist, for he had to eliminate a few shinobi from there already.

"My shipment to Kirigakure has proven that maturity exist not within the Land of Waves. They act upon fear, dwell upon hate and think upon idiocy. They know not the true extent at which their power provide, which is why I foresee their destruction. Going there will only result in disappointment. I, myself, had to sacrifice the one known as Jin for my cause and example. I suggest not to hold high expectations, but to keep in mind that it takes more than just time for a mass of disgrace to progress into something formidable."* - Sun Sep 20 15:21:48 2015
