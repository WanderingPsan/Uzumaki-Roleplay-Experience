<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Because she clearly isn't allied to you? - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015

Locking me in prison for not wanting to supply them with my hard earned money. - Thu Nov 19 08:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Nice and open.. no trees. - Thu Nov 19 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Alright Eri, let's get started."

Almost immediately Ortho begin to unwrap his arm from with the bandages. "The next technique isn't elemental. I'm going to help you get more in tuned with your manipulation of snakes. Thus far you only know how to expel them in one jolt. They however instinctively use the kusanagi blades. This next jutsu is a jutsu deriving from the Hidden Snake Hands." His voice is stern and straight to the point, giving off no compassion or emotion with the words that rolled off his tongue. His visual focus was on his right arm as he unravel the bandages --- he almost expected Eri to give him her undivided attention.

"Unlike the parent jutsu, this one doesn't require two quick handseals. It requires the flow of your chakra and sometimes a hint of blood. Once you actually master the technique, the snakes will subconsciously spawn for you and take things over. For now I want to you do the preparations for a summoning. Instead of smearing the blood in the palm you used to sign the contract, you're run the blood down the arm in question and allow the snakes to extract themselves."

Ortho's lecture came to an end --- there was obviously a cliff hanger. The rest was for her to figure out, and that wasn't hard. He gave her a hint on the flow of chakra and the fact that the snakes work off of her subconscious, the only thing she had to do was figure out what to do once the snakes were actually there.* - Thu Nov 19 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. The sight of the snake heads and tongues barely making it past Eri's skin made his skin crawl. He quickly shook his head to get the image out of his mind, "okay then. Let's just.. act like that didn't happen."

He releases a deep breath and thinks for a moment. He had more elemental ninjutsu but they weren't of 'her' elements. Teaching her a new element all together would be a drag and he already asked her before if she wanted to branch out. A light bulb spawns over his head and flickers on.

"Alright this jutsu is more of a supplementary thing. It's not exactly the most powerful jutsu but it has saved my life numerous of times thus far." Ortho brings his right hand to his left and had his digits wrestle against each other. Slowly, but surely, the necessary handseals were formed for the jutsu in question. Ortho thrusts his right arm forward, in Eri's general location, and have two tripwires shoot forth with the motion. Just as the wires were to make contact with Eri and wrap around her, Ortho would pull his arm back and stopped the progression of its movements.

"Normally the wire would wrap around you and subdue you, but.. yeah. It's really basic, but as useful as even the kawarimi technique. It's something I feel is a lifesaver."* - Thu Nov 19 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks, never actually thinking about where he was getting the wires from. "They're summoned. It's not like animal summoning where you need blood as sacrifice, you simply weave the handseals and there ya' go. That part is easy, it's the actual wrapping of the wires that you need to focus on."* - Thu Nov 19 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He was suddenly ensnared by the wires, his heart immediately started pounding. He knew of the deep gashes these wounds can inflict and wanted no part of it. He takes a gulp and glances at Eri --- there was a look of concern and slight anxiety. "O-Okay.. It's okay. Just calm down and let the line go slack. Don't tug, just slowly push."* - Thu Nov 19 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, "I've seen what that jutsu could do by accident. It's not something even I.. want to experience."* - Thu Nov 19 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Was it Genjutsu she said she didn't want or Fuuinjutsu..? - Thu Nov 19 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched the wires drop to the ground. He slowly shook his head and had the "phew" expression plastered over his face. "Anyways.. Genjutsu is your next lesson. I'm going to start you off with something easy --- Mist Servant Jutsu. It's basically a jutsu that allows you to make an illusion where multiple clones of you are created. As any other visual jutsu, you need a trigger. In this case, for practicing purposes, you're going to use the final handseal in the succession as the trigger. Expand your chakra and you'll eventually catch them in it. Make sure the flow of chakra is steady, and actually make the clones as believable as possible." All through his lecture Ortho would slowly string the necessary handseals together, making sure Eri was paying attention to them.

[Short RP, had to rewatch the episode it was in to get a good description of it --- even though mine is still bad.]* - Thu Nov 19 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded in approval. "Good job."

"This next Genjutsu isn't like the last one. This one is more.. conscious.. involved. With this Genjutsu, the effects is you digging deep into the victim's conscious and using it against him. The handseals," he pauses and begins to weave the handseals, "are relatively easy and also could be the trigger for training purposes. As your chakra seep into your victim, as I said, you're just digging into his conscious for his worst nightmare and, or, making him relive his most.. terrifying.. moments in his life."* - Thu Nov 19 11:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: ? - Thu Nov 19 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head, "don't worry about me." She had already displayed that she could perform the jutsu at will, but he still stated that to assure he that he'd be fine --- or so he put up a front on.

"Let's try that snake jutsu one more time. Your chakra flow needs to be constant and lengthy. Think of the flow to be the snakes. The longer you drag the chakra out, the longer the snake. Also, the more chakra you expel is the more snakes you expel. I suggest keeping the amount of snakes moderate." Ortho's right arm raises and his chakra flourishes, two snakes creeping out of his skin and coiling out of his arm.
* - Thu Nov 19 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's snakes retracted back into his arm. "Control them. Use your chakra and conscious to move them. Don't use words. Use me as the victim. Make them coil around me and constrict."* - Thu Nov 19 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) lifted his chin a bit. He remains relatively still as the snakes coiled around his body. His eyes watched their every movement, wanting to make sure that Eri had full control over them. He knew first hand that once the snakes were hungry and wanted blood they'd rebel, but for the most part his prodigal student had things handled. "Good, good. I just had to get you started with your chakra flow. I'm proud you my student, very proud."* - Thu Nov 19 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) folds his arms across his chest and watches her get acquainted with her snake. "I do," he says in a low tone. "It may not be often but when I do feed them, it's a massive meal that lasts them for a while."* - Thu Nov 19 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Manda have a level of respect for each other. I have a stronger.. bond.. with the snakes of Ryuchi Cave than it seems." The ending of Ortho's statement was more hushed than the other.* - Thu Nov 19 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs. "It's more complicated than that. Him and I just.. I don't know. That level of trust and friendship let's us say anything to one another and laugh about it later."* - Thu Nov 19 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I won't question it anymore. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Obviously hiding something. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What is it? - Thu Nov 19 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just thinking. - Thu Nov 19 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks down at Eri, blinking a few times as she embraced him. By all means he returned the hug with one arm but kept the other behind his head. "Stuff for the village, possible alliances and.. you."* - Thu Nov 19 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continues to blink. He thought about what Eri said and nodded after a minute or so.

"Well, I'm stuck between sending you all.. or some of you.. to Sunagakure. I talked with Hassan, the kazekage, and he wants to host an international Chuunin Exam. I don't exactly agree with the ranking system of the traditional shinobi villages, but I don't want to hinder the rest of you.. Then there is my desire to form alliances with what's remaining of Konohagakure. I also want to check out Kumogakure and see what I can find there," he looks down and winks, "and that leaves you. The latter but most important."* - Thu Nov 19 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had the urge to keep this game up with her of her remaining quiet, but he was truly torn between decisions. Her look of curiosity made him chuckle a bit and slowly shake his head.

"You're always on my mind, so throwing that in there was easy and accurate. The other two things.. I honestly want your opinion on them. I don't exactly know how to go about it and any.. and all.. opinions are welcomed."* - Thu Nov 19 13:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I am. - Thu Nov 19 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let me hear it. - Thu Nov 19 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) listened intently on what she had to say, finding her words very helpful. As a village leader he had the right to make decisions such as this and lead his shinobi to a better and new system. He nods his head.

"Submitting any of you is a bit.. risky. However, I do have Hatsujin in Sunagakure right now walking amongst tem in an attempt to gather as much information as possible. That's a bonus for us. Not to mention I want to see if I can plant him in Kumogakure for a bit as a Sunagakure traveler exploring off of the jurisdictions."* - Thu Nov 19 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Sometimes it's the weak that makes the biggest difference. From what the people of Sunagakure know, I only recruite the best --- Hatsujin is the best in his own way."* - Thu Nov 19 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I see... - Thu Nov 19 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will you ever find something for me to do like that? - Thu Nov 19 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Actually, yes. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Soon, very soon. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A few more techniques and I'll send you to Konohagakure. See if there any lingering shinobi there. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What will I be doing? - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course it's not as high stakes as Hatsujin's location.. but I know there are a few Sunagakure shinobi that linger there. - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I basically want you to see how people of Konohagakure feel. - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: See if their minds are swaying. - Thu Nov 19 13:45:36 2015

I came here for peace and serenity between my village and yours, but I see now I'll just have to kill you all when you're standing strong again. It's no fun destroying you when you're weak. When peace is denied and overlook, I'm there to kill the noise and play a different song in another attempt." He shrugs, taking a solid hit off of his blunt.* - Thu Nov 19 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But if you think your threats of my death are enough to scare me into submission, you are dead wrong. You can kill one, but another one arises in it's place. You student thinks highly of you, say's yo're a good man. But you can't just walk the walk. You speak of ending pacifists with this 'Manda', as if you're cleaning up trash. - Thu Nov 19 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Forgive me, but I see no benevolence in that. - Thu Nov 19 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckled.

"Ahh.. I see," he takes a hit off of his blunt, allowing the excess smoke to seep from his nose, "you're not a complete idiot. Foolish, but not a complete idiot. I'm going to tell you straight up, I don't like you or your village. I rather see you and the village alike dead. Two reasons for this: you knew this was a meeting for peace, yet you still run off your tongue like a whore across a cock. On top of that, you allowed your own personal feelings to guide your words a village leader. That's why I don't like 'you'. I don't like your village because they allowed a foolish man as yourself be the leader of them. Foolish can't lead foolish, it's a natural sin of common sense. However.. I'm willing to look past that. Hideki.. my gone-too-soon sensei.. originated from Kumogakure. His sensei, Ushinawa, originated from Kumogakure.. I didn't take part in Kumogakure destruction and I deem it necessary-no.. I deem is a priority to see it flourish once again.."* - Thu Nov 19 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"You're nothing more than a contradiction. I greeted you in kindness, and then you ran off your tongue --- did you not? You basically stated I was a monster for what affairs I had with Kirigakure, a completely different scenario than what ideals I have with Kumogakure. You took it upon yourself to criticize and judge me, but you yourself don't wish to be judged? You don't want fingers pointed at you for being an unfit Kage? Are you that closed minded and biased that your efforts alone should be acknowledged but no one elses? You're more than foolish, you're simply filler if that's truly how your mind works.

What you just told me isn't a last ditch effort to rebuild Kumogakure. You view it as such but no, it's way less than that. You stated yourself you don't know my story, you're right. Only I know my story and my next chapter is an attempt to aid Kumogakure and each word that spews from your mouth of contradiction is making the chapter lessen in length. You stated that all you know is I killed off people in Kirigakure and that it was an act of aggression. Duh, of course it is. But it's not aggression that went off without a trigger. I'm a murderer, yes, but not a serial killer. I killed those peole when they provoked me endlessly. I held my tongue, something you don't seem to know how to do, and allowed their words and actions to bypass me, but it wasn't until they laid a finger on me and I killed them all. Am I wrong for doing so when I was provoked? If I am then fine, being right a cliché anyways.

As for Kumogakure's progression, I wish to hear the next thing you decide to say. Then I'll make my own decision."* - Thu Nov 19 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head again.

"Contradiction after contradiction, Raikage. You have selective hearing and it's rather annoying. You continue to admit that you placed judgment on me from what others say, but have yet to hear my side of the story. It's pointless at this point."

Ortho shrugs and takes a hit of his blunt.

"This is on you. Do you want help with no strings attached or not?"* - Thu Nov 19 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He unfolds his arms from across his chest. He brings his left hand over to his right arm and tears away the bandages there. His arm was riddled with tattoos at first look, but he'd turn to the side a bit and let his entire triceps and biceps to be viewed. There, massive gashes of in grown skin can be seen. Scars and still healing wounds even after months of proper care. It was as if someone stuck a knife in his skin and just dragged it down to rip away at his skin. Also, it can be seen that most of the healed wounds that turned into scars was drawn on for the tattoos.

"I was locked in prison when I first graduated from the academy. I ended up getting rewarded money from Konohagakure due to my show of loyalty and bravery of my own 'nindo way' as you put it. When word got to the Mizukage at the time, Kirie, that I had such amount of money.. she ordered her shinobi to capture me and lock me up. I was mentally and physically tortured. My money was stolen and used by Kirie herself to buy jutsu scrolls from the one known as Lera. At the time Lera was still starting her business of selling scrolls. This scar.. my tattoos.. and the constantly throbbing and aching gashes in my arm from their torture is a constant reminder of what I been through because I didn't want to give her money for her own selfish desires. I am only alive because the wire they used to apprehend me was slacked after the moved me to another cell in the prison. I was forced to tear at my own skin and break three fingers just enough to make my arm flexible enough to slip out. I made it out with barely any life in me.."

He digs into his backpouch and takes out more bandages then starts wrapping his arm again.

"That.. is why I attacked Kirigakure. The day I was told I could fight again.. I fought.. Killed Elon and Violet. I would've killed Kirie if she didn't die mere hours before I showed up.. Do I regret killing them? No. Would I do it again? Without hesitation."* - Thu Nov 19 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) finished wrapping his arm and listened to what Eiyu had to say. He places the remaining amount of bandages into his back pouch. "I'm not asking you to throw away what ties you have with anyone else. I don't care about them anymore. I live with the scars and my hatred, influencing you is not what I planned to do. I just seek loyalty and honesty in return for my aid. Nothing more, nothing less." Orth takes a hit off of his blunt, shrugging a bit.

"If people just listened to my side of the story instead of judging me, they'd understand. The current Mizukage provoked me by going to Sunagakure, a place I took refuge in after I escaped Kirigakure, and asked Hassan to supply forces to attack my village. That wouldn't matter to me if it wasn't for the fact that I gave the current Mizukage half a million mere days before he went to Sunagakure in an attempt to show no hostile intent to the village during his reign. I showed peace and honesty.. just to have spit launched in my face..

Whatever views you had.. or have.. of Kirigakure.. I don't mean to sway them to different stand points.. I just want my story told for a change.."* - Thu Nov 19 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: In other words.. It's suicide to be anywhere near the Mizukage. - Fri Nov 20 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in understanding.

"Very well.. I ask one thing of you then.. Just one.. thing."* - Fri Nov 20 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes? - Fri Nov 20 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: War is inevitable.. When I die and my village is destroyed by Kirigakure.. - Fri Nov 20 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why? - Fri Nov 20 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Let me join you. - Fri Nov 20 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: There's no point for you to throw your life away! - Fri Nov 20 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Your student loves you more than anything. - Fri Nov 20 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) chuckles, lowering his head a bit. He closes his eyes and allows his two teardrop eyes to activate. "Why..?"

He raises his head and opens his eyes, revealing his doujutsu.

"I'm my sensei's student. Hideki wouldn't want me having other people fighting my battles. He always said I was a rebel and foolish to the bigger picture.. In this case my death is the bigger picture, but I refuse to make my picture bland and boring. If I'm going out.. i'm going out with my cock and balls in my OWN grasp and a sword slitting throats until I fall...

I'm Ortho of the Snakes.. I'm the descendant of Ushinawa and Hideki.. I will not fall without a fight."* - Fri Nov 20 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glances at Eri as she stared off into space. She was in her own world at the moment and he didn't bother to interrupt her. His eyes trailed down to her stomach before he turned his head to look at Eiyu and Hachirou.

"Sometimes.. legacies are passed on in more ways than just.. students. I'll die for Eri at any point. The love I have for her isn't comparable.. If she placed a kunai to my neck right now and threatened to kill me herself, I'll welcome death like I am welcoming death from Kirigakure. She walks this path with me willingly.. I don't know why or how she keeps up.. but she does and I respect her for it.. At the same time.. I have to make sure that my people are safe.. I have to make sure that they have a place to lay their head to sleep at night and not have to wake up every hour just to be tortured.. I've been through that and I refuse to make the same happen to them."

He sighs, a single tear flowing down his cheek.

"Sometimes I wonder if Hideki remembered I even existed when he died.. I never got that acknowledgment that I wanted from rebelling.. so I'm doing this.. accepting my fate.. to finally be of worth to him.. Not some little kid that he had to protect endlessly.. Just please.. allow my villagers and loved ones to refuge in Kumogakure when I fall.. The battle itself.. I'll fight it alone. Any unnecessary casualties must be prevented."* - Fri Nov 20 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: The Mizukage won't dare attack me in front of Hassan. - Fri Nov 20 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed. He really didn't want to get too many people involved in this. The Raikage was persistent and not even Ortho knew if he could contend with it.

"Is this truly what you desire, Raikage? To aid me, the murderer of Kirigakure?"* - Fri Nov 20 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: I guess he doesn't want to know what the Mizukage is capable of. - Fri Nov 20 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks toward Hachirou.

"What does his abilities consist of?"* - Fri Nov 20 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) steps into the doorway leading to the living room.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) supplies Menma with a nod, relieving him of the bow. "Good day, Menma. How are things?" Ortho stood with his arms folded across his chest. His right arm was wrapped with bandages and his other arm was covered by a long sleeve. Of course, like the others, he wore all black with lighter gray colors scattered in his attire. Most noticeable is the Uchiha crest on his belt buckle and Uchiha crest on his back --- his hair covered most of the crest on his back.* - Fri Nov 20 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded once again. "Maybe what I have in store for you all will lighten your moods. I've been thinking and decided to take a step further for our bond as a family and village. We've all come to the point we're close and trust in one another.. So from this point forward our surname will be Uchiha. We will be known as such and hold this name with pride. Am I understood? Ortho's pitch-black pupils transition from Menma to Mitarashi then back to Menma; he was waiting on their answer.* - Fri Nov 20 03:43:34 2015

Once accepting it, Ortho would chuck it to Menma for him to catch. "There you go. The details of the mission is in there."* - Fri Nov 20 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Stay safe. Don't be afraid to contact me if anything comes up. - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Yessir! - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times. He had to commend for the hustle, it was impeccable. Ortho nods to Menma and accepted the scroll back. In exchange, Ortho would supply him with well over the amount of yen the scroll said he'd get. Ten times more to be exact.* - Fri Nov 20 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "No, keep it. It's your reward for getting the job done in commendable time."* - Fri Nov 20 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Jeez, you're swimming in money Ortho. - Fri Nov 20 04:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? I wouldn't say tha- - Fri Nov 20 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods. "Sure, what is it?"* - Fri Nov 20 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Could you assist me with my training later? - Fri Nov 20 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. - Fri Nov 20 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That'll be no problem. - Fri Nov 20 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. "I am."* - Fri Nov 20 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: What are we doing? - Fri Nov 20 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Lead the way M'Lord. - Fri Nov 20 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Ew...They're calling him Lord.... - Fri Nov 20 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Lead the way M'Lord. - Fri Nov 20 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) led Menma to an open field with a medium sized body of water. The air was thin and fresh and the area was just perfect for training. "Alright Menma, we'll start off with a basic spar to see what you're capable of. Sounds good?"* - Fri Nov 20 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took two steps forward. His eyes were fixed on Menma's blade, attentively watching every move it made. By time his progression forth came to a halt he was face to face with the blades' tip, eyeing it from that end down to the hilt. "I don't know much about Kenjutsu, but I can honestly tell you deceptions in your movements is the key to landing a successful strike. Make feint movements to throw your opponent off then go from there." * - Fri Nov 20 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued to glare at the blade. Each movement Menma wasn't one of waste, Ortho noticed that from the jump. The second the male lodged the blade into the ground and hoisted himself on top of the hilt Ortho reacted. He brings his arms to chest level and formed a protective "x". Menma's foot collides with Ortho with relative ease, but didn't cause much damage. In retaliation however, Ortho would lean backwards and arch his back while manipulating the momentum caused by Menma. A backflip is quickly executed and space is created between them. "Impressive," mutters Ortho. He grants Menma with a nod of approval, letting him know that the move was just what he had in mind. "You have to keep your movements going. No move should be left on of cliffhanger, but have a follow up. You must even have a follow up for your follow up. Your ability with your blade is what defines you, always keep that in mind."* - Fri Nov 20 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) prepared himself for Menma's approach. The feint for his shoulder was anticipated, Menma's gripping was a bit too obvious. "Upper body feints," he pauses to side step the blade in its entirety, "must be accompanied by double feints. They're right in your opponents line of sight so taking full advantage of that is the way to go." By time he finished talking Ortho had Menma's wrist gripped. "Come on, improvise."* - Fri Nov 20 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. The sight of Menma's smirk and the sudden surge of electricity managed to catch Ortho off guard, giving the boy ample time to land a solid hit in. As a result, Ortho is sent hurling backward; coming to a halt a few feet away. "Alright, alright I'll give you that. You got me. You're a fast learner." Ortho makes it back to his feet, dusting himself off a bit.* - Fri Nov 20 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: How did things go? - Fri Nov 20 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Decent I suppose. - Fri Nov 20 06:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his head lowered and eyes shuts.* - Fri Nov 20 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Mhm. I suppose. - Fri Nov 20 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Are you angry, Sir? - Fri Nov 20 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Nope. Why you say that? - Fri Nov 20 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You said I would be recieving punishment. - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'll let you pick when and where you want to recieve it. - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Just know it -will- happen. - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...sooner is probably best, Sir... so now. - Fri Nov 20 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I don't know what you mean by where.. I assume in privacy. - Fri Nov 20 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) lifted his head and opened his eyes. He turns on his heels and heads for the house at the end of this street.* - Fri Nov 20 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Come on then. - Fri Nov 20 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) only kicked off his shoes and took off his shirt and sleeveless jacket. He folds it up and placed it next to Eri's pile. "To the couch," he says in a demanding manner.* - Fri Nov 20 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paces after her. He keeps his facial expression plain and void of any emotions. He looks at her, narrowing his eyes and slowly shaking his head. "I'd like to hear an explanation. I'm not saying your actions didn't benefit us, but still. I'm a fair guy in some occasions so let me know what you were thinking.."* - Fri Nov 20 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) take a step closer to Eri and brings his right index finger to her chin. He raises her head and leans in a bit, giving her a passionate kiss. "You have my trust as a shinobi. I may not send you on high stake missions, but you do have my trust. It's not about the level of the mission, it's about what I thought would fit whose personality. Sunagakure is savagery to a certain extent; Hatsujin has that natural savageness in him. You are more logical and analytic. That's why I was contemplating on sending you to Konohagakure to determine if any more refugees could be transported here. Kumogakure didn't cross my mind as a priority that must be dealt with immediately." His voice remained leveled and straight forward, despite the passion behind the kiss he gave her.

"Still," he continues while guiding her more toward the cough. He maneuvers his way behind her and gestured her to climb in and get on her knees, "your punishment is due. You've truly impressed me, don't think I overlooked that. It's for that reason why I'm going to give you a small reward before your punishment."* - Fri Nov 20 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Maybe the punishment isn't what I'm about to do to you.. but the thought that this may just be the last time we do anything for a while is."

Ortho stretches his arm forward, cupping her mound with his palm. He curls in two fingers to craze over her clit the put slight pressure on it. His other hand finds her right cheek and gives it a good squeeze and rub. He then extends his thumb and goes right for her pucker. He wasn't as straight forward with this like he was with her pussy; he takes his time and just continuously glides his thumb over the wrinkles. "Or is that not punishment for you either?"* - Fri Nov 20 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his touch subtle and graze-like. He applied pressure when it was just right, but stopped before she got too riled up. Her reward was going to come soon but the usual tease-session was going to come in play first. He uses the same two fingers than ran across her lit would find her entrance and play around with her lips but didn't dare go too far in. His thumb went against what his other hand was doing to her mound. He applies enough pressure, at a slow pace, to start entering her pucker; easing his way to opening her up. "Yes, that's still intact. I'm sure you'll take joy in relieving him when I'm aroused, but maybe the punishment will result in you not getting that same satisfaction. You'll never know."* - Fri Nov 20 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noticed the instant arch in her back and ran with it. Instead of picking up the pass on her asshole he'd drive his middle finger passed her entrance and pause just as he was two joints deep. His ring finger presses against her lit a lot more and begins circling the nub. The remaining of his fingers worked on her lips, tugging and parting them to make the cold air hit her. His thumb that was focused on her asshole was given some lubricant --- his saliva. He removes his thumb, licks it then placed it back. He didn't go with the slow pace of entering her again; he'd add a bit more pressure with patience this time around. Eventually he'd be first joint pass her wrinkles. "I'll give you a chance to convince me that it's unfair and that I shouldn't even punish you at all."* - Fri Nov 20 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inches his thumb more and more into her asshole, daring her to make any sudden moves for him to place his entire thumb in her. His opposing hand continues to work on her pussy for a bit longer, but ends up slowly slipping away to his zipper. "Come now," he says in a hushed tone; the seriousness in his voice was still there, "I want to see if you can.. talk.. your way out of this." Just as he said that his cock would spring out of his pants, standing erect and ready to be used. He then sways his hip forward and lines his head up with her entrance. "Don't give up, give it your best shot."* - Fri Nov 20 08:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pushes forth, driving his cock past her entrance; stopping just before he reached his half way point. His thumb pulls back, but stops before he was completely out. Just as fast as he retracted his thumb was as fast as he drove it back it. This time around however, he'd twist at the ankle to rotate his thumb around inside. To make things worse, or better in this situation, he'd begin swaying his thumb back and forth to add more stimulation to her insides. All the while he'd sway his hips back and forth, making sure his cock didn't reach the halfway point just yet.

"To.. get out of your punishment.. you must make one-one.. promise," he says in his best attempt not to make the seduction display itself in his voice.* - Fri Nov 20 08:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brings his free hand up and takes a handful of her cheeks, allowing her to ease another inch inside of her. He bites down on his bottom lip, remaining quiet for a bit to just enjoy the feeling of her pussy tightening around his cock and thumb. He continues to finger fuck her asshole while wiggling his thumb around inside her each step of the way. His cock was soon to base out in her and when it did he was going to pull her body back and hold her there, making sure she didn't move. The only movements there'll be is his thumb claiming her asshole. "Promise me that you'll keep up.. the good work.. and understand.. that I want to keep you safe.. not shelter you for the rest.. of your life.."* - Fri Nov 20 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had to be honest with himself. He kept her still and allowed her to run through her orgasm because he knew if they continued to sway back and forth while she climaxed he'd end up nearing his orgasm as well. Now, with his cock nice and lubricated he can go to part two. Before that though he just continues to push and pull his thumb out of her asshole, letting her slowly float down from her high until she was ready. He may be lusting to extreme levels, but he always wanted to make sure the pace was right so she didn't feel unsatisfied at any point; even when he does a few trial and error risks. He'd keep his cock based out inside her and continued his thumb movements, only slowing the pace just a bit so her climax could subside.* - Fri Nov 20 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) felt Eri clench around his cock and even he released a groan. Her second climax was expected but he accepted it with open arms; that was always something he could welcome. The pace at which his thumb moves slowed even more during this climax in an attempt to continue dragging as much out of her as possible. Despite all his urges to glide his cock in and out of her, Ortho leaves himself based out and waited.* - Fri Nov 20 09:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly slips his cock out. By this point, even while he was trying not to, he was enlarged to the max. He was soaking wet from Eri's juices and was going to take full advantage of this. He moves his free hand from her cheeks to her hips and held her in position, not making her go anywhere. He pulls his thumb out and takes hold of his cock and lines the head up with her second hole. Gently, carefully and with patience, Ortho would ease his head in. He'd give more lubrication by adding his saliva, having it seep around his head and on to her pucker. He keeps the pace slow and steady, pulling back on her every centimeter or so.* - Fri Nov 20 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) bites down his lower lip and ease his cock further into Eri. His grip remained on her hips as he subconsciously moves back and forth. He moves his own hips in contrast to hers; she moves back, he moves forth. He inches his cock deeper and deeper into her, pacing himself just in case his girth and length became too much for even her relaxed state. To add leverage to his thrusts he'd alter their position. He'd subtly swing her to the right so she was chest and face first against one of the cushions as he climbed up on the couch behind her, with his cock still in her, and rests his knees where hers were. They were in the same position they were in a few days ago at the bank when he first met his cock with her asshole.* - Fri Nov 20 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) manages to get his cock in past the head but just before he hit the halfway point. He decides to keep things there until another time, only pulling back and thrusting in to stop at that specific point. The rhythm he gathered and the leverage he had allowed him to lean forward completely and rest his palms on the sides of her, planting them on the cushions. His hips sway back and forth and his cock trails in and out of her, the faint sound of his lubricated cock rampaging through her is heard. By this point his was working off of sheer lust and pleasure, enjoying every inch he was able to dig into Eri's asshole. He was tempted to base out in her but then again, this was a process and he really didn't know if she could even handle it --- even in her relaxed and welcoming state.* - Fri Nov 20 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's mind was now clouded by lust. His cock was now aching from how enlarged it was, the tightness of Eri's asshole made him feel like it was a battle between their muscles. His cock was determined to get big and her ass was determined to squeeze and clench to subdue him. He releases a low groan and continues to sway his hips back and forth. Lust took its toll and he dared to inch just a bit more of his cock into her with each thrust. He made sure he wasn't going to fast, nor hard, with the thrust but it was just enough to get the job done. Meanwhile, he'd lean more on to his right hand and trail his left hand to her chest; grabbing a handful of her perfectly sized breast. He fondles it and pinches lightly at her nipple, adding more feeling to his pleasure.* - Fri Nov 20 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) noticed the look on her face and took it as her approval of his basing out in her. He releases another groan at just the thought alone, his hips slowly syncing with what was on his mind. He continues to squeeze and caress her breast, knowing that by now that him doing that probably did nothing to her compared to what his cock was doing. He pulls his hips back, threatens to pull completely out of her before thrusting forth before her muscles tighten back too much. This thrust inched him even closer to his base, it was clear that he was past the halfway point. That thrust forced him to actually moan from pleasure, his voice hushed and full of satisfaction.* - Fri Nov 20 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes rolled back. He thrusts more and more until finally he felt himself stop. Not at his own will but because he finally based out and her cheeks pressed against his lower stomach. He squeezes Eri's breast a bit harder, but not enough to cause immense pain. The arm he was relying on to keep him from tumbling over Eri was about to give out and that was the last thing needed right now. With his cock still based out in her and him remaining still when it came to his hips, he lean his upper body back and hook his right leg with the inside of his right elbow, lifting it up off the couch. Because he did that, Eri's left leg would slide out and cause them both to slowly go down more into the couch.

With her leg now hooked, he'd transition his position one more time so he was lying behind her. He was between her and the back of the couch. Her leg was now properly hitched up in the air, giving him more room to move his cock in and out of her asshole. He did just that. Ortho's hips begin to sway back and forth, the clapping sound of their body clashing against each other is heard. He digs his free arm under her body and went to take a handful of her breast again, pulling her in close to him as he pumped his cock in and out of her. The pace at which his hips were moving was neither fast nor hard, but it was moderate and reasonable for their first true anal fucking. Ortho place his lips behind her ear and kisses, releasing another moan of passion and lust. "E-Eri," he says through the moan. He wasn't exactly calling her to get her attention, but to just say her name since it felt fitting for the situation.* - Fri Nov 20 10:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's thrusts came and go. The pace remained the same but the dream-like state his mind was in made things feel faster than it actually was. His grip on her breast tightened just in bit when he felt her nipple harden, a good sign that she was truly enjoying him slamming his cock into her. With her leg still hooked and hoisted up in the air Ortho leans his hips in a certain angle that made his cock rampage in and out of her, taking the resemblance of a arrow flying strictly straight to the bull's-eye. Ortho's eyes were closed and his lips parted a little. He breath went from entering and exiting through his nose only to just his mouth, the heat running down Eri's neck. Every now and them, from just instincts and lust, he'd plant a kiss on her neck just to return it his mouth-breathing.

By this point his cock was throbbing and pulsing, signaling the near arrival of his orgasm. He wanted to play things out just the way they are, lust making him do nothing else but that. He had nothing to worry about when it came to where he released, this hole was safe and had no potential drawbacks. Still, he'd creek his eyes open and paid a little attention to Eri's face to see if she detected that he was coming soon and was okay with where he was going to release.* - Fri Nov 20 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: it's also -fucking amazing- feeling - Fri Nov 20 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It only took a few more thrusts to send him overboard. "Overboard" wasn't even the proper description of what happened, it was just "over". The feeling he had as his orgasm arrived wasn't really comparable. He's been fucking Eri every chance they got, mixing it with training and other forms of "business", but this orgasm took the cake. His cock gave one last throb and everything that has been waiting to make its presence felt was released. Cum blasted deep into Eri, unleashing like it was a tsunami. Rush after rush was sent and it was like there was no end to the amount of he's releasing. His body went limp. His arm slacked and her raised leg fell and met with her other. His head lowered and rested on her check as his chest heaved and he panted. There was silence from this point forth. His hips continue to sway back and forth through his orgasm, but nowhere near as much as before. It was almost slurred and instinctive; he was using her tight clench to milk as much of his cum as possible.* - Fri Nov 20 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hips slowed and slowed until eventually stopped moving. Ortho pulls Eri in tight, embracing her as they both climbed down from their high, neither of them saying anything yet. His cock eventually slips out of Eri, creating "pop" sound when it did. His body twitched every now and then and so did his member, the high he got reached a whole new height and it felt absolutely great. Their panting continued, their silence continued and they just lay there, taking things one step at a time* - Fri Nov 20 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hip was still against her cheeks so when she clenched he felt it. He doesn't say anything about it nor made any notion toward the cum that seeped out of her. The only thing he did was pull her in and kiss her neck then lay his cheek against her, keeping his eyes closed as he mildly panted.* - Fri Nov 20 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) eyes peeled open just a bit, seeing her reddened face. "It's just me and you Eri," he says in a hushed tone. He was suggesting that she didn't need to be embarrassed and just let things be. His eyes slowly closed and his breathing went back to just the inhale and exhale through his nostrils.* - Fri Nov 20 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kisses her behind her neck again. "Rest.. We'll take a shower a little later Eri. Unless you're really able to move right now."* - Fri Nov 20 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I don't think I can walk. - Fri Nov 20 11:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Then just relax with me. - Fri Nov 20 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: We've both been working a lot lately, we can just relax for ten minutes. - Fri Nov 20 11:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: On the bright side, you managed to get out of your punishment. - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm not so sure. - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hmm? Why's that? - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Everything aches inside. - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Would you..... - Fri Nov 20 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Take a bath with me? - Fri Nov 20 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why does that feel embarrassing to ask? - Fri Nov 20 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Is it bad that I was planning on doing that anyways? - Fri Nov 20 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No it makes you perfect, Sensei. - Fri Nov 20 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: B-but... I still don't think I should go without punishment..... - Fri Nov 20 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can't deny that you did a good job, Eri. Sometimes to do the 'right thing' you have to break the rules. - Fri Nov 20 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: A necessary evil. - Fri Nov 20 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs, nuzzling himself into Eri a bit more.* - Fri Nov 20 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: By tomorrow I'll forget about it. - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Are you sure you don't want to punish me? - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I tried not to smile when you sent your letter back to me. - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I didn't do a very good job. - Fri Nov 20 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Honestly? I didn't really have a punishment in mind. I was just going to put on a act like I was ma- - Fri Nov 20 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Eri. - Fri Nov 20 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I don't have to say this, but I want you to be completely honest with me about something.. - Fri Nov 20 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes opened a bit.* - Fri Nov 20 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..We've been expressing ourselves to each other for a while.. Be it sexually, visually and other ways.. - Fri Nov 20 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You do know.. that at any point.. you can call a quits.. right? Like.. I know I have your loyalty and honest.. I really appreciate that.. But I want you to always remember you have free will/. - Fri Nov 20 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why are you saying this? - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Because my love for you wants you to be in complete control of you.. - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And I once told you, I am always free. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: But to further sate your curiousity... I don't need to remind you of all the things we have promised each other... I need only tell you one thing. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: And all I want to know is that -you- know.. it'll always be like that. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I wasn't planning on telling you this... - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: When I was in Kumogakure... the Raikage was asking me questions and one of his questions led to me admitting that I would kill an innocent child if it meant saving your life, even if I knew you would not want me to kill that child. - Fri Nov 20 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. Ortho thought the Raikage was speaking figuratively, not literal. He did state to Ortho on what Eri was willing to do for him, but it was overlooked in the fit of rage. Ortho's heart starts to pound, he was lost for words. He swiftly flips Eri around so their bodies were face to face. He stares into her eyes and just remained silent.* - Fri Nov 20 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: groaned* - Fri Nov 20 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't fully comprehend what form of loyalty he had from Eri up until this point. Yes he knew that he had her loyalty on some basis, but this on a whole different level. Killing people 'of age' in this shinobi world was one thing, but to be able to end the life of someone who had yet reached that experience marker of life for the sake of someone else --- that's ultimate loyalty. Ortho was still at a loss for words, not exactly knowing how to reply to what he just heard. His eyes momentarily close; an attempt for him to just register everything within his mind. He slowly shook his head, muttering one word. "E-Eri.."

There was silence for a good three minutes until Ortho finally opens his eyes. His pitch-black pupils was now crimson red. Rather than a single tomoe hitched at the top corner of eye, there was two; the second at the lower corner. A black ring around a single black inner iris connects these two teardrops. Ortho stares at Eri and nodded.

"I.. won't question you again.. forgive me.."* - Fri Nov 20 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. What he saw while looking at Eri was deeper. Like his understanding of why she walked this path with him was clear. Like his understanding why when he fucks up and asks the wrong questions at the wrong time and she stayed patient with him was clear. Everything that they had going on made sense and was clear. He releases a sigh, allowing the clouds of his mind to clear.

"T-Thanks.. Eri.."* - Fri Nov 20 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) returned the quick peck. He blinks a few times, continuing to stare at Eri with his newly developed eyes. Her words snapped him out of his trans, but not completely. He sighs and smirks, slowly shaking his head. "You're getting soft on my Eri," he teased. He manages to look away just briefly, enough for him to deactivate his ocular prowess. An enlightened look lingered on his face for the most part, but generally he just had a smirk.* - Fri Nov 20 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Perhaps what I said was enough for him to know... - Fri Nov 20 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grew wider. "Alright, alright I owe you one. You got me on that," he manages to sigh through his brief chuckling. His eyes subtly lower as he glares at Eri. He's been so sentimental to her lately and he had used the 'love' word more than even he would've predicted if right now was like three months ago. His chuckling dies down and silence came from him; he just laid there and gazed at her.* - Fri Nov 20 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's smirk grew to a genuine smile. It crept on his face so slow, but he had no form of strength to prevent it from showing. "Just.. Feels like the right time to say something, but.. I don't know. Sometimes saying something too much makes it stale."* - Fri Nov 20 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shrugs a bit. "Maybe I'll hold off on saying it.. I think you get the point by now. I mean.. if I remember right.. you said Ortho is crazy. The last thing we need is a plain.. stale.. crazy Ortho. Right?"* - Fri Nov 20 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyebrows rose. "Uhh, yeah. Why?"* - Fri Nov 20 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times and opens his mouth to persist. He shook his head and allowed the situation to just die down.. verbally. Ortho nods his head, "sure. Whenever you're ready.."* - Fri Nov 20 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pouted and grumbled something under his breath. He sits up and starts moving around to prepare to lift Eri up and carry her to the bathroom.* - Fri Nov 20 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times, not understanding what she meant at first. What he grumbled was something slick that he knew he'd pay for later. He knew that she had strong feelings for him and didn't plan on pressing the issue. Instead of winging the situation and running with it he decides to speak up, "don't worry about that.. I'm not in a rush to hear it from you."* - Fri Nov 20 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then why did you just grumble like a bear?~ - Fri Nov 20 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ----- - Fri Nov 20 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So umm.. - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: How you feeling? - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Nah nahhhhhhhhhh.~ - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Tell me.~ - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Shit shit shit.. - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) scratches the back of his head. "Let's not do thissss.~"* - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why not?~ - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Oh.. because umm. - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Listen let's just take the shower and go from there. - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Bath, mister, bath. - Fri Nov 20 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) grumbles something again, but covers it up with a cough.* - Fri Nov 20 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ---- - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Okay, okay! - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Wait wait wait. - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets think about this.. - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
