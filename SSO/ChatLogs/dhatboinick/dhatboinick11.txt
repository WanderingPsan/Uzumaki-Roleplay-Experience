"Well, honey.. It's been forever since I've seen you, I'm not even going to get a hello kiss and hug?"* - Mon Sep 28 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We both know if I don't lose my identity, you'll be able to find and kill me easily. - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I played this game with Zetsumo for years. I always wanted to run away but knew it was suicide of some kind or another no matter what I did. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either I lose my name...or.... - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I die. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Keep both. I've come to an understanding that kind gestures are mistaken for trickery amongst you mortals.. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. I was just thinking about your immortality. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've started to understand you, too. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And Zetsumo. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your immortality...it makes you unfamiliar with the games normal shinobi play. The lies that are made with good intentions. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You have no fear so... - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You have no need. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I have fears. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Just not shinobi-based fears. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm even willing to state my fears.. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Unless they don't interest you of course. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't. I'd rather you know that I have no way of harming you. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Much safer I'm sure. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which makes me wonder....why you might try to kill me. Thought about it and...you have no reason to bring an army to do that. - Mon Sep 28 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll skip to the point though. - Mon Sep 28 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have no delusions about ever being hokage again. - Mon Sep 28 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like to be a Konoha shinobi, though. - Mon Sep 28 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't trust Niza. Probably a snake like me, for political reasons. To keep his village safe. - Mon Sep 28 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That and I suspect you might have him bought in some way or another. - Mon Sep 28 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure is...Kirigakure. Amegakure is a nightmare probably. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Probably.. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I love the assumptions you shinobi make. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's amusing. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've long since took over Amegakure.. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hence the reason I spoke of celebrating there for Kilm's promotion.. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wanted to give him the leader role there. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Whilst having you keep the leader role here. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've placed two-thousand of my shinobi there, while buying two thousand more for you.. - Mon Sep 28 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: An alliance between you two.. - Mon Sep 28 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And the two villages. - Mon Sep 28 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That.. was my plan. - Mon Sep 28 23:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. Like I said in my letter. We really should've communicated more. - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's hard to get you alone. You're always so busy. - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With you having so much power over me, and me being hokage... - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And us not communicating.... - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. It leads to an awful lot of confusion. - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly why I'm worried about making a council like everyone keeps asking for. A council with actual authority. - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Huh. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A relative of a.. close friend of yours. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm has no relatives. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Does he...? - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or at least...I don't think he does. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No, it's not Kilm.. - Mon Sep 28 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I admit. Bragging about killing him wasn't my brightest idea. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanted people to think....well. I was lying. Again. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I won't disclose any names, that's not important at this point.. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For a force of immense magnitude is coming for you. - Tue Sep 29 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something tells me you won't hear an explanation for Orakuru's death. - Tue Sep 29 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's none of my business. - Tue Sep 29 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No point in hearing it if trust and honesty won't be given to me in full for my loyal deeds. - Tue Sep 29 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) supplied a shrug.* - Tue Sep 29 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Such is life, no? - Tue Sep 29 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm and I will head to Amegakure then. - Tue Sep 29 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The force is from the person that requested your death.. - Tue Sep 29 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now that my way of life is secured, I guess there's nothing else I wanted to talk about. - Tue Sep 29 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: *sigh*.. - Tue Sep 29 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I feel like I'm going to get my name tainted for this.. - Tue Sep 29 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) shrugged once more, turning on his heels and heading back where he came from.* - Tue Sep 29 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, well...You surprised me..I fainted.. - Tue Sep 29 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: But..We can try again...If you'd like.. - Tue Sep 29 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Like you said, you're not ready. - Tue Sep 29 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) walks over to the desk and takes a seat.* - Tue Sep 29 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: But I am! - Tue Sep 29 00:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times, not allowing the sudden outburst from Yumiko to faze him. He leans back into his chair, folds his arms across his chest and looks up at the female. Just as he went to respond, Erebus took notice of to the entering shinobi. "How can I help you, kid..?"* - Tue Sep 29 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He's not around.. - Tue Sep 29 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm...Damn. - Tue Sep 29 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I was told he was good at Ninjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You know anyone else that's good at it? - Tue Sep 29 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Eventually, we're gonna have to talk about this... - Tue Sep 29 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) looked back over at Yumiko.* - Tue Sep 29 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. don't see how I'm treating you like trash. - Tue Sep 29 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Don't give me that look... I'm just asking for a chance to redeem myself..If I say I can handle it, then I can. - Tue Sep 29 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I don't know what to tell you.. - Tue Sep 29 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Like.. - Tue Sep 29 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's no big deal.. - Tue Sep 29 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: You just don't see it do you?.. I can take it, because you're the only man who can please me and not die or suffer from the poison in my body.. - Tue Sep 29 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So please, once more sometime? - Tue Sep 29 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When? - Tue Sep 29 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Whenever you'd please. - Tue Sep 29 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) remained seated, his eyes continued to fixate themselves on Yumiko. That, however, changed when Asteroth walked in. As if already knowing what the blonde wanted from walking into the mansion, Erebus leans back into the chair and dug his hands into his pockets. After a few seconds of digging, he'd pull out a wad of cash and sighed. "Alright, how much do I owe you for the meals those three had?"

Annoyance could clearly be heard in Erebus' voice, but it was obvious that it wasn't toward Asteroth's arrival. It wasn't until she spoke about needing something to do when Erebus got the hint. He diverted his eyes back to the desk before him and started searching through the massive cluster of papers. It didn't take Erebus long to finally find what he was looking for; a mission. With no words being said, Erebus would wrap the paper work into a scroll-like container and chuck it toward the female.

"There. No time limit on its completion, just get it done."* - Tue Sep 29 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: After I handle them, you're going to prove yourself.. - Tue Sep 29 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You're doing all the work though, I'm a bit lazy today. - Tue Sep 29 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Show. . a vistor. . . around -- Why me? - Tue Sep 29 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: F-fine. - Tue Sep 29 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: . . . . - Tue Sep 29 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Hi. - Tue Sep 29 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as Rosa took a step forward. This was his first time seeing her face so he was skeptic of who she was and what her abilities might be, but this wasn't the time to find any of that out. He leans forward, places his elbows on the desk and allowed his palms to rub his face. "How may I help you," he asks through a muffle.* - Tue Sep 29 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) dug through the piles of papers, repeating the process he did for Asteroth and chucks the end result to Rosa. "Knock yourself out, Rosa."* - Tue Sep 29 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So much work you do... - Tue Sep 29 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) heard the comment of Yumiko, but couldn't answer it at the moment. His eyes wander off to Sabo, fixating on the males frame. "Good to still see you around. Thought you'd haul ass too."* - Tue Sep 29 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Haul ass? For what? - Tue Sep 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: This is the first village I've seen without idiots runnin' back and forth. - Tue Sep 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph, understood. - Tue Sep 29 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You need a mission or something? - Tue Sep 29 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I was actually gonna ask if you've got a blacksmith around here. - Tue Sep 29 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Depends if you're asking for a blackmarket type or official Gezo type. - Tue Sep 29 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Eh...I 'dunno much about either...which one of'em could hook me up with something 'special.' - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Give me time, I'll see what I can do. - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In the mean time.. - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's attention once again averted back to the cluster of papers before him. Being Hokage, or known leader of the village, was a busy occupation, but it was doable. After a few grunts and sighs whilst searching, Erebus finds a free mission and suppled it to Sabo. "Entertain yourself with that.."* - Tue Sep 29 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: You must have a very high position next to our leader for our people to always bother you. - Tue Sep 29 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, yeah. - Tue Sep 29 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You could say that. - Tue Sep 29 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Hm, that sounds like a hard job..Not trying to be Queen of the Obvious. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Where did Erebus go wrong? How did he go from the God of Death to some mission giver for these upcoming ninjas in this shinobi world? Nothing was really 'wrong' with what Erebus was doing, but the stress of being the leader of an entire village wasn't really what Erebus wanted. Still, however, he'll tough through until he found someone to take his place.

On other news, with Yumiko standing by, Erebus visually skims over her body. His hands trails over the desk and toward Yumiko's frame, taking a firm grasp off of her ass.* - Tue Sep 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) gave a nonchalant shrug, leaning back into the chair and looking up at Yumiko. "Maybe.. Show me what you got."* - Tue Sep 29 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet and paced around the desk, expecting Yumiko to follow his lead.* - Tue Sep 29 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) walks over to one of the beds, allowing himself to strip off his clothing with each step. By time he was to lay down, he only wore his undergarment.* - Tue Sep 29 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) securely positioned himself on the bed. It wasn't long after when Yumiko found herself straddling Erebus' lower half of and flaunting her wondrous breasts. Erebus, being the male he was, took joy in seeing her squeeze them together and comfortably showcase her jugs. He had to admit, he was planning on keeping an expression that lacked amusement just to see how far Yumiko would take things. Despite his facial expression, though, Yumiko's stimulation of his member was working; Erebus' cock was rising.* - Tue Sep 29 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's member pulsed at the kiss, a subtle reaction compared to what was coming next. His rod was almost at full attention, but his eyes continued to grope Yumiko's body, taking in as much of the sight as he could. Erebus reaches forth as Yumiko guided the tip of his dick to her secondary hole; he cups her pussy, using two fingers to stimulate her clit. He already knew what was coming next, and rather than making it painful for her, Erebus allowed her natural lubricant to pour down so he transfer it to his shaft. Don't get Erebus wrong, it was taking a lot for him not to thrust his hips up and ram his member into her.* - Tue Sep 29 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || Lust finally took over Erebus, forcing him to release the first grunt of enjoyment for today's session. Feeling the remaining of his shaft slip into Yumiko provided him with nothing but sheer pleasure. Erebus' eyes subconsciously rolling to the back of his head as he slides his hands over her waist, resting them on her cheeks and separating them out of instincts. After a few swirls of Yumiko's hips, Erebus' eyes reopen as set their attention on her bust. He gestures for her to move her arms so he can see them jiggle and bounce in response to her riding; it was obvious he was both a titty man and ass man.* - Tue Sep 29 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yo-You're doing great.. - Tue Sep 29 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) had no reason to hold back. He knew that his limit was being reached soon and it would be a shame if he doesn't please the woman he's having intercourse with. With a bit more determination, Erebus would apply Yumiko's thrusts with his own, finding their unique rhythm and slamming his hips into her as she descended on to his member. With her kissing and nibbling on his neck to add more stimulation, Erebus would return the favor by reaching his hands in between their bodies to cup and caress Yumiko's bust. His focus point, for his hands, was her nipples. If he was going to climax, she was too; that was a must.* - Tue Sep 29 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's head arched back as their hips slammed together. Yumiko's tightening walls and Erebus' pulsating member was the perfect match to this perfect ending; both their climaxing hitting. Of course, Yumiko's bodily poison would kill off Erebus' sperm in a hurry, which made things that much better. A groan of lust came from Erebus as he moved his hands over to Yumiko's ass and squeezed, riding their climaxes out.* - Tue Sep 29 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A-Alright.. - Tue Sep 29 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You redeemed yourself.. - Tue Sep 29 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Be a good girl and lick me clean when you have the energy. - Tue Sep 29 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Y-yes.. - Tue Sep 29 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Thank you.. - Tue Sep 29 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) lays his head back, allowing Yumiko to do her thing. Naturally, despite him just cumming, Erebus' member would start to stiffen. In return, to show that he wanted her to continue this until his next arrival, Erebus placed his hand behind Yumiko's head and adding more pressure to her deep throating.* - Tue Sep 29 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Good girl, good girl. - Tue Sep 29 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) realized that her ability to orally pleasure was superb. It didn't take long for him to meet his second max in the eyes and easily lose the battle, but not without getting as much as he could. Just as his second coming dawned in, Erebus would apply full pressure from Yumiko's throat, slamming his member down her throat and keeping it there until he was done.* - Tue Sep 29 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's climax finally finished, the pressure on Yumiko's throat easing up greatly. Erebus wasn't a man of many words, so to commend Yumiko for her work he simply caressed her head and face, allowing his mind and body to relax from the back to back climaxes.* - Tue Sep 29 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) allowed Yumiko to rest her head on his chest while be subconsciously groped one of her breasts; they were amazing after all. "You earned yourself a good drink."* - Tue Sep 29 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm..? Proud..? Yeah, I'm honored.. - Tue Sep 29 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: To be the first to enter your secondary.. You didn't -have- to let me. - Tue Sep 29 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Well..To be fair, I said I was not afraid of anything.. - Tue Sep 29 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: So I faced the fear.. - Tue Sep 29 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Came to see it was pleasing..Tehe. - Tue Sep 29 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Good, good. - Tue Sep 29 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Wouldn't want you screaming rape at a later date. - Tue Sep 29 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Maybe I should..Just to see what fear looks like in your eyes~...But then that'd bring nothing to not even a laugh, but shame for such a lie.. - Tue Sep 29 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph.. - Tue Sep 29 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Even then, I wouldn't have fear. - Tue Sep 29 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd simply play along to the lie, for even then I wouldn't know if it'd make you happy to see my suffer. - Tue Sep 29 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Oh?.. - Tue Sep 29 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A mother..? - Tue Sep 29 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes...A mother~  - Tue Sep 29 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: And you...The father? - Tue Sep 29 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd answer you honestly.. and let you know that bearing a child with me is the last thing you'd want to do.. I've made a name for myself and my name will most likely carry on to my offspring.. - Tue Sep 29 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Who's to tell what the outcome would be..? - Tue Sep 29 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Who's to say, they'd know that you're the father ,hm? - Tue Sep 29 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than endangering you and the child, I rather see you find happiness with another spous- - Tue Sep 29 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: If it is safety that worries you. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: This is the shinobi world, Yumiko.. Information gets out. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, but only fools seem to fail at that. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: And those fools..Always, end up..Dead..Aren't I right?..Master.. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) sat up, giving Yumiko a quick kiss on the cheek before carefully placing her on the bed next to him. A sigh was released toward Yumiko's last comment; not at the idea of having a child, but the risk at hand. Still, however, Erebus gave the female the benefit of the doubt and simply nodded. Upon doing so, he'd gather his clothing, placed it on and head for the exit. "I must attend to this meeting. We 'will' finish this conversation later.."* - Tue Sep 29 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hey. - Tue Sep 29 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The smell of death and blood almost instantly filled the air, forcing Hideki's breath to become a chore rather than second nature. The eerie clinking of chain could be heard becoming more and more audible as the seconds float by. A sudden gust of wind swoops the area, and in its trail was Erebus; dressed in his infamous black, hoodied, cloak and scythes dangling form around his neck.* - Tue Sep 29 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd like some more clarification.. - Tue Sep 29 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 29 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Why was it you want Katsune dead again..? - Tue Sep 29 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't get me wrong, my best is what you're getting. - Tue Sep 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Because she killed one of my clan members. - Tue Sep 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: But as I stated before, I need to know what water I'm swimming in- - Tue Sep 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Tue Sep 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I recently got a scroll from a bird describing that Ushinawa, Orakuru and.. a special other.. wielded a certain set of unique eyes. - Tue Sep 29 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 29 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And allied with that.. special other.. was an attempt to dethrone Katsune from the Hokage position.. - Tue Sep 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And from there, said.. special other.. will take that spot.. - Tue Sep 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Special other? - Tue Sep 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So her death is moreorless an attempt at power.. rather than- - Tue Sep 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Tue Sep 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who's the speical other? - Tue Sep 29 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Remember.. Snitching is a sin in my eyes. - Tue Sep 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes, I know. - Tue Sep 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Speical other.. Maybe he means Ko-Ko? - Tue Sep 29 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Hey? - Tue Sep 29 12:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hello. - Tue Sep 29 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Um.. - Tue Sep 29 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) thinks: Hokage..? - Tue Sep 29 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) thinks: Or..? - Tue Sep 29 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Just reporting for duty. - Tue Sep 29 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Tue Sep 29 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: State your name and abilities. - Tue Sep 29 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see - Tue Sep 29 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ..Yup. - Tue Sep 29 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. I'll establish a squad for you, but keep in mind that you're not apart of a traditional village.. - Tue Sep 29 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Things are run differently here. - Tue Sep 29 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll explain everything in detail at a later date. - Tue Sep 29 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Right. - Tue Sep 29 12:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: What would you like me to do for you now? - Tue Sep 29 12:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're stating you're a Kushiyose Specialist in training. - Tue Sep 29 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Work toward becoming master until I have your squad set up and missions lined up. - Tue Sep 29 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Alright then. - Tue Sep 29 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Anything else? - Tue Sep 29 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No, nothing else. - Tue Sep 29 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Okay. - Tue Sep 29 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Sooo. - Tue Sep 29 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) leaned back into his chair* - Tue Sep 29 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. .  - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: 'Mission is a strong word. .' - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Huh? - Tue Sep 29 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: <*Perks a brow*> Just commenting on the busy work I was given. I came looking for extra payment. Got stuck babysitting some senior citizen. - Tue Sep 29 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || There was obvious skepticism when it came to Asteroth's arrival. Erebus leans forward and places both his elbows upon the surface of the desk before him, loosely tying his fingers together at the ends of his arms. A stare was given to the blonde female; not of anger or annoyance, but sheer curiosity. Out of all the files provided to him, Erebus had little to no records for Asteroth; not that that was a problem, but information on all the shinobi, civilians and merchants is what Erebus sought. There was no reason to speculate that Asteroth was an intruder --- there was no reason for an intruder to hold a day job whilst accepting missions on the side. Nevertheless, however, Erebus' curiosity got the best of him.

With a slight turn of his head, after going irresponsive to Asteroth's verbal introduction, Erebus places his temporary focus on Valencia White. "Excuse us for a moment; I'll be sure to notify you when I have proper plans for you." His voice was low, almost whisper-ish. Still though, it was comprehendible and audible. Whether or not Valencia desired visual content, Erebus would grant himself another steady view of the blonde.* - Tue Sep 29 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ... - Tue Sep 29 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Right. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: I'll be out. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The gaze given to Asteroth was relentless. It was as if Erebus was searching to pierce through the very fabric of her personal space, tear through her skin, rip through muscle, break through bones and take grasp of her soul; all in an attempt to see where Asteroth stood. Erebus' audience was requested the day prior, so it was only fitting that he no longer placed that on the back burner and acknowledged it fully. You could say that Erebus was almost anxious to hold this meeting --- gathering information was practically his fetish; it was information that kept him on top of the large mountain he reigned on.* - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || A sigh came from Erebus. He couldn't honestly say he didn't some-what expect this at some point and time, he just didn't know from whom. He didn't consider himself boasting about his gift from Lord Jashin, but knew that he was nowhere near modest about it. If anything, he talked about it nonchalantly; as if it was merely casual conversation. More or less, skepticism was expected from anyone that knew anything about religion; Asteroth was a result of this. One thing she had been completely correct about, however, was the fact that no true Jashinist would allow a false proclaimer to live; this, what's at hand, wasn't that case.

Erebus' body pulsed; a quick grasp of one of the scythe hanging around his neck was made. Without saying a word, Erebus would place the bladed edge of the scythe against his left wrist and slice; blood gushed from the wound and spewed all over the place. His eyes remained fixated on Asteroth, not breaking for even a solitary second.* - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || It seemed as though Erebus' demonstrations were becoming more and more frequent now a days; surely this could be viewed as problematic, but to Erebus it was merely these mortals witnessing their deaths unravel. Normally, with another Jashinist around, Erebus would place them on high pedistals, but that isn't necessarily the case right now. The less Erebus knew the more of a skeptic he became. Asteroth is as much of a stranger now as she was when they first met. Still, benefit of the doubt was given to her, no real reason to question her loyalty and reserves right now; that didn't mean Erebus didn't have questions in general though.

"Seeing as though you're a fellow Jashinist, then you must understand my skepticism. Of course I'm not going to question your loyalty to.. our.. Lord, but I do desire knowledge of your capabilities."* - Tue Sep 29 14:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The situation at hand was truly tense. You had the immortal standing off with the infamous Doujutsu god, two titans that have revolutionized their respective eras in the name of their respective cause. As a result, they harbored the passion and authority to do as they please, when they please. However, at this point and time, the God of Death would reign hell down on each of his advisories. Now, don't get Erebus wrong; he considered Ushinawa an ally to death, but that wasn't until the word of betrayal reached his ears.

As a result, with no remorse, Erebus took grasp of his two scythes and prepared for battle. Now, Erebus faced off with Ushinawa's ocular powers before; at the time, Erebus didn't know what the doujutsu did, but after being informed by Katsune, a battle plan was prepared. That being said, like the true follower of Jashin Erebus is, a single sound came from his gullet; the end result being a force of six-thousand military shinobi summoning themselves within the mansion, the garden leading to the mansion and quite frankly, every possible square inch to assure proper security.

Erebus, himself, paced around the desk; his eyes continued to fixate itself over Ushinawa's frame. "I'm a man of honesty, loyalty and understanding. I observe, I analyze and I make my move. Hanabi's death was not on a whim, but because she tempted fate by attempting to out run her death; but as the God of Death and a loyal follower of my Lord, I assure you Ushinawa.. Even with eyes that see all, ears that hear all, tongue that taste all, feet that out run all.. Death has no equal." The information provided to Erebus by Katsune did nothing but help the Jashinist take full advantage; he refused to be eye contact with the Uchiha.

No sudden attack was made thus yet, just the dialogue and arrival of six-thousand shinobi.* - Tue Sep 29 18:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) found himself wandering off from the mansion, endlessly walking down the streets of Konohagakure while bound to his thoughts. A lot of things transpired in the recent days, a lot that could easily reshape the foundation of the village. It's not like Erebus was worried, but he just hated watching all his hard work and investments crumble before him. Still though, he kept his chin up and allowed the tricks of the shinobi world to take full jabs at his immortal chin. That was actually the only thing he could do at this point and time, no one was said living amongst mortals were easy. Hell; even is Lord Jashin foresaw this, not even he would be able to comprehend the trickery that manifest amongst these ninja. Such is life, no?

Before Erebus knew it, he managed to stroll his way into a garden with a single pond and exotic herbal life. Off to the side of the pond were Suitengu, and child that have shown nothing but literacy and intelligence of his surroundings. This was a commendable feat, for even Erebus had trouble from time to time when it came to understanding their mindset; not that Erebus couldn't overcome the differences, but merely understanding was becoming more of a chore rather than a natural way of life. Still, there must've been some way for things to fly by easier. Maybe just sitting back for a while and letting things play out, but even he could see faults in that.

An audible sigh came from Erebus as he stared off into the distance; his pupils could be seen fixated on Suitengu, but it was obvious that he wasn't really looking at the boy. Rather, he was looking off into space while using Suitengu as the telescope. Erebus wasn't aware that he sighed, or even how loud the sigh was; he was just aware that he was in a garden and Suitengu was as well, then his mind drifted off.* - Tue Sep 29 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) stood at five-feet nine inches. He built wasn't bulky, but it was nowhere near scrawny. Erebus was known for his ability to withstand the strongest of Ninjutsu without batting an eye. His skin, from what could be viewed through the chain mail he picked up in Kirigakure, was riddled in scars; all self-inflicted. One thing about Erebus, however, that often stood out was the two scythes that hung from around his neck; the two scythes were connected by a thick chain. One thing about Erebus that really set apart from others was the scent he carried; the smell of utter Death and overflowing bucket of Blood. When Erebus was prepared for battle, the intensity of his aroma increased ten-fold.

"Huh..?" It was clear that Erebus was still lost in his thoughts, only able to muster up a sound effect in response to Suitengu. He was aware of what was asked, but the sudden transition from what he already set his mind on to the proper answer for the child left him in a slight daze. "Uhh, yeah.. It was fine. How are you doing...?" Erebus' reply was subtle and it was clear that he just threw whatever first made sense in his head out through his mouth and hoped for the best.* - Tue Sep 29 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The mentioning of Baen caught Erebus' undivided attention. Not saying that Suitengu was being ignored beforehand, but now that someone of extreme importance was being mentioned, it was only natural that he was aware. Erebus' eyes narrowed a bit at the question, as if he was trying to remember exactly where and how they met.

"Ahh, yes. Baen and I met in Kirigakure a few days before your fathers' death. Baen was actually the only one that didn't try to take my life right off the bat because of my beliefs; this was before I became immortal."* - Tue Sep 29 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: The way you worded that leads me to believe that Baen is certainly a powerful man. Considering your own capabilities, even without the immortality. Hm..Do you think I should be expecting results from him? - Tue Sep 29 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Baen is as trustworthy as they come. - Tue Sep 29 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Father thought two spaces ahead.. but in this world, I can only be seen to try to see no less than three spaces ahead.. I need all of my bases covered to get what I want. - Tue Sep 29 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If I was forced to replace my immortality with Baen's loyalty, I'd be just as efficient. - Tue Sep 29 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That says alot about him. Thank you.  - Tue Sep 29 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There's one thing I've learned whilst being in this world of mortals. - Tue Sep 29 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There are some that think like their status --- mortals, and their are some that think above their statu --- immortals. - Tue Sep 29 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Baen is one of those hotheads that move with the wind on purpose while being a single flame.. - Tue Sep 29 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Dangerous..? Yes. Efficient..? Yes. Reliable..? Yes. - Tue Sep 29 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That.. is just what I wanted to hear. Thank you for your honesty, I've noticed that most shinobi tend to lie more often than not in these times. Many of the people in Kirigakure to be specific. - Tue Sep 29 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Also; I haven't seen Taiga around, he is a Konohagakure shinobi, isn't he?  - Tue Sep 29 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Come to think of it.. - Tue Sep 29 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I haven't seen him since the bounty was made public. - Tue Sep 29 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So he's scared then?.. That also means he doesn't trust you or I, I suppose thats good. On his part anyways.. - Tue Sep 29 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: -- .. Hm. - Tue Sep 29 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What is your opinion on Ushinawa? - Tue Sep 29 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ushinawa..? I don't know too much about him, honestly.. I've spoken with him and form alliances with him, but recent information makes it seem like that alliance is nothing more than a "get power quick" scheme. - Tue Sep 29 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I've known him for a while, I'd even go as far as to consider him on my friendly side along side you and a few others. He has gone out of his way to help me at times, but again. Not everyone is trustworthy. - Tue Sep 29 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I can't supply you an answer without being biased in some way, shape or form. - Tue Sep 29 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Then share your bias with me. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: As I said, potential betrayal has been placed in my ears, so I personally seek no reason to have ties with him until I clear out the wax. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That being said, allowing him in on such a delicate matter will led to destruction. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Keep in mind, Ushinawa is still a shinobi within this shinobi world. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. So would it be safe to assume you don't want anything to do with him, for the time being? - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Still, I wish not to get in between your relationship with him. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: The man was the second person to see my eyes, when they came to be. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hm.. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What do you think If I kept the details vague, and simply put a bounty on someone specific to see his reaction to the job itself?  - Tue Sep 29 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That'd be doable, but I suggest making the bounty for the person as a whole. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than the person's eyes. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Thats what I was getting at. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Edge or Taiga. Both people I want, but I only know one of their skillsets. - Tue Sep 29 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Taiga seems relatively simple to take care of; I believe even I could have handled it if I really went for it.. - Tue Sep 29 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So that leaves Edge. - Tue Sep 29 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Send Ushinawa after Edge. - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Leave Taiga to Baen. - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Yes.. that seems like the best idea.  - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... Interesting. - Tue Sep 29 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Erebus, you yourself are quite acquinted with death. Right? - Tue Sep 29 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What do you think about the possibility of someone to control the dead? Is that plausible? - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Control.. the dead..? - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very much, yes - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I mean.. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah.. I can see it happening. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It seems Ushinawa is lead to believe that Edge may have capabilities to do such. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: He has also agreed to do what he can to bring Edge in. - Tue Sep 29 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Regardless, Baen also knows about Edge having what I want as well.. so I could care less which one brings him in. As long as he's brought. - Tue Sep 29 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood. - Tue Sep 29 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Just push Ushinawa more toward Edge. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That's exactly what I've done. Having given him a single target, whereas Baen has several to choose from. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What about you? Rather than what I'm planning. Anything you are looking forward too? - Tue Sep 29 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hmm.. So, what are your plans now? Take back charge of Konoha? Continue to stay at Amegakure? - Wed Sep 30 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Both. - Wed Sep 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You plan on being at two places at the same time?  - Wed Sep 30 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I plan on placing figure heads while I work in the shadows. - Wed Sep 30 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I best operate when I'm able to observe thoroughly. - Wed Sep 30 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 30 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Are you going to keep Katsune as the figure head for Konoha, then? - Wed Sep 30 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Most likely not. - Wed Sep 30 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd have to train someone else to do it. - Wed Sep 30 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Have you decided on whom? I have to say I'm interested in meeting them if I had not met them yet. - Wed Sep 30 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I actually don't have anyone in mind at the moment. - Wed Sep 30 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hmm. Okay.  - Wed Sep 30 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Do you still have guards checking who enters and leaves the village or no? - Wed Sep 30 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I do. - Wed Sep 30 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You wish to leave? - Wed Sep 30 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: No. I just want to know if Taiga had completely left the village or if I am just having a hard time finding him. - Wed Sep 30 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: This place is currently the best for me to be at, for now.. - Wed Sep 30 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know how, but I'm sure Taiga has left by now. - Wed Sep 30 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He's weak, but not an idiot. - Wed Sep 30 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see.. I had him fight with that large man, the one that wasn't too bright the other day. He isn't too strong at all, as you said. But I didn't expect Taiga to be thinking ahead either. Hm.. - Wed Sep 30 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The only thing we can do is check each village. - Wed Sep 30 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Yes, but how. I'm not too keen on traveling to each village myself, or asking Baen to do it either. I'm trying to make this as easy for him as possible, I don't want any setbacks. And I assume you're busy taking care of the village for the moment, or atleast finding someone who can. - Wed Sep 30 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So that leaves the most common question, to question the question. And that is; How.  - Wed Sep 30 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I could call in a favor from someone.. but that'd involve releasing more information to even more people. I don't want to have to worry about everyone not spreading the news. - Wed Sep 30 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll take care of Taiga myself if Baen isn't able to. - Wed Sep 30 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Baen is the man to get the job done.. he isn't some mere scout.. Ushinawa is already busy, Seisuke is too vague for me being allianced with a group I still have no information on.. Hm..-- - Wed Sep 30 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I thought you didn't have time for this, and that you were busy with finding a figurehead for the village. - Wed Sep 30 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I stand by a code, Suitengu. - Wed Sep 30 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I may be a religious brute, but when someone close needs me, I'll be there. - Wed Sep 30 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || It's sickening how the shinobi of this world treat religious figureheads. Constantly passing judgments, constantly placing the figureheads under an investigative spotlight; all in the name to deem the figurehead wrong before a trail was even hosted. It's sickening how the shinobi of this world are able to pass judgment of these figureheads, but as soon as the figureheads do the same, they're executed; assassinated; bifurcated. It's sickening how religious figureheads have to praise their lords in the confinements of their mind, for it'll only end in their death if a single word is said out loud. It's sickening how religious figureheads are treated all together. Soon however, all of that will change.

Erebus stood before Suitengu, preaching the word of loyalty. It's not the type of loyalty where you have no choice but to be compliant or your life is over; it's the type of loyalty where both parties have free will to do, say and think as they please. It's just natural loyalty. For the most part, Suitengu rubbed off on Erebus. The boy went from the unherded sheep, to the newest member of the wolf pack. Erebus took it upon himself to hand pick Suitengu and guides him to greatness within this shinobi world; all to see how, why and when Suitengu will use the tools given to him and build himself up.  The words provided to Suitengu were sincere; it couldn't be heard in Erebus' voice, but it was obvious.

"You only have two things in this world: loyalty and honesty. Loyalty to one another and loyalty to your own cause, honesty to you're the ones you're loyal to and honesty to yourself that your cause is what's best for you. Stitch these words into your head, Suitengu; they'll help you find your way."* - Wed Sep 30 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. The question given to him by Suitengu took Erebus by surprise, something that rarely happened. It's not that the question made Erebus rethink the code he lives by, but the fact that the question was so delicate that a misword could easily break the motto in general. Erebus took a few seconds to think.

"No man, immortal or not, can effectively walk the path of his cause without companionship. Loyalty is as powerful as ones will to defend and fight for his cause, for a cause is stronger when the loyalty you have for others and the loyalty others have for you bond together; all in the name to help you stay on your path. Two different causes could be at the end of the same path for two people. The loyalty they provide for one another will help them stay on that path and force them to not stray away in the wrong direction. They have different causes, but still.. Loyalty bound them to the same path. It's a complicated thing, but as you live it you'll understanding."* - Wed Sep 30 09:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Do you have any short-term causes, Erebus? - Wed Sep 30 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I do. - Wed Sep 30 09:13:23 2015
