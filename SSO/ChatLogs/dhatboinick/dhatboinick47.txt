<br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) Was this karma? Was this fate making Ortho pay back all the lives he took? Was this some sick joke for whatever gods were in control of these types of things, or did the Grim Reaper get promoted to Soul Snatcher? Right about now Ortho felt empty. His head was beating, his brain was working and his lungs were expanding and retracting with ease, but he felt hallow. After everything he has done to protect Nina and assure that she had a safe place to live she goes to the one place he forbade. Who was responsible for this all and why did it happen now of all time?

He was pulled into a hug, his body acting like some ragdoll to Eri's small frame. His body remained slumped and near-lifeless, but his breaths continued. His slow tempo breaths and his leaking eyes, life was still in his body and his soul was still intact. "I told her.. no matter where she.. was.. I'd protect her," he said in a hushed tone. "Why am I.. such a failure to the people.. I care for the most..?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Wasn't it his fault? The last conversation him and his sister had wasn't even a legit conversation, it was more of them cursing one another out while throwing some sentimental apologies in an attempt to calm each other down. Still, Nina chose to go to Sunagakure. Ortho's last knowledge, from Nina, of where she was going was her house in Kumogakure, but now look. It's like all his work was in vain. He did all this, originally, to give Nina a place to eat, sleep train and repeat. It doesn't matter now. Nina's gone and so is the reasoning behind this village.

Ortho, deep down, knew that Shinkogakure is more successful than he originally thought it'd be. Deep down Ortho knew that even though Nina was gone the village could easily progress, but this pain in his heart was too much. This loss of a loved one, after he was forewarned, is what really tore him apart. The events leading to Nina's departure, the events that caused her to go into surgery and the events following the surgery --- three main factors and if the first was nonexistent the rest would've fade from the history books.

"..Revenge.. don't even seem worth it.. It's all.. my fault.. The last thing I said.. to her.. was for her to grow up.. and stop bein.. spoiled.."* - Tue Nov 17 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "There's.. nothing more.. that can be done.. I've failed.."

He brings the bottle of sake to his mouth and takes a swig. "Nothing.. makes sense anymore.. Everyone I trusted and loved the most is gone.. I only have you left.. and after the other night I don't even know I'm keeping you-.."

Of course. Ortho had to go and say the absolute wrong thing. He had to go and speak without thinking and just set off another person. Now what? Eri's going to leave the village, wander off and get hurt? Then Ortho is going to be forced to stay where he is until a messenger bird comes in saying that Eri is dead? Was lightning about to strike the same spot twice? Was there going to be two thunderclaps from one lightning bolt? Was the horseshoe going to split in half? Right down the middle?

He sighs. Eri's words were true and her questions stung him deep. What he said in the street was real messed up and as inaccurate as it can get. He can't say he regrets saying it because it's all said and done, but emotions were running wild and the death of Nina was still eachoing through his mind..

"I-I.. I'm sor-.. I didn't mean that, Eri-.. You know I didn't mean that.."* - Tue Nov 17 11:11:08 2015

There was truth behind Eri's words, not matter how blunt and straightforward they were. Nina was gone and there's nothing he could do about it, he just had to accept that fact. He sighs and placed his bottle of sake down --- yes, 'Ortho' placed his sake down. "You're.. right.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brings his left palm over to the back of right hand, sending chakra to that generic area. Suddenly, after a quick puff of smoke, a massive bucket of ice and sake is gripped in one hand while a tray of rolled up blunts was in the other.

"All because you came through the window doesn't mean you bypass the no clothes rule," he says in a leveled tone. Pain was apparent, but not as much as before.* - Tue Nov 17 11:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) joined her in stripping down to nothing. His tank top went bye, his pants was evicted and everything else was thrown off and out of sight. His cock, already, was half way. A single vein can he running from his base to his slightly enlarged head, but unless some action started the cold AC was going-

The cold AC. He smirks a bit, his eyes immediately diverting to her nipples. He licks his lips in interest before glances at her face as she spoke. For a moment all the seductive thoughts vanished he firmly nodded. "I assure you that none of it bothers me. It's actually.. extremely attractive."

With their legs now tied into each other Ortho was purposely lean a certain way so his member can just rest on her thigh, plain of sight and full of feeling to her.* - Tue Nov 17 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || "Depends on what you're looking for. Want me to just fuck your brains out or make love to you?"

Ortho's tone was actually a bit serious sounding. His expression hinted to the same thing, but there was a bit of humor behind it all. To make things even more casual, however, he reaches for his own bottle of sake and takes a few gulps out of it.* - Tue Nov 17 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shifted their positions a bit.

He maneuvers himself behind Eri that way they were both facing away from the couch. Him being in between the back of the back and Eri with her at the edge; without her actually being 'at' the edge. He pulls her in close, and lifts her leg just a bit. He places his cock in between her cheeks, making sure not to penetrate her but to just leave it there casually. He lowers her leg while bringing it back a bit so her leg was on top of his upper one. "We'll take it slow," he says in a hushed tone. There, he grabs his bottle of sake a continues to take drinks from it.* - Tue Nov 17 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded.

He reaches over her body and placed his bottle of sake down on the side table next to the cough; also where the tray of blunts are. There were about ten already rolled up blunts there and two lighters. "Think you can handle one by yourself or you want to share?" His question sounded serious with a hint of teasing and humor. Last time they smoked and drank together he remembers calling her a newcomer to the whole thing, made for good competition and.. other intimate-type things. "It's okaaay if you can only handle half, new girl."* - Tue Nov 17 12:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirks.

When it comes to taunting Eri, all someone has to do is try to dethrone her capabilities. His hand right had trail down her naked body, taking in the feeling of every curve she gave him free access to fondle and caress. Eventually his hand reached her hips and as she leaned forward and back to get her own blunt he couldn't help but bite down on his tongue to fight back the urge to sway his own hips into her as he backed back up. However, his member pulsed a bit and enlarged a small amount --- noticeable if Eri wasn't intentionally trying to ignore what was poking her.

Ortho leans in a bit, taking hold of blunt with two fingers on his left hand; the index and thumb. "You're lucky we settled on casual.~ Unless I can.. casually.. give you that checkup. Some people say smoking his bad for you young lady," he whispers into her ear.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hands moves down further, making its way between Eri's thighs before trailing back up to her mound. "I mean, this is an important issue. I'm going to have to do a thorough check." Once at her pussy he'd only place a single finger just past her lips and glide it back and forth. He wanted to get her nice and stimulated.* - Tue Nov 17 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "I'm going to have to check you up now. I mean look how short your attention span is. I have to figure out what exactly triggers what." Just as Eri leaned forward Ortho made his move. He pushed more of his finger into her, stopping at the second joint. Of course he was using his middle finger so that checkpoint of his joint was enough to send Eri close to the edge like normal.* - Tue Nov 17 13:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls his finger out just until the tip. "Do you not trust the doctor? If this level of the method doesn't work for you, I can try another." Just then he'd bring his index finger up next to his middle finger and push it inside her, going as far as swaying them back and forth inside her. "Is this more to your.. comfort?"* - Tue Nov 17 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think I like this as much as the business meetings. - Tue Nov 17 14:00:57 2015

You seem healthy despite the fidgeting, but I'll excuse that as wetuntilyoudon'tknowwhattodoitist. Maybe you should just get some reason and.. release.. some of your fluids by any means necessary." He takes his index fingers out, but made sure to extract his middle finger as slow as possible. "You're free to train as much as you want, but I highly suggest getting some.. closure.. to your symptoms."* - Tue Nov 17 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) smirked. He nods his head and shrugged a bit, "sure thing."

Ortho sways his hips forward again, allowing his now erect member to push past her cheeks and rest just when his head separated her lips. There, he'd embrace your moistness and release just a small groan to let her know that he was enjoying this moment and feeling. To keep things casual though, he'd place his blunt back between his lips and took a single solid hid, exhaling the excess smoke after holding it in for a few seconds.* - Tue Nov 17 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinked as few times. Hearing Eri's words actually made him, the sensei side of him, slightly annoyed --- but still he was lusting and didn't really think of it as a big deal. Still though, he was going to use what she said as an opportunity to 'punish' her. He moves his hips just a little, allowing his cock to slip only an inch past her lips and threaten to enter her hole. "Is that so? I hope you had fun and deemed it worth it," he states. Of course his tone was flat, demanding almost. His expression gave away no form of expression --- his true 'sensei' attitude.* - Tue Nov 17 20:12:09 2015

Three guards' poofs up beside Ortho, one leans in and whispers something to the leader. A nod is given then a sigh release of a sigh. Ortho's eyes momentarily close as Index approaches the main streets of the village, greeted by skepticism of all the common day civilians. The guards stood prepared and Ortho simply folds his arms across his chest.

"Every time I help you in your efforts I end up screwed over, Ryutaro.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"I no longer wish to claim her life."* - Wed Nov 18 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're missing the point, Index. - Wed Nov 18 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: -That- truly saddens me. - Wed Nov 18 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then tell me what the point is - Wed Nov 18 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes momentarily shut. Chakra is sent to the frontal lobe of his brain, where his ocular prowess are, and triggers his doujutsu. In return, after merely a few seconds, Ortho opens his lids to reveal his Sharingan --- two teardrops resting within the crimson-red pits of his pupils.

"Since Ume has been under your care.. Have you, or have you not.. played your special 'games' with her.."

Ortho's voice is stern and his eyes fixate on Index, looking for any sign of dishonesty as a answer is given --- if an answer is given.* - Wed Nov 18 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"You stand there and get angry at me..? As if I'm in the wrong here? You came here to give me good news while you go to your hideout day after day and play games with the woman I loved? I never thought of you as a hypocrite and I never thought that you'd stoop so low to have relations with her, but the fact that you know I love her and still decided to play that game with her is what tears me apart on the inside. You preached the word of 'no woman between brothers' yet you betray me. You stepped on my side of the border with evil intent and expect me to take that kindly? You expect me to be jolly knowing that? You expect me to be happy that she's there allowing you to do whatever after I told her how I felt about it when she told me about the first time you two played that game? How do you expect me to react? How do you expect me to behave?"

Ortho takes a step forward.

"Explain to me, Index. How?"* - Wed Nov 18 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then I'd have you know. - Wed Nov 18 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do you know -why- she did any of that? - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You realise, the game isn't inherently bad correct? - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: .......... - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had enough. There was no reason to hold back nor was there a reason to accept Ryutaro's words any longer. His right arm shoots forward, four snakes instantly surge toward Index in the process. These snakes are white in color with yellow-slit pupils. Their intent is to coil around the male and bind him completely, giving him no room maneuver around.* - Wed Nov 18 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't done --- not by a long shot. He gave Index too many opportunities and all he got in return was lies and disrespect.

Index's attempt to create distance was commendable, but not completely successful. The speed of Ortho's snakes was amazing and it's for that reason why Ortho allowed his chakra to continue expanding their length. He, himself, followed Index in close pursuit while seeing to it that the snakes did the same. Once caught up to the male, two of the four would widen their jaws and look to pierce the male in the legs while the other two looked to wrap around the males frame.* - Wed Nov 18 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't going to give up. He was aware of the mechanics of Shunshin and knew that it was a level of high speed movement. For that reason, and that reason only, Ortho continued to trail after Index in his attempts. Not only that, but Ortho's sharingan aided in keeping visual tabs on Ryutaro's movements. Still, with no remorse, Ortho allowed his snakes to progress forth --- two wrapping around Index's frame and the other two piercing his thighs with the kusanagi-like blades.* - Wed Nov 18 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) saw the buildup of chakra and slowly shook his head. Ortho disconnected what ties he had to the four snakes and continued his pursuit. This time around, while continuing make an attempt to not lose Ryutaro, Ortho quickly strings together a series of handseals and expels numerous bullets made of wind. These bullets were aimed to basically knock Ryutaro completely out, two of the six bullets he sent aimed right for Ryutaro's head.* - Wed Nov 18 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) grinds his teeth.

Ortho's retaliation was obvious. With Ryutaro weaving together handseals, Ortho did the same. From the looks of things Ryutaro had the edge on Ortho when it came to damage so instead of trying to have a wind war, Ortho used Ryutaro's technique against him. The two-tomoe'd Uchiha inhales, puckers his lips and exhales a massive fireball. Its purpose was to consume Ryutaro's wind completely --- maximizing its area of effect zone and overall damage. Ortho was indeed sure Ryutaro had no way out of this.

To make matters even worse, Ortho would follow up with another succession of handseals and slam his palms down into the grass. A dome of earth would begin uprooting around Ryutaro, leaving him open to the now x2 Fireball and giving him no room to run.* - Wed Nov 18 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) hated being taken lightly.

Ortho was superior in speed to Ryutaro, that's a given. It's for that reason, and that reason only, why Ortho made it an assured thing counter this jutsu. The second Ryutaro went to unleash the jutsu; he was met with surge of lightning. Ortho's speed of handseals was superb and Ryutaro's one handseal was nothing compared to the two Ortho needed to string together. That being said, in attempt to null Ryutaro's jutsu before it got too strong, Ortho zapped the male.* - Wed Nov 18 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) leaped alright, but it wasn't in the nature Ryutaro thought it'd be. Ortho jukes away from the spikes, foreseeing the situation at hand with relative ease.

Ortho had enough of this. Ryutaro was going to pay and Ryutaro thought this was a joke. He spat in Ortho's face way too many time and quite frankly, Ryutaro had no one to save him. Hatsujin interference was perfect, Ortho already knowing he wouldn't be effected by the Genjutsu --- they've been in battle together once before. That being said, while evading the spikes, Ortho's frame begins to change.

His skin turned scale-like and darkened in color. His body, as a whole, morphed into that of a true serpent, his legs binding together and transitioning into a tail. At this point, Ortho's maximum speed and physical capabilities were reached. He shoots himself forward, slithering in diagonals to evade Ryutaro's jutsu's. Just then, knowing for a fact that he supposed brother was inferior in this department, Ortho would form a succession handseals then thrust his right arm forward. As a result, even more snakes protrude and aim to wrap around Index --- all with the aid of Hatsujin's Genjutsu.* - Wed Nov 18 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) continued forth.

His body was surging toward Ryutaro with no remorse. All the backed up anger, all the shattered feelings, everything surged forward at this point and time.

The handseals from before wasn't to cast the snakes, no. The handseals before was to begin the process of charging up another jutsus. With Ryutaro now caught in the Genjutsu, Ortho thrusts his other arm forward and allowed even more snakes to protrude. This time, however, the snakes had their jaws wide open and kusanabi blades aimed right for Ryutaro's chest.

To top it off, without actually USING the jutsu he did the handseals for yet, he'd pucker his lips and expel multiple air bullets toward the males head, rendering him unconscious.* - Wed Nov 18 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed and looked down at his brother's lifeless body. He slowly shook his head, knowing what possibilities there were. Ortho's own body begins to revert back to normal, his snakes recoiling back in his sleeve. Ortho strips off all weaponry and armor off of the male, sealing it away. "You did this to yourself.. You betrayed me.. brother.." With that, Ortho hoists the males body over his shoulder and carries him off.* - Wed Nov 18 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) unseals a scroll and pen. He unravels it and begins writing:

"I have no beef with the Gezo Empire. I may not share the same views as you all, but I am looking to come to mends with whatever crime I committed. Take Ryutaro's, also known as Index's, body along with his eyes. Possibly, in return I can get my name off of the Gezo's bounty list and possibly given funds for the remaining amount. I heard that Ryutaro had One Hundred Million on his head. Of course, if that's pushing the limits I understand. Still, I have placed it in my own hands to kill him and turn him in."

With that, Ortho would stuff the scroll in Ryutaro's mouth, close his eyelids and ship him off to the Gezo.* - Wed Nov 18 05:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glances back at Eri. "My supposed brother came to taunt me, but I called his bluff. Of course Hatsujin here dealed me the perfect hand at the end of the game, so the praise must go to him and his guitar."* - Wed Nov 18 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's expression immediately faded. His eyes peered down for a bit and he releases a single chuckle.

The question echoes through his mind, and everytime it repeated his chuckling increased to sheer laughter.* - Wed Nov 18 07:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. The thought that just ran through his mind almost got him in a -lot- of trouble.* - Wed Nov 18 07:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. Perhaps I will make that trip to Sunagakure sometime today. - Wed Nov 18 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: See if I can gather anymore stray information while I'm there. - Wed Nov 18 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) tucks his hands within his pants pockets and heads to the villages' exit. "Come, Eri. I need to review what you've been practicing. Hatsujin let me know when you're heading out."* - Wed Nov 18 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Yea, Yea. . .will do. - Wed Nov 18 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) looks from left to right, making sure the coast is clear. After a few seconds of scanning the perimeter he'd set his gaze on Eri and attempt to lock gazes with her, returning to their usual staring contest. He reaches for her hands and pulls her closer to him, locking his fingers into hers. He bites down on his lower lip before sighing. "Look," he says in a hushed tone --- something was obviously on his mind. "We've.. been at this for a short amount of time and I know I screwed everything up the first time I said this.. but I.. I've been thinking and I have to ask you something."* - Wed Nov 18 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know you can ask me anything. - Wed Nov 18 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) brings her right hand up and placed it over his heart, wanting her to feel the increasing rate of his heartbeat. Just a graze of her hand and she could feel the hard thumping. A bead of sweat drips down the side of his face and he chews on his bottom lip. "You know you mean a lot to me, right? Like.. a LOT-lot..?"* - Wed Nov 18 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed a bit, watching her turn her head away. It didn't kill his mood, but it made him rethink these last few days. He slowly shook his head, not to express his disapproval of the situation at hand, but to accept the situation and what has been said leading to this very moment. His heart rate starts to lower with a bit of concentration --- a single deep breath did wonders. "..Uhh," he stammers, trying to come up with something else to say that'd fit this moment. "Umm.. Alright, I-.." He sighs again and begins backing up a bit, allowing her hand to glide off his chest and their other hands to untie. "Alright.. Just-.. Just making sure.."* - Wed Nov 18 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Wed Nov 18 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) eyes widened. "Eri, please.. Calm down, here me out.. I had-.. have.. something else on my mind, but I'm trying to go by what you asked of me.. You don't ask me for anything and I just-.. I just want to respect that.." He steps forward, attempting to take grasp of her hand to calm her down.* - Wed Nov 18 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) shook his head. "No, Eri.. I-I didn't mean to lie-.. I wasn't trying," his eyebrows arched in, his expression saddens for a bit at the look on her face. He honestly didn't. "I want you.. to marry.. me, Eri.. I know you wanted to take things slow.. and-and.. I know you said it'd be dangerous for us to go 'public' with 'us'.. but-.. like I don't know.. I feel so attached to you and.. I just.." He sighs again, looking away.* - Wed Nov 18 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. There was suspicion of her possibly of being pregnant, but he made all of that blow over his head when she didn't bring it up to him. They had numerous times alone and there was plenty of chances for her to just come out with it --- it was only natural for him to let things go when they're not brought up. He slowly shook his head in disbelieve, a smile slowly creeping on his face. He mouths the word pregnant without any sound coming out, trying his best to come up with a reply.

He looks down at her stomach as he own chest heaved a bit --- he was feeling joyous but staying cautious. He didn't know exactly if this was a good thing or bad, but just imagine a little Ortho running around. No one can say that that wouldn't be humorous. He sets his gaze on Eri, meeting hers. "Pregnant," he manages to murmur. He really didn't want to get too happy at this news so he just nodded and smiled, "no worries. Pregnant or not, it'll be okay.."

Ortho's eyes narrowed just a tad bit at Eri's sharingan activated. The sensation they gave off made Ortho go silent, but his smile kept up. When it came to getting an answer, he didn't exactly expect one right now or anytime soon. It just felt great knowing he didn't make things worse-.. more confusing between them. Things have been rocky lately and fighting through it was a priority of his.

"I want you happy, Eri.. I've wanted that since that day you crawled on to my lap and you activated those. I just knew.. within myself.. that it was just a matter of time I deemed it necessary to present this option to you.. I really do.. love you, Eri.."* - Wed Nov 18 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || There is only one tool that helps you view this world for what it truly is --- the glasses of Life. The acceptance of yourself and the acceptance of others are the lenses.

Eri and Ortho, Ortho and Eri --- that had a nice ring to it. Who would've thought: months after Hideki's death the renowned rebel named Ortho is standing before a female suggest that they run off and get married. Months after Hideki's death the renowned rebel named Ortho is the leader of his own Village; whose walls are forged by the teaching of Hideki himself. Months after Hideki's death the renowned rebel named Ortho is able to smile with someone not feel as though he's going to end up dead by them. Months after Hideki's death.. Ortho is happy.

There it goes again. There goes that feeling from before, where all this truly started. The feeling before where all the emotions from both of them poured out relentlessly and shamelessly for each other to view openly. The feeling where a simple kiss is truly more than that --- it's more than just a show of passion between to people. It's more than just two people getting intimate and sex-bound. It's more than just them trying each other out. It's more than just the common reasoning why people lock lips. A simple kiss is doing so much to the mind and soul rather than the groin.

Their lips part and the feeling lingers. Their lips part and that sensation hangs around and refuses to live --- he welcomes it with open arms. He bear hugs it in fact, not wanting it to slip because this is the feeling that made all his pains go away. This is the feeling that everything makes sense and allows him to truly see the light at the end of his dark tunnel. This is the feeling that made him feel warm on the inside and fulfilled past the common gladiator life. Hell, if anything, this is what a gladiator fought for. He wields his sword and hoists his shield and fights --- all to assure his glory and uphold his pride as a force to be reckoned with. Eri was his glory. Eri was his pride. Eri is what he wanted to fight for. All these worldly aspects mattered not to him, but the events surround Eri that involved those same things is what he wanted to embrace. He embraces the fact that they lived the savage life and walked the path of dangers and unknowing, but to Ortho, as long as he was walking with Eri alongside him, it didn't matter where they were heading.

"I will marry you someday, Ortho."

These words meant so much to him. These words gave him a boost in his heart and soul, fueled his drive to carry on past normal means of living until he could hold Eri in his arms and carry her off into the sunset. These words allowed Ortho to step further away from the darkness and more into the light of love and happiness. Something he thrived for and wanted to just hold as close as he can, and he knew Eri was the caster. He knew Eri was the cause of the happiness and the love. He knew that at the end of the day, when he laid his head to rest, the end goal would be the same when he awoke once again.

A smile is given. A soft smile that was allied with an expression of completion, aimed directly at Eri from Ortho. He takes notice of her second tear drop --- his smile only grew wider. Ortho wasn't used to smiling for this long and this hard, but it felt right. It felt different as well, but it's was a different that managed to change his perspective of things. He nods his head and chuckles a bit.

"Never.. thought I'd be the one to bring this up. It was always me running through the wild on my own and fighting to stay alive.. for my own purposes. It's.. different.. knowing I have someone with me.. at all times.."* - Wed Nov 18 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) rblinked a few times, watching the confusion sneak on to Eri's face and rest there. He knew exactly what she was experiencing at the moment. He smirked, accepting her kiss and returning it in full. Her words made things even better, the icing on the cake. He takes her in for a hug and kisses her on the cheek. Just then, he leads her to the bank of the water and point down at her reflection. "What you're seeing right now.. is understanding and acceptance.. clear as day."* - Wed Nov 18 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He folds his arms across his chest, turned his head and pouted. "Probably cheated again," he says in a fake whining tone. A few seconds pass and he cracks a slight smile. "Good job."* - Wed Nov 18 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) fell back, holding on to her in the process. He kept his pouting-smile up, making light of the situation. "..tch. I don't know whaaaat you're talking about. I'm never jealou-," he's interrupted by an onslaught of kisses. Still, he attempted to talk between each peck. "I .. never.. get.. jeal..ous.."* - Wed Nov 18 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened as she talked. The more and more she went on is the more his eyes widened before narrowing instantly. He was actually conflicted now. She knew exactly what she was doing by rotating her hips against him like that. She'd easily feel a small rise in his member. "..Nope, nope, nope. I can tell you why I wouldn't get jealous either."* - Wed Nov 18 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes her by the hips and smirks. "Because," he says while starting to rotate her hips a bit more to get him even more riled up. "I'll just fuck the soul out of you before you go. That way you'll be too soar to even think about doing anything.~"* - Wed Nov 18 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowed her hips down a bit, giving her access to stop whenever she wanted. Still, however, if there wasn't any more restraint he'd continue to have her grind against his member. "Depends, ma'am.~ What are you offering?~"* - Wed Nov 18 10:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Yes. I mean two of the tomoe's? You deserve that, ma'am.~"* - Wed Nov 18 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Even if I could put you in your place, and trust that I will in the future.~ I still would prefer to call you Sir. - Wed Nov 18 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) returns the kiss, leaning his head more into it a bit. He glides his hands down and attempted to slip them under as much clothing as possible to make flesh on flesh contact with her butt. "That.. I can agree with.~"* - Wed Nov 18 10:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) starts squeezing and rubbing her cheeks, getting a good feel of them. He runs his hands to her crack, gliding down just a bit, threatening to graze against her back hole. "If you're able to tell me straight up what your learned last time, I'll continue training you right now."* - Wed Nov 18 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) inches closer and closer to her pucker each time he strokes in between her cheeks. "Let's start go with the Kai. What do you remember about it?" By time he finished asking that he middle finger would just barely graze her.* - Wed Nov 18 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's finger makes full contact with her pucker, slowly caressing it and daring her to make the slightest movement so he can put just enough of his finger in. "Good, good. Try using it now. Right here, right now for me." His voice shoots back to its leveled tone, crossing the border of 'demanding' her. On top of that, Ortho would wipe all expressions from his face, only focusing on enjoying her bum and tempting her concentration.* - Wed Nov 18 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Oh he -has- to be kidding. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Out of -all- the jutsu in the world. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: THIS ONE? - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: NOW? - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I win. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) eased the movement down this time around. He kept his finger on her pucker but doesn't move it. The most he did was squeeze and rub her left cheek with his last hand, internally and physically just enjoying her body. As for her concentration, he'd give her the time she needed. Besides, he has a plan.~* - Wed Nov 18 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Go a head. - Wed Nov 18 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: One more time. Concentrate. - Wed Nov 18 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. Things went in slow motion for him as Eri's eyes rolled to the back of her head and she went limp. "Fuck," he says as her head falls right against his chest. He wasn't hurt from it or anything, but he didn't expect her to pass out. Hell, he had his finger ready to rock her world as soon as she completed the jutsu. He sighed a bit, tacking his left hand out from under her skirt and brang it up to her upper back. "Eri," he states in an almost comforting tone. "Wake uuuup.~ Eri.~"

One thing Ortho made sure not to do was make any sudden moves. The last thing he needed was her getting some serious effects from him moving her unconscious body around. He didn't even move his right hand from beneath her skirt. All he did was use his left to gently pat against her back.* - Wed Nov 18 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) is dumb, this is a known fact.

He sighs and forms a single handseal, allowing his chakra to run through Eri's body and kick start her system. He sends it to overdrive, allowing the rush to snap her out of the unconscious state.* - Wed Nov 18 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sighed again. He slowly shook his head, feeling Eri's heart rate slow and her body relaxing. He bites down on his lower lip, the thoughts running through his mind tempting him to new extremes. "Eri," he says in a hushed tone. His left hand gently rubs up and down her back while his right hand, with his middle finger still resting against her pucker, would start moving back and forth again.* - Wed Nov 18 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's finger found it all too easy to slip in, but he refrained from doing so. For now, he continues to graze over her pucker, taking in the feeling as a whole. With his left hand, that was once on her back, he reach for the back of her thigh and pull it up so at least half of the leverage was back. Just as he pulled her thigh in he'd enter his finger to just the first joint, slowly and gracefully moving it back and forth. "Eri..~"* - Wed Nov 18 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) focused his visual attention on Eri, watching her slowly wake up. When he felt her back arch and the slightest clench of her hole he knew that any sudden push or pull that it'd cause pain so he brings his left hand to his and put two of his fingers in his mouth. He lubes it up with his saliva he extracts it just to trail it down to her cheeks and run around the edges of her hole, wanting it to be a bit more easier for them both. "How you feeling," he asks in a hushed tone.* - Wed Nov 18 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded. He bites down on his lips and slowly pulled his finger out, taking it centimeter at a time. Something this tight was going to be explored, that's a must --- but not at this time. Well, not to its full extent. Instead of having a finger in, he'd just gently graze it against the pucker and leave it at that. For a few seconds he'd play with her down there before pull his hand away completely. This, however, didn't come without a price. He grabs her by both thighs and readjusts her slightly. The bulge in his pants was rested right against her pantie covered mound, just barely threatening to evade her if there was no fabric around.

"Alright, this technique is similar to the one I taught you in the shower. Instead of flowing your chakra around an object or into an object, you're going to expel it through your palms." Ortho's hands come together after releasing her thighs. He places it between them at chest level and made sure they had Eri's eye contact. The necessary handseals were formed numerous times for her to memorize. "Once you've gathered that chakra, push it and allow it flow into a gust rather than centering it into a single point."* - Wed Nov 18 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) kept his focus on Eri, wanting to properly overlook her progress --- yes, his eyes indeed kept focus on her. His hands, however, moved back to her rump and starts squeezing again. He didn't do it to distract her but to just ease down his lust with the amazing feel of what she was allowing him to explore. The most he did was gently tap her cheeks ever so often, syncing it when she'd shift in his lap and rub against his crotch. He can't lie, once two jutsus are learned by her here he's going to have to reward her nicely.

"Good, good," he says. His leveled tone almost broke and a sign of lust was barely exposed. He coughs a bit, restarting his vocals and going again. "Now, this next technique is real similar to that but has its difference. Focus your wind affinity once more but focus the chakra in your lungs. Knead it there and take in a deep breath. Once your wind and chakra merge and magnifies, unleash it. Don't exactly center it, but keep it wide spread."* - Wed Nov 18 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded in approval. He can't lie, he was extremely proud of Eri's progress and felt like while they were at it he should just teach her a third jutsu. However, he didn't start the next instructions right away. He gave himself just a bit to be selfish. When reaches more into her skirt and runs his fingers back down her crack and in between her cheeks. He gives a good squeeze before allowing his middle finger to rest right on her wrinkles. He bites down on his bottom lips, loving the feel of it. In all honesty, this was actually the first time he decided to explore this hole --- he didn't regret it.

With his other hand he'd begin controlling her hips, applying just enough pressure to sway her hips back and forth against his bulge. The wetness of her pussy was getting to him and even he had to quickly distract himself:

"Alright, your third jutsu is a bit more complicated than that last one. This time around you're going to unleash the wind in intervals, making them into bullet-like blasts of wind. Swell and knead the chakra with the intake of air within your lungs and instead of expanding it to the maximum so you unleash one big gust, fill your lungs and unleash multiple times."* - Wed Nov 18 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nods again, approving of Eri's ability to use the jutsu. There were more jutsu's to learn of this element that Ortho had but lust was getting to him and he was trying his upmost most to keep the flow of the training session going. Still though, temptation was one hell of a negotiator.

His finger starts to rub against her asshole a bit more, each stroke had a little more pressure than the last. Ortho brings his other hand to his mouth once again to lubricate it then reached behind her again. His eyes kept focus on her face, wanting to watch her expression of lust each step of the way. Eventually his send set of fingers start lubing her asshole up for his first set. Once it was nice and ready, with a little bit more effort in the pressure, Ortho would slowly, centimeter by centimeter, push his way in. "You're doing great," he says. With what he was doing and how her pucker was lubed up, along with her training, it'd be too hard to decipher what exactly he was talking about.* - Wed Nov 18 13:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's jaw opened slightly and a breath was released. This level of teasing was getting to him, his cock was begging to enter Eri --- it didn't even matter which hole it was this time around. His finger on the other hand was having the time of its life. It continued to pace more inside of her, stopping at the second joint.

"Very happy.. -very- happy," he says in a hushed tone. He looks up at her, locking eyes as he stays to sway his hips a bit, trying his best to fight back his own urges just to talk. "Your sensei wants to be inside you, but you deserve more training. Which do you think we should choose?" As he spoke he'd continue to move his finger back and forth within her asshole, exploring as much as he can.
* - Wed Nov 18 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pushes down on her hips a bit more, making his bulge create a cameltoe with her mound and panties. "All of me.. wants to be inside you, my student."* - Wed Nov 18 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. The idea wasn't bad and he took up that offer. One of his hands was already beneath her skirt and panties so he just used the other to pull the crotch area off to the side as much as possible. He even uses his bulge to keep the fabric aside as he reaches for his zipper and pulled it down. Almost instantly his cock springs out, slapping against your exposed lips. He bites down on his lower lip again, trying to keep things as professional as possible despite him about to base out in his student. His eyes trailed down to his member for just the moment, wanting to see him enter her. He lifts Eri up just a bit so he can stand his cock on end. Slowly, but surely, he'd ease her down on the head --- he made sure to take the time out to rub his head against her lips, clit and entrance before actually entering her.

"This.. next technique," he starts off between breaths and slight groans. He looks back up at her, wanting to see that amazing face full of lust and anticipation. "It's similar to the first.. technique I taught you. That technique is called Gale Palm, this one is Divine-," he releases a deep groan as he adds more pressure to her hips and finally base out inside her. He can never get over how tight and wet she was, a glorious hole it was. "It's called Divine Wind. All.. all you have to do is summon the chakra to palms like Gale Palm and expel it. How-however.. instead of making into a g-gust.. you make the chakra twist at the last second, forming a multitude of tornadoes."* - Wed Nov 18 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. Eri's words made him frown a bit, but nothing he couldn't punish her for. A finger was still firmly tucked away within her asshole so all he did was push more of that finger into her. There was caution in the push, but not as much as before. He continues to roam around inside her, pressing against any and all muscles that was trying to prevent him from entering her even more. To make matters even worse for her, he'd use his other hand to sway her hips up and down a real moderate pace. This pace caused a thumping sound from them slamming against each other. All the while, while she rides him, he makes sure to keep his finger active inside her other hole. "You promise to listen this time my student?"* - Wed Nov 18 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gradually slowed the pace of her hips, allowing his own lust to momentarily subside so he can give her the instructions once again. This'll probably aid her in her efforts to pay attention --- even though deep down he wanted her to just make the slightest mistake so he just rampage her pussy for a bit more. Nevertheless, he understood what her training meant to her and the village as a whole so he'd continue to put on the front that this was truly her punishment.

"V-Very well," he starts, only rotating her hips just a bit compared to the actual slamming from just seconds before. "You must knead the chakra in a similar manner as you would the first technique I taught you today. That technique in question is called Gale Palm. That being s-said.. once you've established the chakra and wind affinity as a single unit, expel it. Thrust it out and make it twist. As-as a result it'll take the form as a tornado."* - Wed Nov 18 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head. He felt Eri lean back into him and submit to him, something about that always turned him on even more. "You know I'm going to have to punish you, right?"

Just then, their hips started to collide together again. He used his free hand to guide her small frame to ride him as he turns his head to the side a bit and her lips and mouth do as they pleased. "This is your punishment for being a bad girl. All is forgiven but I must make.. make sure you understand," he says continuing to ram his cock in and out of her pussy while forcing her hips to comply with his own movements. Meanwhile, his middle fingers starts to glide back and forth inside her asshole, even starting the process of pumping in and out of her at a moderate pace that complied with how loose her clench was --- nevertheless, he was going to end up fingering her asshole today.* - Wed Nov 18 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) allowed her ride him through her orgasm. He went as far as picking up the pace and adding more pressure to their slams, wanting a second climax out of her while the first was starting to ease down. Of course her words didn't fall on deaf ears but right now he wanted her to enjoy herself before he made his real move. His finger continues to rage through her asshole, loosening up the muscles for the grand finale. He didn't say anything to Eri, only giving her a groan of pleasure and a show of "annoyance" that his student was taking her punishment lightly --- she just don't know.* - Wed Nov 18 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) felt his reward wrap around his cock and squeeze. Her orgasm was intense for both of them and as he nuzzled her face into his neck he couldn't help but create a smile of accomplishment. He felt like she was ready to accept something from him for the first time, but he wasn't going to abruptly change things and ruin the tempo of things. Instead, with the hand he used to treat her like ragdoll by the hips, he'd reach between their body and play with her outer lips and clit. He was on the bottom so he'd have to put in more of an effort to sway his hips back and forth so give her that fulfillment after her orgasm.

He keeps the pace slow from this point, wanting her to stay aroused and feel complete by the stimulation afterwards, but not enough for her to have that irresistible thirst for more cock in her mound. When the tempo finally died down and her hips were still, he'd sit up and slowly lift her up. "I want you on your hands and knees," he says in his leveled tone. By this point his smile subsided and returned back to plain, not wanting his role as 'sensei' to falter because of his undying lust."* - Wed Nov 18 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) loved this sight. Her ass is up with that cute little pucker and pussy waiting for him to rampage again. "As I said before.. I must know that you understand my student. I don't want that mistake to happen so you must accept you punishment like a good girl."

Ortho grabs his cock from the base. He was soaked in Eri's juices and properly lubed up for a normal occasion of anal sex to crazy levels of lust and love --- this wasn't a normal occasion. This was his first time exploring the backdoor so he was as much of an amateur as her, but common sense kicked in. He takes another lick of her fingers and allowed saliva to smear over her asshole. He'd then line his head up with her small pucker and pause there. "I'm feeling generous and will only give you a taste of the punishment. You are my prodigal student and I feel like you've earned some leniency."

With that said, he'd apply extremely slight pressure to her hole. Just looking at the hole compared to the head of his cock made him know that this is going to be a long process, he didn't mind how long it took to just get the head in. Every now and then, as he took it, literally minute by minute, he'd ease his way with the help of more saliva and him playing with her pussy lips then bring her juices up to his cock head. He releases a groan each step of the way, the tightness alone could possibly make him cum  here.* - Wed Nov 18 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) begins massaging her cheeks in an attempt to comfort her. The process alone to get his head in was long so he knew his entire length wasn't going to be possible today --- after all, he had a pussy waiting on him just inches below. Still though, he lets his head just have this moment of wonderful tightness and lubrication from his saliva and her transfer juices. "Good girl, good girl. Relax," he encourages.  He sway his hips back just 'slightly', making sure not to make any sudden moves. His head is actively penetrating her asshole. Whenever he pulled out he only got to the very tip before slowly pushing back to exactly where he stopped with his head; the crown of his cock.

He goes with this for a few minutes, honestly loving the feeling and only wanting to go more in her hole but keeping his restraint high. He continues to caress and grab hold of her cheeks relentlessly claiming them as his and his only. "Yes my student, you have repaid your debt. I am happy."* - Wed Nov 18 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was teasing himself to hell by the point. He wanting the entirety of his shaft to slam into Eri but even he knew, with the aid of sheer common sense, which today wasn't the day he claimed her asshole as his. He gives her cheeks a firm swat, letting that sting sink in as he plops his head out of her asshole completely. "Good girl," he says to coach her on. He grabs his cock by the base again and lines himself with her entrance and slides in with much more ease than he did with her asshole.

The feeling of satisfaction that her pussy gave him caused a groan. He takes another swat at her cheeks and grabbed her by the hips, pulling her back as he thrust forward. Groan after groan is made and as he starts thrusting in and out her he could feel more and more blood rush to his cock. He was so enlarged that it was to the point he started aching and begging for a release --- he was almost double in thickness now. Only one other time this happened and that let to both of them having one of the best releases to date.* - Wed Nov 18 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head, the one on his shoulders, fell back and lust kicked in fully. Her words didn't fall on deaf ears and he did implement the request within his subconscious and made sure to pull out as soon as things were getting too deep. He pants heavily and releases a groan while continuing to grab on to her hips and pull her back against his cock when he slammed forward. On top of that, her look of terror didn't go unnoticed so instead of continuing his slaps of attempted passion he instead gently rubs one of his hand over her cheeks and softly squeeze, changing the tempo on that while keeping up the pussy onslaught.

His enlarged cock begins throbbing and twitching, signaling for the closeness of his orgasm. It was near, but not near enough. He still had a few good thrusts left until he knew for a fact that it was time to pull out. For the time being, he'd just continue on the pace he was at.* - Wed Nov 18 15:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave it one last thrust forward and that's all it took. His mind immediately became clouded and his movements were almost slurred as his own orgasm came. First thing he did however was keep the grip her had on Eri's hips and pushes her off just before he came. The push wasn't to make her go flying off, but to just pop off the cock in time so his member rested in between her open cheeks and his liquid reward to her spewed over her lower back and cheeks.

His jaw clenches and his high to him to heights he has only experienced once before --- that ultimate climax that Eri seemed to be the only one to grant him. His body went lip and his cock continues to throb and exert what remained of his semen. He pants and tumbles over to the side, taking Eri with him and carefully took her into a hug from the back. There weren't really any words he had right now. He was still gliding down from his high.
* - Wed Nov 18 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) had priorities and Eri was a major one. He did catch sight of her reaction in response to certain things and knew that sooner or later he'd have to acknowledge that he was wrong and he wouldn't do it again. He was still on his high, but he wanted to get things cleared up before it was just swept under the rub and stepped on later. He released a sigh, centered his mind the best he could and leaned in to Eri. He reaches for her chin and attempt to turn her head around to face him.

If allowed he'd give her the best 'I'm sorry' look and follow it up with planting a deep apologetic kiss on her, going as far as holding her cheek with his hand and softly gliding his thumb back and forth against her skin.* - Wed Nov 18 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulls her into a hug, allowing her head to rest on his chest and his chest to rest on the top of her head. He cradles her a bit and hushes her, "shh.. it won't even happen again.. I promise." His eyes slowly close and he just held her.* - Wed Nov 18 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in understanding, not faulting her for anything she just told him.

"We'll ease into certain things and experiment outside of sex. Until then I owe you an apology. That's something I should've eased my way into.. especially after that arm thing that first time.. I should've gotten the hint."* - Wed Nov 18 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded once more.

"Then I'll take new things slow. Ease into new things slowly and see your acceptance to it. That sounds good?"* - Wed Nov 18 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thought about that question for a bit.

"I am, but I don't want you to relive the thought too soon after experiencing the trigger to those thoughts a few minutes ago. If you want to tell me, I'm all ears."* - Wed Nov 18 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: It's easier to talk about it now.... then later. - Wed Nov 18 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Then talk to me.. I'm here whenever. - Wed Nov 18 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes immediately widened. "Is this what I just reminded her of," he asks within his mind. His eyes lowered a bit and his visual focus shifted off to the side.

He slowly shakes his head to what was asked, not know how to even imagine that..* - Wed Nov 18 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was starting to wish he said no he wasn't interested in hearing what she had been through. He was a murderer, that was well known, but he had morals to the lives he took. Hearing what Eri had to say only angered him and rather than making it seem like he was angry at her he'd bite down on his tongue and slowly shake his head. His eyes continue to focus on somewhere else, refusing to make immediate contact with her gaze. Still, however, she was in full view of his peripherals. He sighs and reaches up to use his thumbs to wipe her tears away.

"I want to say I'm sorry to hear that.. but I'm more.. angry.. than anything else. Not at you, but at the fact that the person I claim honest love for is haunted by that and there's nothing I can really do to erase that from your mind.."* - Wed Nov 18 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) nodded.

"Good.. heal and move on.. all we can do in this world.."* - Wed Nov 18 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No t's not tha... - Wed Nov 18 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's something.. I wish didn't have to experience. - Wed Nov 18 17:20:12 2015
