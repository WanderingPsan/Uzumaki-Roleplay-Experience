<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) glides down to the ground.

His hands are tucked away within his pockets. A blunt was also located at the right corner of his mouth, stiffening every few seconds as he takes subtle hits off of it. A casual expression is plastered on his face, as if nothing in the world can bother him.

It is noted that his current scent is of strong sake and bud, as if he has been downing and hitting both for hours with no break. He remains quiet once he lands, saying nothing to no one initially.* - Tue Nov 24 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Hm...Him as well. - Tue Nov 24 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head lowered.

He sensed Eri approaching and released a sigh. His lids lower in shame and so did his head. "H-Hey there Supaiku," he says in a hushed tone, but audible enough for her to hear. "What's going on?"* - Tue Nov 24 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's head remains lowered.

"Had to get my mind clear," he says in a hushed tone, pointing to the blunt in his mouth. "A lot of shit went down and I don't know.. I-I'm sorry Eri, when I saw what the plan was and what I was ordered to do.. I knew my plan wouldn't work.. I knew it'd end up in us both getting killed.. I had to go through with everything.."

He sighs. His eyes completely shut his head slowly shakes, "I gave it everything I got but.. I had to go through with what he wanted.. I'm sorry."* - Tue Nov 24 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's arms rose. He hesitantly wraps them around her frame, trying to fight back the shame he felt and hug her back. Something deep down inside him was burning.. as if he was slowly self-destructing and didn't know whether or not he should cut the red wire..

He sighed again when Eri spoke. The way she took it upon herself to try and comfort him, that made him love her even more.. through it all she was rida'. "Most likely, yes. I did everything he told me to do.."* - Tue Nov 24 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. He spins on his heels and momentarily lifts Eri to switch places with her. He turns around to now face Kana, being the speed bump between she and Eri all together.

"Not today, Kana.. Not in the mood."* - Tue Nov 24 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Too early. - Tue Nov 24 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes lowered.

"What happened..? I'll kill 'em.. Who did it..?"* - Tue Nov 24 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: no - Tue Nov 24 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I should go train... - Tue Nov 24 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Push myself even further...I can feel the third boundary... - Tue Nov 24 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I heard sexual pleasures can assist in bypassing them. - Tue Nov 24 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Tue Nov 24 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyebrows rose.

He felt her embrace and didn't know how to react. Did he hug her back or just.. stand there doing nothing? He takes a gulp and concentrates on sensing her chakra for any build it before slowly raising his arms and.. hugging her back..

"What.. happen, Kana..?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No, I don't smoke. I just wanted to know what gave off that aroma. - Tue Nov 24 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn. - Tue Nov 24 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) just.. stood there..

He looked from left to right, trying to figure out what to say.. or do. Nothing was making sense and he didn't want to make the situation awkward..er.* - Tue Nov 24 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You a shinobi of this village then? - Tue Nov 24 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. I'm a traveller. - Tue Nov 24 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Ah. - Tue Nov 24 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Seems to be the fate of all of the villages these days. - Tue Nov 24 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Or always has been. - Tue Nov 24 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 24 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was still waiting for answers on what's going on..* - Tue Nov 24 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's the only village that'll allow me to stay a while. - Tue Nov 24 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) blinks.

"Kana.. what's.. going on..?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was getting slightly annoyed.* - Tue Nov 24 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) whispers: They killed him . . - Tue Nov 24 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: What are you talking about? - Tue Nov 24 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Who killed who? - Tue Nov 24 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's momentary niceness was his weakness. All efforts to comfort Kana and understand what was going on was thrown out the window when he was suddenly pierced in the back.

His eyes widen from both shock and pain. He was angrier at the fact that he left himself open for such an attack rather than sad that his life ended here and now. He slowly shook his head and looks at Kana, his knees bending as he dropped face first into the dirt. His light begins to dim and dim until eventually he was gone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But then his eyes reopened to see that Kana was still hugging him and he was still attempting to comfort him. He looks from left to right, gasping for air.

Either his blunt was the good shit or the trauma of what he had to do in Sunagakure was taking its toll and making him think of the worst case scenarios. He looks down at Kana and blinks a few times.

"What the hell is going on, Kana? Why are you crying and who killed who?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) extends his arm hesitantly. Ortho dabbed in Fuuinjusu and knew what a simply handshake can do. Caution was thrown out the window and he takes hold of Edge's hand, shaking it once.

"Sunagakure's destruction was once a priority of mine. That's why I find it so easy to ally myself with you. Free my wife and consider the deal closed and consider this checkmate."* - Tue Nov 24 21:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) sensed the buildup of chakra and reacted accordingly. The faintest of touch and the chakra was sensed in more ways than one. In retaliation, a mediocre attempt is made to evade the slashed aimed for his neck --- ducking if possible.

The hand that is gripped fluxed with chakra, causing internal damage to Edge's hand. Ortho's eyes, not in sequence to what's going on by while everything unfolded, would transition into its infamous Doujutsu. With his opposing and Ortho would go to pull Edge in and use the same chakra infused technique to slash at his forehead; aiming to have the same effect on his brain as it did his hand.* - Tue Nov 24 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hand inches forth. It was at that moment Ortho knew.. he fucked up.

A quick attempt to evade is made. He sidesteps the best he can, allowing his armor to possibly take over in the slash. Of course there would be damage made to him on the aspect where the lightning based attack pierces through, but a sacrifice must be made to assure victory in this bout.

Ortho's opposing hand came charging forth, chakra infused in its entirety. The destination was set to Edge's neck, a quick drag of his body to relieve any form of counter to the best of his abilities. Of course, naturally, since his shoulder to the damage of the lightning based attack, Ortho's other hand was now the main tool of this battle.* - Tue Nov 24 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: Did she.... - Tue Nov 24 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. He still made an effort to evade the attack on his face, which led to him being caught in the secondary attack.

The Demon King made its presence felt and in turn his tongue was captured. His demise was nearing and there was little to nothing he can do. Still, however, there was fight still left in him.

The memories of his past flashed before his eyes, causing his anger to swell. Said anger is turned into determination and the memories fueled him to battle on. Eri stood mere feet away from him and here he was pronounced a bitch by Edge once again.

No.

No, he couldn't allow that to happen. Ortho's eyebrows furrowed in once again --- defiance in each movement he made from this point forth. Ortho's sleeve thickens and a white snake is seen protruding from its confinements. The orders were already given to the snake and instantly the reptile goes to both wrap around Edge and sink its fangs into him. Of course, to aid in the efforts, Ortho would fight back against the King to prevent his soul from being leeched while bringing his arm, the same one the snake was uncoiling from, and wrap it around Edge's limb that made physical contact with his chest.* - Tue Nov 24 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ^ - Tue Nov 24 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's snakes successfully digs into Edge's skin. Ortho's eyes furrows in even more and anger continues to fuel his movements --- anger that is turned into will and fire.

With the release of his tongue/throat, Ortho coughs a bit before summoning chakra to his good hand. Upon doing so he'd inch himself over Edge's paralyzed body and slash at his throat a total of four times.

Of course the concussive damage from Kana's jutsu on Rymei, which would send her flying back, would give Ortho ample time to finish off this Orochimaru-like shinobi.* - Tue Nov 24 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) whispers: [nigga didn't even help me qq] - Tue Nov 24 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || All hope was lost.

A rogue life ending before it could even be started. Ortho's final attempt to end Edge's life comes to an end here today, mere inches away from the prize. Rymei was momentarily subdued and Eri was off on the sidelines watching and pleading for reconsideration. 

Ortho's eyes widened, his chest is pierced and blood forces its way up his throat and out his mouth. His eyes divert to the side in a hazed state, a desperate attempt to find something to aid him in his efforts. Nothing could be found. A cough is given and more blood spews out. Life is nothing more than a guest that stayed in Ortho's shell of a body --- it was time for it to return back to its rightful place.

A smile grew on Ortho's face. Of all the ways to die.. Ortho's soul is claimed by the Architect himself. More and more blood seeps from his mouth, dropping over Edge's body until finally Ortho tumbles over to the right and rolls to his back. He stares up at the sky, continuing to smile. Amazingly.. Ortho starts to chuckle.

"You watching, Hideki..? I tried my best, I swear. What about you, Hatsujin? I tried to play one last song in your name.. to end the guy that.. ended you, haha. Sorry man.. I failed you bot-," Ortho coughs up more blood, "..I failed you both.. I'm not going where you two went though.. I wonder if Hell would allow me just one glass of ice water before I spend the next eternity there.. Hey.. if anything.. you guys could come visit.. tell you the stories of how everything led to this after you two die-."

Ortho beings to cough hysterically. His lungs are filling with blood and his throat was becoming sore. He turns his head to Eri, winking at her like he wasn't on his dying breath.. as if everything was perfectly fine. "I'm all in my student," he says through his cough and disposal of blood. He gives her a bright smile, despite the blood that was coming from his mouth.

"I'm.. sorry.."

With that, Ortho fully collapse and dies.* - Tue Nov 24 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) , the new Guard of the place, stands off in the background.

His hair is a glistening grayish-silver. His build is slender with toned enough muscles to be shown through his black jumpsuit. Hokori's skin is a fair tone --- not too pale and not too tanned. His pupils match his hair color, but they're dark enough to be contrasted to the whites of his eyes. For the most part he seems like the "average Joe". The only thing that could stand out is the massive gourd on his back at he seems to carry around with relative ease.

With the crowd, be it two or three, before him Hokori remains quiet and minds his own business; only ever looking over at them to assure that nothing dangerous was going on for his safety, their safety and the safety of everyone else.* - Wed Nov 25 01:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes creek open. His body was forcibly being moved, ending in his unstrapping his gourd from around his body. He releases a sigh, giving no efforts to rebuttal physically.

"I'm a Guard, not your slave. Release me at once.."* - Wed Nov 25 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: He's demonstrating restraint? - Wed Nov 25 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) had enough.

His gourd flies across the room, shattering against the wall behind Yori. A massive load of sand erupts from the remains, settling there.

"Release me."* - Wed Nov 25 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You may release him. - Wed Nov 25 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) takes a glance at the load of sand. He remains perfectly apart from lowering his head once more and releasing a self-calming sigh. The mass of sand would begin to shift and move around. Eventually, 'new' gourd was molded and it'd roll back to Hokori; halting at his feet after standing itself up right. The guard says nothing more* - Wed Nov 25 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) spoke, keeping his head and eyes lowered in the process..

"The regimen I went through to stand here before you as your protector said nothing of training my supposed Commanding Officer. I was trained to be your sole protector and I will not be rendered his play toy. If I must accept discipline for voicing this then so be it. His training, his progression, his life is none of my concern. Only yours and your mistress next to you is of priority to me."

"I've said my piece."* - Wed Nov 25 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) raised his head once more and takes a glance at Yuriko.

"Hokori of the Keibetsu family," he says in a stern and prideful tone.

"Is this how he treats his mistress?" he asks himself within the confinements of his mind. It seemed a bit bizarre how he used her as a hand rest --- or petted her like a pet, whichever his intents were.. it wasn't of the usual to Hokori.* - Wed Nov 25 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) stands off to the side. His head is leaned back, enough to comfortably rest against the wall. The gourd that is usually strapped to his back in on the floor by his feet, standing up right with a  cork hitched in the circular hole that led to what was confined within. Hokori's hands are firmly stuffed away within his pockets and his general posture is nonchalant. His visual focus, even with his head leaned back, was momentarily on Yuriko. He wasn't exactly interested in what she was doing or what she was reading; it was just his job to keep tabs of her. He remains as quiet as ever, having no real reason to interrupt his Domina whilst she read.* - Wed Nov 25 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, diverting his gaze to the ceiling. Eye contact with is Domina would be something that's required when talking to her, but Hokori couldn't care less about that. If anything he didn't care about the rules at all, he does what he has to do to assure her and Thirteen's safety --- nothing more, nothing less. "It becomes strenuous occasionally, but boredom isn't a factor."* - Wed Nov 25 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's lowered slightly. A sigh followed her two pokes and statement. He wasn't annoyed of her, but conflicting interests was apparent. On one hand he was on duty, on the other he was actually a very social person. His duty and priority was to be the best he can possibly be --- at being a guard of the Domina and Dominus. He slowly shook his head, lowering it as well and giving her just a quick glance. "The other guards are pansies. I have a job to do, but suck up to my higher-ups --- All due respect, Domina."* - Wed Nov 25 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Yes.. Domina. A personal title of respect of your position as my higher-up."* - Wed Nov 25 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need you to act that way, I don't care about respect. I can't care, you know that right? You heard what I am like? I won't need respect until I get more emotions. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's pointless. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) raised his head again and sets his gaze on the ceiling. "Emotions or not, respect is due. You're more than just a cute face and conflicted conscious, you're my higher up. Whether you owned the place or not, some form of respect will be granted to you from me."* - Wed Nov 25 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) shook his head. "I'm far from noble. I do what I must to have food on my table when I am off duty. Might as well call me selfish."* - Wed Nov 25 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's left eyebrow rose. He keeps his visual focus on the ceiling and sighed a bit. "It means I do things for me. Your protection and safety gets me paid. If money wasn't involved here I'd be at another place that pays."* - Wed Nov 25 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) shrugged a bit. "There are many different acts of being 'selfish', but selfish in general is.. broad. You'd have to give me a scenario or something so I can tell you whether or not it was selfish."* - Wed Nov 25 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but chuckle. He looks down at Yuriko and nodded, "very. Anyone that takes joy and pride in reigning over someone else is selfish. They're only considering their wants, needs and feelings.. not the other person.. or persons. I can't be an 'owner'.. I consider the outcome for everyone else too much."* - Wed Nov 25 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed. "Think of it this way: An owner can use you as he, or she, wish. When you are of no purpose to her, or him, you will be thrown away. It's not a matter of trying to keep you around until you are of use. First sign of uselessness, you're as good as trash. You're just a tool to the 'owner'. Someone like me don't really.. care.. for other people, but I have morals. I won't throw you away like you're nothing when you took the time out to be useful to me.. At most I'd keep you around and feed you the same food you helped me attain."* - Wed Nov 25 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "There are some owners that don't throw away their dolls, yes. But my statement stands. The doll would be put on a shelf on in a box for mere memory purposes. The doll won't be played with, the doll won't be acknowledged, the doll will be forgotten until the next doll, the one he found to be useful after the first, is sitting next to the first doll on that shelf or lying next to the first doll in that box. It's an endless cycle. That is why I can't be an owner and don't want to be an owner. Honestly.. If I was a 'doll', I'd want to be thrown away rather than watch my 'owner' find use in other 'dolls'.. I refuse to be anyones after thought."* - Wed Nov 25 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I won't sit on a shelf, he won't put me there. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat him if he puts me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Even if he doesn't taste good. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat anyone who tries to put me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No shelves! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No other dolls! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No dolls, no dolls, no dolls. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Little boxes all in a row... - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened. Did he say something wrong? Did he hit a nerve that was supposed be nonexistent? Did he say the right thing that struck realization within hey faltering self-conscious?

He knew that if Thirteen was to awake from his slumber and see her like this that he'd be pissed and Hokori would be reprimanded. Hokori slowly shook his head, refusing to make this resort to that; he didn't graduate the top of his class for nothing. He pushed himself off of the wall and paced himself closer to Yuriko. He takes a second to examine her crazed state before standing next to her, faces the wall with his back, and slides down to her level.

"They say.. it's the past artifacts that depict the outcome of the future. Whether or not a doll is placed on a shelf, the effect that that doll has while it's useful would determine what his, or her, owner looks for in the future dolls. The doll is as much of a manipulator as the owner.."* - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Dollies dusty...dust--dusty..dust dolls dusty. - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) pushed his head back, resting it on the wall behind him. He sets his gaze back on the ceiling.

Her mental breakdown wasn't understood by Hokori. He was a human but lacked the ability to comprehend what form of mental tragedy that could occur when someone is used and thrown away --- it was life that he long since accepted. There was no way to prevent this. It was the basic fundamentals of being an existing being of this world, no way around it.

He sighs and shrugs again. "I'm going to take it that you view yourself as a 'doll' and you have a 'owner' you're wary about. I don't exactly know who you, on a personal level, are.. nor do I know who your 'owner' is, but my statement stands." He pauses for a second then continues. "You're as much of a manipulator as him. You want to make sure you're not on the shelf? Stop being a 'doll'. You want to make sure you're not put in a box? Stop being a 'doll'. If you like the role of 'doll', then make sure you, the 'doll', have as much control over your 'owner' as your 'owner' has of you. The owner tells you to jump? Tell the owner to give you a boost. The owner wants you to say something? Tell him to give you a synonym."* - Wed Nov 25 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) || Another sigh is released. He was full aware of who her 'owner' was, but didn't want to add shame to her current state of mind but blatantly calling names.

"Being in charge and having an owner is two different things. Think of it as rankings. Yori is 'in charge' of me, yet he has a higher-up as well. Listen.. You may have no emotions like humans and you may be viewed and rendered a 'doll', but in some way, shape or form.. you still have a lot of influence here. Your 'owner' tells you what to do.. not what to think and want to.. want. If anything," he leans in to whisper to her, "you're each other's owner."* - Wed Nov 25 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) chuckled a bit.

"You speak like I'm not here to stop that, Domina.~ Come now.. with me here you have nothing to worry about.. I'll be by your side.. even when I'm not physically there."* - Wed Nov 25 13:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) prayed that the rolled up blunt in his pocket wasn't screaming to her.* - Wed Nov 25 13:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Whaaa? - Wed Nov 25 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Let's not.. call yourself that. - Wed Nov 25 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Then what? - Wed Nov 25 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe I'm a tree. - Wed Nov 25 13:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes trailed down to her lips then diverts back to her eyes.* - Wed Nov 25 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's a desert plant. - Wed Nov 25 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Filled with lots of water. - Wed Nov 25 13:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Right then.. - Wed Nov 25 13:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll take your word for it. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So what do you think I am? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) went to cough but nearly choked when she asked the question.* - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Ehh? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Oh.. What you are..? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: That's simple. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: You're a 'unique'. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think that's a thing. - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Want to make a bet? - Wed Nov 25 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A bet? - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that like a game? - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ...I suppose so.. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I like games, okay. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Wed Nov 25 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. I bet you I can show you visual proof of a 'unique'. - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But. - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: How? - Wed Nov 25 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't think too hard on it.. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. accept. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Wed Nov 25 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) makes it to his feet, dusting the back of his blank jumpsuit off. He glances down at Yuriko and offers his hand to her, suggesting she takes it and uses it as aid to get up. If she took it, he'd firmly clench his muscles and pull her up. Hokori would then lead her to the closest free room.* - Wed Nov 25 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) advances into a small room. The only thing available thing in the room was a very small bathroom, a living room and a single stove. The bed was located in the living room, giving no free space for a couch. He leads her directly to the bathroom, but not before maneuvering behind her and slowly, cautiously, placing his hands over her eyes. Once in the bathroom, if she allowed him to guide her and block her sight, he'd make her face the mirror over the sink, "alright.." He'd then move his hands away, making her look at herself. "It's okay to try and compare yourself to something.. it helps you find yourself.. But sometimes being 'unique' is the best thing in the world. That, Domina-.. Lady Yuriko.. is why 'you' are the 'unique'."* - Wed Nov 25 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times as she jumped back. He instinctively takes her by the hips and gently nudges her back into her former position, wanting her to stand firm and stare at  herself. He leans his head more into her, resting his chin on her shoulder just a bit. "That's.. you," he says in a hushed tone. The look on his face told her that he was slightly confused, he wasn't aware that she never saw a clear reflection of herself. Still however, he keeps his skepticism to himself. "That's how you look to us."* - Wed Nov 25 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I see why.. she calls herself succulent.. - Wed Nov 25 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She's.. soft.. - Wed Nov 25 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) saw her smile and nods to himself. A smirk crept on his face for just a half second before fading with all his efforts behind its disposal. He lets go of her hips and inches back a few paces, allowing her a full view of herself without him in the picture. "From this point.. stop comparing yourself to something, don't worry about what you are.. just consider yourself a 'unique' and go from there. And if you think about it.. a 'unique' fits anywhere.. A succulent is only mainly found in the desert.. stranded there. Do you understand?"* - Wed Nov 25 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) nodded again, feeling slight accomplishment from her saying she understood what he was saying. He tucks his gloved hands back into his pockets and shrugs a bit, "the other guards don't have the balls to speak the truth. Morals go a long way if they're at the right place. Besides," he pauses and chuckles a bit, "like I said.. you're more than just a cute face and conflicted conscious."* - Wed Nov 25 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And morals are good to have? - Wed Nov 25 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) blinks a few times. "It means you're more than what the eye can see and more than what someone tells you what you are compared to what you see yourself as. And.. having balls means having the.. uhh, courage..? to do something no one else was willing to do." He pauses. "Does she know what courage is?" he asks himself..

"Courage, if you didn't know, is when you work past your fear and do something.. 'Having the balls' to do something is a reference to what a male has in his pants as well.. A man that is claimed to have no balls is deemed not a man at all --- whether it's there physically or not. As for having morals and if it's good to have them.. it depends. Someone can have morals but be so little that they're better off having none. Some may have a bunch of morals but views contrast what they are representing; it's basically something you stand by.."* - Wed Nov 25 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) chuckles a few times, "eh.. I got used to it a few years ago."* - Wed Nov 25 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I think I'm glad I'm not human. - Wed Nov 25 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I would be dead if I was human, probably. - Wed Nov 25 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I'll.. take your word for it. - Wed Nov 25 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) looked down at her. He wasn't bothered by the staring contest and closeness of their bodies --- nothing was going on..* - Wed Nov 25 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: How determined are you to gain these.. human.. characteristics? - Wed Nov 25 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's scent was of the typical light sake and a hint of.. herbal.. practices. It wasn't strong, but it wasn't weak. It was a fair strength that was blended with cologne with the intentions to mask the two main scents. The cologne was smooth and basic manly, fruitfulness wasn't apparent in the smell.

He continues to stare down at Yuriko, narrowing his eyes just a bit. "Is it really that simple? I mean I know the tests and stuff, but is it something 'you'.. want..? for yourself?"* - Wed Nov 25 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened a bit, "forgive me Domina-." He sees her head lower and immediately takes his right hand out of his pocket and raised it to her chin, using his index finger to make contact and raise her head a bit. "Once you've come to the point where your emotions can be controlled, it'll all be easier. I promise you. Not many people are able to control their emotions, but the selective few that do know have yet to perish."* - Wed Nov 25 14:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) noticed how her lips parted. He felt kind of bad at how things were playing out. He didn't go through all this training just form any bonds with his Domina, but the way she reacted to such an innocent gesture where he wanted her to keep her head up.. it made him feel like she was taken advantage of. How does a being with no corresponding emotions and desires instinctively part her lips when her chin is lifted?

He sighs. His fingers gently rub against her skin before his entire arm and hand lower. The look he gives her is softened a simply.. caring. Not in a passionate rather, but caring in general to where things were put on a new perspective for him.

"That cloud will clear soon enough. It's just a matter of you putting up a fight and seek out the point where emotions are a buff to what you're capable of rather than a hindrance." 
* - Wed Nov 25 14:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's voice follows his expression's lead. It softens to a hush as he slowly shook his head. The more he talked with Yuriko is the more he realized that she was truly oblivious to a lot of things. Her thought process was so.. unique.. that comprehending what she may of knew from didn't know took more than just glances at her. She was much more complex that what she presented herself to be --- if anything, she's as complex as it gets.

"It's simply.. care.. Nothing laced with it --- no lust, no passion, nothing.. just me caring.."* - Wed Nov 25 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) nodded. "Yes. Simple.. care."* - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why has no one else ever looked at me that way? - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There are those who said they love me. - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is love not care? - Wed Nov 25 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Love and care exist together, yes.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love is more.. complicated.. than that.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Love looks more.... painful. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: This looks calm. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Love looks like it eats the person up. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: As for why no one else ever looked at you that way.. They probably mixed it with love and it came out --- - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It -feels- like it eats you up. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, love can do that.. - Wed Nov 25 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That was the one I looked forward to. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But then it felt fake. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love is the easiest to obtain, but hardest to uphold. - Wed Nov 25 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It is also the easiest to alter.. no matter what your intentions are. - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Easy to alter? - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Love.. goes by interests. If you love something and lose interest in them, you're naturally going to lose your love as well. - Wed Nov 25 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like an owner that puts a doll on a shelf? - Wed Nov 25 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It can be compared to that, yes.. but it's more genuine. Once you truly have interest in something or someone and gained the sense of love for them, you'll always have some form of that 'love' in you for that specific thing or person. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not you placing it on a shelf to add in some collection, but it's something that helped you mold into what you are.. or can be. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like Ortho and Yosuke. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Uh, sure.. - Wed Nov 25 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I understand. - Wed Nov 25 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Good, good. - Wed Nov 25 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I've never talked to a guard this long. - Wed Nov 25 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I've become a therapist.. - Wed Nov 25 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) glances up at the mirror and saw how close they really were. He coughs and looks back down at his Domina.

"So, uh.. long story short.. You're.. the 'unique'."* - Wed Nov 25 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 25 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: So, um.. - Wed Nov 25 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) looks around. He didn't know what to say, their closeness was starting to.. intimidate..? him.* - Wed Nov 25 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) calms himself down. He takes in a deep breath and slowly releases it, centering his nerves and just relaxing. He looks back down at Yuriko and met her gaze full on.

"May I ask you something a bit.. personal..?"* - Wed Nov 25 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You can ask me anything. - Wed Nov 25 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..What is it that makes you okay with being a.. 'doll'? - Wed Nov 25 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It is part of me. - Wed Nov 25 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I am made to have an owner. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I only recently became a doll though. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It was something I never heard before. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: My owner says I am his doll. - Wed Nov 25 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I guess I can understand that it's 'part' of you, but I'm still not sure if you're telling whether or not you're 'okay' with it. - Wed Nov 25 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes it feels different than what I expected. - Wed Nov 25 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) blinks, "forgive me Domina.. Do you wish to change the topic..?"* - Wed Nov 25 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no...it's okay.. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe...don't tell him. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: We talked about this. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: What you and I discuss will only stay between us. - Wed Nov 25 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... - Wed Nov 25 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If.... - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I ended up on the shelf. - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ....meaning... - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I was put back in the room and locked up again. - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would the guards stop it? - Wed Nov 25 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: Most likely not, but I'll resign from being a guard and be sure to take you out of that room and off of that shelf. - Wed Nov 25 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you make sure he's put in a room if he does that to me? - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: This...it isn't all his... it's mine.... Yosuke gave me it. - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But he's my owner so I let him have it. - Wed Nov 25 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If he tries to lock me up I want him put back in his room. - Wed Nov 25 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: I assure you.. if he tries to do such a thing, he'll be place in a special room. - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't...let him find out. - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He wouldn't like this. - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He would punish me. - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Punish you..? - Wed Nov 25 15:28:00 2015
