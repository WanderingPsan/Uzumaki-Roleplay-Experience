Their beliefs falter in comparison to my loyalty to you, they will know not the true generosity you show them. I, my lord, will force your way over them; each of them, my lord, will soon understand what true wrath is."

Erebus' body was riddled with scars, physical proof that life had no preference for him. His skin was tight, however, showing that despite the obstacles placed in front of him thus far, he has overcame them with nothing less than victory. There was a spoiled aura coating Erebus, some may say that it was the insanity that swelled within his mind; others claim it was the fact that he was the outcast for so long that resulted in him having an unfamiliar sensation.

Erebus advanced forth a single step, allowing his intimacy to the mountain to diminish. His posture was unorthodox for the most part, yet it was clear he was in complete control of his physique and balance. He lingered in that solitary spot.* - Fri Sep 18 14:09:16 2015

Erebus paces into the courtyard, each step he took resembled that of a titan. His hair flowed down his back, wooly and thick. Erebus' build favored that of a slender average man, but it was clear he was nothing short of a tank. His eyes were, by now, fixated on the single being within the immediate area, examining his stature. Erebus edged forward a bit, opening his jaw and readying his tongue for him to speak.

The battle cry did nothing short of leading the pulse of his right arm. The limb stretched over his chest and allowed his open fist to take grasp of the large sword he harbored on his back. Without much effort, the sword is unhooked and slashed forward, intentions of hacking off Haru's head completely.

"Are you happy, Lord Jashin!? I've done it! All in your name, all in your name! I've done it!"* - Fri Sep 18 21:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) paid the women no mind, but granted her an audibly exhale of breath. He had nothing to say to her, so her demand did nothing but fall upon deaf ears. However, despite her rather disrespectful approach, she will be respected with a proper death in the name of Jashin soon.* - Fri Sep 18 22:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Soon, my lord.. - Fri Sep 18 22:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She will understand.. soon. - Fri Sep 18 22:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh come onnnnn. I just wante- Can you at-least say your name? - Fri Sep 18 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Twice you've been asked for your name. - Fri Sep 18 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) observed Ushinawa's approach; his peripherals were as good as his main view. Another exhale of breath sounded from Erebus, giving them no satisfaction on identification. Still, however, he raised his head ever so slightly to grant them a full view of his face. His jaw opens; each centimeter was heard by a low pitched crack of his joints.

"I bear not a name, for I am not a mortal to be named."* - Fri Sep 18 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But you are a shinobi of Kumogakure, so you will answer me. - Fri Sep 18 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.* - Fri Sep 18 22:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I bear no name. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm, well you see.. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Shinobi from Kumogakure, rather they be man, woman, or Ninken are given names. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then with said names. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Comes identification numbers. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It is verbatim. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So, lets start this over. - Fri Sep 18 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's right arm pulsed, raising to the headband that was around his waist; his index finger pointed to said headband* - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I bear no name, for my journey only started here. I did not go through your mortal affairs of educational system, for I am not of the mortal breed. - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Just... leave him alone. - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's head jerked to the right, placing his chin on top his shoulder. Slowly, he creeks his neck back into place; each step of the way was granted with an audibly crack of his bones snapping against one another.* - Fri Sep 18 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I share not the art of deception. I am merely misunderstood; fore I am not a follower of your judicial system for shinobi ranking. I bear not a name; fore I had no maternities to label. I commit no sin of trickery. - Fri Sep 18 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's focus was not set on a single platform, but on a general basis. However, once the handseal was woven together by Ushinawa, the Jashin follower granted the Uchiha his full attention. Sadly, as a result, Erebus fell under a Genjutsu.* - Fri Sep 18 23:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Ugh.... Ushi always. But he looks fine. - Fri Sep 18 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) cared not for death or life as a whole, it was nothing but something granted or extracted by lord Jashin. Is mind easily succumbed to the effects of the Genjutsu, providing Ushinawa with the ability to do as he pleased.

"I bear no name; fore I was never granted one. I am simply walking on my path. My purpose is not of worldly affairs, but to follow the guidelines of my religion."* - Fri Sep 18 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was knocked out, nothing left for him to do. He told the truth about everything that was asked. He was born within Kumogakure, but was never given a name. His beliefs didn't grant him with the common labeling at birth, rather than the person granting themselves a name as their progress through life. If Ushinawa was not able to understand that, then there was a major flaw in this doujutsu activated Genjutsu.

Apparently, he was kicked out of his own homeland; sent off to Kirigakure.* - Fri Sep 18 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright.. - Fri Sep 18 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: What do you want me to prepare? - Fri Sep 18 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Am I going? - Fri Sep 18 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 18 23:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: But whose gon keep watch? - Fri Sep 18 23:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The same people who kept watch when Niza left to Kirigakure. - Fri Sep 18 23:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 18 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) was shipped off, a bird following close pursuit during the travels. Whether or not he would remember being questioned, Ushinawa did grant himself a newfound enemy. Nevertheless, a formidable ocular ability was something Erebus would train his mind to counter; be it normal means or not.* - Fri Sep 18 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Congrats as Mizukage. - Fri Sep 18 23:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I don't know who this new guy is, but Tethys would never approve of him -omit- - Fri Sep 18 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Meh... - Sat Sep 19 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) ' journey came to a momentary halt. His eyes trailed from person to person, granting them with nothing more than his ocular acknowledgment. Erebus progressed further into the courtyard, positioning himself off into the distance, having no reason to ally his personal space with anothers.* - Sat Sep 19 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They are just like the rest.. - Sat Sep 19 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Those penetrative eyes, piercing through me with judgment. - Sat Sep 19 00:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I do nothing but keep to myself, but still.. they stare. - Sat Sep 19 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: One by one, my lord.. - Sat Sep 19 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: One by one. - Sat Sep 19 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's fingers twitched.* - Sat Sep 19 00:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Excuse me... Who are you? - Sat Sep 19 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They seek knowledge of me, my lord. - Sat Sep 19 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: But they know not, nor will understand, the path I chose in your name. - Sat Sep 19 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I fall victim to their minds, but I will surely stand in your name. - Sat Sep 19 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: My lord, do I make your proud..? - Sat Sep 19 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's left arm pulsates, an audible crack being heard from a joint snapping.* - Sat Sep 19 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They will soon understand us, my lord. - Sat Sep 19 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They are unknowing to your higher power. - Sat Sep 19 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... Okay, really need you to speak to me here.' - Sat Sep 19 00:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's focus was fixated southward, giving Jin no satisfaction of visual contact. However, with his peripherals detailing the slight approach of the shinobi, Erebus managed to creek his neck to the side a bit; the only form of communication he would grant Jin until the proper questions were asked.* - Sat Sep 19 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They approach, my lord. They know not of what they're closing in on, but they still approach. - Sat Sep 19 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Does this anger you..? - Sat Sep 19 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) thinks: Is this dude alright? - Sat Sep 19 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Hm - Sat Sep 19 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: ..Hey. - Sat Sep 19 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Yo. - Sat Sep 19 00:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's interest was sparked. The mentioning of his beloved scythe caused a physical response, but nothing major. His neck turned more, but not too much to give Jin the fulfillment of a straight forward answer. Nevertheless, the right question was asked; he shall grant Jin a verbal answer to that question and that question only.

"I bear not a name, for I am not a mortal to be named."* - Sat Sep 19 00:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm... worried of why a guy... holding a object like he has, is in our village. I'm just asking questions to learn why hes here. - Sat Sep 19 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) thinks: He's definitely scared. - Sat Sep 19 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: It's just a scythe. - Sat Sep 19 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head; it was a shame how a single being can rouse up such a commotion.* - Sat Sep 19 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: That guy over there has a hammer. - Sat Sep 19 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: ... - Sat Sep 19 00:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I am labeled as uncanny, my lord.. - Sat Sep 19 00:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But, I know that guy over there. I don't know who he is. - Sat Sep 19 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's neck snapped back into place, allowing his ocular focus to set upon the likes of Baen.

"I ally myself not with mortals, but only the one that make my path clear. This Zetsumo being has sparked no interest in I; fore I only bear attentiveness to my higher power."* - Sat Sep 19 00:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) || The words of Koeki fell on deaf ears, the relevance of a woman was nonexistent at the moment.

Erebus' attention remained on the questions spewed from Baen, granting him the answers of most importance.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's attention was finally given to Jin, a feat that Jin accomplished without having to do much other than stand there. The Chuunin was examined thoroughly by Erebus, allowing the Jashinist to come to a crucial decision. "Tell me, Jin.. What path are you on..?"* - Sat Sep 19 01:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's arms pulsed, his muscles contracting and loosening as Jin spoke. The titan-like man edged forward, aiming to lessen the distance between himself and Jin.

"You wish for people to.. respect you..?"* - Sat Sep 19 01:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed, his pupils scanning over Jin's frame. A chuckle came from the Jashinist, a lack of humor chuckle; it was so sarcastic, that whoever caused the chuckle could easily die from sheer embarrassment. Erebus' neck shifts to the right, causing a few bones to snap against each other and provide an audible crack.

"You seek respect for the deeds you've done. That's foolish. Instead, you should seek the assurance that the deeds you've done suffice your way, your set path.. Only then will true respect be given." Erebus points to Koeki. "I've said nothing to her, yet she already made a judgment of me. She, your renowned Mizukage, will die at the hands of Zetsumo with ease." His arm retracts before extending once more to point at Baen. "Once you have an open mind like him, Jin of the Respect Seeker, you are only living on borrowed time."* - Sat Sep 19 01:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) 's focus inched over to Koeki, providing her with his momentary attention as she spoke. Her words didn't fall of deaf ears this time around, and it was for that reason Koeki made herself look like a typical woman in an argument that only makes sense in her maze of a mind.

"You speak of snap-judgment, a method of thought process I could comprehend at the start of your lecture. However, your last statement contradicts everything you explained. Like a classic closed-minded person, your true mindset illuminates the more you talk. Snap-judgment is something a person of curiosity makes when they've experienced something, or someone, of the unknown; keyword, curiosity. If I was of no relevance, then no snap judgment would have been made by you. You would've continued to host your side conversation over there as I stood here minding my own business; a feat you, the new Mizukage, don't seem to have learned thus far in her life."

A pause came from Erebus, he allowed Jin to speak until the Chuunin halted.

"You wish to be acknowledged for feats you have yet to accomplish, an ending mindset rather than a starting. Your path is meant to be in drive, not reverse. If you walk this path known as life backwards, then your death will be your start while your start never started."* - Sat Sep 19 02:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: An ending goal is always nesscary, because how else are you going to find the path best suited for travel. You might see it as a path to death, but I just see it as difficult one to overcome. - Sat Sep 19 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: An ending goal is made at the start; you have yet to even prepare for the starting line. - Sat Sep 19 02:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We'll see soon what happens to people with our different ideals, there is a war coming. If its what you say, I'll be dead soon enough. If it what I say I'll come out for the better. - Sat Sep 19 02:01:48 2015
