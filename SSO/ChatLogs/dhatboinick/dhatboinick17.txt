<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) fixed his attention of Takeda, watching every move he made and listened to everyone word he spoke. To be completely honest, this Fireball Jutsu thing seems extremely easy. It is for that same exact reason why, in the of Takeda's lecture, Ortho took it upon himself to attempt the jutsu. The necessary handseals were strung together in marvelous haste and the kneading of his chakra within his stomach began. The speed at which Ortho decided to knead and expel his chakra forced him to do nothing but fail; only a small like flame was produced and quickly extinguished.

A slight grunt comes from Ortho as his failed attempt. Rather than taking that anger out on Takeda, like he felt like doing, he would center his mind and chakra network. Slowly, at a reasonable pace, he'd string the necessary handseals together once more and allow his chakra to vigorously heat up within his stomach. Upon doing so, with actual perfection, he'd take in a deep breath and expel a large fireball.* - Fri Oct  9 15:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, allowing the oxygen to act as a stimulant for both his mind and body. The concentration needed for this technique wasn't exactly plentiful, but he was just now learning it so it'd take more than usual. Ortho forms a single handseals, using that as a meditative safe haven. From there, with a sudden burst of chakra toward the soles of his feet, he'd attempt to step off and plant his feet firmly on to the surface of the water. Instantly, as if he wasn't even trying to send a steady flow of chakra to his feet, Ortho dunked straight into the water. It took a few seconds for him to pull himself out, but eventually he did.

This time around, however, with a mug on his face, Ortho would lessen his haste. He formed the same handseal again and allowed his chakra to first knead within his stomach and slowly seep to the remaining of his body. At this point, after a few intakes and exhales of breath to center his mind and chakra network, Ortho would take a single step on to the surface of the water. He allowed his foot to get a feel of the chakra needed at first before planting his opposing foot. Eventually, as if he's been doing this for years, Ortho stood atop the water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Ambrocio's pivot forward was no less than amazing; that's something that had to be given in full due. In retaliation, however, Ortho took the stand and decided to break his usual noncaring stature and become a form of hero. The reasoning behind this was simple: he can't bear to see a female, of any age, harmed. That being said, with the altering of his blunt in the corner of his mouth, the Uchiha strung a series of handseals together. Upon doing so, even after trying to protect his blunt, a massive torrent of water rush forward. Its aim wasn't directly at Ambrocio, but the immediate front of the rampage figure. Naturally, if the male decided to continue his pursuit, he'd eventually get caught by the torrent of water and pushed back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's onslaught of handseals continued. The fluency of them was divine and the speed was marvelous, both allied with the kneading of his chakra. Surely, by the look on Ortho's face, a damaging blow was not the intent; however, a nullifying affect was the goal. With the outpour of his chakra, from his arms and palms, came the pulsating presence of an electrical surge. The goal was to use the water spawned previously to stop Ambrocio in his tracks, hopefully before any form of physical contact could be made.

Upon hearing Hideki's words, however, if Ortho was lucky he'd be able to tag along as well. After all, he just wanted to stop the rampaging male, not be known as a backstabber.* - Fri Oct  9 19:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was finally getting the lessons he so direly needed. The instructions given to him was relatively easily, but due to him knowing not a single thing about Genjutsu made it a tad bit challenging. Still, however, Ortho came at it head first. That being said, the young lad would centers his chakra within his stomach and string together the proper handseals. Upon doing so, in a quick burst of chakra, he'd make an attempt to form the illusions. This, however, was a complete fail due to the fact that a constant flow was provided.

With that in mind, Ortho would restart. He starts off with taking in a sleep breath and allowing his mind to fixate itself on the flow of chakra. Slowly, but surely, his chakra would begin to seep out his body and engulf the immediate area. Upon doing so, Ortho would string together necessary handseal whilst closing his eyes. Once they opened, he could see numerous illusions duplicates of himself. "..Hmm.."* - Fri Oct  9 21:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) Is this truly the world we live in? Where at the drop of a hat destruction rains down on the heads of the innocent? Where the youngest of lives are taken due to revenge and there are only a select few that can retaliate? Where the very same people with the power to put their guard up and punch back are too intimidating to advance forth? Where all you have after the smoke is cleared is the clothes on your pack, the loose change in your pockets and the intelligence you gathered from birth to this point? Where you have to question whether or not you too should have your life ended because you are not one of the selective that can do a damn thing about the destruction of your home? Is this truly the world we live in?

Is this truly the life that a shinobi must live? The life where death is nothing more than a common occurrence? The life where you don't know if the last time you'll see your loved one is when you two argue over a disagreement and both walked off with tension still thick? The life where you put on your armor, grasp your sword and know that even those two key elements may not be enough to allow you come back home to make up with your loved one? The life where you eat dinner with your loved one tonight, but sit a lonely table tomorrow? Is this truly the life that a shinobi must live?

"Within.. mere seconds. Within mere seconds the peaceful foundation of the Leaf, my village.. my home, destroyed. No remorse, no hesitation; simple child play in comparison to the strength of that damn beast. Its overwhelming power forcing us to refuge here, in this.. village, with nothing more than the items he had in our possession at the time. A mockery of our integrity, a mockery of our way of live, a mockery of.. us. The detached look his damn eyes, piercing through my wellbeing and destroying my soul.."

Ortho stood on the outskirts of Amegakure. His fists clenched as tight as can be and his head slightly lowered. Tears swell and poured from his eyes relentlessly, gravity taking effect and dragging the liquid to the ground. At the age of only fifteen, Ortho has experienced one of the hardest things a shinobi can go through; the instant decision to abandon his village to save his own hide and live on to see a tomorrow. The instant decision to exit the radius of destruction and watch a beat run rampant on the place you whole heartedly loved; evading your home and metaphorically spitting on your sense of privacy. This was all for what; revenge? The tears continued to pour down the teen's face.

"Now look where I am, a proud.. Leaf.. shinobi forced to live amongst outsiders for my own safety. I'm forced to make do with the little that I have compared to the plenty I had; all because of what? A rampant beast..? A beast that.. that cared little to none about my life..?! I've come this far in my shinobi career for what!? To be forced to leave behind my home!? My family!? FOR MY OWN S-"

Ortho couldn't continue that thought. Was he truly that selfish..? Should he have gone further into the village in an attempt to save as much people as he could? Did he even have the strength to do so-. Strength. Did he have strength..? Was he strong then? Is he strong now? What's the difference between a few days ago and now? Would it truly make a difference if went into the midst of danger to be a nobleman and tempt fate? What now, though? What should he do now? Stand here and cry? Allow his emotions to render him mentally incapable? But would there be a difference if he goes back and try to find survivors? He doesn't even know if the village is even there anymore. A beast that large could lay waste to any building it pleased, much less a human. Or was it that Ortho was, and still is, scared?

"I'm.. sorry. I should've- but I couldn-.. Please, forgive me-.. I know I didn't try my best but I'll aveng-.." Avenge? Is that the cement of the path her walk? Was the outcome of a, thus far, decade long shinobi career vengeance? Who, or what, was he going to avenge? On who, or what, was he going to exact vengeance on? Why was vengeance and avenge even an option at this point? Now, where Ortho stood physically, mentally and emotionally, he wasn't ready to do anything of the sorts. He wasn't able to step up to no man and strike the intimidation needed to send chills up and down another's spine. Hell, he wasn't even able to make a puppy whimper much less a true enemy. At this stage of his life, Ortho had to come to a decision.

"I.. refuse to stand idly by. No longer will I play victim, no longer will there be a stronger than I. No.. longer. I've come too far to allow anyone look down on me as if I am nothing.. I've come too far.. too far to let anyone tell me that I am lesser than them.." The tears that poured down Ortho's cheek became hot; similar to acid against paper. The feeling of helplessness ravishing the mind and heart of the lad, denying his mind the freedom to explore all routes; it was that of tunnel vision that led Ortho to succumb to this painful fate. It is tunnel vision and sheer anger that he isn't able to see a way out-. See, he can't see.. his way out. His eyes were open, but still his light was dimming as he backed away from the light and into the darkness. He just.. couldn't see.




This self-righteous path that everyone so desperately clings on to was nothing more than trickery. Treason to the true meaning of life and the denial of what's really happening before them, all of this was pure; a desperate attempt to disconnect themselves from reality and prevent their minds from succumbing to what fate has stored for them. Ortho stood by himself in this world, everyone he knew was dying and quite frankly he expected it. Reisen, a female that had made a big impact in Ortho's life thus far, died before his very eyes. There was nothing he could do, nor was there anything he wanted to do. His main concern was why her assassinator even existed. What could Reisen have possibly done to have someone go to such extreme extent to kill her?

It wasn't until Reisen's life was already snatched away when Ortho heard the truth. Reisen failed to safely evacuate Suitengu from Sunagakure, and the end result was the boy's death. Suitengu was young, yes, but that lad gave Ortho a meaning. That lad gave Ortho a path to walk on with a flashlight that had unlimited battery power. Where was Ortho supposed to go now? What was he supposed to do? He's lost and the only person that could lead him down the right path was gone. The only person that made things make sense was obliterated; what was he supposed to do..?

"N-No.. It's not.. true. He's not d-dead.. Injured, probably.. but not-.." Ortho's body pulsates, his emotions running rampant and the understanding he had of this world been shattered. His sanity add deep cracks in it and quite frankly, at any moment he's going to break. At any moment the quiet and standoff-ish Ortho was going to explode and the only thing that's going to be able to stop him is him. The only thing that's going to be able to make things make sense once again is him, and that's only after he finds jumps from the stone he's standing on and progress further into life. The only thing that remotely remained the same at this point was the fact that Ortho was, and still is, too weak to do anything.

Power and strength are two different things. You can have the power to get revenge and payback the debt of those that did you wrong, but that doesn't mean you have the strength to withstand sudden lose and move on. At this point, Ortho had neither. At this point and time, Ortho was a mere Genin, Konohagakure born, trying to scrape and claw for any form of power he can get in hopes that strength will follow close pursuit. At this point and time, Ortho was a mere boy trying to live the life of a man without any form of coach to tell him what it truly took to uphold that title. Ortho was simply a lost puppy.

Ortho stands by his lonesome in this dark room within Kumogakure. His eyes was suffering from a serious leakage for tears poured down relentlessly. His knees were tucked into his chest and his arms hugged his shins, the common pose for someone lost in the dark. He was scared, quite honestly. He was scared that the outside world would chew him up and spit him out with relative ease. He was scared that at this point, there was nothing more for him to do. He was scared that at his time, he should just roll over and die-.

"If you sit there too long, you'll end up missing the next training session with Hideki. I know you of all people wouldn't want that.." That voice- Could it be? Ortho's head snapped up and his eyes jolted to the right, settling on the semi-transparent frame of Suitengu. Ortho's jaw creeks open, the aspiration closing in on the bed Ortho was sitting on and simply stood there. "I know what you're thinking, Ortho. My death isn't the end of it all. If anything, haha, it should be fuel to your fire. At this point and time, Ortho, you control your destiny. Only you can change your fate and make the best out of yourself. Don't let these hurdles keep you down. If you trip, get up and keep hopping; that's.. what a true Powerful and Strong ninja would do."

Before Ortho could even rebuttal, Suitengu faded from his eye sight. The words echoes through his mind, hitting every bit of doubt unforgivingly and spawning something new; spawning something that made Ortho feel warm on the inside, as if the coldness of his heart was finally covered by a thick comforter. The tears that streamed down Ortho's face slowly subsided as he stared of into the same direction Suitengu briefly stood.

"S-Suitengu.. I-I.. I hear what you're saying, but- How am I supposed to-.. I don't see a point-.." Ortho's mind was conflicted and he knew it. He knew that Suitengu was right, but his own self-doubt rivaled this sense of reality of this all. The room became quiet fast; no words, no movements. Ortho simply stared off and allowed his mind to wander.

"I-I  understand, Suitengu.. For you.. I'll progress. I'll show you that life isn't.. going to keep me down anymore.. I'll show you.." Ortho's eyes widen. Reality finally struck him. His mind finally unclogged itself and accepted the words of Suitengu with no rebuttal, just the purity of it cleansing the devil of doubt. "I've.. come this far, a-and.. I know that.. you wouldn't want this for me.. I under..stand, Suitengu.. I'll walk down my path with my head held high and.. you words guiding me.." Ortho's eyes momentarily close, a smirk of confidence plastering itself on his face and a simple nod given to himself. For the first time since they were attacked in Konohagakure, Ortho felt like he had his peace of mind. He felt like everything made some sort of sense and the remaining that didn't make sense was his job to understand it. Another nod of assurance was given to himself as he opens his lids and reveals a red pupil with a single tomoe swirling around a black center point. "I.. understand.." * - Fri Oct  9 23:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasted no time. He steps further into the lake and stood beside Elon, mimicking his posture and handseals. The speed at which Ortho's hand formed the seals was impeccable, but he wasn't the type to toot his own horn. The general concentration of chakra needed to perform this jutsu was basic, but due to Ortho already knowing Raging Waves, his body instinctively generated the necessary amount of chakra for that jutsu. As a result, from distinctive differences, Ortho failed to perform the water gun technique on the first try.

A grunt of annoyance was supplied as he looked off at his jutsu. His eyebrows furrow in and his hands speed through the seals once more. However, this time around Ortho paced his chakra flow and allow a nerfed amount to settle within his stomach. Upon doing so, after allowing the chakra to liquefy, Ortho would pucker his lips and expel a reasonable torrent of water out. Once it was extinguished, he'd look toward Elon and give a smirk. "..Next..?"* - Sat Oct 10 00:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) examined the mud that Elon was spewing. He raises a skeptical eyebrow whilst nodding his head in understanding. The jutsu was truly similar to the Water Gun technique, but it required much thicker chakra. When Elon finished, Ortho would take his pose and string together the necessary handseals. His chakra kneads within his stomach and begin thickening, an attempt to make it turn into mud. Upon doing so, after puckering his lips, Ortho would spew out what his chakra turned into. At first try, his chakra was still liquid with hints of earthly substances, but not completely mud.

Rather than being annoyed at his failure, Ortho simply nodded to himself and gave it another go. He understood that his chakra needed to thicken and until he was able to match his kneading speed with his handseal speed, he'd have to pace down his hand signs. With that in mind, after syncing the two and allowing his chakra to swell enough, he'd pucker his lips once more and unleash the river of mud.* - Sat Oct 10 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paces himself into the campus, fixing his eyes on the Mizukage. It never dawned on him how ugly she kept herself with that massive hat and toothpick-like frame from the neck down; Kirigakure fashion must be disintegrating. Nevertheless, Ortho would keep his hands tucked into his pockets and allowed his tone of voice to show no form of emotions. "Excuse me.."* - Sat Oct 10 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) walts up, hands tucked in his pockets and a single blunt resting at the right corner of his mouth. His eyes panned over to Ambrocio, resting on him for a few minutes before shifting to Cypher; Cypher was a person Ortho only saw a few times, but has made himself known throughout the group. A nod of acknowledgment was given the two males before Ortho's gaze fell upon Yoshiko. It examined her frame for merely a second or two before giving her a half nod; no point in giving someone full acknowledgment without knowing who they are and what they're about. No words came from Ortho, he simply stood there and watched whatever was happening --- or not happening.* - Sat Oct 10 16:18:20 2015

"Listen, you can either tell us your name so we can be off or we force it out of you. Just like us, you probably don't have time to waste, so make it either on us both-.." Ortho was rudely interrupted, the handseals of Gakuto weaving themselves together as a massive ball of fire raged forward. In retaliation, and haste, Ortho would string together his own handseals and knead chakra within his stomach. By time the fireball was to make contact with them, Ortho would unleash a power torrent of water. Afterward, while he continued to clash with the fireball, Ortho would form a second handseal and allowed a shadow clone to spawn to his right.

Upon its creation, the clone would break off into the distance while forming his own succession of handseals. By this point, after kneading his own chakra, the clone would extend his arms with open palms and allowed a surge of lightning to pulsate toward Gukato.* - Sat Oct 10 18:28:03 2015
