<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Sure. - Tue Oct  6 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) figured that this spar was just to hone in on their abilities so going all out was pointless for the time being. With that in mind, Ortho started things off with weaving a succession of handseals together whilst keeping a firm focus on Kirie. That at being said, after altering his position ever so slightly so his attack could come at an angle, Ortho would allow his chakra to violently rupture into an electrical surge. Thus, a ground breaking lightning-based jutsu would pivot toward the female.* - Tue Oct  6 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's line of sight was almost immediately disrupted. The flash from Kirie's jutsu proving to be extremely effective, and Ortho hated the fact that this was the second time in just a few days that he fell for that same exact jutsu. A grunt is heard coming from the lad as just the slightest glimpse of Kirie's movement caught his attention. With haste, and more of a combination mindset, Ortho would stitch together another series of handseals The build of his chakra could easily be detected by Kirie, but it mattered not since Ortho had no other way to mask this. From this point on, he'd swiftly move his head from side to side in an attempt to unleash a power torrent of water in the generic area.

The instincts of Ortho kicked in as he began weaving yet another series of handseals whilst releasing the torrent of water. Following the handseals was the out-stretch of his arms and a launch of pulsing electricity to combine with the torrent of water. Said torrent of water would cover the area zones from the left of Ortho, to the front of Ortho and to the right of Ortho; all in a constant stream of water and lightning.* - Tue Oct  6 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't a fool. Why would anyone, in the midst of a battle, stay beneath anything black and dripping of black liquid? That being said, with extreme haste, Ortho made an attempt to evacuate the immediate area; there was no point in staying under Kirie's jutsu. Upon doing so, Ortho would form a single handseal and expelled a thick bundle of chakra outward; in turn, a single shadow clone was spawned.* - Tue Oct  6 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: FOR KONOHA! - Tue Oct  6 16:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) and his clone stood before Kirie, both weaving a set of handseals together. The downpour of fireballs was intimidating to the average shinobi, but many battles allowed Ortho to come to a solution. Ortho, the original, took the initial step forward; a massive torrent of water gushing forward to only protect the shadow clone. As the negation of fire and water combusted into a thick steam, the shadow clone followed up with a surprise attack.

With a combination in mind, the clone, whilst Kirie descended back to the ground, would unleash a quick surge of lightning forward. This time, however, he'd follow up with a separate torrent of water (Quick post cause I had to go AFK before I started typing.)* - Tue Oct  6 16:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's left eyebrow rose at Kirie's command. He slowly shook his head, already having past relations with people wanting to heal and end up placing a seal on him. "I'll be fine, nevermind the healing.."* - Tue Oct  6 17:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, backing up a few paces and keeping his eyes locked on Misa. "I can't do that.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's skepticism didn't falter. The demand over the Gunbai only proved that trust couldn't be provided for Misa just yet, or maybe never; it all depends on how things play out. The request to hear the promise made only provided another slow shake of his head and a cold toned verbal response. "I snitch not."* - Tue Oct  6 18:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || The switch in demeanor and tension from Misa proved to throw Ortho off, giving him no form of understanding. A thorough intake of the scene needed to be accomplished, but in the current situation he was in he wouldn't be able to do so. Physical attraction was once bared for Misa, but just as fast as it came it went. Thus, with her slumped forward with her chin firmly placed on his shoulder, Ortho took her by the waist and gently pushed forward. Not to send her back, but to create some form of space between them without either taking a real step back. "It seems as though I'm mistaken. You are.. bored?"* - Tue Oct  6 19:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's gaze wandered off, a visual survey of the surrounding area taken in to his mind. Was this form of trickery to lower his guard, or did she truly seek the appearance of her brother. Nevertheless, Ortho kept his skepticism with; disrespect of her wishes was not intended. "I heard not of that name before. I wish you the best on your search."* - Tue Oct  6 19:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's hands moved in subtle successions, forming a multitude of handseals. Despite its fluency, the speed at which his fingers tied into one another was admirable to say the least. Whilst the weaving occurred, the kneading of chakra within his stomach allied in preparations of the jutsu within Ortho's mind. Quick pivots forth, slant in direction, closed in the distance between the two titans. Water is the natural element of the surround area, and it is water that Ortho was going to manipulate at will. With Misa that much closer, the lad would pucker his lips and allow a steady torrent of water to rush forward; intents of clashing with the females' petite body.* - Tue Oct  6 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || Misa's understanding over the Raging Waves was superb, and it is that knowledge that granted her the possible ability to evade this next attempt --- maybe. The altering of his lips was provided to Misa, causing the torrent of water to follow her in close pursuit. Whilst her travels, and the water, Ortho weaves another succession of handseals. A pulsation of lightning burst forth, allying itself with the outpour of liquid; it's design was to electrocute Misa where she stood.* - Tue Oct  6 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) remained stationary, there being no counter for the massive hawk and the arrow. The most he could do Is accept his fate and the reasoning why she decided to aim directly at the poor lad.* - Tue Oct  6 21:21:16 2015
