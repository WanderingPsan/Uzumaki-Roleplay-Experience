Ortho remained stationary, his arms folded across his chest as he leaned back first against the massive wall of Genjigakure. His posture was the same as always, nonchalant and lackadaisical. The only difference about Ortho's visual was the fact that he wore a mask; a mask that concealed the entirety of his face and only provided two holes for his line of vision. The mask was made of fine material, providing Ortho with the proper security from damage as the mask would fall victim to little to nothing. From the neck and below, Ortho wore the same style of clothing --- black, black and more black.

His focus shifted slightly and infrequently between Baen and Marrisa, saying nothing to them nor providing his usual nod of acknowledgment. He understood that now he and Hideki ventured off, stakes were and unless they were greeted first, no initiative would be taken.* - Mon Oct 12 22:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) watched as Fujitora departed with a sigh and blank expression.  He didn't know exactly what he walked into, but if someone as mentioned as Fujitora had to walk away in such a demeanor, then something must've been wrong. Ortho, however, wasn't the type to investigate things so he simply shrugged. One this that caught his attention was the fact that no one even acknowledged him when he greeted them; so rude. A smug plastered itself on Ortho's face as he tucked his hands within his pockets and paced himself southward. "Fine then," he thought. "Might as well go train.."* - Wed Oct 14 12:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Good, you get training for that too.~ - Wed Oct 14 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) pulled his hands out of his pants pockets and broke out into an instant dash toward Marrisa. He didn't know what abilities Marrisa had in Taijutsu, but it didn't matter to Ortho; he was so novice at the form of fighting that he thought Taijutsu was just punching someone until they either submit or die. In this case, it'd be to submit. That being said, Ortho would clench and fist and cock his elbow back. Once close enough to the female, he'd attempt to punch her dead in the nose, but stops. He.. couldn't punch her in the face.. Beating her with ninjutsu was fine, but punching her in the face? Nope, he wasn't about that life. "Uhh, I quit.. You two go at it.."* - Wed Oct 14 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) takes hold of his stomach and doubles over, the punch from Marrisa to his gut proving to have some form of effect. His eyes glaze over briefly, but out of sheer instincts he'd reclench his right fist and send it for Marrisa's stomach; a retaliation to her attack.* - Wed Oct 14 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's air was withdrawn from his body and by the sound of his desperate attempt to gain it back, he was exactly 'okay'. Nevertheless, he'd straighten himself and look back at Marrisa. He gives her a thumbs up and nods his head. "I'm f-fine.."* - Wed Oct 14 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly..? I did a bit of training before I went to the village square. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Was going to just sit by myself and think. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: let me guess. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened.* - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. wasn't thinking that, but it doesn't sound bad. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: To me that is.. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'd love some Ramen and Juice? - Wed Oct 14 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it done. - Wed Oct 14 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow and took.* - Wed Oct 14 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lead the way. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: A gentlmen always escorts a lady - Wed Oct 14 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) paid for a caravan to get them all the way to Kumogakure.* - Wed Oct 14 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Wow. . You. . You must really like the Ramen here huh? - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Better than Suna's. - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I see. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still think the flavor their ramen with sand. - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) didn't know if he should sit next to her or not so he made a random decision to sit across.* - Wed Oct 14 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave his order to the chef as well. Marrisa's comment dawned on Ortho pretty hard, he wasn't used to being asked to tell people about himself. He was usually the one to ask them that and them not caring enough to want to know about him. A slight shrug was given as he half-way looked at Marrisa. The look in Ortho's eyes was empty for a moment, but still his facial expression broke into a emotionless smile.

"Umm.. Well, Nina is my little sister. We are orphans and I've been taking care of her for a few years now. I'm a combination specialist when it comes to fighting style. I, uh.. I enjoy sake, it drowns the sorrow. Umm, I keep to myself most of the time, probably that's why I'm still alive.."* - Wed Oct 14 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) gave a chuckle, nodding his head. He looks away briefly before returning his gaze to Marrisa. "Soon enough she'll feel as though she's too grown to listen to me. I've accepted that, but her friendliness can put a target on her back for the leeches in this world. I'm proud of her as is, and knowing she has obtained some good friends and a good teacher makes me happy. She doesn't take fond of me attempting to get under Fujitora's teachings, so just let her and him know I'm backing out. Just.. to make Nina happy."* - Wed Oct 14 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) || It was clear that Ortho was making an attempt to show some form of emotions, a feat that everyone knew he was barely capable of pulling off. Nevertheless, he provides a genuine half-smile and nodded his head. He has had many moments similar to this occasion with Marrisa, but nothing of just casual conversations. The other moments almost always ended up in a battle, so it was different for him to be at ease and just talk.

"It's better that I just give Nina what she want. I doubt she even understand that our parents is dead. I still give her allowances and she keep trying to send messenger birds to our parents. When she doesn't get a reply I tell her that they're probably on a high ranked mission."
* - Wed Oct 14 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) 's appetite changed whilst sitting here, so he simply pushed the bowl of ramen off to the side a bit. Marrisa's words was easily understandable, the comparison to their situation was defined by simple pain and unknowing. He gives Marrisa a nod or two before speaking.

"Ya'know, it's not often I'm able to do this. I mean, yes I talk with people and have a bowl of ramen with them, but not like this. It's.. different.. to know that this won't turn out into a life or death battle. I suppose I can honestly say lust is turning into something more genuine when it comes to you."* - Wed Oct 14 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) wasn't really able to comprehend Marrisa's whisper. He didn't pursue after what she whispered, nor did he feel like it was his place to do so. The smile on Ortho's face grew a bit, a noticeable amount with being a full pledged beam. He gives Marrisa another nod.

"No rush. As long as I.. have you in my life."
* - Wed Oct 14 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) stood to his feet. He takes out a wad of cash and placed it on the table for the waiter and chef; he also threw in some extra for the fact that he didn't even touch his ramen. Ortho extends his hand to Marrisa and if she takes it, he'd lead her to a caravan.* - Wed Oct 14 14:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh? - Wed Oct 14 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) couldn't help but chuckle. Hideki's message for Ambrocio to meet them in Genjigakure wasn't delivered, and it was the same person that was suspected of starting the rumors. Ortho slowly shook his head, breaking the visual connect him and Ambrocio had. He gave a slight shrug of his shoulders before digging his hands further into his pockets. A single audible exhale of a sigh is sounded before Ortho looked back at Ambrocio.

"The fact that you'd think Hideki would just leave you behind. When he and I departed you were still asleep [AFK]. We told the rat known as Takeda to give you a message, but it's obvious that message wasn't delivered."* - Wed Oct 14 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised both his eyebrows, giving an expression that said "true". But Ortho knew what transpired between Takeda and Hideki, and quite frankly Ortho knew he was telling the truth. Nevertheless, the tension from Ambrocio was felt and acknowledged with another shrug. "Takeda was supposed to tag along with us as well. Hideki planned on getting some rest [go AFK] once we reached Genjigakure and expected that Takeda and you both would have arrived once he awoken. It wasn't until we met the same masked figure that originates from Kirigakure, and who was also the one that told us about the rumors, told us that no one else showed interest in following him. Hideki took that as you and Takeda wanting to stay here in the village."* - Wed Oct 14 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I was there when Hideki left. - Wed Oct 14 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: All he told me was to tell Zeus that he was in charge. - Wed Oct 14 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Not a word more. - Wed Oct 14 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That.. wasn't the departure where he sent for you. - Wed Oct 14 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He returned to retrieve you and Takeda. - Wed Oct 14 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Well. I can disperse the rumors for him, but I'm afraid I can't let you or him claim the childs life. - Wed Oct 14 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: When he placed Zeus in charge he departed yes, but it was to get the okay to reside in Genjigakure. Him and I both- - Wed Oct 14 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head, briefly closing his eyes and sighing. Once he opened them back up he'd fix his gaze on Ambrocio.

"It's not that easy, Ambrocio. You and I both know Hideki isn't a traitor to people that show loyalty to him. Is the position you aquired here that important..?"* - Wed Oct 14 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He saved me from getting myself killed in Kumogakure. - Wed Oct 14 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: So now I will save him by preventing the death of this child, which will lead to him being a bountied criminal. - Wed Oct 14 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) was clearly getting aggravated throughout Ambrocio's speech. It was also clear that it wasn't toward Ambrocio, but something else concerning the entire situation. It was understandable that Ambrocio wanted to figure himself out before tying himself back with Hideki, but at the same time, wouldn't there be the same effect if Ambrocio just hung around Ortho? Hell, Ortho wouldn't mind teaching Ambrocio how to simply remain calm and don't let everything both you; maybe Ambrocio just didn't see Ortho as much of an ally as Ortho saw him. A sigh of disappointment came from Ortho as he gave Ambrocio a nod.

"My journey back here is not within Hideki's knowledge. Him having a bounty would be least likely, but be acquiring one is likely. In all, Ambrocio, do what you see fit for yourself. Takeda's death may not be today or tomorrow, but everyone that snitches or lies eventually die.."* - Wed Oct 14 19:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You can leave whenever you would like, but I suggest staying away from Takeda. - Wed Oct 14 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) raised an eyebrow.* - Wed Oct 14 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Prison..? - Wed Oct 14 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Don't ask me about it. I prefer to do things old fashioned, but Zeus prefers prison methods. - Wed Oct 14 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wasn't talking about that. You're actually willing to put me in jai- - Wed Oct 14 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head.

"Whatever.."* - Wed Oct 14 19:27:47 2015
