<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kept himself silent. His eyes are shut and his head is subtly lowered. Both his arms are neatly folded across his chest and his back steadily leans against the side of the mountain, just within the path used by people to get to the Raikage's mansion.* - Thu Dec  3 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's head perks up a bit when Akarui approached. He didn't bother to really acknowledge her, but from what he could sense from her chakra levels, she was perfectly fine. He lowers his head again and slightly shrugged.* - Thu Dec  3 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'll reply to her message later. - Thu Dec  3 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was tempted to lift his head and examine the new presence of chakra, but decided not to. Quite frankly, it wasn't any of business. That and because he didn't want an argument to start over dumb stuff.* - Thu Dec  3 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes inch open. He places his focus on the primate and smirked a bit, the little guy was actually adorable. Sogeki crouches down and accepted the piece of paper, reading it and narrowing his eyes a bit. Instead of writing a reply he'd lift the primate up and carry him off to Akarui, "up for a drink?"* - Thu Dec  3 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) stretches his arm out and allowed the monkey to use the limb as a branch-like traveling system. Once Akarui took grasp of the primate, Sogeki would turn and head for the local shop.* - Thu Dec  3 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) sits himself down comfortably, leaning his shoulder against the wall and rhythmically taps his fingers on the table in front of him. There was really no expression on Sogeki's face, something that was clearly different to anyone that spent actual time with him. His eyes are, without any form of modesty, fixed on Akarui's bust. He wasn't doing it in a pervy way, they just happened to be the physical center point of his train of thought.

"So," he mutters, "how have you been?"
* - Thu Dec  3 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was noticeably different physically. He wasn't the most muscular guy but it could be pointed out that he was becoming scrawny. His eyes are naturally lower than normal, making him look half dead. His skin is more toned though, giving off the idea that he has spent time in a tanning bed or sun --- any of the sort. He bears new scars on his face. One, in specific, runs horizontally across the bridge of his nose. Another ran vertically across his left cheek; he simply looked like someone recovering from battle.

The gaze on her breasts was eventually broken. In its place was a steady stare in to her eyes that had a subtly nod following the eye contact. "I want you to know I don't hate you, Akarui. The confusion you and I felt was dragged on to the point where when the view of a third person came; we went back to square one and we-.. I couldn't handle that. You, on the other hand, are free to hate me to your hearts' content. That much I can understand fully."* - Thu Dec  3 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) also has a scar across the left side of his neck.* - Thu Dec  3 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) watched the primate run off, halt to glance at him, and then continue on. Suddenly, in hesitation, he'd inch back away from Akarui's touch. His eyes widen in confusion before lowering to its new 'normal'. Sogeki leans forward to his original position, allowing her hand to rest on the side of his face. He bites down on his lower lip, trying not to think too much on certain factors during his stay in the hospital, and even before he was registered in the place. He looks down at the table and sighed.

"..Just some stuff where I got myself into trouble and paid for it.."* - Thu Dec  3 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) says: *You look - Thu Dec  3 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) couldn't manage looking Akarui in the eyes anymore. He diverts them to the nearest thing in front of him, and it so happened to be her cleavage. The common hint of lust that usual illuminate from Sogeki was barely visible. Yes, this time around, more interest was involved with the view but the blank stare and expression was just as apparent, if not stronger. He sighed once more and shook his head in an attempt to swallow the feelings tied in with the memory. Eventually, he manages to answer:

"..They say I went insane. Extreme lust, misguided views and beliefs resulted in me blacking out and doing things they won't disclose to me. All I know is I woke up in the hospital and instantly.. had the urge to kill myself. They strapped me down after the third attempt.. and did mental and physical tests on me.."* - Thu Dec  3 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) easily peeled his eyes away, fixing them on Akarui's face. It wasn't like he was obsessed with the her allowing his to look for a change, so it was no effort at all to stop. The look in his eyes told her that he was still half dead. The expression only confirmed what his eyes were saying, assuring everyone that Sogeki was basically.. done.

"The last thing.. you need to worry about is taking care of me. I'm reaping what I sowed, i just have to wait.. until my time is up." The subtly implication of death rang through his head. Not knowing if Akarui was going to share the bottle, he'd raise his hand for a waiter to see and extends three fingers --- that alone made the waiter know he wanted three full bottles of sake.
* - Thu Dec  3 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) lowered his arm and nodded. "This.. is mainly my fault. I must've put too much pressure on you or something. I don't know I can't let you take all the blame." He looks down at his hands and slowly shook his head. "I'm just a fuck up.. Maybe I am like the other guys that just want to touch you.. I don't know.. Kari and you both need to just.. let me die and forget about me."* - Thu Dec  3 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) kept his gaze on the table, not knowing if eye contact with her was necessary or not. He bites down on his lower lip as she spoke, accepting everything she had to say with a slightly opened mind. Everything she did physically was allowed, no real reason to rebuttal. Her fingers were noticed, but questions weren't asked --- he didn't feel that was his place. When she was done he'd release an audible sigh and nodded.

"You'll grow stronger and you'd know that even in my death I'll be there for you.. You and Kari alike. I am useless now.. just a big slop of uselessness. If anything, I'm hindering you both. That much.. I can admit."* - Thu Dec  3 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) placed his gaze on Akarui's for a while, granting her a sincere smile. The smile seemed a bit forced when it came to how long it was upheld but, for the most part, it was sincere. He shakes his head from left to right before sighing again. "Knowing.. you don't hate me is the best.. 'shape up'.. you can give me." With his arm gripped by Akarui he tug her a bit closer to him, he desperately wanted just a bit more physical contact with her small frame. "This.. does more than I can put into words."* - Thu Dec  3 06:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's smile widened a bit, tears swelling in his eyes too. He was aware of Takuma's presence before he said anything, but took the time out subtly hog Akarui for a minute or so --- he wasn't going to make Takuma seem like the bad guy. Of course, without making his sensei feel disrespected, he'd shake his head to say 'no' toward the question then gesture to just place the scroll on the table. Throughout this, he kept hugging the female.* - Thu Dec  3 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head toward Takuma, thanking him without verbally speaking.* - Thu Dec  3 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was a bit sad that she broke the head for numerous reasons. It was clear why he tugged on her in the first place, her bust was amazing and he just wanted her close for comfort. He'd take her by the arm and gently pull her in again, allowing her to wrap around his arm again and tighten as much as he want. "This.. time around we'll have to work on our friendship. A relationship shouldn't be on our minds.. Just a friendship and we build on that and see how it goes."* - Thu Dec  3 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) quickly shook his head. He can't lie, temptation made him want to have her straddle him and just hug her full on.. but he refrained. Instead, he'd brings arms around her made 'sure' to only place them on the back of her shoulders and nowhere else --- he learned his lesson the last time he got yelled at. "It's not that.. not at all.. you're still very.. very.. veeery.. attractive. I just don't think I'm ready for titles yet.."* - Thu Dec  3 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) unzips pants, "taste me."* - Thu Dec  3 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: -- - Thu Dec  3 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes widened a bit and his hands slowly trail down her body, stopping at her lower back. His fingers steadily expand, a few of them threatening to graze over her upper cheeks. He places his gaze on her and smiled.

"You're fine in my eyes. We'll just work on getting you back to your regular self. Now? Still look attractive. And.. the title makes a difference. I want you to understand that having sex with you is 'not' my intentions. Yes I want to physically show you my attraction and all that, but I feel as though sex 'has' to wait until things are right.. The title makes people target you and me.. and say if they see something they don't understand and start rumors and all that. The title.. I'm honestly.. scared of. Right now.. I was kind've hoping we have that type of friendship where.. relationship type things happen, but it's just between  us.. no one else knows."* - Thu Dec  3 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) felt the kiss on his cheek and was inclined to just test his fate. His hands just glides down more, aiming to subtly cup one of her cheeks, "trust me.. I'm not lying." He'd squeeze just lightly, close to no excess pressure being apparent.

His gaze meet hers once more and he'd bite down on his lower lip. "You talk like I'm not going to be there to protect you either way.. The title only draws in guys to claim what's not theirs.. Just.. have faith in me.. please?"* - Thu Dec  3 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) nodded his head in full understanding. Honestly? He didn't blame her. He was pushing the boundaries and he had to respect that. "Whatever makes you happy," he says in a hushed tone. He moves his hand and pats her lower back. "I gained the trust of the Raikage and.. I have to check on the missing people report." He'd plant a kiss on her forehead and rise up, sliding his way out of her grasp and helping her to her feet. From that point, he'd grab for his bow and sack of arrows --- pacing off once he gathered everything.* - Thu Dec  3 08:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) picks her up and kisses her on the cheek, dangerously close to her lips. "I'll be right back, I promise.  If I rush this with you, I'll have to leave anyways.. If I go now, do what I have to do and come back.. then we have all the time we need. Just let me handle this." With that, he'd steadily back up.* - Thu Dec  3 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) paced himself to the main gathering area. His bow is properly hitched to his side and the quiver of arrows is strapped to his back. He had a look of confusion and skepticism plastered on his visage --- Yuriko's presence was the last he expected. Still, he'd hang back for a few to analyze the situation at hand.* - Thu Dec  3 09:06:33 2015

His fingers trace around the wire of the bow and his arm, with the arrows gripped, pull back by the elbow and shoulders. His eyes squint slightly, narrows on the back of Yuriko's head. "Psssst!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) || The house is relatively bland. There was a small kitchen, a small bedroom that was also the living room and a small bathroom. It was a basic poorman's home. Despite the million Yuriko gave him weeks ago, he still decides to live the modest life. For the most part, however, the most expensive thing there, in the house, was the air conditioning system.

Just as they entered the home, he'd turn around to face her and look her in the eyes. It was obvious that he was searching for something in her gaze, something past her pupil color. "Explain," he says in a hushed tone. "This isn't you.. you're more.. outgoing.. Who are you..?"* - Thu Dec  3 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's narrowed once more as he scans over her body. He knows that he had paid attention to her physical standings the first time he met and from just a quick glance he didn't notice anything different. The second she diverts her eyes from his own he knew something was up --- Yuriko spent hours staring him down over a single bottle of sake, there was no way this was the same Yuriko. "What do you mean I'm not real..? Explain to me.."* - Thu Dec  3 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's narrowed eyes widens to normal. He slowly shook his head and a thicker expression of confusion plasters itself on his visage. Slowly, with much hesitance, he'd reach for her right wrist and gently take hold of it. From there, if he was allowed, he'd put it over his left chest and allow his heartbeat to be felt. "Explain.."* - Thu Dec  3 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) slowly shook his head. "No, Yuriko.. I'm really here," he says in a hushed tone. "What.. happened?"* - Thu Dec  3 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) would maneuver his hand, that he used to grab her wrist, and placed his palm into hers. He ties his fingers into her and leans his head to the side a bit, keeping full eye contact with her. "What.. do you mean broke you? Who is your 'monster'?"* - Thu Dec  3 10:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) reached up and caught her hand before it could make contact with her head. He placed it down to her side and released it just to bring his own hand back up and place his index finger under her chin. "It's just me and you here.. no one else. It's okay.." He trails that same hand around to the back of her neck and gently, and swiftly, pulls her into a hug, embracing her. "Talk to me, Yuriko."* - Thu Dec  3 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I tried to stop him... - Thu Dec  3 10:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: He broke my mind. - Thu Dec  3 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) pulls his head back from over her shoulder as far as he can in an attempt to get eye contact with her. "Me and you, Ume.. Me and you.." If he was able to meet her gaze he'd place his forehead against hers and star even deeper into her, "you told me that you were a weapon.. that being a weapon was your purpose.. does that have to do with your 'monster breaking' you?"* - Thu Dec  3 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) 's confusion only grew, but he still nodded against her forehead. "He did this to you.. Leave him.. forget him.. stay here.. we'll take care of you.."* - Thu Dec  3 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: He took control of everything I have left... I can't leave. - Thu Dec  3 10:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) bites down on his lower lip in slight anger.* - Thu Dec  3 10:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) only tightened his embrace to keep her from tumbling over. Anger was forming in him and he was trying his hardest not to make it shown and interpreted as her being the one making him angry.* - Thu Dec  3 10:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) was now completely confused. He kind've understood what Yuriko meant about her 'monster breaking her', but this was close to crazy. The sudden change in demeanor right after the words she muttered --- what did this family member do to her? He just leaned his head back and watched her for a bit.

"Don't worry about her, she'll be fine. Uhh, how are you feeling?"* - Thu Dec  3 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Her? - Thu Dec  3 10:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Girl's can have flat bits? - Thu Dec  3 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Takuma. - Thu Dec  3 10:54:56 2015
