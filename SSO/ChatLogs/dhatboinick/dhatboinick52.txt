<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) stood in his usual spot. His head his lowered slightly and his eyes are shut closed. Rather than having his entire jump suit on, his upper body is exposed while that bit of his clothing hung down from his waist. His massive tattoo that trail from the middle of his back to the side of his waist is open to all spectators. He has yet to notice Yuriko's lack of attire, but he did know she stepped out of the greenhouse. The most Hokori does is turn his head just slightly while keeping his eyes shut and speak. "Good day, Domina-.. Lady Yuriko. How are things?"* - Thu Nov 26 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) 's eyes sluggishly opened.  He didn't expect silence from her; maybe she took offense to the slight mistake of almost calling her his Domina. His natural instincts to pay her the respect that is due forced his stand straighten his body and enter a proper posture. It was at that point his jaw nearly dropped to the ground, only thing preventing it was the restraint from joints and other bone-system factors.

His eyes pan over her frame, soaking in what she was so willingly able to show him. From her smooth skin, compared to his that was riddled in battle scars and healing bruises, to her more detailed features. Of course, like any male, he gave her breasts more visual attention, allowing each nipple to have their own time to be admired before he trailed down even more. Her cleft set him off a bit, causing a slight pulse in his member. His respect for her and refusal to make her feel violated, even if she was able to feel that or not, made him immediately divert his eyes back to her. He stiffens his posture even more, returning to his strictly professional state.

He coughs. 

"Forgive me.. I am not yet used to calling you by your desired name," he says in an attempt to cover up the intense groping he did with his eyes. "I'll be sure to work harder on that."* - Thu Nov 26 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) blinked a few times out of confusion. He felt heavily disrespected. A second guard must be present? After all he's proven during his training to get where he stood now? He was prepared to rebuttal and voices his opinion, that much was clear by the look on his face, but he simply bites down on his tongue and nodded once. His eyes remained on Yuriko, giving her no verbal response to the news, just that nod.* - Thu Nov 26 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Is this because of my refusal to train with Yori..? - Thu Nov 26 08:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) didn't not nor shake his head.

"If I was to tell you that it is then I'd be nothing more than a liar."* - Thu Nov 26 08:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) stood there. His arms are folded across his chest and his head is raised to normal levels. His eyes are fixated on the wall way across the room and a serious look is plastered on his face. His attire is the same for last few days: shirtless, tattoos exposed with the lower half of his black jumpsuit still worn.* - Thu Nov 26 21:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) heard Thirteen's voice and immediately felt the anger swell in his stomachs. If his arms weren't folded across his chest fists could easily be seen clenched and veins bulging at the back of his hands. His jaw, however, visibly tightens and the two joints at the side of he face push out against his skin. Still, despite this, Hokori remains quiet and respectable.* - Thu Nov 26 21:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) simply stared. If he was to die here then so be it, no worries. If he wasn't restricted he'd simply shrug and wait for his light to eventually fade. Death didn't scare him, it's what he didn't get to do before he died that did. Still, he kept his head up as high as it could go, walked with his cock in hand and balls still attached --- he has no regrets.

He eyes focus on Thirteen, saying nothing to him nor responding to Yuriko's words. He just sat that.* - Thu Nov 26 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) looked up at Thirteen, unfazed by the interrogation technique. Hokori sat there and simply answered as honestly as he could --- Thirteen didn't need to cast the genjutsu on him for that.

"You must be deaf. I am from a family that has a last name, not a clan. Unlike you, mister number. My intentions are simple and clear. I protect Yuriko and I only protect Yuriko. I help Yuriko and I only help Yuriko. That's what I was trained to do and that's what I'm going to practice on the field and in here. Unlike someone I know that rather treat her like some Doll for her own self-gratification. Tell you what, Thirteen, whether you like it or not.. I'm doing the very same thing your inquired about for every guard's training. You're simply reaping what you helped sow."* - Thu Nov 26 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) looked up.

"I thought I said your speeches are over rated and not cared for."* - Thu Nov 26 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) went through all that dramatic scenario with his past and torture. How the tattoo on his back was him earning his strips in his family and the three scars on his arm was the lessons he had to learn for not wanting to follow bullshit rules and all that good stuff.

If he mind is broken then yeah. If it isn't okay. Thirteen wins. Hokori murmurs one thing throughout the entire process.

"You're.. just.. a.. number.. not.. a.. real.. man"* - Thu Nov 26 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: + - Thu Nov 26 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) went into a vegetable state.* - Thu Nov 26 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) tumbles over. His body is still restrained and his mind was done for. All form of understanding or characteristics Hokori was known for is completely gone. He was just slumped and what not.* - Thu Nov 26 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) felt his mind slipping. Nothing he could do can prevent any of this from happening. Hokori stood behind what he believed in and there was no form of regrets. There was no form of "I should've kept quiet". There was just him accepting what his fate was and knowing right here and now is where he met his demise.

It's a bit ironic. Hokori lived the life of someone with morals and fought against the biased stature of everyone's minds. He lived the life where everyone and everything should be able to forge their own destiny and walk toward what they created. The irony of this all: his mind was evaded and taken over with great ease --- in the end, he didn't forge his own destiny; Thirteen did.

Nevertheless, Hokori is proud. He didn't practice what he preached, but he's proud of everything. He's proud that he got under the skin of someone so evil and twisted where they had to resort to killing him because they couldn't handle the truth. Let's be completely honest here. Thirteen was jealous. Thirteen hated the fact that some guard showed up and told the truth to Yuriko. He hated the fact that someone so.. original.. showed up and forced knowledge and understanding into his 'doll'. The same knowledge and understanding that he tried to keep away from her. No matter what Thirteen does or did, he'll never match up to Hokori. After all, Hokori helped Yuriko find herself. She actually looked in the mirror and liked what she saw. All Hokori had to do was lead her to that mirror. What has Thirteen done? From what Hokori sees or heard thus far, nothing.

Chuckling came from Hokori as his mind became narrow and narrow, blocking out all forms of sanity and life that could possibly be held on to. His body slumps over on to the ground and his hog-tied state continued to bind him. His chuckling eventually fades until there was utter silence. Hokori was completely gone mentally and in turn his life was no more.* - Thu Nov 26 22:39:21 2015
