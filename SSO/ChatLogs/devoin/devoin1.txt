<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) began walking along the crevice of the beach. He looked around and saw no men around. "..Indeed..you have not failed me yet." he smirked gently, looking around as he laid his hands in his cloak pocket, making his way along the beach. He saw nothing wrong with just taking a break every now and then.

Akahoshi gave off a sigh as he looked up at the sky, his eyes drifting from left to right, admiring the nice, black filled sky, looking onto one single yellow light. "..The first star." he said gently, his hands pulling out of his pockets as he smiled gently. "Noone likes to admire these things anymore." he said with a light audible mumble under his tone.

Soon after, Akahoshi dispersed, his image fading into black lines of flash. He appeared several feet away, he had moved at a blinding speed, it was not due to the fact that he had used some teleportation technique, but because of his years of experience, he had just moved slightly faster than the average sight peramiter.

He entered the Kazekage mansion and jumped over the first desk with his right foot hitting it gently before pressing off of it, landing with both feet on the ground. He then performed a sideflip and took a seat in his desk, landing rather perfectly. He then resumed to do his paperwork -- what a drag.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: ..Mm.
<br><font color=green>*Chloe Valens(Devoin) says: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Oh, good morning, Ishizu.
<br><font color=green>*Chloe Valens(Devoin) says: Good morning sir.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: How are you doing?
<br><font color=green>*Chloe Valens(Devoin) says: Good..and you sir?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Quite nicely.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: I'm going out. I'll be back soon.
<br><font color=green>*Chloe Valens(Devoin) says: Oh..okay...I shall await for your return sir.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) slides his hands into his brown coat pockets, smiling gently before lifting his left hand up to wave at Ishizu. "Stay safe." he said.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Ishizu.
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Yes?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Come with me.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) A little boy ran up to Akahoshi and hugged his left leg. "Akahoshi-kun!" he yelled out.*
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Oh..who is this?
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) leaned over and smiled. "Introduce yourself." he referred to Frank. Frank then spoke. "My name's Frank!" he said.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: That's Ishizu-chan, Frank.
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Nice to meet you Frank.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) Frank looked at Ishizu and then whispered up to Akahoshi, just loud enough for both of them to hear. "Is that your wife? She's really pretty." he asked.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) smiled at Frank and patted him on the head.*
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: What did he say?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Oh. Nothing at all.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Frank, take this and go buy everyone a piece of bread at the orphanage, i'll be there later to drop off the regular food.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) hands Frank one thousand ryo.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) Frank smiles and nods, running off. "Thanks, Akahoshi-kun!" he said.*
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Awww how sweet.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Oh..nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Ah. Hah.
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: How are you, today?
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Good and you?
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) begins to go through a series of handseals. He smiled gently and then slammed his hands on the ground, a gentle poof appeared and a cute dog ran outward towards Akahoshi. He put a scroll in the dog's mouth and put flowers in his mouth.

The dog then ran toward Ishizu and looked up at her, lifting his head to extend the gorgeous dozen of roses up to her and give her the scroll.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Huh? Who's dog is that?
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) took the dozen roses as she smiled softly fixtating her gaze upon Akahoshi. "Oh...thank you sir...I really..appreciate it.." She said faintly walking over towards Akahoshi and embracing him lightly. Blowing his ear slightly she giggled as she done so.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) slid his hands into his pockets and smiled gently. He looked down at Ishizu and lifted his arms out of his pocket, wrapping them around her tightly. He held her firmly and gave off a light chuckle. "It's my pleasure, really." he said, the dog spit out the scroll at Ishizu's feet.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) nodded her head as her hazy orange eyes stared intently into Akahoshi's eyes. Planting a kiss onto his lips she smiled gently as she poked her tongue on his top lip, attempting to be allowed entrance. "Did allow me..sir..to please me?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) blinks gently. He looked onto Ishizu with a furrowed eyebrow, pressing his lips roughly onto Ishizu's. "..This is a first.." he thought to himself as he wrapped his arms around Ishizu, hugging her tightly as he opened his mouth and began gently rotating his tongue around hers, sucking on her tongue with ease to please her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) smiled softly as she rolled her tongue around his, sucking on his bottom lip as well. Her long hair hanging low as she wrapped her arm around Akahoshi's neck drawing him in more. "Mm..I think the orange juice in your sailva...taste better than the original.." She said faintly winking at the guy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) gave off a chuckle as he nibbled on Ishizu's lips, holding her tightly as he lowered his hands to her plump rump and began squeezing it gently. His saliva mixed with Ishizu's and he smirked. "..Is that your way of teasing me?" he asked after pulling away from the kiss, he then pushed back into it, giving her a long, compassionate kiss of love, intertwining lips and tongues.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) nodded her head as her cheeks turned bright red form the squeeze. "And is that your way of teasing me?" She asked modestly as she begun to kiss him passionately as well.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) lets out another warm squeeze on her rump, this time, performing it even rougher. He then pushed Ishizu up against the rock, making sure she wouldn't get hurt. He pressed his lips roughly against Ishizu, planting deep, meaning kisses all over her sensual lips.

He then slowly dug his nails under her pants, slowly pushing his hands down her pants from behind, groping her plump ass cheeks roughly, his warm soft palms touching her sweet flesh.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) smiled softly as she was placed ontop of the rocks. Her body heating up for the thought she imagined Akahoshi had in mind. "Ooh..whoa..you';re a nice kisser..." She bluntly admitted after Akahoshi kissed her again.

Biting down on her bottom lip as he dug his hands into her panties she hesitated for a moment before lifting up her head to meet akahoshi's biting his bottom lip again.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) let out a soft smile as he began softly playing with and smacking her ass gently, toying with it like it were a piece of meat. He then pulled away, looking at Ishizu. "That was a bit of a test." he said, winking before he slid his hands into his pockets and began walking off. "Stay safe, love." he said.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) hesitated for a moment before she shifted her gaze steadily towards the floor. "Ooh..I see...I will.." SHe stated quickly and softly before heaving out a low sigh.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: How about a date, Ishizu?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Later. You and I.
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Hmm..sure why not?
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: Good to hear it.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) walked up behind Ishizu and wrapped his arms around her waist, holding her tightly. "Hey." he whispered into her ear as he nuzzled her cheek playfully.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: [ swag ]
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: (swag)
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: (swagstar)

<br><font color=green>*Ramen(Huchiama) says: (y so empty)
<br><font color=green>*Ramen(Huchiama) says: (??)
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: (because)
<br><font color=yellow>*Ramen(Huchiama) has a long dick.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ramen(Huchiama) wonders if he will get in trouble for abusing World Roleplay.*
<br><font color=green>*Swag(Sal Mota) says: [ its bc we get swag
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: [ Get ur long dick outta here. ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Ramen(Huchiama) wants free genin*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ramen(Huchiama) just lost the Game.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ramen(Huchiama) points out that Sunagakure doesn't have a village page.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Oleic(Oleic) What's this verb do?*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) travelled to Konohagakure as he sought to find survivors of the Kumogakure village...He had heard news of the kage returning but had no idea who they looked like...His violet eyes scanned the horizon as he entered Konoha, hoping to find answers...His fists tightened upon thinking about Kirigakure, where his kages murderer resided....

"Soon I shall get my revenge..."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) began walking towards his destination along the sandy path when he saw someone standing in front of him...His eyes narrowed slightly as he backed up, one hand lying casually on his hilt...

"Who are you...?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) blinked her eyes a few times at the person infront of her. "State who you are..and why are you here?..And I won't hurt you."*
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: Hurt me....? If you want to threaten me then I won't be afraid to draw my blade, woman.
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: You're on property which you don't belong at..I assume you have a visitor's pass..if not..I shall detain you.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) grimaced slightly as he had no such pass and was simply travelling alone in search of answers...He unsheathed his blade regardless, his eyes closed as he flipped it repeatedly in his hand...He pointed it towards her, his fear hidden beneath the surface as his eyes shone in anger of his Kage's death...

"I'm looking for answers as to who is left of Kumogakure, and I can't allow you to detain me and stop my search..."*
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: I could careless what you're doing..that's none of my business..all I want to know..is where is your pass.
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: I don't have one and your not getting in my way.
<br><font color=green>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) says: Now move!
<br><font color=green>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) says: Fine..do as you please.
<br><font color=yellow>*Ishizu Valens(Devoin) steps aside.*
