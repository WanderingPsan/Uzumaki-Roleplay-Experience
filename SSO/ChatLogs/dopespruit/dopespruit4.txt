<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Harada, Haru.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I heared from Evan that I'm in the Chuunin Finals o.e )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (lolwut)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Ah, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I was about to buy some shuriken.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Are you a Genin?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I am a chunnin.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Ah, phew.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (your from konoha too lol)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I was scared that you'd be a Genin from another village that's angry about not being in the Chuunin Finals.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: If you're a Chuunin, then please tell me. Are the Finals scary?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Yes they are.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: . . . 
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: You will be facing some of the best genin out there.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Oh god I'm done for.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Don't worry.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: All you need is confidence.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Confidence? How can I have confidence with only the basics of the basics and one jutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I've seen one of the others fight.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: She will slice me up.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: A shinobi's strength isn't determined by how many jutsu he has.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: It is measured by his ability to not give up.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Well, I would just feel more confident if I had something special, something that they didn't know about.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: What jutsu do you have?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: The Genin already know what I can do, and what I cannot. They must be making strategies right now on how to counter me.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Water Style : Raging Waves. . . 
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Oh, I see.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well then.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Here.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) gives him a scroll labeled, 'Water Style: Syrup Capture Feild.'*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (Field*)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (Syrup Trap**)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( xD )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I would feel so much epicer with Third Affinity : Katon. Then if I did become Toad Sage I'd be able to do Toad Oil Flame Bullet, once I'm like A rank xD )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (XD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) took hold of the scroll and blinked a few times. '' Thank you, you're a kind Shinobi. '' , he smiled gently at her and opened the scroll.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: This jutsu isn't much. But it will help you a bunch if you opponent is caught with it.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: And don't mention it.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (7 rps for the jutsu)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (its C ranked)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I'll be going now.
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked out of the weapon supplier shop, he stared at the scroll while reading what was stated inside of it. '' The user spits out high-viscosity, chakra infused water, aimed at a surface of wide scope. This is a stream of sticky liquid which can be used to form an adhesive trap that can inhibit a person's mobility. One can effectively reduce their enemy's area of activity with this technique, and has the effect of being able to take complete control over the battlefield. The normal scope of this technique is normally just a few metres, but if prepared, it is also possible to make an entire pond of starch syrup. Being caught in the technique can be avoided by channelling chakra to one's feet allowing one to walk upon it uninhibited, beforehand. ''

The boy blinked a few times and found a place to train this new jutsu, he stared at the hand seals that were needed to perform the jutsu and made a slight nod. '' Ram, Tiger. . . . Got it. '' , the boy closed his eyes and charged chakra inside of his body, first making the Ram seal and following afterwards with the Tiger. Once he was done he stared forward while spitting out some water.

'' Eh. . . This is just regular spit. . . . . Maybe I need to do something else with it. '' , he rubbed his chin and sat down while writing notes in a notebook and putting the most important parts of the scroll into it. '' Alright, with this notebook I'll be able to learn the jutsu. And once I'm done I'll show it to that nice lady and show my improvement! '' , he smiled and took a small rest.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (??)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( How many Rps can I make a day? )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (for wut?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( The Jutsu. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :S )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (you can do all 7 rps today for the jutsu)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Okay. )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Got 1 down xD )
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) grabbed his notebook, it held the most important parts of the jutsu and was perfect for studying it inside of his head. He underlined the words that seemed the most important like '' High-Viscosity Chakra Infused Chakra. '' and '' Adhesive Trap. '' , the boy rubbed his chin and stood up while putting the notebook down.

'' Alright, first I need to make a couple of hand seals. '' , Haru took a small peek at the notebook before preforming the Ram seal while charging Chakra inside of one point of his body, it was a small bit, a really small. He didn't want to waste any Chakra right of the bat so he kept most of it inside to escape any after effects like getting tired.

Harada ended the series with the Tiger seal as he surged the chakra towards his mouth like he would do with his other Water Style Jutsu, the boy shot it out forward and made a large ball of water, it fell on the ground and splashed him. '' . . . . Really? '' , he muttered while face-palming.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :S )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( They said Free RP. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( So I just rped what came to mind. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( And because the Toad Sages are Genins. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :S )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Are you a resident here?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Yes I'm.
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked through the streets with the scroll and notebook between his waist and arm, he headed for a big lake, a place with water would surely help him more then such a dry grassy area. '' Ah, that lake seems good. '' , he said while staring at a not to far away area. It took two minutes by foot to get there from his place so he reached it fast and easy.

'' Now then, let's do it like this. '' , he said while dropping his notebook and scroll onto the ground, his hands clapped together with a loud sound as he formed them into the Ram seal with a quick and good movement, followed up by a Tiger seal that was but slightly different from the Ram. His Chakra was send to his mouth after gathering it all into one spot. '' First to get some experience with the Jutsu before doing what I want to do. '' , he thought.

The boy shot out a large blast of water onto the lake but nothing extraordinary happened, it was a simple bubble of water, not even remotely close to what he wanted to make. '' Ah, damn it. '' , he thought.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Don't pay attention to that :S )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Nice to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Nice to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (How long you been playing this game?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( 2 days :S )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Do you know where I can find your Kage or the head of the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (oh. Do you like it?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( It's a nice Server. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( The Chuunin Exam Third Round took a long time to finish but the rest was all really fun. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I don't know for sure.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: But follow me.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (you were in the chuunin after only two days of play lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) lowered his body towards the lake and stared at it, the water was almost crystal clear and nothing seemed wrong with it. '' Alright then, I'll try it this time with the actual plan I had in mind. '' , the boy grinned and stayed at his position while taking a deep breath and closing his eyes as he took a moment of sollitude to meditate.

Once Harada's Chakra was replenished and his body was ready for more training, he performed the two hand seals again, getting faster at the progress with it as it seemed like he didn't have any problem with it at the moment. The Chakra was being focussed towards a single spot of his body.

Haru took a sip of the lake's water and kept it inside of his mouth while fusing it with the Chakra enhanced water from his body as he spew it out of his mouth as he walked forward, making the place slippery with water, but it was still regular water. It was only slippery and wet, not sticky and he could still use movements onto it. '' Hmmm. . . '' , he thought.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Also ignore that Rp xD. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( It's the 1 month Hiatus time between the Semi-Finals ( Third Round Finals ) and the Actual Finals of Chuunins. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I'm one of the last remaining. ;p )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (hm)

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (gimme basics, shunshin and suimen please)

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Repeat what you said.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I didn't say anything.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Call me fat again.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Go for it.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: . . . . 
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I said you were big boned.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) raised his right fist, clenching it hardly.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Okay, Okay. I called you fat.
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Oh yeah... Am I on a squad?
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) quickly put his right hand on the top of the kid's hair. He quickly grabbed his hair and dragged him away, in a sort of punishment.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) gets dragged away like the bitch he is.*

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Wait.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Genjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Don't know anything about it and if I ever get hit by one I'll probably be defeated without any resistance.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I can't help with that...
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Then Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I'm a shit-
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Now you are speaking my language.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: What are you difficulties and your advantages?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Um.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I just have above average Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I can hold my own in a Taijutsu fight, but my reflexes are a bit dull.

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I'll need to finish training a Jutsu of mine.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Named?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not finished yet.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: You have water?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Me too.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I got Fire and Water, though.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i dun want chakra ne more)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (ffs, you cant lolswitch perks)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (can i have massive strenght ?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (no)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (why)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: What do you want help with it?
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked around on the training ground while his now newly made Sensei by the Hokage-Sama him/herself was watching him. '' Alright, I'll get my notebook out and start reading the instructions. '' , he blinked a few times while placing his hand in a backpouch, inside was a small book with notes that he flipped open and began to read.

'' Alrighty then. '' , Harada stretched his legs and closed his eyes, slowly gathering up Chakra inside of his body as he performed the Ram seal, thinking about a wide flood of water that could reach about four meters infront of him and three meters wide, he stayed focussed as he channeled the Chakra towards his mouth.

With the next handseal he turned the Chakra into water, as it became to what seemed more of a puking manner then a spitting manner, he wasn't used to this and needed to get some experience until he could do it without barfing his organs out of his mouth. 

Now infront of him laid a two meter wide and three meter long flood of slippery water, he showed improvement but it wasn't sticky yet, it couldn't stick the oponent to the ground and corner him/her into a trap with this. '' Damn, I still need to work on it some more. '' , he said to himself.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Just 2 more Rp's :S )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's getting close.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (thats more than 2 rps)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (1 rp = 6 lines)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :S Nah. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u got a lot tho)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (Trin just told us)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I make Para's :S )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i'm telling that)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u made more than 2 rps on this)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (didnt u say u needed 3?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I made 4 Rps with 3 Paras. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( And this one with 4. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :l )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( 7 in total. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (how many do u need?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( So 2 more Rps. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (4x3=12)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (+4=16)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u got 16 rps)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: ((World)(Malcolm1rock)(Genin D+)Sotokon: How many lines are considred 1 rp?
(World)(Typhlosion101)(Genin D+)Sashi: ^
(World)(Malcolm1rock)(Genin D+)Sotokon: Cause you guys made a req. didn't you?
(World)(Trinity606)(Chuunin C+)Yamanaka, Suzy: at least 6-7
)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: ((( D-rank = 5 rps | C-Rank = 9 | B-rank = 10 | A-Rank = 15 | Kinjutsu = 25 ) 
))
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked through the water as he felt his shoes getting wet, it didn't feel that nice to him knowing that he barfed it out himself, but he was glad to know that his jutsu was finnaly getting somewhere. He rubbed his chin and walked back to his regular spot now staring at the left side. '' Alright, now I'll add in the Sticky part of the jutsu. ''

Harada began to close his eyes while charging his Chakra into one single point, his stomache was overflowing with focussed mental and physical energy as he made the Ram seal once again, he followed it up with a Tiger seal immideatly and made the Chakra flow up inside of his neck as he imagined a pool of water spewing outside of his mouth that could stick anything to it like gum or glue.

'' Water Style : Starch Syrup Capturing! '' , Haru chanted the name of the Jutsu while shooting out the syrup like water infront of him, it was a smaller pool then he imagined, it didn't take much Chakra out of him at all. He now knew that he had actually already finished it, he only needed to put in a bit more Chakra. '' Alright, next time I'll finish it. '' *
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Great job.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I'm waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Just a little more, wait a little bit.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: And you'll see it finished!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (Do I really need 2 rps to learn a jutsu...)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (owait its c rank)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i need 6)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) grinned at Takumo, the boy grabbed a shuriken out of his holster and aimed it at his left cheeck, as he swung it towards him but making it just far enough from the cheeck to not make any actual harm. He hoped for him to jump to the right and fall into his trap, he needed to see if his Jutsu was ready to be used in battle so he estimated his jumping power and clenched his hands into fists.

'' Ram! '' , Haru chanted the word while performing the hand seal and thinking of his Chakra being put into a large pool of syrup that would be able to stick anything it touched to the ground, he took a deep breath as he poured in a good amount of Chakra this time to make it bigger then the last one.  He stared at Takumo, hoping that he did jump into his trap.

Once more the boy made a hand seal and this time it was the ' Tiger ' seal, he made a form with his hands resembling the Ram, while opening his mouth barely to let a spray of Syrup shoot out of it, like a fast flooding fountain, aimed at a four meter lenght and three meters wide area infront of him, if Takumo landed in the Syrup then his feet would be stuck ontop of it unless he had Chakra on them before connecting with the Syrup. If he added Chakra to his feet after connecting then it would already be to late.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) jumped to the right trying to dodge the weapon, falling into the guy's trap. He quickly noticed his feet being trapped by the water, mentioning: "Good trick, boy." The fat dude channalized chakra into his feet area, expanding it, and releasing the trap.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Great jutsu is this one.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hehe.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) || His shit would hit the ground.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: So.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: You just create the water with chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Spit it on the water.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: And what?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not as easy as it sounds.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: You also need to make it sticky.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not easy to explain.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Tell me what you do.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I imagine a sticky Syrup like water coming out of my mouth through the use of Chakra that turns into that.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: That's practically it.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Did the Chunins Continue yesterday? :S )
