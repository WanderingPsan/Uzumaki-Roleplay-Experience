<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) tried to smile in this ridiculous situation, the fact that some people were just standing there and looking at the situation, even listening in yet not doing anything. It made him rather angry to be honest. His hand was still stuck to Baen, and they were close. This meant that the shinobi's blade which he was literaly pointing right at Baen the entire time could be shoved in his chest at any moment. And well, that's exactly what the teenager went for.

''Tch.'' Taiga took no moment to hessitate, he thrusted his blade at Baen. With the minimal distance between his blade and his chest the chances of hitting were incredibly high, especialy since they shook hands meaning that the man couldn't move to the side and dodge anymore. Of course, maybe Ossa could escape somehow. But Taiga kept his eyes on him as he attempted to hit the man's chest and stab right into his heart with his flaming blade to end the man's life.* - Sun Oct  4 00:12:22 2015

That was the only way for him to prevent the bones from getting closer to his body after all. He couldn't really move from his spot anymore now that the man had caught him like this. ''I see, you're a bastard. Luring me in to attack so you'd have a reason. Well, since I'm going to die anyway. Mind telling me the name of the person who put this bounty on me in the end? I'd like to know who caused my death.''

Taiga was just standing there, waiting to see what would happen next. After he couldn't do much at this point but keep his burning sword on burning.* - Sun Oct  4 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) didn't know what to say, his eyes were wide at this point with bags underneith. Did he just survive a murder attempt because he was weak?

'' He grabbed it with a half broken yet half determined expression. He had to get stronger even when he felt like crap, his hand held on to the hilt as he channeled his chakra into the iron and turned it aflame. It didn't cost him that much chakra, but the pain from his barely healed palms was making it hard to keep hold of his weapon. He had to take it easy while he was still recovering.

What the boy didn't notice was that he was actually crying, tears flooded his cheeks while the flames from his blade warmed up his body. He just sat there looking at his blade, waiting for his chakra to eventually run out. His eyes didn't move at all, the tears stopped at some point. And his face dried up due to the little campfire his tanto was making for him and anyone near the blade. ''. .  Tch.'' The fact that he was still so weak after all that training left a bitter taste in his mouth.

The teenager took a deep breath and pulled himself up from the ground, his body turning for now to head to the village entrance with his flaming sword. He had no idea what to do at this point. But be damned if he didn't keep his tanto unsheathed and his flames roaring to protect himself from any possible danger incoming. ''Tetsu went that way right?''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sat next to a building surrounding the village square for now. He grabbed the tanto from his sheath and stabbed it in the ground infront of him. He really had to practice some more, what happened the previous day left him feeling weak and small after all. ''Damn it, I really fucked up that time. I can't believe that I'm still so weak!'' He said to himself, flames sprouting from the blade as if to show the teenager's own anger. He didn't move the blade from it's current spot, and just looked on at the flames.

Harada sighned, knowing that beating himself up over it wasn't going to help him either. He had to get stronger that was true, but feeling bad was only going to make negative things happen. ''Chakra Flow, it's my only answer for fighting right now. . '' He mumbled, watching on as he drained his chakra to keep the flames from dying out. He didn't even feel tired from using it for a while, after all he was close to finishing up this technique as a whole, which meant that he could move on to another technique soon.

''One technique makes a ring of fire, another shoots a giant fireball and the last one shoots like a flamethrower.'' He said, listing down his other Katon techniques. This one was without a doubt the most different of the four, as all the others were for mid-range and required just Ninjutsu. Chakra Flow was an interesting and useful ability in deed. He pulled the sword out of the ground for a moment and rose it up to the sky, letting the flames float up to the air as it died out at a certain point.

There was nothing interesting about training a technique that he had almost mastered, but almost mastering it and having it mastered was a big difference. Of course he wanted to reach the maximum potential of this technique at his current state. And so he struck down the blade, letting the flames shoot forward as if to cut and burn the ground infront of him at the same time. Meaning that he used the flames as a way to make his reach longer. Which was probably the right way to use it.

''. . . I'm still not there yet at all am I?'' He said, clenching his fists and thus tightening the grip around his weapon. The teenager stood up and rose his arms up on the sky again, only to bring them down to the ground to make a simple strike. He continued to practice this at his own pace, having his sweat slide down his face after a while. Showing that he was indeed getting tired from training like this. But that was normal for anyone, training required energy after all.* - Sun Oct  4 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) didn't have any intention of stopping here, for once he was going to train without taking a break. ''I'm going to master this technique, I have to!'' His face was dead serious, the sweat sliding down his face caused his sight to become blurry as it got in his eyes. But that didn't matter, the teenager continued to strike down infront of him with the flames burning on. He had a rythm in his breathing as well to keep it up longer, he was really getting into his training for once.

''Hah, Hah!'' Harada released that from his lips with every strike he took. The boy also managed to breath in from his nose and out from his mouth like he was supposed to. His form was normal and his strikes were strong, atleast for him. The flames on the other hand were getting better than both, as he was slowly starting to master the technique. Which would be a first for him as he never mastered a technique. Any at all. ''Chakra Flow, I'll have you under my thumb soon enough!''

He had to believe in himself for now, his emotions were a mess at the moment and training was the only thing that got him back to his normal self. It was was kept him calm from screaming out his anger. ''Hah, Hah!'' The strikes continued on, flames releasing from the blade. There was no starting point, the flames just started from all over the iron. It was surprising that the blade didn't melt, but that was just part of the technique after all. ''!'' The teenager rose his arms to the sky and looked infront of himself.

''HAAAAH!'' He pulled his arms and weapon down as far as he could. The blade striking the ground as the flames surrounding it went further forward as to increase his strike range. But it also increased the destructive power of the weapon, as the flames continued to burn on for a while. But ultimately it was in a desert so the flames would die out in such a sandy, dry place. '' . . Hm.'' He took a step back and prepared another strike like that, and again without stopping.

There was no time to relax for the boy right now, he was getting closer to finishing up this technique. Then, and only then would he be allowed to take a moment of rest to sit at the village square. Of course it was stupid of him to stay outside where it was dangerous, but he didn't want everyone to see him train either. ''Hah, Hah!'' The  boy's flame covered weapon swung down again and again, it seemed like he was getting it almost perfectly at this point. Just a few more tries.* - Sun Oct  4 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) was panting, sweating, gasping for air. All of that, but he was still not finished. His tired body still had to pull through for a while longer. ''!'' This time he stood like a baseball batter, swinging with a small twist from his body. The flames sprouted from the iron and released during the swing to make a cover of flames for himself. It was a smart idea, or so he thought at least. This was just another way of using Chakra Flow to his advantage. ''. . I'm almost there.'' He muttered, making sure to tighten his grip.

''Almost, almost!'' He continued to say that word with every swing, it sounded weird when he was also breathing in and out heavily. But nobody was there to coach him so he had to do it himself. The swings were improving due to the flames being easy to handle to the point where controling it was no task at all. The teenager released the technique and returned the weapon to his sheath. ''. .  That should be enough, right?'' He was sure of it that he managed to master this technique.* - Sun Oct  4 09:15:56 2015

He said, he turned to the next door, seeing various things in this lab. Things that he really didn't want to see ever. He just wanted to burn the place up and run forever from this place. His attention turned to Kilm, Zenaki and Fujitora.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) held his hand infront of his mouth as he turned around and left. Trying not to look at the body parts and corpses. He was going to puke if he stayed any longer. ''I hope I'll never have to see that place again.'' He thought.* - Sun Oct  4 11:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Whenever you're ready. - Sun Oct  4 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) clapped his hands together and made a single handseal while leaping forward at his full speed. It was the tiger handseal meaning fire. But it still created something interesting, his mouth released a bunch of flames like a dragon's breath. Thus earning the name Ninja Art: Flamethrower, he intended to practice his techniques in this spar so that the training wouldn't be boring after all. His eyes were focusing on Kilm the entire time.* - Sun Oct  4 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) held his tiger handseal up even when the technique was being pushed back. He simply tried to continue the clash, his technique was stronger but his Ninjutsu as a whole was weaker. This of course meant that his technique was being pushed back. Thus he had to cancel it out a moment later to move to the side so he could escape. ''. .  Hm.'' He tried to think of a plan, but he had nothing for now. The teenager decided to keep the distance for now and see what would happen.

''I can't match him in speed and Ninjutsu.  . How can I come close to him?'' He thought.* - Sun Oct  4 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his head to the back, a wall behind him. He was cornered, he didn't know suimen after all. But then again. . ''!'' The boy leapt up in the air and unsheathed his tanto at the same time, stabbing it in the wall to keep above the ground. His eyes watching at the wave of mud and water hitting the wall. The teenager used his nimble body to pull himself up and find a spot to stand on the wall. Of course his footing could break off if he became too careless. ''Let's test it out first.'' He mumbled.

Harada formed the tiger handseal once more, spewing out flames into the wave of mud and water. But it didn't do anything, the water was too strong for his flames and thus burned it all out. ''Maybe it could've done something if that water wasn't there. . '' He thought, his eyes then turning over to Kilm. Waiting for his next move, since he couldn't get close now that the ground was a dangerzone.* - Sun Oct  4 12:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, his hands holding on to the wall now. But the wall crumbled apart, thus he fell down. ''Shit, shit, shit!'' He thought, clapping his hands together and weaving a few handseals quickly as he spew out more flames than before. This time creating a big ball to hopefuly push away the electrified water around the spot he'd try to land in. It was a gambit at this point, and the chances of him getting hurt were high as well. But maybe he could safe himself from most of the dangerzone with this.

''Goukakyuu, please pull through!''* - Sun Oct  4 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, just being pulled up by the man and spoke. ''Hm, sure. A quick visit couldn't hurt, but we can't stay too long alright?'' He clapped his hands together and formed the tiger handseal once more, blowing out flames to give Kilm a cool effect as he ran carrying the teenager. ''This looks kinda cool actually.'' He mumbled. ''Plus you're my buddy, my best bet to being safe is when I'm near you.'' He said, releasing the technique to stop the amazing runnig effect.* - Sun Oct  4 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll be taking a caravan. - Sun Oct  4 12:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, sure. - Sun Oct  4 12:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sat in the caravan with Kilm, his hands clapping together to form the tiger handseal as he shot out his chakra and oxygen from his lips to form a breath of fire. Much like a dragon breathing flames. The giant bullet even formed into the face of a dragon, something he managed to do because he had trained his fire chakra for a while.''Hm. .  Still needs alot of work.'' He said, watching at the flames trail behind the caravan and slowly die out as they got closer to Kumogakure. ''Caravans sure are nice huh?'' He said.* - Sun Oct  4 12:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No one's inside. - Sun Oct  4 12:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head right now, his eyes half closed and his eyebrows frowning. ''Kumogakure looks so dead. . .'' With that he meant the enviroment, he didn't know which was worse Sunagakure or Kumogakure. He was also still training his fire technique, but made sure that he didn't damage anything. He simply shot out the flames up towards the air and allowed it to die out quickly. ''Hm, maybe the people left or they're somewhere in another building.'' He said, following Kilm calmly.* - Sun Oct  4 12:44:09 2015

All it took was a mere second for him to shoot a stream of fire out of his mouth. It was much like a flamethrower yet somehow resembled the head of a dragon as it reached it's limit and died out. ''Hm.''  Taiga wrote down the instructions of the technique in a scroll and handed it over to Seisuke. ''There you go.'' He said.* - Sun Oct  4 13:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So if I were to turn in this C ranked one. - Sun Oct  4 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) scratched the back of his head, having nothing to give to Seisuke as he knew every technique he did now. ''Well, that's a bummer.'' He yawned and clapped his hands together to form the tiger handseal, making sure to collect as much chakra as he could inside of his stomache. Breathing out the flamethrower like technique as it burned the ground infront of him and the others. ''Might as well train this technique for now.''

Harada pulled his head backwards and then shot it back forward, spewing out the flames from his stomache to burn the air and ground infront of him with the Dragon like technique. Some left over flames escaped the corners of his lips as he stopped the technique. This certainly took more chakra than Chakra Flow, but it used more flames and had a wider range. He wanted to get better at this technique without a doubt.

''Fire Style: Fire Dragon Bullet!'' The flames escaped his lips once again after he clapped his hands together to form the tiger handseal. The dragon head formed and devoured nothing because there was nothing to be devoured except for dirt and air. ''. .  I'm really lacking in experience for this technique.'' The boy said to himself, just sighning it off as he rubbed the back of his head for now. He had nothing better to do anyway. Might as well keep practicing.

The boy closed his eyes and took a deep breath, the oxygen and chakra combining to ignite the sparks in his lungs. He allowed it all to blow out of his mouth a moment later to continue his jutsu training. Time after time again, using it over and over until he memorized exactly how the technique worked. That was the best way to get better at a technique for somebody who wasn't a genious or talented like some of the people here.

The teenager cracked his knuckles and rotated his arms to keep his body from turning stiff. But he continued to waste his chakra on this technique he barely knew to train it once again. He had some minor burns around his mouth from training the technique so much. The control was there, but the experience in correctly handling the technique wasn't. Which was a real pain in the ass for Taiga as it was hard to properly learn how to use a technique.* - Sun Oct  4 13:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Just putting it out there., - Sun Oct  4 13:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Information. - Sun Oct  4 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sighned, he only barely managed to get better at the technique just now. He wanted to get used to the technique. ''Ugh, it's going to take a while huh?'' He said with a dissapointed expression on his face, the boy took a deep breath once more and clapped his hands together to form the tiger handseal. Allowing himself to use the fire technique yet again, he could already feel that this was going to take a long ass time.

Harada shrugged it off for now, knowing that being upset about it would just get him more angry. The fire kept on coming and the handseal was repeated once again as he spewed out the dragon like head and formed a flamethrower to burn nothing infront of him. He didn't pay attention to the conversation next to him. He had no time to learn new techniques because his current techniques were still lacking alot.

''Oh man, this is so boring!'' He cried out, wanting to stop his training now. But he was far from getting where he wanted to be, he had no choice but to continue training right now. The teenager rubbed the back of his head for now and took a deep breath, flames accidently forming in the technique too soon. Causing the boy to fall on his ass. He picked himself up from the ground and sighned once again.

Fire chakra, it wasn't a hard thing to control for Taiga now. But a fire technique? That was different, no matter how many times he tried or studied up on a technique. It was always the same, it took a long time for him to correctly use it and that's what annoyed the boy the most. He sighned for how many times during his practice, the flames burning his mouth time after time again. He couldn't even feel his chakra depleting at this point.

The teenager was panting and sweating like a maniac, falling on his back for a moment. But he continued to train even while his back was on the ground, spewing out flames into the air like a fountain. He made sure to not make it too big so that he wouldn't burn himself or those around him. But it was a rather comedic sight to look at to say the least. ''Why is training so boring. . '' He mumbled with dead fish eyes.* - Sun Oct  4 13:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Probably none of interest. - Sun Oct  4 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rolled on the ground for now, acting like a small child. ''I don't want to anymore. . . Ugh.'' He moaned and whined non-stop. Yet he didn't release the tiger handseal, showing that he knew how important training was. He couldn't use his technique like this in combat after all, the chakra drain was too high and he lacked proper control over it. He wanted it to have a wider range after all. So this small flamethrower was not enough to make him satisfied.

Harada stared at Seisuke for a moment, wondering how that man managed to learn so much techniques and still want to learn more. But the same was for Kilm who stood next to him. ''. . Ugh.'' His face was planted flat on the ground, which was stupid because he was spewing out flames. So his body jumped up from the flames and caused him to stand once more while his fountain like mouth spew out flames.

''It burns, it burns!'' He grabbed his head for a moment and stopped the technique, coughing out some smoke and leftover fire. He wiped the sweat from his forehead away and sighned. That was embarrasing and showed his lack of experience. He had to get back to training though so the teenager continued his practice and formed the tiger handseal once more. Blowing out a dragon like head infront of him and the others.

The boy wanted a way to speed up his training, because this was really starting to bore him. He coughed some smoke out once again and rubbed the back of his head. ''Tch, this is really just way too boring.'' He yawned slowly. His ears were wide open, making sure to listen to the conversation happening next to him as he spew out more flames. He was going to ran out of chakra at some point, probably soon.

A break was about to happen certainly. But not before the boy managed to get better at this technique. Atleast to make it usable in actual combat. Taiga clapped his hands together and frowned, his eyes closed. The deep breath allowed him to spew out the dragon head in an instant, the bright red and orange flames giving him warmth. . . Unneeded too because they were in a desert. ''So hot. . .''* - Sun Oct  4 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Probably none of interest. - Sun Oct  4 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And how do you know what I would be interested in? - Sun Oct  4 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'l sell you this blade on my Back. - Sun Oct  4 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: For Two Hundred And Fifty Million. - Sun Oct  4 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anything cheaper? - Sun Oct  4 13:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) pulled on his legs for a moment. ''Hm, I should train Fire Run a little bit. Chances are I'll never use it, but just a bit should be fine.'' And with that he decided to restart his training, but this time on a different technique. One that would probably take less time. He cracked his knuckles once more and clapped his hands together to form the tiger handseal again. Spewing out fire from his mouth to form a circle infront of him.

The boy held up his handseal and the circle for now, this seemed like technique that he'd get better at by keeping it up for a long time rather than doing it for a few seconds to then once again perform it. The sweat came down his face rather fast though, how was it so hard to properly make a circle with these flames? He couldn't understand that. The boy released his technique and wiped the sweat from his forehead. ''Hm, Once more.'' He mumbled.* - Sun Oct  4 13:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rotated his arms and wrists for a moment. Then he closed his eyes and pulled his head back, his cheeks filled with chakra and fire. ''!'' He pushed his face forward, blowing out flames once more to form a circle infront of him and the others. He maintained the technique with a calm composure and waited for it to slowly die out. It was really rough around the edges, but he noticed that he could easily become better at it if he tried to.

But he didn't want to do that, there was another technique he had to train after this. So this would be the last time he'd use this technique for now. ''Ninja Art: Fire Run!'' The boy blew out more chakra which turned into a circle of fire the moment he allowed a single spark to touch it. The heat made him sweat once again, but it only took a few seconds for him to cancel the technique and take a well deserved break.* - Sun Oct  4 13:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned, sitting down between Kilm and Tetsu at the moment. He clapped his hands together and slowly weaved together five handseals ending with the tiger seal. ''Right, now the same shit as Flame bullet.'' He said, breathing in deeply and combining his chakra with his oxygen. The flames escaped his mouth and shot forward, forming into a mediocre ball rolling on the ground infront of him as his eyes reflected the bright colors made by the fire.

''Ugh, that was terrible to look at. .  Small and left a bad taste in my mouth.'' The boy knew when he sucked at something and when he did something well to say the least. He took one more deep breath and shot out flames from inside his stomache after weaving multiple handseals ending with the tiger seal. There was no problem in doing the technique, but there was so much to do to make sure it didn't suck.

Taiga turned his attention over to the other people around him for a moment, they were all just kind of standing there for now. ''. .  Right.'' He was training all on his own, maybe everyone else had already finished their training for the day and he was just late. Or maybe they were all really lazy and needed to get off their butts to train. Either way the boy rubbed his face and went back to charging up chakra as he formed multiple handseals.

''Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu!'' He shouted it out loud, as if to let everyone know a ball of flame was going to come out of his mouth. He managed to pour in just the right amount fire, letting it roll infront of him as it blew his clothes back just a bit. It was a big technique after all, so it had some force behind it to say the least. The dry air didn't help the flames grow though, so it wasn't at it's full mediocre potential.

Harada rubbed the back of his head and sighned, he had to take a break after the next try. ''Ugh, training is such a drag.'' He clenched his fists for a moment but when back to practice the technique once more. It was the same routine, making a few handseals, charge chakra and mix it with his oxygen and then finish it off by shouting the name and spewing out the flames. He didn't bother to form a ball this time though.* - Sun Oct  4 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) noticed that the last attempt was utter shit and knew that he didn't deserve a break just yet. ''God damn it.'' The male rubbed the back of his head once more and prepared the technique. Weaving five handseals that finished with the tiger handseal. He was feeling tired from using all his chakra for this technique time after time again. It was the most taxing of his small skillset after all. The ball rolled forward and came rather far.

However the size wasn't anything to brag about, if anything it got smaller and smaller the further it go. The small trail of flames behind it also dissapeared in an instant. Leaving the ball on it's own for a few seconds until the flames stopped burning in the dry desert wind. ''Well that was depressing.'' The boy said, sighning once again. He sat down again and crossed his arms as his eyes closed, almost appearing to be asleep. But he was simply restoring his chakra for now.* - Sun Oct  4 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) actually snored right now, he was half-asleep. Training so much was really tiring the boy out. ''Eh, huh?!'' He woke up a second later and rubbed the back of his head, turning his head from left to right for a moment. Nothing happened, he just fell asleep and woke up in a few seconds. He returned to the molding of his fire chakra while redoing the handseals time after time again. Maybe that would keep him awake for now. 

''Katon:Goukakyuu no Jutsu!'' The teenager mumbled, releasing a small ball of fire out of his mouth. This was to preserve chakra and train the control over the technique. He had to train the control after all. He had enough chakra to be honest though. ''Such a boring way to train. . '' He was really fed up with it, laying on his back after finishing that technique with an angry expression appearing on his face.* - Sun Oct  4 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) took a deep breath and stood up once more. ''Time to train just a little bit.'' He muttered, clapping his hands together to weave a single handseal. The seal formed was the tiger handseal, he shot out a stream of flames infront of himself and turned them into a circle. It was a simple technique that didn't require too much chakra in the first place. And it still needed work so he wanted to fix that problem.

There was nothing to really say about this technique, it was simple and the flames circled around to trap an opponent. If he got a bit better at this then he could combine it with Tetsu to make a powerful combination. Add a few tags in there and it would be deadly. ''Hm, fighting in pairs is important. .  Goukakyuu can wait for now. This is more important.'' He muttered to himself, shooting out even more flames to continue his training.

Taiga cracked his knuckles and rotated his wrists for a moment. His hands were rather stiff after holding that tiger handseal the entire time. ''I wonder why these guys aren't doing anything. . '' The boy thought, looking at everyone for a few seconds. But his attention returned to the training at hand. His flames circling around infront of him to trap nothing because there was nothing infront of him to be trapped right now.

The boy rubbed the back of his head and sighned, knowing that there was nothing else for him to do but practice. But that didn't mean that he wanted to practice either. Right now he just wanted to sit down and talk with people. But he continued to train, making sure that the Fire Run technique would become usable in combat, because as it was now. . It really wasn't good, as could be seen by his pathetic attempt at using the technique.

''One more time. .'' He said, clapping his hands together and pulling his head back. ''Ninja Art: Fire Run!'' The boy pushed his face forward once more, spewing out the flames from his lungs and circling around infront of him. He released the technique and clapped his hands together once more to regain some chakra for now. He was satisfied with his training for the day, though he knew he was still weak.* - Sun Oct  4 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stood up one more time, he was actually not happy with that last attempt at all. He clapped his hands together one more time to form the tiger handseal. And from there on he made sure to do the technique well this time. Making it a proper circle, it showed that he gained more experienced in the technique and that he was getting better as a shinobi. ''Alright, that should be enough for today.''* - Sun Oct  4 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I should go train now. - Sun Oct  4 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why didn't you train while I was training? - Sun Oct  4 14:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll probably be back later then. - Sun Oct  4 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) opens up his mouth. ''So, nice weather huh?'' Heavy sarcasm was intended.* - Sun Oct  4 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Still better than Amegakure. - Sun Oct  4 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: True. - Sun Oct  4 15:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Sounds like you guys got fucked up, especially since you're wearing a Chuunin vest. - Sun Oct  4 15:48:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: You're from Konoha, but you're chillin in Sunagakure? - Sun Oct  4 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I hear it's hot as fuck there. - Sun Oct  4 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We were from Konoha. - Sun Oct  4 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah, It is. - Sun Oct  4 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sometimes shit happens. - Sun Oct  4 15:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Shit happens. - Sun Oct  4 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And then you have to escape your own home. - Sun Oct  4 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: That'll be the day for Kumogakure. - Sun Oct  4 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Our people wouldn't leave. - Sun Oct  4 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Only way I'd leave is if there was a mass exodus of all our womanfolk. - Sun Oct  4 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Heh. - Sun Oct  4 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You interested a lot in women? More than usual? - Sun Oct  4 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Well, I'll put it this way, a hole is a hole. - Sun Oct  4 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And something has to go in it? - Sun Oct  4 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: More or less. - Sun Oct  4 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right. . - Sun Oct  4 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hello Niza. - Sun Oct  4 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hello Kilm. - Sun Oct  4 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I would like to talk to you in the mansion - Sun Oct  4 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Sun Oct  4 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's go. - Sun Oct  4 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know what to do now. - Sun Oct  4 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) calmly ran up to Kilm and Tetsu, he fell behind at first but it wasn't that hard to get back up to them now. Tetsu wasn't the fastes out of the bunch after all. ''So, what did the two of you talk about Kilm? You just said you know what to do, what's that all about?'' Taiga asked, his attention only given for about fifty percent. The other fifty percent was directed to their enviroment, there were three of them. So they would probably be safe, but just to be sure he decided to stay on guard while they went on their travels.

''. . Shit, Konohagakure is a mess. .  Again.'' The teenager said, noticing just how utterly destroyed their old village was. But that didn't matter to him anymore, he was chased out after all. He continued to run next to Kilm, though he had a hard time keeping up with this man. As he was twice as fast or even more than that. Though he did feel some nostalgia to be running through his home country once more. The weather was nice, much better than Kirigakure, Amegakure, Sunagakure and Kumogakure for sure.* - Sun Oct  4 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned, it was calming but also tiring to be back in this country. The weather made it so easy to move around, but the shining sun and the perfect warmth made his feel like taking a nap. However he couldn't do that, he had to follow Kilm back to Sunagakure for now. The boy rushed through the country, knowing that it would take a long time for them to get through this one. Konohagakure was still in sight even now after all. And damn was there nothing left of it.

It was like a giant crater was the village. Maybe some wood and what not was left, ruins and broken houses. Stuff like that. ''And Konohagakure managed to fix it's problems, then it gets destroyed. .  What happened to it.'' He thought, feeling some sympathy for the village. After all it was his birthplace and there were lots of innocent people there. But now they were all dead. ''. . In a way I should be happy that I was chased out, otherwise I'd be dead huh?''* - Sun Oct  4 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) had his sight set on Sunagakure from this point onward. Konohagakure was out of his sight, or atleast what was left of it. ''. . .'' He didn't say a word this time, he couldn't let his mind get stuck on that village any longer. Worrying about it would only slow his movements down. And he didn't want to be a burden to Tetsu and Kilm who were going fast. ''. . . Well, it was nice to see the village again I think.'' He honestly wasn't sure after seeing that huge crater. But they were starting to reach further into the country.

The rest of the fire country was nice though, he regained his smile and rushed through the land. His feet moving a bit faster now that he had some enjoyment in traveling again. The teenager grabbed something to drink, thanking Kilm for giving it to him. He finished it and reached the desert at the same time as his two companions. Sweat sliding down his forehead and face, it really was hot there.* - Sun Oct  4 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sighned, the heat from the desert was getting to him already. Even though he had gotten used to it before, but now that he came from another country he felt hot and uncomfortable yet again. The desert sucked, Sunagakure's enviroment sucked and he had to live with that. ''Ugh, I wish the desert didn't exist and was just more like the fire country.'' He said, showing signs of anger, but he still continued to go in deeper. The village hidden in the desert was soon to be reached after all.

''!'' He noticed something in his sight, the village was starting to slowly appear as a small figure. And it got bigger the closer the three of them got. He continued to drink some water while traveling, that was needed in this heat without a doubt. He wiped the sweat from his face once more and smiled. ''Maybe people will actually be awake now.'' He thought, following behind Kilm and Tetsu on the end of their trip.* - Sun Oct  4 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I should tell Zenaki right now instead of Fujitora . . . She might pass it to him when she sees him. - Sun Oct  4 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Seen Fujitora, Zenaki? - Sun Oct  4 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) had a finger up his nose, with dead fish eyes. He didn't care.* - Sun Oct  4 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: He is asleep.  - Sun Oct  4 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright . . . Mind if you tell him something when you see him? - Sun Oct  4 16:55:53 2015
