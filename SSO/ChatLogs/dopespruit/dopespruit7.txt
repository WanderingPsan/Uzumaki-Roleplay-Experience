<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We weren't hired. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just personal matters. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I make sure to tell them this was an A rank mission? - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They didn't seem to take it seriously. That's what worries me. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Katsune, you have to remember that you're the Hokage. Just because two of your shinobi are giving you the puppy dog eyes doesn't mean you should send them on a mission like that if you don't think they'll survive. - Wed Sep 23 12:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: No you did not. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I take it that you actually want him to stop them, right? - Wed Sep 23 12:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They've already left. - Wed Sep 23 12:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: This is the problem with the hokage being weak. - Wed Sep 23 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then you can only hope for the best. - Wed Sep 23 12:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Maybe you should shift your focus to something else for now. Stressing over it won't do anything. - Wed Sep 23 12:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't believe that. Not stressing over anything is why Orakuru's dead. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It started a war. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why Kitora's dead. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo too. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I honestly have no comeback for that. - Wed Sep 23 12:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I judge my own behavior, and you judge yours? - Wed Sep 23 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm just saying . . .  - Wed Sep 23 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Still . . . Like I said . . . I have hopes that they'll be fine. - Wed Sep 23 12:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll be handing over the portion of Konohagakure I have control soon. - Wed Sep 23 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've done my part, and I'm willing to entrust you with what's left to be done. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see... - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You, Katsune, are not a dunce; you can handle things. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I, however, will be at your disposal should you need me. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I will be around the village, but I won't be doing as much as I am already. - Wed Sep 23 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: After I get in contact with Kirigakure officials and see where Koeki stands in my plan, the rest is on you when it comes to this village. - Wed Sep 23 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know... - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've never been with Beth on a mission. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Beth.. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aside from the scouting one, way back then. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm... - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I almost killed her in Amegakure.. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Recently? - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Recently as in after Zetsumo's death, yes. - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She came here, and I've told her she can stay. She's a bit...sadistic. Bloodthirsty. But she's very skilled. - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Request her appearance once again. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's on a mission. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd like a second conversation- - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I should privately ask Paine and Shin for reports when they get back. I'd like to know how she leads. - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If she's good at it, I could use more chuunin. - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: This was the first serious mission I've ever given out. I'm definitely going to learn fast from this mistake. - Wed Sep 23 13:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't be too Chuunin-happy. - Wed Sep 23 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: At the end of the day, it's just a rank and vest. - Wed Sep 23 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. I'm only letting competent people wear it. - Wed Sep 23 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I was put on the spot with Kilm. . . - Wed Sep 23 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What is the need of asking them privately? Was the mission that important..? - Wed Sep 23 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- They're in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..There's no time for jokes, Katsune. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She's serious. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What mission did you gi- - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And that was logical how..? - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It....was supposed to be only Beth. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) clapped his hands together, his eyes clothes and sweat sliding down his face already. The boy took a deep breath to calm himself down. ''Alright, let's learn this technique now. . . I should've tried a long time ago to be honest.'' The genin cracked his knuckles and grabbed the scroll Ushinawa gave him before. To be honest he didn't really care at the moment but he had to do it at some point. Taiga opened the scroll and read the name of the technique. ''Fireball no Jutsu. . .'' It seemed powerfull.

Harada sat down, it took a while to finish the entire scroll. But he felt like he needed to read a few more times to completely get the technique. The boy grabbed a pencil from his holster and underlined whatever seemed like an important word. ''I see, so that does that and this causes that. It's certainly a powerfull technique.'' He muttered, seeming impressed by such a common ninjutsu. But he didn't know this so whatever right?* - Fri Sep 25 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head, wondering if he was fully understanding the technique. ''Hmm. . . Alright, I get it now.'' He said, but the boy was still too scared to actually try it. For now he just wanted to make sure he got everything perfectly, it sounded like a dangerous technique that would burn him if he didn't understand how to control it properly. Harada went on to the handseals and took a quick read, there were even pictures of the seals themselves. Though he knew atleast about handseals.

Taiga practiced the handseals time after time again, sighning when it got boring. This really felt like a drag, but even so he wanted to get this part down. If he fucked up the handseals then he would have to dig his own grave because that'd be embarrasing. ''Fireball no Jutsu uses five handseals, and like any classic fire technique it ends with the tiger seal. . . Not only that, I can use my hands as an assist to control the flames if I put two fingers next to my lips.'' He said to himself.* - Fri Sep 25 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) clapped his hands together yet again, he felt like it was almost time to actually start practicing the technique itself. But even then he was still hesitant to actually try it. ''Hm, maybe I should take a break first.'' The genin grabbed a lunch box from his backpouch, though it was small in size. The boy simply ate away for a while, not really minding anything that could possibly happen around him. ''So the chakra I use and the oxygen I inhale turn into flames and then I spew them out. . From then on I'll have to control it. It doesn't have to be a ball of flames either.''

The technique was rather versatile to be honest, while also ranged and dangerous. It could kill a person if used right or combined with the right techniques. ''I wonder if I can even use it with my chakra reserves.'' He never thought of his own reserves as big, but he didn't exactly think they were small either. Anyway, Taiga grabbed the scroll and decided to take one last read through it before he went on to the actual practicing of the technique. ''I just hope this goes well. . .''* - Fri Sep 25 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stretched his arms wide, he got to the actual practicing of the technique now. ''Katon. .  Goukakyuu no jutsu, right?'' He didn't have to say the actual technique and he knew that, but it was a habit from an unexperienced shinobi. Taiga closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his head pulled back with his cheeks puffing up. He molded his chakra inside his lungs and allowed both his oxygen and chakra to mix together into what felt like hot flames. The boy formed the five handseals and finished it with the tiger seal, being content with it.

Harada opened his lips just a little, two fingers to the right side for control. The flames blew out haphazardly though. The control was all over the place, but atleast there were flames. .  So that was something? He rubbed the back of his head out of embarrasment.  Atleast nobody saw his failure, so he was safe from being bullied. ''I see, I get the technique and I know how to do it. . . But I can't control the flames well enough to make actual use out of it.'' He rubbed his chin for now.* - Fri Sep 25 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) remained calm, even after his failure. It was only the first try after all, he was going to do better this time. He just knew it, his eyes closed as he took a few deep breaths. Each time he tried to keep a little of that oxygen inside, carefully molding it with his chakra. ''!'' Taiga clapped his hands together, his mouth now closing with the final breath as his cheeks puffed up, his formed the first two handseals and felt the heat of the flames inside his body rise up like a volcano. It reached through his throat and waited behind his lips. The boy made three more handseals and placed two fingers next to his mouth for the final part of the ninjutsu.

''Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu!'' Flames rolled up into a ball infront of the Genin, the red and orange flames causing a dawn like surrounding around him. He blinked his eyes for a moment, the fire clearly shown in his eyes like a mirror. However, he still lost control at the end. It turned into a lowkey chaos. This made Taiga cancel the technique and remind himself to not get lost in the technique itself. ''Alright, I'm getting closer to grasping the actual technique.'' He said with a smile. Clearly satisfied with that attempt even if it could've gone better.* - Fri Sep 25 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sat down, his hands on both knees. ''So I know where I went wrong and I know what to do better this time.'' Of course he tried again, but failed. This cycle would repeat itself for a while like any practice session for anyone really. Practice was key, but it also took time. However he got closer to it everytime, he felt like he was really getting a grasp on the control. Even if his ninjutsu was really bad. And he knew this, thus this gave him a reason to actually better himself. ''I should keep this up for a little while longer, it's not usefull for combat. . And it won't be for a long time with my weak ninjutsu, but still!''

Taiga clapped his hands together and closed his eyes, once more going through the preparations for the Fireball technique like everytime. He was bad at everything but Taijutsu, so he had to pay more attention to the little things like this. Details were important, and even those were messed up by Harada all the time. Flames escaped the ends of his mouths, causing him to puke out the flames like a sick kid. Though this caused him to quickly take control of the technique since he had no choice to at this time.

It was about to turn really bad, but he pressed onward. ''I have to fix this!'' He thought, because if he didn't he'd probably burn a tree or two. It took Taiga a moment but he managed to form the puked out flames into a ball that stayed in the same place for a few seconds. However he felt drained afterwards. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and decided that he was done with his training for now atleast. ''Alright, I'll see what I can do to get better at this when I'm actually up to par with ninjutsu. . .''* - Fri Sep 25 22:51:18 2015
