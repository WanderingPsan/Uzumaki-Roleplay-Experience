<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If we end up fighting bandits then of course, but if we fight somebody strong. Then maybe it would be best for me to guard our client. - Sat Sep 26 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm an elementalist . . . I have a genjutsu and then four elements with tons of jutsu for each one. - Sat Sep 26 19:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Try to attack using taijutsu together. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't attack at the same time . . . That makes dodging easier since if you dodge one attack, You unknowingly dodge another. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Try to fight close combat in succession. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Understood. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Lyric, if you start with your shurikens then I'll follow up with my blade. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For example, Lyric attacks first and then afterwards Taiga quickly tries to attack as well though not at the same time. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It will make dodging a lot harder. - Sat Sep 26 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright, I have lots of crowd control jutsu. - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I use Syrup Trap water, Try not to walk on it without having suimen activated. - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) thinks: ..I need to learn that. - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you don't have it . . . Avoid it. - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: While my ninjutsu may lack. I do know Fire Run to trap enemies in a circle of fire. - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I do so too. - Sat Sep 26 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway. - Sat Sep 26 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The blacksmith arrived . . . Shall we begin? - Sat Sep 26 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right. - Sat Sep 26 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Mhm. - Sat Sep 26 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Try and avoid projectiles too . . . They could be too strong to stop if anything. - Sat Sep 26 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) clenched his fists, this was going to be a really dangerous mission. He noticed that he was already standing in the right position so he didn't have to move. ''Projectiles. .  Understood.'' He said, taking a few deep breaths to calm himself.* - Sat Sep 26 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's get going then, Shall we? - Sat Sep 26 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 26 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) placed his right hand on his tanto, unsheathing it already. Having to grab it later on when danger appears would just slow him down. The Genin followed behind Kilm, making sure that he was close to the client. ''Projectiles, keep your eyes out.'' He muttered to himself, his eyes looking all over the area. Although he didn't really have amazing sight. He just hoped that his causciousness was enough to make up for that. Taiga didn't say anything as they went through the last parts of their own country, though he was also interested in learning what Kumogakure looked like. ''I hope that we'll get through this without any trouble.''

Harada blinked for a moment, the moment he saw the land of Kumogakure. ''That sure looks dead huh?'' He rubbed his forehead clean, noticing that he started to sweat from all the walking. The boy grabbed a sandwich from his backpouch and quickly ate it, following that with a water bottle. He needed a full stomache for a mission like this after all. However, nothing happened yet. So maybe they would be alright, atleast he hoped they would.* - Sat Sep 26 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Probably has some business in Kumogakure. - Sat Sep 26 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Details weren't provided as to why . . . We're just here to get the job done and escort him. - Sat Sep 26 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) continued his careful observation around the area. ''Hm?'' The boy blinked, noticing something in the distance. ''!'' His instincts kicked in, pulling the blade in his right hand forward with a vertical swing. Taiga's head pulled to the ground in an instant, his eyes taking note of a shuriken. A small trail of blood sliding from his cheek as well, he didn't reflect it properly. It seemed like there really was an enemy out here. And considering the mission, saying that it was one would be wrong. Harada would have to keep his cool and hold the formation no matter what happened. As such he made sure to tighten the grip around his tanto with his right hand, one hand reaching for a kunai and explosive tag.

The Genin's eyes marked the next weapon headed his way. ''So that one has marked me.'' He muttered, hitting the second shuriken out of the way. Of course his enemy was already reaching in closer to Taiga. ''!'' He loaded his tag with chakra and wrapped it around the kunai before throwing it forward, though he didn't throw hard enough for it to reach past the rogue. Rather he aimed for his feet and allowed it to explode before the kunai touched the ground. A medium sized explosion occupied his sight, with rubble rolling out of the smoke.

However the rogue was not defeated. The man jumped out of the smoke, with his palm infront. ''What the?!'' Harada's face was grasped and pushed backwards, the boy hitting the ground with the back of his head. ''Agh!'' He had to act quick, his hands forming a tiger handseal which he used to blow out flames quickly. Usually this would form into a technique, but for now he used it to burn the man's hand away from his face before he could stab him or whatever. This created some space between the two, which Taiga wanted to use.

His eyes analyzed his enemy, a rather small person. Yet his grip was tight and his speed was astonishing for his build. But he knew that now, so he would no longer be surprised. The young man pulled his right arm up, his tanto infront of him to protect himself. ''!'' However the enemy didn't come in for an attack. . Atleast not physical. The only thing he noticed were a few handseals. The sand around him combined with the rubbles as it floated around him. ''What's this?'' He wondered. The Genin remained calm, but soon he saw different things before his eyes. Everyone was dead?! The boy took a deep breath, he had to remain calm.

''Hold up Taiga, it's too soon for anyone to have died.'' He said to himself, but at the same time he noticed a beating pain in his gut. His head pulled forward as he spat out his breath. ''?!'' He looked up as he saw the enemy kick his knee and blast him backwards with a spin. ''Tch. . '' He thought, the man seemingly coming in for a second attack. However Harada wouldn't fall for this again, his tanto reaching up with a horizontal slash. Cutting the man down, however the slice wasn't deep enough. The boy slashed in the air once more to get the blood off, he didn't want his blade to get rusty. ''What did you do?!''

Taiga was no idiot, he knew when something didn't add up. But the rogue didn't answer, he simply got up and headed in for another attack. However Taiga managed to dodge, though that was just a feint for the real attack which was a knee in the gut. ''Wha-'' He was once more shot backwards, this guy had some physical strenght backing him up. His eyes wandered for a moment to the supposed corpses now. ''Wait a second. . '' The Genin clapped his hands together, releasing his chakra for just a second before recollecting it. ''Ah!'' Things were back to normal, however he didn't pay attention to the enemy and got kicked in the face. This was followed by a combination of attacks with a kunai, cutting his body up just a bit and causing his clothes to rip at certain parts.

''I've had it with your kicks damn it!'' He yelled out, he clenched his fists for a moment but followed by weaving a few seals. His oxygen mixed with the chakra inside his stomache which he aimed at the enemy. Blowing out a medium sized fireball at him, though he only managed to burn some of his clothes. However this was to expected, Taiga grabbed two kunais with explosive tags and threw them in the leftover fire, causing the explosions to combine and blast the rogue into Harada's direction. Of course the man's back was considerably damaged by the explosion and now he was also in the air unable to do anything.

Taiga had experience when it came to blades, and he proved that with a quick, precise slash through the enemy's stomache as he headed for him after taking the explosion. Blood splattered all over his blade and face. But he managed to get off this fight without any real danger. ''. . The blacksmith and the other's what about them?!'' He asked himself, his head now searching for the other's and their current conditions. The rogue was unconciouss at this point, and would die right there if he didn't get rescued by his comrades to get treatment. Either way the boy got off lucky.

But he wasn't so soft as to let that happen. Harada turned back to the enemy and stabbed his heart withhis tanto, after that he wiped his blade clean and sheathed it back on his back. His fists now clenched, he couldn't butt in on their fights without a plan. Plus this way he could protect the blacksmith if one of them managed to break through his comrades. The boy reached over to the client and stood infront of him holding two kunais, one in each hand. He was prepared to defend the client till the end.* - Sat Sep 26 20:49:42 2015

You should be glad nobody actually died on such a dangerous mission.'' Taiga tried to stay positive, though a small beat of sweat went down his face. However he smiled after he finished his sentence. The boy grabbed hold of the Aburame and pulled him on his back for now, that seemed like the easiest way to carry his comrade for now. ''Just rest for now Arnitanu, you did your best and survived. That's the most important thing.''* - Sat Sep 26 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) looked down to the ground, he tried to be positive. Or rather he had to, everyone else was in a bad situation right now. ''Shit, shit, shit. .  If I had ended it sooner and helped them then they wouldn't be this wounded.'' He thought to himself, his smile turning in a frown for a moment as his sweat dripped down his chin. But he quickly caught on to his own expression and returned to his smile as they walked on through Kumogakure, this mission may have been a mistake. But it was a success in the end, which meant their village would hopefully get some more attention now. Yet he felt a heavy sense of regret.

Taiga didn't respond to Arnitarnu, rather he didn't think he had the right to do so. They all felt bad and had regrets about this mission, maybe it would be better if all of them resolved their own regrets rather than help them. However the boy noticed Konohagakure in the distance, and a familiar sight managed to bring some sense of relief and joy to the boy. ''Alright, just a little more and we'll be back home. .  I'll head to Katsune and report the mission. I'll bring you to the hospital first though Arnitanu.'' He was the only one in a capable state anyway, reporting was something he had to do.* - Sat Sep 26 21:15:18 2015

''By the way, this here is a Kirigakure shinobi. He was nice enough to travel with us in our caraven and take care of Kilm.'' He turned his head over to Kang who was holding Kilm.* - Sat Sep 26 22:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Sep 26 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's. . . - Sat Sep 26 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then what will you do now? - Sat Sep 26 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not sure. . . - Sat Sep 26 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Still trying to let it sunk in that you're in Konohagakure? - Sat Sep 26 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well that, and I have my mind wrapped around progressing myself at one point. After seeing the wounds you and your friends took, it makes me think that I'm too weak to even travel back to my village alone. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well we did do a high classed mission so it was to be expected. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But yeah, it's dangerous out there. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Atleast that's what I like to think. - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course two can't right now. - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps you'd be up for a quick one? - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Would you like to go a round then? - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, sure. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why not. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Follow me. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Eh, different spot. - Sun Sep 27 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Follow me once more. - Sun Sep 27 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not much of a challenge. . . - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well then, come at me. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So don't look down on my but so much. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's alright, I'm not that amazing either. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, he didn't expect this technique at all. In fact he knew it himself, and he only knew a few techniques. However Tetsu was so much better at it than him that he felt a bit embarrased. ''I see, well then. I'll come in with my own Ninjutsu then.'' He thought, his hands clapping together. Taiga pulled his head backwards, his hands weaving into five different seals until it stopped at the tiger seal.

Harada placed two fingers next to his mouth, he never trained his techniques and that showed. A chaos of flames escaped his lips, rolling forward in a big ball aimed to burn Tetsu away. Though the shape was a bit wacky, he didn't have much experience with this jutsu.

The flames surrounding him didn't really bother him, he was used to the heat anyway. * - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his eyebrow, he didn't expect it to be over this fast. But apparently Tetsu really was speaking the truth. Either way Taiga smiled and walked through the leftover flames from their techniques, it didn't really faze him. He could step them out with ease. ''Hey, come on. Pull yourself from the ground, that was an incredible execution of Fire Run. I can barely even make a circle.''

He smiled at him as he stuck his hand out for Tetsu to hold on.* - Sun Sep 27 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) seemed to hold an expression of sympathy now, to be honest Taiga had never lost a fight. Even in his previous mission, he was the only one who won without any actual damage. ''I see, I understand. I'll leave you alone for now. I'll be at the mansion if you need me.'' Harada was not the type to get angry anyway.

The Genin headed off to the mansion, leaving the training field.* - Sun Sep 27 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 00:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why're ya'll standing here? - Sun Sep 27 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Im trying to get Master maloth to show me something cool and im wating for  the kage because I have Served and now it is time to collect. - Sun Sep 27 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Master Maloth? - Sun Sep 27 00:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: I call all my teachers that a sign of repsct. - Sun Sep 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Okay then. - Sun Sep 27 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Have fun. - Sun Sep 27 00:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Hello. - Sun Sep 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Is it okay if I take that seat next to you? - Sun Sep 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Err.... Sure. - Sun Sep 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) formed a kind smile on his face as he bowed his head for a moment. ''Thank you ma'm.'' He walked over to the seat next to the woman and set down, his wallet placed infront of him. ''I'd like one regular bowl of ramen please.''

The boy pulled out some money and paid for his food, now just waiting to be served. ''Oh right, my name is Taiga. Nice to meet you ma'm.''* - Sun Sep 27 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Ririi. - Sun Sep 27 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: I'm from Konoha originaly. But then I moved to Suna. - Sun Sep 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh, then why are you back here ma'm? - Sun Sep 27 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: I'm planning on starting a business here. - Sun Sep 27 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A business? What will it be? - Sun Sep 27 00:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Don't know. - Sun Sep 27 00:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But why did you pick Konohagakure for your business? - Sun Sep 27 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Rolled a dice. - Sun Sep 27 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well that's an interesting way to make such a life changing decision. - Sun Sep 27 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: I guess. - Sun Sep 27 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So how is it to be back in Konohagakure? - Sun Sep 27 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: Don't really know. - Sun Sep 27 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Still too soon huh? - Sun Sep 27 01:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ririi(Kizuzan12) says: So I guess so. - Sun Sep 27 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see, are there certain people you hope to see now that you're back? - Sun Sep 27 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) held on to a big bowl of ramen, slurping the noodles right out of it at a quick pace. ''Hm?'' He turned his seat around, blinking at the sight of Tetsu who was about to leave apparently. Taiga quickly finished whatever he had on his chopsticks and spoke.

''Oh Tetsu, you don't have to leave. You can join if you want, the ramen here is amazing!'' His mouth quickly formed into a smile. ''Right Ririi?''* - Sun Sep 27 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his head over to Ririi, his dim purple eyes blinking a few times. ''Haha, oh I see. Well then just take my word for it Tetsu, I swear it tastes amazing.'' He grinned this time, grabbing more noodles from his bowl as he stuffed his mouth with it.

''By the way Ririi, how old are you if I may ask?''* - Sun Sep 27 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised one of his eyebrows, slurping the noodles until he finished it all. Now he just had the soup left. ''Well, if you say so.'' He got the feeling that Tetsu either misunderstood the situation or still felt bad about what had happened before this. Either way something was off, but he wasn't going to dig into it. ''See you later then Tetsu.'' He smiled once more before his chair rotated back to it's original position.

But apparently Tetsu wasn't the only person leaving the shop. ''Eh?'' Taiga blinked, noticing in an incoming fist headed for his face. ''!'' He quickly moved his face to the side but still received some damage, even falling off his chair. That delicious soup of his fell on his clothes, and thus had wasted some of his money. ''. . Well that happened.'' He said in a less excited and rather monotone voice.

''I'll have to remember that, women care about age.'' He meant no harm by it, but his cluelessness had caused this. However the boy didn't stop Ririi from leaving the shop.* - Sun Sep 27 01:20:12 2015
