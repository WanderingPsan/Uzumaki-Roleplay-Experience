<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Did I tease him too hard with that? - Sun Sep 27 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) walked over to the woman, his hand reaching out to grab the cards. ''Thank you ma'm.'' He'd then walk over to Kilm to put his card in one of his pockets. ''There you go.''* - Sun Sep 27 10:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned because of the sudden appearance. ''Hm?'' Taiga didn't even listen to Erebus's short command, rather the boy in question was what caught his attention.

''Zetsumo's kid?''

He didn't notice that he said that out loud, but he felt the same way he did when he was in Kirigakure. Though he noticed something about his eyes, a new ring. .  That wasn't there the last time. ''Suitengu, you have some interesting chakra huh?'' He said with a smile.* - Sun Sep 27 10:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Though the same as mine. - Sun Sep 27 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I wonder why he has two rings though, maybe I should get to know him a little better and find out. - Sun Sep 27 11:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Maybe it's a sickness, who knows. - Sun Sep 27 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Could be. - Sun Sep 27 11:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his left eyebrow with a puzzled face for a moment. ''Others?'' He mumbled, only now finding out that there were more of them. ''I haven't, you're the first. Which would mean that there're none in Konohagakure besides the two of us now.''

He placed his hand on his chin for a moment, thinking. ''Ah! But there's a difference between our eyes now right? I mean, you have two rings.''* - Sun Sep 27 11:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why? From all I know they just show chakra and those weird points in everyone's chakra sytem. - Sun Sep 27 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah, right. It's Taiga, I should've introduced myself a long time ago. - Sun Sep 27 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Well, Taiga. He believes there is more to our eyes than just that. Tell me, when you look at me. What feeling do you get from it? - Sun Sep 27 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's hard to put my finger on it really. I mean, your chakra is different from the rest. - Sun Sep 27 11:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I really don't know how to describe it. - Sun Sep 27 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Do you feel a sense of.. anger from it at all? - Sun Sep 27 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anger. . ? No, I wouldn't call it that. - Sun Sep 27 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Instinct maybe? My attention continues to go to your eyes. - Sun Sep 27 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: So my feelings around others with these eyes are different from others.. I see.. - Sun Sep 27 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see then.. - Sun Sep 27 11:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So.. Its either Time, or a completely different one of Thought. Maybe. - Sun Sep 27 11:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I don't know what happened to him. - Sun Sep 27 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So one of them is gone. - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Which of the three T's caused your eyes to change? - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .. Trauma. - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah! I-I'm sorry to hear that. - Sun Sep 27 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Four of us now, who knows how many there might be out there. - Sun Sep 27 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You said my eyes.. have two rings now? - Sun Sep 27 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his right index finger, pointing at his own eyes for a moment. ''Look, if you pay attention then you can see one ring. However. .'' His finger turned around, pointing at Suitengu this time as he spoke once more. ''You have two rings, try looking in a mirror.''

Taiga figured out something new now as well, these eyes could change further. Though he didn't know if that was good or bad. It worried him to say the least.* - Sun Sep 27 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I recall your eyes being the same as mine in Kirigakure, but surely you have gained a ring. - Sun Sep 27 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) only had one question left at this point, and he asked it without in an instant without thinking. ''Suitengu, did anything happen between the time that we last met in Kirigakure? Is there anything that triggered your eyes to gain that extra ring? Or did it just happen out of nowhere?''* - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Could you tell me? - Sun Sep 27 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I could. - Sun Sep 27 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What do you think about Erebus as the Kage of this village - Sun Sep 27 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Please do. - Sun Sep 27 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm. - Sun Sep 27 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Erebus, he's a scary person. But as for his actual goals and interests. .  I wouldn't know what to think of them. - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean, he's immortal. - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Immortal?.. - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: On the other hand there's Katsune. She just became the Hokage, however she does care for this village and wants it to recover. - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Sun Sep 27 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I was born and raised in Konohagakure, so I understand Katsune's desire. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I was born here as well. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Are you from any particular clan? - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm not. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I come from a normal family. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mm. - Sun Sep 27 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh as for Erebus. - Sun Sep 27 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: The reason why I called him immortal is simple. - Sun Sep 27 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: The man used his own weapon, to stab his chest wide open. But he survived without a problem. He walked, spoke, smiled the entire time. - Sun Sep 27 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But that doesn't matter right now. If you'd please tell me what happened between the time we met in Kirigakure and now. - Sun Sep 27 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I ate copious amounts of honey buns. - Sun Sep 27 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Honey buns? - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That's weird. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I was hungry. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It is weird. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It doesn't make much sense does it. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I'm surprised he didn't get fat from that. - Sun Sep 27 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well the entire situation is weird. - Sun Sep 27 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 27 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Though there's nothing else to discuss now, as there's little we know about. - Sun Sep 27 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I guess that is it then. - Sun Sep 27 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Once more I'd like to say that I hope we can get along. - Sun Sep 27 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And I'll tell you when I learn new things. - Sun Sep 27 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That would be nice. - Sun Sep 27 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well then, I'll head back outside. - Sun Sep 27 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) bowed to show his respect and gratitude, he didn't learn much but even a little information was nice. ''I hope you'll enjoy your stay in Konohagakure.'' He pulled his head back up with a smile and left the building.* - Sun Sep 27 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So how'd it go . . . Taiga? - Sun Sep 27 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Edge. .  I wonder what kind of person that man is. - Sun Sep 27 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Kilm, want to go a restaurant now? - Sun Sep 27 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Sure. - Sun Sep 27 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Smile...? - Sun Sep 27 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Mhm.. - Sun Sep 27 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, entering the restaurant. ''I'll tell you what Suitgenu and I spoke about during our dinner.'' He said, without a doubt aimed at Kilm. But then his attention went over to Erebus and Yumiko. ''So there're others here, oh well. Doesn't matter.'' His eyes shifted to Asteroth this time, wondering if this was the new restaurant. 

''Right. .  Well, let's try the food Kilm.'' He said, trying not to listen in on Erebus's supposed 'interview' or whatever it was. Seemed more like a date to Taiga.

''We'd like a table for two please.'' He'd say a bit louder this time for everyone to hear.* - Sun Sep 27 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: I'm but a typical villager..Will you show me a smile?..My leader? - Sun Sep 27 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Leader? But Katsune's the Hokage. . . - Sun Sep 27 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..A smile.. - Sun Sep 27 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's.. the best you're getting. - Sun Sep 27 12:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: . .  This creeps me out. - Sun Sep 27 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Nothing to say on that . . . - Sun Sep 27 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So, uhh.. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: *cough*.. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yeah, don't Erebus. - Sun Sep 27 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi, listen. - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: This is a business meeting. - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Does he even believe that himself? - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What a nice business meeting. - Sun Sep 27 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm gonna have to buy a milkshake with a straw. - Sun Sep 27 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's the only way to drink something right now. - Sun Sep 27 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Such a good man.~ - Sun Sep 27 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Cheers? - Sun Sep 27 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Sun Sep 27 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: . . . Did she just. - Sun Sep 27 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) couldn't help but laugh at how whipped Erebus was.* - Sun Sep 27 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Erebus of all people, unbelievable. - Sun Sep 27 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I bet there are times when Erebus wants to kill himself . . . Tries to do so and fails cause of his immortality. - Sun Sep 27 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) thinks: I'm sure he means well. - Sun Sep 27 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: These people. . To do this. .-- Despicable.. - Sun Sep 27 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Oh shit. - Sun Sep 27 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) thinks: Compassionate I see. - Sun Sep 27 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) thinks: In his own way.. - Sun Sep 27 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Table for two, Please. - Sun Sep 27 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This nigga gay as fuck, begged to go out on a date with me . . . Trying to shut him up so he could give me his rinnegan later. - Sun Sep 27 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: -omit- - Sun Sep 27 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If you want rinne go ask Suitengu. - Sun Sep 27 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Milkshake with straw. - Sun Sep 27 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) decided that it was time to shift his attention elsewhere, that being the actual restaurant. ''Ah yes, a table for two like my friend said.'' He rubbed the back of his head, wondering if Erebus was about to leave or cause a fight. Either way he had to watch out for that man.

Atleast they stopped being so intimate out in the open. Of course he followed the maiden to the seat, now sitting on the other side of Kilm.
''Hm, I'd like something sweet. .  How about dumplings and a glass of water.'' He was clearly under the legal drinking age and so he didn't even bother asking for alcohol.

This time he turned his attention to Kilm, almost whispering so nobody could hear but them. ''Alright, so Suitengu told me a few things and we figured somethings out by combining what we know.''* - Sun Sep 27 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Sun Sep 27 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What'd he tell you? - Sun Sep 27 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alright, so there've been four people including me with these eyes now. However Suitengu's have developed in one way or another. - Sun Sep 27 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Huh . . . Do you atleast know what the eyes are called? - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: One of them is called Ikarus, but he's gone. Then there's a man called Edge who wants to bring us all together and do research. - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't. - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Suitengu was confused about the situation just as myself. - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sounds like those eyes are trouble then. - Sun Sep 27 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, as I explained before they're useful in some way. But this Edge person thinks that there's more to it than that. - Sun Sep 27 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: We don't even know if there're others aside from us four. . . - Sun Sep 27 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't know this edge person . . . Wouldn't trust him. - Sun Sep 27 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right. It also seems like everyone feels some sort of attraction to each other. For example I have no ill intent but I can't keep my gaze away from their eyes. - Sun Sep 27 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Suitengu on the other hand probably feels anger, atleast that was the example he gave me. - Sun Sep 27 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: -- If you need me, I will be behind the counter. I also mix drinks. - Sun Sep 27 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his attention over to the waitress for a moment. Giving a kind smile like usual. ''Thank you ma'm.'' His eyes shifted to the food for now, taking his first few bites. ''Oh! This tastes awesome!'' He said a bit too loud.

This new restaurant was going to get a regular client now, he loved sweet food and these dumplings were amazing. ''. .  Anyway.'' He took another dumpling and continued the conversation. ''We know that these eyes are not like the red and white eyes because we're not related by blood.''

Taiga was still trying to figure things out, because there was still so much he didn't know. ''There might be different triggers for these eyes. Time, Trauma, Torture, Thought. .  Everyone had a different trigger.''* - Sun Sep 27 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 13:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Interesting. - Sun Sep 27 13:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What was your trigger? - Sun Sep 27 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Thought, though we're not sure if it really is that. I have no bad memories. So it couldn't be one of the other three. Suitengu named it Thought to fit the other T's. - Sun Sep 27 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He said his eyes developed because he ate hunny buns, alot of them. Though I'm sure that was a lie to cover something. - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I believe . . . - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: His trigger was Trauma. - Sun Sep 27 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He told me it was himself so you're not incorrect. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I didn't intrude further though. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Know why? - Sun Sep 27 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm sure it has to do with Kenryoku, but it's not my business. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: His parents died . . . That's why I believe it was Trauma. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That, makes sense. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm worried about that Ikarus guy, first he gets these eyes and then he vanishes? It doesn't feel right. - Sun Sep 27 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Why' didn't he just give his report through the letter? - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey Katsune. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good morning. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) didn't have anything else to tell Kilm at this point. That was all he knew, little indeed. ''I'm not sure what to do about this to be honest. If I learn something then sure, good for me. But I'm not going out to just ask people, who knows what could happen. . .''

Taiga allowed a long sigh to escape him. ''On the other hand this food is amazing.'' The boy continued to eat his dumplings with a smile on his face, though that was probably just an act to hide his troubles.* - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright . . . The report. - Sun Sep 27 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Shall I tell it here? - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should've told me in the letter. - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It would've taken too much time to write everything with these hurt arms. - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it happened at the gates it's probably public knowledge. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . It is. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not on your way to getting that vest back Kilm. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Flexus had invited a group of sunagakure shinobi to stay over for a night in Konohagakure. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) returned his attention back to the food, quickly stuffing his face with it. ''Almost turned cold.'' He thought. He really wasn't paying much attention to the food at first.

The boy got up from his seat after finishing the dumplings. ''Ah, right. We're splitting the bill. Right?'' He asked Kilm, his right hand holding on to his wallet.* - Sun Sep 27 14:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, it is filled with weird symbols. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So that's understandable. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Once I'll learn it though. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll combine it with my elements. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll try to seal them away. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, Kilm was a rather impressive person to say the least. '' . . You sure have things planned out.'' Taiga rubbed the back of his head and sat down, thinking about what he could do himself. ''I should get better at Genjutsu: Kai for now. I don't want to get stuck in illusions.'' He thought, his hands clapped together in the form of the ram handseal. His chakra released from his body for only just a moment, and after that he fixed it once again. Of course it wasn't that hard to do without an actual Genjutsu on his mind but he could still train this way. ''Hm. . Hold on. I just thought of something.''* - Sun Sep 27 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) scratched the side of his face for a moment, having realised something. ''Kilm, your chakra flow becomes fuzzy if you get caught in a Genjutsu does it not?'' The boy continued to train during his explanation of course, he didn't forget about it just because he realised something useful. ''If so, then shouldn't my eyes be able to detect illusions. I can see chakra and the chakra system, so if I get caught wouldn't I realise it?'' Taiga seemed to put some thought into this for a moment, wondering if what he thought of was actually right. If so then he was one lucky shinobi. 

The Genin wiped some sweat from his forehead, rubbing through his hair for a moment. He knew that he was never good at studying or practicing techniques so this was only maybe a hundreth of the entire training session. ''If I can detect and master Kai. . . Then Genjutsu would become a lot less threatening would it not?'' The boy asked, his chakra breaking and reforming once more when he formed the ram handseal to practice the technique. Luckily he had an above average chakra reserve, otherwise he'd have to wait a long time between each use.* - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) took a deep breath, his hands clapping together quickly to restore his chakra for a moment. ''Okay, not once again.'' He mumbled to himself, his eyes staring down at the ram seal he had just made. It wasn't hard to perform the technique itself of course. But he wanted to be careful not to waste his chakra by making a mistake. The Genin's chakra dissapeared for a moment and came back a little while later, he looked around him. Hoping to find something that would be more exciting, but there was nothing. He really had to keep this boring training up. ''Ugh, so boring.''

Taiga imagined an actual Genjutsu being cast upon him, maybe that would make it a bit more exciting. Though probably not. ''This feels like a chore.'' The boy complained, his chakra breaking and reforming yet again. Sweat went down his forehead and dripped on the ground every few seconds as is escaped the tip of his chin. Practicing it through a spar would've been much more exciting and useful to be honest. But hey, there was nobody to spar with right now.* - Sun Sep 27 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is it working out for you? - Sun Sep 27 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, how to say this. - Sun Sep 27 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's boring to practice like this. - Sun Sep 27 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can't really help. - Sun Sep 27 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Haha, sure. - Sun Sep 27 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head for a moment. Wondering what to do for now. ''Well, I'll just continue on with my training for now.'' He said cheerfuly, his hands clapped together to form the ram handseal for the fifth time now. He took a deep breath, relaxing his body and making his chakra escape his body slowly. After that it came back and would've normaly broken him out of any Genjutsu that he was smart enough to detect. The boy got up for a moment and stretched his legs and arms, he didn't want his limbs to fall asleep from him sitting down the entire time.

''And again.'' Taiga said, his eyes checking out his body this time. Or rather his chakra system, he kept watch with all his attention. His chakra broke, and he could see that in his arms. ''Alright, so it is working after all.'' Harada stopped doing whatever he was doing with his chakra and saw the stream return to normal in his body. ''These eyes really are useful if anything else.'' He said, his head turning to Kilm with somewhat of a brattish smirk. ''Eh? You jealous of these amazing eyes? Eh? Eh?''* - Sun Sep 27 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They're strange though. - Sun Sep 27 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm going to go . . . - Sun Sep 27 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later. - Sun Sep 27 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles for a moment, waving goodbye to Kilm as he left Taiga behind in the training field to practice on his own. ''Ah, I see. So now I'm left alone huh?'' The boy rubbed the back of his head for a moment, still checking out the chakra system in his body as he made it break and restore a few more times. To be honest it was rather tiring to do it this many times, but practice was key after all. ''I'll have to keep practicing this no matter what. Until I get better at it, I don't want to get stuck in a Genjutsu after all.'' He said, his fists clenched for now.

''Genjutsu: Kai!'' The boy clapped his hands together, forming the ram handseal and destroying the current chain of chakra in his body. Everything was visible to his eyes, the way it broke off at the tenketsu points and the way they restored themselves to function once more. ''. . Hm.'' Taiga clenched his fists for a moment, and decided that he was still far from done with his training. He sighned after that and sat down, grabbing something to eat. Keeping his stomache filled was an important part of training as well after all.

Harada finished his small lunch, cleaning up his box and placing it back in his backpouch. There was no time for idling around, he had to return to his Ninjutsu practice. ''Alright, let's keep this up for now. I'm going atn okay pace right?'' He said to himself, his hands already forming the ram seal. He was atleast getting better at the breaking of his chakra. Though that didn't mean it was that good either, if anything it still felt like a terrible execution.

Taiga stretched his arms once again, rubbing the side of his cheek for a moment with a small sweat drop sliding down his face ''Hm, it doesn't feel like I'm actually improving to be honest. Oh well.'' Practice took time and patience after all, and he knew that. Genjutsu Kai was a simple technique, but even simple techniques needed time and dedication to master. And he was nowhere near that. As was seen by his own eyes when he tried it yet again. ''Bah! This is so annoying!''* - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm back - Sun Sep 27 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Nothing else to do? - Sun Sep 27 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not really. - Sun Sep 27 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Haha. - Sun Sep 27 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Being unable to do a mission must suck for you huh? - Sun Sep 27 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 27 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Are Katsune and Erebus still talking? - Sun Sep 27 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No - Sun Sep 27 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 15:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I hope they resolved things. - Sun Sep 27 15:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned slowly, he was rather tired from all that training. But he wasn't done yet either. He still had to practice his technique for a little while longer to get this done. ''Ugh, so boring." The Genin sighned after his complaint. He really didn't enjoy training his jutsus. But that was the only way to improve after all. He focussed on his chakra with care, making sure to break it neatly. And then restore it without doing a thing. It wasn't a hard process, but that didn't mean things went fast.

Taiga rubbed the sweat from his forehead away, he didnt seem to stop sweating to be honest. If anything he'd need a towel after this and his stomache growled. ''Calm down there tummy.'' He said, rubbing his stomache. His eyes looked down on his stomache as well, taking notice of the chakra coursing through his body. Taiga pressed his hands together to weave a single handseal, which he then used to break the flow inside his body. ''And now, to let it restore.''

Harada's chakra restored to what it was before, making things go back to normal now. ''Alright, I should stop after a few more tries.'' The Genin pressed his hands together and formed the handseal like usual. Time after time again did the chakra break and restore itself. Even though he was starting to get tired, his chakra reserves weren't gigantic after all so using a technique many times over made him fall on his back panting. ''Still not done yet. . .'' He mumbled, feeling like he just took a huge loss.

The boy rolled over to his stomache, an annoyed and bored expression on his face. He just closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The chakra inside his body dissipating for a moment. And then it came back, coursing through his chakra system and tenketsu points. ''I'm done, I don't even care anymore. This is just way too boring.'' He said, complaining even more about practicing. ''I'm going back to the mansion, maybe there'll be a mission available.'' He wanted to do something interesting now.* - Sun Sep 27 15:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head, his figure just reaching out of the mansion. ''Hm, what to do?'' He mumbled, his eyes then noticing three figures in th courtyard. ''Oh, Hideki and Hanabi right?'' He said with a smile, one eye hidden behind his hair while the other held a dim purple color with a single ring.

''Why're you two here?''* - Sun Sep 27 18:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How did you get them? - Sun Sep 27 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Not sure honestly, atleast not for the same reasons as the other three. - Sun Sep 27 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Other three? - Sun Sep 27 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Ikarus, Suitengu, and now Taiga.. - Sun Sep 27 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Who else? - Sun Sep 27 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I got mine simply by thinking about what had happened in Amegakure and Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 27 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who are the other three? - Sun Sep 27 18:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So he really does feel anger when he looks at these eyes. - Sun Sep 27 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's different for me, I do look at the eyes constantly. It's an instinct I believe. - Sun Sep 27 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I don't get angry. - Sun Sep 27 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It might depend on the person. - Sun Sep 27 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Instinct. - Sun Sep 27 18:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Not that I know of, maybe Suitengu knows more about that then me. After all he has a second ring, so he might know more about that kinda stuff. - Sun Sep 27 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: That's all I needed. - Sun Sep 27 18:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yes? - Sun Sep 27 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: ? - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah, not that I know of. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: She's not behind her desk. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And she's not in the room to the right either. - Sun Sep 27 18:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sometimes she goes to train, but I don't know where. - Sun Sep 27 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So she might be training right now. - Sun Sep 27 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Suitengu really has a scary stare huh? - Sun Sep 27 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: To me it seems that you two have the same stare. - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Although he has had a rough past. - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: From what I was told his mother was killed. - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Though I always thought I had a rather kind stare. - Sun Sep 27 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Maybe that changed due to these eyes. - Sun Sep 27 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Probably because of your upbringing. - Sun Sep 27 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That's likely the truth. - Sun Sep 27 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Sun Sep 27 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Slippery. - Sun Sep 27 18:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Where is Maloth? - Sun Sep 27 18:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah Maloth. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So Erebus fucked Yumiko? - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, maybe he's inside. Not sure. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Nice~ - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, not saying the fucked. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But when I walked in. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yumiko was sitting on his lap, embracing him. - Sun Sep 27 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I swear the staff was aggitated before we came in. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: They must've done something there before I saw them. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well I am going to check to see if Maloth is inside. - Sun Sep 27 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: There was someone south of here though. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: That could be him. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: South and take a left. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll go check then. - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Would you like a spar though, Taiga? - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A spar? - Sun Sep 27 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, I'm not sure if I would be a challenge. But sure, why not. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cool, follow me. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You may make the first move. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh, alright. - Sun Sep 27 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) took a deep breath, he didn't know what Hideki was good at to be honest. But then again all Taiga really had was his taijutsu and tanto. ''My Ninjutsu really isn't that amazing. . '' He thought, but he wanted to try it anyway. Taiga clapped his hands together, weaving five different handseals. The last one being the tiger seal, most people with the fire element would know what the teenager was about to do.

''!'' Flames escaped Harada's lips, leaving a trail infront of him that rolled into a medium sized ball aimed right for Hideki. Taiga lacked control and experience with this technique so it didn't look like a real threat to say the least.* - Sun Sep 27 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, not understanding why Hideki pulled out such a huge weapon. ''Didn't he make handseals just now? So why the weapon?'' He thought, but the first thing on his mind was dodging that massive weapon.

Harada leapt to the left, thus following Hideki's movements, But he also moved forward, trying to close the distance in one go. His right hand pulling on the tanto that he held on his back. The Genin rushed in with a thrust attempting to make a thin slice across Hideki's cheek and then stopping it next to his neck to make a quick end out of it.* - Sun Sep 27 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned, wondering why Hideki didn't say anything. But either way, the spar was over from Taiga's perspective. The teenager sheathed his tanto and smiled once more.

''Hehe, thanks for giving me the first move. I probably wouldn't have managed to get a win without it.''* - Sun Sep 27 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah, no problem. - Sun Sep 27 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Omit - Sun Sep 27 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) doesn't have a 15+ tai difference with Suitengu so a jab wouldn't get that deep. GG, try again.* - Sun Sep 27 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: -Omit- - Sun Sep 27 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What is it? - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just thinking, that's all. - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why did you throw that shuriken anyway? I thought you were going to use ninjutsu. - Sun Sep 27 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just to test something. - Sun Sep 27 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: By the way, has either of you seen Ushinawa lately? - Sun Sep 27 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: No. - Sun Sep 27 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What about you Hideki? - Sun Sep 27 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*Snatches this little niggas eyes*> - Sun Sep 27 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nah, haven't seen him. - Sun Sep 27 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: <*Unlocks Rinneshar*> - Sun Sep 27 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Damn, I wonder where he could be. - Sun Sep 27 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) just blinks, his head slightly tilted backwards. ''. . .Why?''* - Sun Sep 27 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Because. - Sun Sep 27 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That's your answer? - Sun Sep 27 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alright then. - Sun Sep 27 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Rude but okay. - Sun Sep 27 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, it was fun and all. But I'm going back to standing bored at the mansion. - Sun Sep 27 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) just leaves.* - Sun Sep 27 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: .......... - Sun Sep 27 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: --- - Sun Sep 27 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I feel a disturbance in the force - Sun Sep 27 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) thinks: What's going on here? - Sun Sep 27 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I like turtles.. - Sun Sep 27 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head for a moment. ''Hm, I should train some more. But what?'' The boy held his chin for a moment and thought. His mind went to Ninjutsu and how his fire techniques weren't doing well. ''I could practice the techniques but maybe I should get better at controling fire as a whole first.'' He said to himself, his mind drifting over to the leafs. ''Maybe I should try burning a leaf.'' The boy walked over to one of the trees and grabbed a dozen or so, something easy to start off with. However it would probably take a long time for him to actually get this to work.

''Alright, let's try it.'' Taiga held the first leaf in his hand, just between his index finger and thumb. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his chakra coursing through his body and reaching all the way up to his tips. He had a normal image of a flame in his head, but nothing actually happened. The boy opened his eyes and noticed that the leaf was still there and that nothing came from his chakra and fingertips. ''I see, it's not that easy is it?'' He rubbed the back of his head for a moment, wondering what he could do better.

Harada tried the same thing another time, yet nothing happened. Maybe he just wasn't good enough at this, which would mean he'd have to learn to control the chakra well first. Or get a better image, whichever it was he had no idea. He strained his brain too much thinking over it, maybe that was the problem? No, likely not the case. The boy sighned and just closed his eyes again, channeling his chakra into his finger tips. He hoped to get atleast some form of heat out of it, but even that failed.

''Tch.'' The Genin didn't get angry, but he was slightly frustrated. It was like the leaf just slapped him in the face and followed with a roundhouse kick. Was he really that terrible at using fire techniques? If so, why did he never train to get better at it until now? His lazyness was showing now and he didn't like that. Taiga took a deep breath and placed the leaf down, for now he'd try to imagine a big, hot flame in his mind. That was the first step without a doubt, and he wanted to get that part right.

The flame burned intensily in the back of his head, but that didn't mean anything was actually happening outside of it. He could feel his chakra course through his body, stopping at his finger tips. And he even saw it happen the moment he opened his eyes. ''Maybe now?'' He mumbled, grabbing the leaf. But his chakra didn't pour out of his fingertips at all. ''Well, maybe I should try again another time. There's no need to do everything in one day, taking my time should be okay too.''* - Sun Sep 27 19:55:31 2015
