<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) simply waved to the three people with a smile. After that he returned to his previous spot behind the tree to read whatever weird magazine he had in his hands.* - Wed Sep 16 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) flipped the pages through his magazine, something not safe for work most likely. The male brought his head up, looking around the area. ''There was somebody here? That's rare.'' He closed his magazine and turned his attention over to the woman near the corpse.

''Hi there, what brings you to this empty place?''* - Thu Sep 17 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) placed the magazine in his back pocket for now, his eyes sliding over to the dead body. He crossed his arms and nodded at her statement, this wasn't the best place to visit right now. ''Well, you've got a point there. This village really doesn't have anything to show aside from that corpse.''

''So where're you from ma'm?'' He didn't seem all that interested, but this was the first human he interacted with for days.* - Thu Sep 17 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) brought up his shoulders and shook his head. ''It's not my business to clean up that body, or rather. I just don't feel like doing it.'' He raised his left index finger, pointing towards it.

''But if you want to, then you can clean it. But you wouldn't want to get covered in all that blood right?''* - Thu Sep 17 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) frowned, thatwas a good question. ''Hmm, nothing really. With the current state it is in atleast, I mean you could get some food from a restaurant. Or you could walk through the streets and hope you find something interesting. But aside from that, nothing really.'' He rubbed his chin, trying to think of something anyway, but there was nothing.

''Sorry, I'm drawing a blank here. This village really is empty.''* - Thu Sep 17 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) blinked with surprise.

This was embarrasing, that was exactly his life. ''Oh, eh. .  Well, I just lounge around actually. I don't wonder why it's boring, but you pretty much hit the nail with that.''

''You're really cautious of that body aren't you?''* - Thu Sep 17 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hm, maybe you should try a different village. - Thu Sep 17 17:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I don't understand why you would slaughter innocent civillians though. - Thu Sep 17 19:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Atleast leave them out of this, not everyone is a shinobi. - Thu Sep 17 19:18:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: They shouldn't have to be brought into a shinobi's battle. - Thu Sep 17 19:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: . .  What? - Thu Sep 17 19:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) says: You consider the lifes of the people you're 'supposed' to take care of. .  Tools? - Thu Sep 17 19:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then do so. - Thu Sep 17 19:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles, he didn't have a choice. Somebody came in and decided to have a happy time killing innocent civillians. ''Ah, screw me.'' He thought, he never had a real fight, and he never trained either. This was only going to end badly for him.

Haru analyzed the distance between him and his enemy, too wide for him to close. Which meant he'd have to rely on Ninjutsu. The hobo leapt forward, weaving a short sequence of handseals infront of his mouth. This technique would do well with the current mansion on fire.

''Katon: Misty Flames Dance Jutsu!''

Gas escaped the man's mouth, filling the area between him and Ushinawa. This effectively caused a smokescreen. But that same smokescreen turned into an explosion of flames the moment some fire from the mansion reached it. ''Did that get him?! Where is he?'' He thought, his right hand unsheathing his tanto. He was nervous, and he had no battle experience, so not being able to see his opponent was the worst case scenario.* - Thu Sep 17 19:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) didn't know what was coming to him, the blast from the explosive tag combined with his technique resulted in him taking the full blow. And he wasn't the most durable out of the bunch, so he fell on his back covered in wounds. But there was no time for him to say anything, he picked his weapon up from the ground and waited for the flames to thin out. ''So that's where he is.'' He thought. He wiped the blood that almost got caught in his eye away.

Haru went forward once more, the gas wouldn't work and another jutsu of his wouldn't reach far enough. ''Well, then that leaves this technique. .  Although everyone knows it.'' He mumbled to himself as he formed the oh so famous sequence of seals to prepare his strongest technique.

Flames blasted forward, rolling up into a giant ball aimed at Ushinawa, there was no need to yell out the name of this technique since everyone knew it. And he was too concentrated on the battle now to even speak anyway.* - Thu Sep 17 19:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) turned his head from side to side restlessly, where was he? Did he get hit? Probably not, otherwise he'd have heard screams. Haru noticed something behind him, the sounds of something he had never really heard before. ''?!'' His body shot forward, crashing into the ground while his body got electrocuted. His body felt numb with pain, blood seeping out of his many wounds. But if he stayed there like that he'd eventualy get caught up in the mansion's fire and die. 

''S-Shit!'' He wasn't fighting for himself either, he had the lives of others on his shoulder right now. The Genin pulled his sorry ass off from the ground, even if he was bleeding and trembling. Even with one eye shut and a gasping mouth. He just had to grit his teeth and hold on to his tanto.

''That didn't even hurt you bastard! Come and get me!'' He yelled, taking a few steps into Ushinawa's direction with his tanto pointed forward.* - Thu Sep 17 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) thinks: Well, atleast I'm not alone now. .  Right? - Thu Sep 17 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: \ - Thu Sep 17 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head, holding a dirty magazine in one of his hands. He didn't pay any attention to the man approaching him at first. ''Hm?''

Haru raised one eyebrow, what a weird and random question to be asked out of nowhere. ''Oh, well sir I believe in the Will of Fire.'' The weak looking male returned his attention to his magazine, reading it with a stupid smirk on his face. Not to mention the drool dripping from the corner of his left mouth.

''Yeah, you show that behind girl.''* - Fri Sep 18 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tatagami, Haru(Dopespruit) || ''Yeah, that's a good body~, you go girl.'' The young man was not paying attention to those crazy words. Which lead to his own death, the sword came swinging at his neck. Ending his life in an instant.

His head dropped to the floor a few yards further down the path as his body fell down. His blood sprayed everywhere, his magazine covered in it and becoming unreadable. What a waste of money and paper.

There were no images flashing before his eyes as he died, since he didn't have anything memorable to memorize. He just lead his life like a hobo after all.* - Fri Sep 18 21:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) || A young man covered many miles by himself, with nothing but some food and a single blade. He left his home to find out more about the world and the people that inhabited it. ''I wonder what kind of people I'll meet, and not to mention the other villages. .  What'll they look like?'' The boy came across a merchant or two, spending his money on water and food for the next days to come. He never saw these parts of his country either, the red leafs falling from the trees caught his attention for a moment. He just stared in silence for a few minutes.

''I should be reaching the border soon.'' He said to himself, trying to remember the map he forgot at home. But he was following a wide road, and there was the occasional person passing by whom he could ask for directions. This helped him alot, he'd be lost by now without those people telling him to just walk on straight ahead. Taiga reached the half-way point of his journey, and maybe it was time to take a short break as well.* - Sat Sep 19 13:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned, he expected this to take a while but still this was tiring. ''I want to take another break, but I also want to reach my destination. It'd be dangerous to sit here in the wild and rest. I'd better make a rush for it.'' Harada picked up the pace, now rushing through the forests. His feet stepping in multiple puddles, splashing the water to the sides. The heavy rain made it practically impossible for him to hear anything, and the mist made it hard to see. He was used to clear, sunny weather after all. ''People live in a country like this? How?!'' He muttered.

Taiga noticed something in the distance, water. And not a little pond, but something that looked like the start of the sea. ''Eh. . ?'' He managed to reach it a few minutes later, his clothes already drenched due to the rain. The boy decided to follow the sea from the coast down south. ''A traveling merchant did tell me I'd have to go south a bit if I want to reach Kirigakure. . .'' He thought, and he didn't even know that he was about to arrive already.* - Sat Sep 19 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: ? - Sat Sep 19 14:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) carefully walked forward, reaching what seemed to be the village gates of whatever this village was called.  A Konohagakure headband hanged from his neck. His eyes spotted an individual standing on the road.

''Hello, if I may ask. What is this village called?'' He hoped that he'd hear the word 'Kirigakure', but he had never been there. So he was rather clueless of his current destination.* - Sat Sep 19 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) quickly moved his right hand and index finger up, with his mouth wide open and his eyebrows frowning just a bit. He wanted to say something, but the person infront of him made a point. .  And he completely forgot about that specific point.

''That. .  I completely forgot about that, thank you for reminding me. Am I atleast allowed to stay here? Outside of the village walls. I haven't had any form of interaction for a long time, so even being able to talk to other travelers is enough to satisfy me.''

The boy didn't sound threatening, rather he had a bit of a ditzy aura around him.* - Sat Sep 19 14:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'd rather you not. - Sat Sep 19 14:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Go talk to your Amegakure buddies. - Sat Sep 19 14:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I, uhm . . - Sat Sep 19 14:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Just run. - Sat Sep 19 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: If you don't, you die right here. . . - Sat Sep 19 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Solid points, both of you. But first of all, I have never met anyone from Amegakure. I don't even know where it is. P-Plus, just because my people have done such terrible things doesn't mean I have. . . Right? - Sat Sep 19 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Three. . .  - Sat Sep 19 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Two. . . - Sat Sep 19 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stepped backwards, wiping the sweat from his face the moment Ikaro started to count down. ''A-Alright, I'll leave. Have a nice day, it's a shame that it had to turn out this way.'' He turned around and walked away from Kirigakure at his own pace, dissapointed at the outcome.

''I'll try Sunagakure next then. . .''* - Sat Sep 19 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) calmly came from Kirigakure's direction, rubbing the back of his head with a dissapointed expression on his face. His Konohagakure headband just hanged from his neck.

But he noticed people across the path. ''Oh, maybe I can have some actual human interaction for once.'' He thought to himself as he aproached Mariana and Hideki.

''Hi there, nice day today isn't it?''* - Sat Sep 19 14:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, haha. Everything is fine. - Sat Sep 19 14:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh, sorry. I just said that because you seem older than me. I only intended to be respectful ma'-. . If I knew your name then that would probably make this easier, ha. . ha. - Sat Sep 19 14:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: My name is Mariana. - Sat Sep 19 14:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Are the two of you from Kirikagure? - Sat Sep 19 14:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Are you? - Sat Sep 19 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Because we are not good fans of Kiri Shinobi. - Sat Sep 19 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm from Konohagakure, y'know. .  The practically dead village. - Sat Sep 19 14:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alright then, would you mind it if I joined the two of you for a while until I find a village to stay in? - Sat Sep 19 14:59:12 2015
