<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) moved his irises around his eyes, all over to be exact. The corners of his eyes showing some shurikens he'd be unable to see if he didn't become so restless. The teenager took a deep breath at first, trying to calm himself down as the first few shurikens cut across his body.

''!'' At that moment he noticed the trail of chakra in the air, the man did say he used Wind Ninjutsu. ''So you can combine weapons and Ninjutsu. .  Amazing.'' But he had to get rid of those shurikens somehow. Otherwise he'd be covered in his own blood. Taiga unsheathed his tanto and cut away at the shurikens, hopefuly managing to send a few stuck into the ground.

After that he'd spew out a trail of fire by forming the tiger handseal. Maybe he could make use of that powerful wind to grow his own weak fire technique into something more powerful. The flames would surround Hassan, maybe trapping and burning him at the same time.* - Tue Sep 29 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) felt the sweat slide down his face, mixed with some blood all over his body. ''He's really strong huh. . . ?'' He mumbled, as he was attacked by a strong force of wind with shurikens. The teenager was literaly being pushed around by shurikens.

Taiga dropped to the ground, feeling his body sting all over from the multipe cuts on his legs and arms. ''Ah, I didn't think shurikens would hurt this much . .'' He said with an awkward laugh.

Honestly standing up was already hard, his legs trembled everytime he'd try to anyway. ''I-I give up, that was really amazing.'' This was the first time he had been defeated like this, he wasn't even mad. Just impressed.* - Tue Sep 29 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I fought a guy whom I couldn't hurt with my physical attacks, and there must be others like him. At time it might be useful for me to switch it up. - Tue Sep 29 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sighned, he felt like crying to be honest. Not because of what he was about to do but because he had to run from his home. Then again his new home didn't seem bad, not ideal but not terrible. ''A golden age huh, I picked the right village to escape to.'' The teenager rubbed the back of his head and sighned once more, with paper in his hand now. He had no leafs in the desert after all, so he had to make do with paper. Hopefuly it wouldn't ruin his training. Because that would be a major setback on his improvement.

Taiga looked up at the sky, what had happend was done now. He had to get used to this, the boy sat down and turned his gaze to the paper. His eyes staring at the chakra system inside his body, the chakra coursing through his body. Slowly but surely escaping his hand as it tried to latch on to the paper, sadly that didn't work out. Which meant the chakra dissapeared and turned into a short moment of warmth. ''I see, so I did get better. .  Although only a little.'' the teeanger rubbed the back of his head, not sure if he felt even mildly satisfied.

He realised that he was nowhere near done with his training. His eyes still had that fire in them, the will to press on with this boring training. ''I made the decision to practice this way, so I'll stick to it.'' Sweat went down his head, simply because he wasn't used to this enviroment. This made it harder to concentrate as well, resulting in his chakra failing to latch on to the paper each and everytime. So improving became even harder now. Maybe he'd have to spend twice as long now to get things right. . .

Harada's irises shifted to the top of his eyes, looking up at the sky while his training continued. Unable to burn the paper, not even the tip was getting burned. The heat itself was slowly getting warmer. But heat alone was not enough. The problem was rather simple, this was a case of repeating until he got it down. Of course that meant a boring, long time of practice every day to reach the result he hoped for. And he was certainly not anywhere close to that goal.

Taiga stood up and held on to the paper with his thumb and index finger, the wind almost blowing it out of his grasp. The Genin walked towards the center of the village while he continued his training, slowly noticing that he was getting a bit better. No flames, but he noticed something that seemed like a burned part at the bottem right edge. It was hard to see, but his eyes allowed the boy to see the trail of chakra dissapearing from it. He managed to somehow latch his chakra on the paper.  Now if he could remember how he did that. .  Then this wouldn't be so hard.* - Wed Sep 30 15:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Are you in the mood for a mission? - Wed Sep 30 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 30 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Build some homes. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We have a major influx of villagers. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And not enough hands. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Consider it a D rank mission. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Make haste. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Understood. - Wed Sep 30 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) walked away from the village center. Noticing that there was indeed not enough men to build the houses for this growing village. The teenager reached where he needed to be and showed the mission scroll to explain his reason for being there. After that he'd start working on a new house, but he had to help people build it from the ground up. And the boy had never done something like this. So it would prove to be quite a tough task for him. ''Alright, let's get this started.'' He clapped his hands and got to work.

Taiga grabbed some wood, noticing that most houses were made of not only wood but sand. However he didn't even know how those were made so he sticked to the easier method. The Genin followed his orders and brought the wood to the carpenters, he had to walk back and forth to get supplies for them so that they could work quicker. After all, he would just get in the way since he had no experience or knowledge on how to build a house. Though it seemed to be a quick task for these men.

First came the walls, the men made sure to properly build them with the wood Harada got them and the sand from the village. ''Amazing.'' He mumbled while running back to get new equipment. They were really working at it quickly, and without a problem at that. But still, they were behind schedule otherwise they wouldn't have made a mission for the leader of the village. He got yelled at to move faster sometimes, and at other times he got yelled at for bringing the wrong supplies.

It was a hard task for somebody who didn't know anything about this sort of business. But it was also an interesting learning experience. If he ever lost this home and had nowhere to return to then he'd know how to quickly build a house of his own. Anyway the walls were now done, however that meant the roof, windows, door and inside still had to be worked on. And they allowed the teenager to help with the doors, so now he actually had something to really wok on as well.

The doorknob was finished already, so all he had to do was follow instructions and put the knob on the door, with a lock added in a moment later. He continued to do this for a few more doors until they were all finished. Taiga dragged them over to their positions and helped putting them in place, with this the house had doors. The windows as well were being doing at the same time, and those were finished even quicker. Maybe the Genin was holding them back instead?

Harada was sweating a bit, he had a tough time getting used to this enviroment but even so the mission was still far from impossible. At this point he was no longer holding them back, he understood what he needed to do and made sure to do it quickly. For the roof it was simple, get more supplies to the men as fast as possible. And for the inside it was much the same to be honest. He wiped the swear from his forehead and looked on as the men did the last details on the house to make it sturdy.

''And that's a wrap.'' He said, finishing the first house. Of course this meant that there were more houses, and he got to do more after each house until he finally got accepted to help with everything like it was his own job. Taiga finished his mission after a while and wrote down his report in the mission as he headed back for the village center to tell Hassan that he finished building some houses as the man had requested of the shinobi. ''So there're missions like this as well huh?''* - Wed Sep 30 18:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I want to share what I know with you, and then ask you somethings. - Wed Sep 30 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) placed his arms infront of his chest, crossing them. ''Of course, but you'll have to hide those eyes somehow or people will notice. Anyway, you probably know about the three million bounty.''

But then he noticed something weird. ''Wait, even with that bounty. .  You should be able to know I have these eyes as well. .  So why do you want me to keep my distance?'' He really wanted to know, because he thought everyone with these eyes were comrades. Atleast with the bounty on their head's.* - Wed Sep 30 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: He talks a bit weird but okay. - Wed Sep 30 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I've met another besides you who told me about two more, however one of them is missing. - Wed Sep 30 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't know about the last one though. - Wed Sep 30 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? Nope. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I literally just got this before I came to Suna. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, I see. - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: How do you feel when you see these eyes of mine? - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anger, anything else? - Wed Sep 30 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . Uh. - Wed Sep 30 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see, Suitengu felt anger and you have desire. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'd have to say mine was nowhere anything like that. .  At first. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I simply felt like it was an instinct to look at the eyes, but now with this bounty. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't want innocent people to bear the burden. - Wed Sep 30 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So like you I have the feeling of taking other eyes in a safe way. So that those innocent people don't have to die. - Wed Sep 30 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's very noble, good on ya. - Wed Sep 30 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Thank you, however. .  It's not like I know a medic who can do something so hard. - Wed Sep 30 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And I don't know if the others involved would like to lose their eyes in exchange for safety. - Wed Sep 30 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean honestly it's something that will never work. - Wed Sep 30 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If I ask you to give your eyes up so that you'll be safe. .  Would you do it? I don't think so. - Wed Sep 30 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No wayyy! - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll be fine. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I thought so. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course I don't intend to fight over it. - Wed Sep 30 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't want either of us to get hurt. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Phew. That's cool. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Plus I'm not strong either, so I'm sure I'd get my ass handed to me anyway. - Wed Sep 30 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How do you know? I might be a weakling/ - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I just know that I'm not strong, honestly. - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Also, what I do know is this. - Wed Sep 30 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: There's a way to progress these eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: As you know there's one ring. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .? - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: However a boy named Suitengu has two. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He told me he got it by eating lots of honey buns, obviously hiding the truth. - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? - Wed Sep 30 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: C'mon. It's obviously based on instincts. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And then there's a person named Edge who wants to bring us all together and do research. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Instincts? - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What do you mean? - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: The eyes are a special power. . . But only a portion of the special power. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's likely this instinct is just a way to make the power become whole. - Wed Sep 30 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, that might be possible. - Wed Sep 30 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So you mean. .  The instinct of me looking at the eyes, you wanting the eyes and Suitengu being angry at the eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Is a way of telling to take them? - Wed Sep 30 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's my theory on it. - Wed Sep 30 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Doesn't explain how that makes him get two rings, though. .  - Wed Sep 30 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Wait, but Suitengu had only met one more person before meeting me.  . And he said Ikarus was no longer here. - Wed Sep 30 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So if he got angry at his eyes. - Wed Sep 30 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Wait, no I'm sure that's not right. I mean he's just a seven year old kid. - Wed Sep 30 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Although he is Zetsumo's child, so who knows. - Wed Sep 30 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tch. Begs a lot of questions. - Wed Sep 30 21:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Sep 30 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sighned, somebody next to him was training so he decided that it was time for himself to do the same. Even though he really didn't want to do that at all. Well, training had to be done to reach perfection and that was something Hassan wanted from his shinobi. Taiga sat down and clapped his hands together, his chakra flowing through his body for a small moment until it suddenly dissapeared for a split second. The Chakra came back a moment after, making it seem like nothing had actually changed at all.

Harada formed the ram handseal, his chakra blowing up every few seconds. Like a flickering light, at one moment it was off and a moment later back on. On off, on off. He could check if it was working correctly as well simply because of those eyes he had. The chakra through his system was easy to understand. Which made the training easier because he knew everything was actually working the way it should be. ''Alright, again. . '' He said while yawning out loud.

Taiga didn't feel even remotely tired after doing that a few times, then again it was an easy technique. And nobody really got tired from doing something like this. ''Such an easy technique to use and train, but also so boring.'' He yawned once more, it was just so boring that he felt tired from doing this technique. ''But this is just the start.'' And he was right, he only just began his training and it would take a long time to finish it.

The Genin felt his chakra dissapear for a moment, only to have it reconnect a second later. In a way it was like a one second black out, maybe that was simply how things worked for chakra. His attention shifted to Tetsu for a moment, though he kept on training. ''That's true, you're doing well Tetsu.'' He said with a smile, watching the fireball roll forward with ease. For a first try that was quick and amazing. Tetsu sure had it easy when it came to making progression.* - Wed Sep 30 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) says: Hassan. - Wed Sep 30 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles, his hands now reaching out for a bento in his backpouch. He simply ate some of his food for a while and drank some water. He had to stay hydrated after all. ''Back to training.'' He sighned once again, his hands clapping together to form the ram handseal. His restored chakra already flowing through his chakra system at a rapid pace, and he could check that with his own eyes. His Kai was far from perfection, so he had to train it alot. He had to reach perfection after all.

The teenager wasn't paying attention to anyone else at the moment, everything went into practicing this boring technique which would probably save his life later on. ''Ugh, I hate this.'' The boy complained, though not loudly. He didn't want to seem like a pansy compared to everyone else. It took a while for him to shut up though, but he still continued to train even though he seemed so angry about it. A bit strange to be honest. However being able to deflect Genjutsu was important.

Taiga rubbed the back of his head for a moment, with his eyes now closed. He tried to imagine a Genjutsu being cast on him, though he barely had any experience with it. So it was honestly hard to really imagine anyway. But that didn't stop him from trying. Harada took a deep breath and clapped his hands together, forming a single handseal to cancel his chakra from flowing for a split second. This allowing him to break free in his imagination. And the chakra returned to it's normal state a second later.

Harada's eyes locked on himself, watching his own chakra system with care. He wanted to check if there were any spots where the chakra did not flow correctly. And he did this by of course using the Genjutsu Kai technique which he was practicing. Everything seemed to go well, there was nothing wrong with his chakra system and there was nothing wrong with his technique either. He sighned out of relief and stopped training for a little while, thinking a moment to rest was needed.* - Wed Sep 30 22:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) nodded, following Arashi if he decided to move out.* - Wed Sep 30 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, following Arashi out of the village called Sunagakure. The Genin nodded at everything Arashi said, having nothing to talk back to. Fucking up was not an option. After that they went through the desert unknown to him. He had only been out in the desert twice now. And one was in a cart so this was a firest time experience. Nothing to really look at but still, he managed to learn more about Sunagakure's land. The mission seemed simple, not something he himself had to do anything for to say the least. As it seemed like he had to just tag along. ''Hm, I wonder what those smaller villages will be like. Probably poor.'' He rubbed his chin, lost in thought for a moment.* - Wed Sep 30 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned for a moment, on eye closed while the other stayed open. He seemed rather tired for some reason. Maybe because he had yet to get used to the current enviroment and it's climate. Anyway, the teenager followed Arashi and Kang through the desert. Hoping to soon reach one of those small villages. His eyes noticing the entrance to the first village after a while, though he stayed silent the entire time and simply allowed Arashi to do what he was told to do. Even during the meeting not a single word escaped his mouth, and he only had his eyes out on his surroundings. Because who knew what could happen? After that he once again followed the Uzumaki to the next village.* - Wed Sep 30 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) held on to a bottle of water, drinking it slowly to make sure he didn't finish the bottle in one go. Anyway, the road to the next village wasn't that different from the first path so nothing to say about that. He yawned from time to time, wiping the sweat from his forehead due to the heat. ''This is going to take some getting used to huh?'' He muttered, drinking his water once again. But they reached the second village after a little while, and this meant he could rest in the shadows of the buildings for a little while. Once again he had nothing to say to the villagers, he didn't mind being seen as a prick or  mean person. He simply had no reason to talk to them. After that he followed Arashi and Tetsu out of the village, as that was the only thing he really had to do anyway.* - Wed Sep 30 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his right hand for a moment, shaking his head. ''Ah, no. You can keep that to yourself Tetsu.'' He returned his hand into his pocket and followed behind the two. Occasionaly drinking from his water bottle, though it wasn't cold at this point due to the weather and enviroment. He got used to the burning sun for now, but that didn't mean it did not annoy the living hell out of him. However the only had to do one village left, so they were past the halfway point. He got excited about finishing the mission, because this was not a pleasant one. Even if it was easy. ''I really want to just rest after I'm back in the village.'' He thought, letting Arashi do the usual inside the small village while he waited in a shadowy area until the man made him follow him.* - Thu Oct  1 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) yawned yet again, this time because he was just really tired and wanted to sleep. Which was something he'd be able to do in a while since they finished their mission. As such he tried to up just a pace while he walked with tetsu and Arashi. The sand was annoying for one stupid reason, and that was that at times the sand got in his eyes or mouth. Which was annoying and aggitating on multiple ways he could not describe. Anyway, the Genin continued to walk on the path to Sunagakure no Sato with the intend to finish the mission and get some well deserved rest. After all, he seemed to have some bags under his eyes and a rather tired expression on his face in general.* - Thu Oct  1 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) folded his arms for now, walking through the sand paths that inhabited the village hidden in the sands. He knew that it was time for training once more, even if he didn't want to do it at all. ''Right, right.'' The teenager rubbed the back of his head and reached a dead tree, noticing that there were a few leafs on the ground. Though completely dry. Maybe this would make training a bit easier, but just once would be okay right? And it did seem easier, as the first leaf had a burned edge after he tried for a while.

''I see, so the training is paying off in the end.'' He noticed the chakra flow through his body, and for some reason it felt like it was burning calmly. Everytime he tried burning a leaf the edge turned black as the small amount of ashes fell down to the ground infront of him. Taiga raised an eyebrow, wondering how much longer he'd have to practice. As it was ultimately up to himself in the end. But if he wanted to reach perfection. .  Then this wasn't where he'd have to stop. Certainly not.

Harada took a deep breath and closed his eyes, burning the edge of another leaf once more. The training was still really boring but atleast not horrible to go through now that he noticed the slow progress. His hot chakra burned calmly, meaning that he got the hang of the chakra itself but still needed to learn how to correctly control it so that it would not only last longer but burn stronger. But it seemed like the tough part had been accomplished. So he felt some form of accomplishment to say the least.

The Genin was leaning against the dead tree while the leafs were burning slowly after trying multiple times. Each leaf took around five tries to burn completely. So he had to get better five more times. ''Hm, well I'm getting there.'' He muttered, his attention fading for a moment as he looked around the village. Nothing was really happening at the moment so he had nothing to do aside from training either. It seemed like he was stuck for now with these leafs. ''Alright, I'll burn a few more.''

The teenager took a few more breaths to calm down, he was sweating from all that training. It was slow and easy, but even something easy could become tiring if done non-stop. Taiga dropped the last ashes and stood up, wiping his clothes clean from the sand. He grabbed another leaf and left the tree, heading to where other shinobi would be. He could use this leaf to practice as he searched for others, just slowly burning it at his own slow pace. ''Hm, I wonder what I should do now. .''* - Thu Oct  1 17:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head with a yawn. Standing somewhere in that sandy desert village called Sunagakure. Of course he had nothing else to do but train, which meant he really had to do just that. . . Train. Oh boy was this going to be exciting! Taiga clapped his hands together and placed his back on the walls protecting the village. His chakra dissapearing for a moment after he formed the ram handseal. It all came back to him a second later, meaning that he succesfully did the Ninjutsu. But it was still a bad version of it, nothing about it screamed well done.

Harada stared at his own hands, watching the chakra flow through it casualy until he canceled it out with his handseal and concentration. ''Hm, it's going to take a while huh?'' Harada rubbed his hands together for a moment, a pained expression on his face. He was not happy with all this training it seemed. Anyway he just had to break and reform his chakra time after time again until it came naturaly to him. And who knew how long that could take? Maybe it would take ages.

Taiga shrugged, the heat from the sun and desert made the training even worse. It was anything but fun, and even if it was fun. .  The heat would suck it all out. ''Ugh, and again. . '' He said with an annoyed voice, his hands still clamped together to form the ram handseal. This way he could just doze off every once in a while and train if his attention came back. Either way it meant that he was going to continue his training even if he had to complain about it every single second.

The teenager wished he had anything to make this more interesting, but he knew nobody who was good at Genjutsu so he had nobody to try the technique out with. This meant many hours of himself just using the same simple technique over and over again until he was confident enough to use it in actual battle. And he was currently not confident about it at all. The boy yawned for a second, and with that he decided that it was time for a short moment of rest. He didn't want to tire himself out too much in one go.* - Thu Oct  1 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) sighned, he had to continue his practice yet again. ''I'll stop after this session though. I just can't keep my attention to it for so long.'' He mumbled, his hands forming together to make the ram handseal. Honestly it wasn't hard to do what he wanted to do. As he had been doing it for so many times now. It was a simple routine, form the seal. Concentrate on your chakra and make it dissapear for a second, then you do nothing and it returns. That's what he had been doing and what he was doing now.

A smile formed on Taiga's face for whatever reason, he wasn't even sure of it himself. . He just felt like smiling, his Ninjutsu was slowly getting better. Maybe that was it? Or maybe the stress from everything that had happened was getting to him instead. Anyway, the training on Genjutsu Kai was slowly starting to form into him getting used to the technique itself. He didn't know how much longer it would take, but he hoped that it wouldn't take much longer for it to get atleast usable in combat.

That smile on his face cracked into a worried expression a few moments later, the stress really was getting to him in the end. But all this training was helping him keep his mind of that atleast. ''Alright, let's keep this up for a little while longer.'' He took a deep breath and broke his chakra flow for a mere second. Only letting it reform a second later, meaning that he was alright in the end. ''Hm, I can see what's going wrong and what's going right. .  But it's not easy at all to correct it.''* - Thu Oct  1 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head for a moment, thinking about what he did wrong and what he did right. In the end he couldn't really understand why he was unable to fix those problems. But he continued to practice the simple technique without stopping until that simple mistake was accurately corrected through his hard work. ''!'' He noticed something small, a tiny change that was just what he needed for now. Thanks to those eyes of his he could see that something had made it easier, but what? He didn't know.* - Thu Oct  1 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Thu Oct  1 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have. - Thu Oct  1 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Seems no one really utilizes Earth, or Wind. - Thu Oct  1 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So it's a bit aggrivating. - Thu Oct  1 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked for a moment, noticing something like chakra near him. ''Hm?'' Taiga turned his head around, watching Fujitora use two different kinds of chakra. One of them being fire, he raised one eyebrow and held his hand to his chin. ''Interesting.'' He was interested in both types of chakra, but there was something else he could do now.

''Hey Tetsu, this man here seems like he can use Fire. Why not ask him to teach you something?''* - Thu Oct  1 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Thu Oct  1 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Could I inquire if you'd be willing to perhaps teach me a few things? Or would that be asking too much from someone you don't know? - Thu Oct  1 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You'd have to convince me...I don't teach many now a days.. - Thu Oct  1 21:16:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And how would I go about doing that? - Thu Oct  1 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm no longer a shinobi...I see little reason to. - Thu Oct  1 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Thu Oct  1 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps I could pay you or such? Or provide a service? - Thu Oct  1 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, I need to learn more techniques to protect myself from my worldwide bounty. .  Which in all honesty, I have been given for no reason. - Thu Oct  1 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Paying will not work...These skills can mean the life or protection of someone.. - Thu Oct  1 21:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So if I could learn some new techniques to protect myself. .  That would be great. - Thu Oct  1 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, if I cannot convice you, I am sorry for bugging you about it. - Thu Oct  1 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: There must be a reason for you to learn new things Tetsu. That's why you came here, right? - Thu Oct  1 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Heh, well, I'm a bit sick of being kicked around so easily, but the way this man speaks, that isn't exactly a viable reason for him to teach me. - Thu Oct  1 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I think he only wants to teach if it's needed. - Thu Oct  1 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway Tetsu, you shouldn't give up. - Thu Oct  1 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Mm. .  Well, I don't have that privilege. - Thu Oct  1 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A three million bounty on my head means that I'll be in danger everyday. - Thu Oct  1 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I need to learn more techniques to protect myself. - Thu Oct  1 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Is that a good enough reason sir? - Thu Oct  1 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Plus, I have this bounty yet I did nothing wrong. - Thu Oct  1 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So you could say I'm an innocent man with a target on his head at all times. - Thu Oct  1 21:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I'm better when it comes to close combat, be it taijutsu or kenjutsu. - Thu Oct  1 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If there's anything I can do for you. Then please tell me. - Thu Oct  1 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If it's something I'm capable of, then I will do so. - Thu Oct  1 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Someone with a bounty on their head, maing a deal with a villager for his teachings..Bad news to most..So I'll just request that you keep your actions away from myself and those I care for.. - Thu Oct  1 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course. - Thu Oct  1 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I don't want innocent people to suffer because of my problems. - Thu Oct  1 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well done Tetsu, you're a natural. - Thu Oct  1 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm.. - Thu Oct  1 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, seeing that you use kenjutsu, this skill will be great for destruction.. - Thu Oct  1 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned with interest, the red and orange flames reflecting in his eyes. ''I didn't know it was possible to use Ninjutsu like that. . Amazing.'' His voice was calm, yet with some spark of excitement in it. He never saw something like this before after all. ''I see, that does make sense. As for killing people, it's never the right thing to do. It's a shame to hear that somebody used it for such a reason.'' The teenager grabbed a small notebook from his backpouch and wrote down what he saw, though he had no idea how it was actually done. But still, this meant that he could remember the image easier by checking his notes later.

''So, how do you make this technique. .  Happen?'' He asked.* - Thu Oct  1 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) wrote down what the man said once more, so that he could remember it if he did forget for some reason. ''Understood, well then. Might as well try it.'' The teenager grabbed the tanto from his back and unsheathed the blade, now holding it infront of him with his eyes closed to help him concentrate. Taiga took a few deep breaths until his chakra bursted out of his body, trying to latch on to the blade of his small sword. What it turned to was a few sparks but nothing amazing aside from that. It was his first attempt at using the technique after all. ''Hm, this might take a few tries to really get down.'' He said, rubbing the side of his head.

Harada made sure to tighten the grip around the hilt, his chakra flowing out once more to grab the blade and surround it in sparks. The heat was there, but the flames weren't. ''Hm, still not there huh?'' Taiga frowned, wondering what it could be. The boy tried a few more times, but it didn't really work out. ''I'll keep trying till I get it down.'' He said with a smile.* - Thu Oct  1 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm...Continue to try. - Thu Oct  1 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles for a moment before he got back to practicing. The teenager closed his eyes and took a moment to concentrate. The few deep breaths that he took helped with this as well. Chakra escaped his grip and surrounded the blade of his short sword, until it bursted out into flames. ''!'' Taiga's eyes opened up, watching at the flames surrounding his weapon. ''A-Amazi-'' The flames were out of control, burning the ends of his sleeves. ''Woah!'' Harada canceled his chakra and stopped the technique. One part was done, but another part had still been unfinished.

''Well, I don't want that to happen a second time.'' He mumbled. He waved his arms around to cool them off from the flames.* - Thu Oct  1 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) took a glance at the palm of his right hand for a moment. ''. . .'' Taiga placed both hands back on his tanto and took a deep breath once more. The flames came sprouting out in an instant, appearing from the bottem and dissapearing in the air from the top. It continued like this for in what seemed to be a cycle. Harada made sure to try it out a bit, swinging the blade around with the flames. He managed to keep a basic control over the flames, though it was draining him and the flames did dissapear at a quick pace from the top. All that constant burning of chakra was something he'd have to work on later.

''Hm, well that worked. Right?'' His gaze returned to Fujitora, waiting for the man's opinion.* - Thu Oct  1 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Thank you alot for teaching me this technique sir. - Thu Oct  1 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) really doesn't want to be a part of this at all, the poor teenager wants to train.* - Fri Oct  2 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed his forehead for a moment with a pained expression, he was not feeling happy with what he saw now. ''I'm never going to be safe huh?'' He muttered, his eyes then sliding up to look at Erebus. Hoping that all he'd do is look at him, and nothing more.* - Fri Oct  2 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles as he walked through Sunagakure, it was time to train after all. The teenager was feeling rather good about his progress right now, and he wanted to keep that feeling so he'd have to continue training for a little while longer. Otherwise he'd lose his groove, and that's something he did not want at all. Taiga reached the edge of the village and sat down next to the giant stone wall. His hands formed together to create the ram handseal, which he then used to charge his chakra with.

The chakra inside Harada's body boiled up till the point of almost burning. He made sure to release it out of his fingertips, which created a tiny flame ontop. ''Alright, it's small but still. .  It's something.'' The boy smirked, and took a deep breath. For now he'd try to keep said flame up for a long period of time, of course it vanished a while later. Which meant that he'd have to do this for a long time, filled with many failures and a success or two. For once he was actually happy to be training.

Harada held a dead leaf in his hand, letting it burn slowly through the use of one small flame. He did his best to keep the fire burning, however that was harder said than done. He showed a painful expression with sweat sliding down his face. It was truly a hard task, controling the flame for such a long period was anything but easy. And this was still a tiny flame at that. He had to laugh at his own struggle just to keep himself from feeling bad about having such a hard time over something seemingly easy.

The Genin stretched his arms for a few seconds, he didn't want to get a stiff body. ''Hm, I'm still not there yet.'' The boy mumbled, rolling the leaf from left to right and right to left with his index finger and thumb. The flame consumed it at a snail's pace, but it picked up speed the longer it went on until it suddenly burned the end in an instant. ''!'' He blinked his eyes out of surprise, maybe he was doing it unconciously but that was certainly what he had been aiming for. He had to try one more time to be sure.

''Right, first concentrate. Calm yourself and let your chakra burn through the use of a strong image.'' Taiga held the leaf in his hand and took a deep breath, the flames sprouted out of his fingertips a second later and consumed the leaf at a quick pace. It was still a small flame so it took a while longer than a normal fire. But it went through the leaf with relative ease for it's size. ''Alright, now I need to control a bigger flame.'' He said, rubbing his chin to think about it for a moment. Wondering how he'd accomplish that.* - Fri Oct  2 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned, his eyes closed for a while as his right hand held on to his chin and his left arm crossed his chest. ''Hm, I'll just have to go with trial and error huh?'' The teenager said to himself, his eyes now opening up. Staring at the chakra system within his body, he was already concentrating everything he had to get this started. If anything, he was rather pumped up to train even after finishing a session just now. ''I'm almost at the point that I want to be, I can't stop now that I'm so close!''

Taiga's chakra bursted out of his fingertips and formed a big flame, which he was unable to control, thus burning multiple leafs in one go as it vanished from a slight breeze. ''Eh?!'' He was sweating, with a surprised expression on his face. That scared him for real, controling a big flame was anything but easy. But he didn't let that stop him, because the teenager continued to do the same thing over and over again until he found some progress. And he started from a smaller flame this time.

The flame kept growing bigger and bigger after each checkpoint. Which meant he started small and went to a slightly bigger flame after controling that and so forth. It was the safest way of doing this. Burning himself would only end up with him being in pain. And there was no need for that. Of course the boy was getting somewhat tired from wasting all his chakra like that, but getting tired was a part of training after all. ''Hm, let's try burning some leafs with this big flame.'' The boy said.

Taiga grabbed two leafs, one for each hand. His eyes closed with a deep breath to find a good moment to start. Two flames ignited from his hands and burned the two leafs with good control, he was able to keep them from going into utter chaos and ruining the enviroment. ''Yes! Awesome!'' He said, doing this a few times again to remember the feeling. He didn't want to forget how it felt after all. The teenager stood up after a while and clapped his hands together with a grin.

''Well, I've trained enough for now.'' He laughed a bit, his right palm open and pulled infront of his face. He stared right into it, his concentration being at the center. ''!'' Harada created a large flame out of nothing and closed his fist a second or two later to let it dissapear. ''Heh.'' Taiga left his training spot and headed for the village center, where most people usualy were doing whatever. He really didn't know what other people did in their free time. ''I'm so happy that this worked!''* - Fri Oct  2 19:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his index finger and pointed it at his own eyes. ''I don't need to explain myself do I?'' He had told this person about these eyes and what he could see before, so he didn't feel like explaining it a second time. However he was shocked at his appearance, completely different from what he was used to. So he took a second to speak.
