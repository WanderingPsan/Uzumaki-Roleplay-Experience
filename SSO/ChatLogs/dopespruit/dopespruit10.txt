<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head, Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Pick it up. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Katsune planned a massive party for you in Amegakure.. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I ruined her plans.. without knowing she had plans.. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You need practice, Erebus. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Time to waste millions to throw a festival... - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: At lying..? - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mind teaching me, madam expert? - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. All you have to do is ask. - Mon Sep 28 16:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) reached the bigger training field this time, which was strange considering that he always stayed in the smaller field. ''Weird, there's somebody in the small field but nobody's here.'' Though that meant he could occupy it for now. Taiga grabbed some leafs from his pockets and walked over to the center of the field. The boy sat down and placed the leafs on the ground, with a single leaf staying between his finger tips. ''Now how should I burn it?'' He thought, rubbing his chin. Knowing that he was lost.

Taiga's eyes gazed at his fingertips, waching the chakra inside flow through. ''Hm, I need to get the flames out from there right?'' He muttered, still concentrating on the chakra system. ''First, make an image in your head.'' Taiga's head filled with the thought of flames and heat, burning and growing like a wild fire. He tried to do what he'd do when using a fire technique, molding the oxygen in his body with his chakra to create flames. However that didn't work either, atleast not for this.

Harada's head rose up, noticing a person entering the training field now. ''Hm, seems like I'm not the only person left anymore.'' He kept his eyes on him for a while as he played with the leaf in his hand. Trying to get some reaction out of the leaf by molding his chakra into his fingertips. Though nothing happened like usual. The boy didn't even feel any heat come from his fingertips. Was he really just that bad at controling chakra? If so then he'd have a hard time as a shinobi ahead of him.

The Genin sighned, bored by the entire training session. In the end all he did was sit down and hold a leaf. ''Maybe I need something else?'' He scratched the top of his forehead, wondering if he was right or not. The boy grabbed something else, a piece of paper to be exact. However nothing happened, molding an changing chakra was truly a hard thing to do. Harada frowned now, feeling not only dissatisfied but stupid for failing to do such a simple feat. ''Eh, a few more times. . .''

It continued on like before, nothing changed and it was all because he was inexperienced. But his patience was also wearing thin for today. ''One more time.'' He stared at his fingers, making the chakra in his body course to the tips. Slowly making contact with the leaf between his thumb and index finger. It started at the bottom, to be honest he felt a faint warmth come from it. But maybe that was because he had his fingers so close to each other. Confusing for sure. . .* - Mon Sep 28 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: What is this man planning. . ? - Mon Sep 28 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned, seemingly interested in what was going on. Being one of the many Konohagakure shinobi standing at the gates to look at Erebus and his troops. ''Right. . '' To be honest he wasn't sure what was going on, even after the man spoke. For now he'd just have to wait and see what happens.

''Though, I wonder why Katsune isn't here. . '' He rubbed his chin, trying to figure out why.* - Mon Sep 28 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Why so tense, Taiga. - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Lighten up, this is a day of celebration! - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Konohagakure's troops have flourished once again! - Mon Sep 28 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right, of course. - Mon Sep 28 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What does your heart desire? - Mon Sep 28 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Money..? Women..? - Mon Sep 28 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Sake..? - Mon Sep 28 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm sixteen Erebus, so it's none of those. - Mon Sep 28 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: My only desire is for Konohagakure to stand tall for the many ages to come. - Mon Sep 28 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But why does that matter? - Mon Sep 28 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But still, is it really needed to have such a celebration? Kilm is but one shinobi, his promotion should not have such a grand impact. And I'm sure that he himself does not want that either. - Mon Sep 28 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: And Katsune is most likely tired all the time from all the paper work. - Mon Sep 28 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You don't seem to understand, Taiga. Kilm's promotion is representation that Konohagakure is flourishing. Despite all the odds, a Chuunin was appointed and our military power is growing. Now tell me, where are they? - Mon Sep 28 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . .  As I said, I have no idea about there current position. - Mon Sep 28 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sake and women? - Mon Sep 28 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He wants to celebrate your promotion and Konohagakure's growth. - Mon Sep 28 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Your promotion. I ruined the surprise so I bought two thousand troops for Katsune and I'm throwing a party for you. - Mon Sep 28 19:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What have I done..? - Mon Sep 28 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Killed a person because said person didn't agree with your religion. That's what you did. - Mon Sep 28 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . So far . . . You killed two people. - Mon Sep 28 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or rather one. - Mon Sep 28 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Not sure if that's what you should be answering with Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Okay, maybe I need to make myself clearer.. - Mon Sep 28 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What have I done to you two ungrateful bastards..? - Mon Sep 28 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've given you everything you asked for. - Mon Sep 28 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Your village.. - Mon Sep 28 20:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, let me try something else then. - Mon Sep 28 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: You're walking an unbelievably thin thread here Kilm. You shouldn't have said that. - Mon Sep 28 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Now we have to be ready for an assault, who knows with Erebus. .  - Mon Sep 28 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) chuckled, simply because he was nervous and scared beyond belief. Sweat sliding down his face with a strained smile. ''Haha, we sure got ourselves in a pickle didn't we Kilm?'' Taiga's eyes shifted back to Erebus, hoping that the man would regain his composure.* - Mon Sep 28 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I really wanted to tell him that we'll settle this later though I have no time. - Mon Sep 28 20:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Awkward. - Mon Sep 28 20:42:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Since it feels like you cut your ties with Konohagakure this way. - Mon Sep 28 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Konohagakure wouldn't be where it is now without me. - Mon Sep 28 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My ties with the village is not cut, but my ties with Katsune and Kilm are. - Mon Sep 28 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then wouldn't that mean that Konohagakure will be split in two? - Mon Sep 28 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Katsune is the Hokage, so if you the person holding the military cut your ties with her. - Mon Sep 28 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then there would be two sides. - Mon Sep 28 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There wouldn't be two sides. - Mon Sep 28 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It'd be her and Kilm against Konohagakure. - Mon Sep 28 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Katsune was just the title holder, I was and still am the true Hokage.. - Mon Sep 28 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I did hear that some consider him the Hokage. . Chances are what he says will end up true. - Mon Sep 28 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm heading back into the village, but let me say this. Katsune is not a bad person. - Mon Sep 28 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) the teenager's dim purple eyes stared right into Erebus's for just a moment. ''She simply wants to make Orakuru's dream come true. That being a Konohagakure that's doing well.''

He turned around, making his first steps back into the village. Though his face showed his fright now that Erebus couldn't see. * - Mon Sep 28 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You seem mistaken, Taiga.. - Mon Sep 28 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 28 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow me to explain to you how all of this came to be.. - Mon Sep 28 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . Alright, please explain. - Mon Sep 28 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I can't face him right now, I can't control my expression at the moment. - Mon Sep 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I found Katsune and Kilm lost in Genjigakure, a village south of here. I talked with them and found out their dreams and goals in life; they were both lost mentally and physically.  - Mon Sep 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I took them in, I brought them back here.. - Mon Sep 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I rebuilt the village with my own money, allowed the village to regain resources and structures.. - Mon Sep 28 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then I gave Katsune the title Hokage. She preached the same mess to me about wanting to accomplish Orakuru's dream.. - Mon Sep 28 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I told here, specifically, all I ask for is honesty and trust.. - Mon Sep 28 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For I risked everything to assure their safety and their wellbeing.. - Mon Sep 28 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then all of a sudden, they turned on me. - Mon Sep 28 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Little by little I noticed the people that I forewarned were waltsing into the village.. - Mon Sep 28 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Claiming that Katsune was putting hits on me.. - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You think Hanabi's death was a mistake..? - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It wasn't.. - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It wasn't on a whim.. - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It was the after effects of a discussion that turned sour once I figured out Katsune has been going behind my back.. - Mon Sep 28 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . I see, as a person born from Konohagakure and a friend of those two. I will have to say, you have my gratitude. You save both them and the village. - Mon Sep 28 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Still, I cannot see murder as a correct solution to anything. - Mon Sep 28 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, I believe I've stayed here long enough. Thank you for explaining this to me. But I should go back into the village. - Mon Sep 28 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Mon Sep 28 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rapes the 7 year old.* - Mon Sep 28 21:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, okay then. - Mon Sep 28 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? Actually, I've never seen her around before. - Mon Sep 28 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ..U-Unh..? - Mon Sep 28 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Hi. - Mon Sep 28 21:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: It's hard to understand Maloth, damn. - Mon Sep 28 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) thinks: ...He's got a sword. - Mon Sep 28 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his right hand, waving it casually. Though anyone looking at his face could see that he had a strained smile on his face. Not to mention his face being a bit pale at the moment.

''Ah, nice to meet you. I'm Taiga. And this kid is Suitengu.''* - Mon Sep 28 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .... - Mon Sep 28 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Should atleast introduce yourself. - Mon Sep 28 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: So I did it for you. - Mon Sep 28 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: I'm going to kill this man if he says my name again. - Mon Sep 28 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Omit.  - Mon Sep 28 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Right. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: I'm off to mend my pride. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: And my bruises. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Seeya around, Maloth. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Your pride? Why? - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Thanks for the pounding? - Mon Sep 28 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Got One hitted. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Eh? - Mon Sep 28 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: What's so funny? - Mon Sep 28 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hmm. - Mon Sep 28 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) fell to his knees, tears in his eyes as he laughed. He needed something to laugh at after what just happened. So this really cheered him up.

''Nothing, nothing. Just your choice of words. Hahaha~.''* - Mon Sep 28 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . Not get. - Mon Sep 28 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is get one-hit-ed. Not tell lie. .  - Mon Sep 28 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I don't think they have bandages for Pride. - Mon Sep 28 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: True. - Mon Sep 28 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Pride is a fragile thing. - Mon Sep 28 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) managed to pull himself back up, his eyes dim purple eyes staring at her for a moment. The rings in his eyes allowing him to see her chakra, nothing strange about it to him. 

''You have a pretty smile. . . Valencia was it?''

He never forgot a name, unlike a certain woman named Misa. . Anyway he smiled back, but with his wasn't fake. He even waved for a moment, meaning no ill intent.

''A fight? Me? Eh, I'm not the strongest fighter believe me.'' He said, having a sweat drop slide down his face as he laughed awkwardly.* - Mon Sep 28 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Taiga want's to spar. Thats why he came here. Go ahead and have at it, I'll just watch. - Mon Sep 28 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . .  Did you even listen to a single word I just said? - Mon Sep 28 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) eye's twitched for a moment, anyone would be shaking if they had to fight a man like Maloth. Just one look at him and you knew he'd punch your head straight into the ground.

''O-Okay! Stop pushing me! I'll spar him, I'll spar! No Ninjutsu or weapons though, just hand to hand taijutsu alright?'' Though that was obviously a disadvantage to the teenager.

''Y-You can begin Maloth, please go easy on me.'' He laughed awkwardly once more, still shaking.* - Mon Sep 28 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinks, his face looking like he was about to see his own death. ''Oh crap, look at those footprints. I'm going to be obliterat-'' His thoughts ended at the sight of the man's slow punch.

Taiga's pupils quickly moved around the corners of his eyes, analyzing the man's stature. ''I see, so all those muscles are weighing the man down.'' The teenager moved his body after that, his hands opening up into palms. He moved his body to the left, meaning Maloth's right side. This way he wouldn't be able to come in with a left punch. ''Let's try hitting his chin.''

Taiga moved quickly, his palms grabbing the man's thick right arm and using it to pull his body up as his right leg came inwards. A quick blow attempting to hit the man's cheek, showing that his precision was off. ''Damn, that's not the chin!'' * - Mon Sep 28 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked a small sweat drop sliding down the side of his face. ''Eh?'' And from there on it all became hazy, the first thing he noticed was a fist reaching his chest and sending him a few feet backwards. He was going to feel that in a moment. Some of the air did leave his body.

''Eh? No, really. .  That was me at full physical strenght Maloth, you're just really strong. I have a blade that I'm experienced with. But I'm not even sure if that can hurt you, to be honest. .  I think I can't hurt you.'' He wasn't lying, atleast that's what he thought.

Taiga rubbed his chest, obviously not that wounded from it. He managed to take a hit, not with ease but enough to not topple over. ''Wait, I take back the rules on only Taijutsu!'' It was cheap, but he felt severly dissapointed with himself for being unable to damage him.

Harada took a few steps back, going as fast as he could while weaving multiple handseals. His chakra molding in the back of his throat with a deep breath. The rest was rather obvious to anyone who knew about fire ninjutsu. ''Katon:Goukakyuu no Jutsu!''

A ball of fire escaped his mouth, going at Maloth. Taiga was better at hand to hand fighting, but maybe Ninjutsu would pull through for him somehow. .  It would be a wonder.* - Mon Sep 28 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stood there for a moment, thinking what to do while this bull of a man ran through flames. ''. . Are you kidding me. . ? YOU ALL SAW IT, I TRIED DAMN IT!'' This was maybe the first time Harada got even a tiny bit angry in a fight, simply at his own weakness. But he still held speed above Maloth, logically speaking it was impossible for the man to hit Taiga if he moved around.

''I don't think that I can use his strenght against him . . But maybe I can have him ram into the fence behind me.'' The Genin took a few more steps back and carefully timed the moment Maloth would without a doubt come charging at him.

Taiga would duck down down, his arms infront of his face to protect himself from a surprise knee or kick. After that he'd try to leap through the gap between Maloth's legs, considering their difference in size such a thing should be possible. Of course it was a risky plan.* - Mon Sep 28 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turns his head around, this time with big white comic like eyes. Tiny black dots in the middle as his mouth was opened just a little. ''Eh? Not even that?'' He stood up and looked at Maloth's facial expression, now quickly backing up to widen the distance as he held his palms up.

''O-Okay Maloth, calm down. .  Let's end this here alright? You win, I'm too weak to hurt you. Thus you win by default. You are the stronger one.'' He wasn't sure if giving up would stop the man though.* - Mon Sep 28 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Oh thank god. . . If he exists. - Mon Sep 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah, I'm going somewhere else now. .  And think about, what I could do better. - Mon Sep 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head, his eyes staring down at the ground. He just left like that, rather sad.* - Mon Sep 28 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: What do we have here? - Mon Sep 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Eh, hey there. . . Guys. - Mon Sep 28 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then.. - Mon Sep 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Whenever you want to hear, let me know. - Mon Sep 28 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I wonder what they're talking about. - Mon Sep 28 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: A weird place to have a conversation don't you think? - Mon Sep 28 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: i-is it? - Mon Sep 28 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, maybe that's just my opinion. - Mon Sep 28 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, having a nice day? - Mon Sep 28 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) smiled after Paine finished her sentence. ''That's nice to know, it's always comfortable to meditate. A peacefull day is a wonderfull day.'' He clapped his hands once, nodding at his own statement.

scratched his head for a moment. For once he had something to ask the man behind Paine. ''Eh, anyway. Erebus, I have a question for you.'' He raised his finger, pointing at the weapon that the man always kept with him.

''That's not a weapon that you can just buy in the village's weapon store. And then there're those gauntlets that Katsune uses. I was wondering if you know a place where I can buy a strong katana.'' He then pointed at his own weapon. ''As you can see, I have a regular tanto. It doesn't have any range and it'll probably break soon.''* - Mon Sep 28 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, honestly..? - Mon Sep 28 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) bowed deeply for a moment and then turned around, heading back to wherever he came from.* - Mon Sep 28 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed his head for a moment after the crash. ''Eh?'' He blinked, one eye opened at the moment.

''Ouch, sorry. That's my fault, are you alright?'' He hoped that Valencia wasn't going to get too angry at him.* - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) pulled one hand up, two fingers starting at his eyes and then pointed directly at Erebus. ''You already have Yumiko, you better not do anything weird.'' He thought, knowing that he'd be in trouble if he'd actually said that.

He didn't do anything aside from that, meaning he'd be dragged out of the room.* - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Fine, sorry. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his right eyebrow and leaned his head to the left just a bit.

''Are you really alright? Maybe you have a fever.'' He never really noticed the locked hands in the first place since his mind was occupied with Erebus.

''Maybe you should rest or go to the hospital.''* - Tue Sep 29 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Yeah. - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: I should. - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, what to do~. - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head. Still blinking a few times, this was followed by a quick yawn. ''What to do, what to do~.'' The teenager unconciously lead himself through the streets, ending up in his favourite training spot. He sighned, knowing that he had to practice everyday to keep up with the others. And his recent defeat to Maloth also reminded him that he had to get better.''Right, time to resume that training.'' Taiga grabbed a leaf from the ground and poured some of his chakra into it, sadly nothing actually changed. ''Ah, here we go again. The same old boring training.''

Taiga placed his legs on the ground, not minding the sand that dirtied his pants. ''My nemesis. . .  Leaf.'' The Genin twirled it around between his index and thumb, chakra surrounding it yet not actually managing to lit a flame. He felt some form of heat, but that was something he managed to accomplish the last time as well. Of course the heat itself was barely noticable and felt more like it came from his fingers practicaly rubbing against each other. ''I wonder how long it will take until I've got this figured out. . '' He yawned once more.

The boy sighned yet again, this was honestly becoming really boring for him. But he had nothing else to do either. The heat seemed to increase just a tad, but that didn't mean it was all that much either. He tried blowing on it, but that just made it worse. ''So nothing helps huh, learning proper control is something that takes ages. . .'' He said, feeling rather dissapointed by this. If only training could go faster, then he'd be so happy. Sadly something like that didn't exist. So the chakra in his body couldn't randomly turn into fire out of nowhere.

Harada closed his eyes, almost dozing off after a while. But he managed to regain his concentration. He felt the chakra in his body flow through his body while the image of a bright flame burned in the back of his head. To be honest it didn't feel like he'd ctually make it work, but still. .  Atleast he tried. And that meant something didn't it? His dim purple eyes saw every part of his chakra run through his fingers at a rapid pace, trying to fill the leaf.

However, it dissapeared the moment the chakra released from his fingertips. Causing a sad expression to unfold on his face. ''Ah, damn it!'' He yelled. Throwing the leaf down to the ground and stomping on it. But he grabbed it and continued his training after that, he didn't want to give up either in the end. ''Please, just some kind of change. I beg of you!'' He almost cried, begging the leaf to show some mercy on him. Sadly this leaf came from the pits of hell, and it did not give him that chance.* - Tue Sep 29 13:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know what sparks your interests, so I'm going to just say maybe. - Tue Sep 29 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, I'd like something mildly engaging. So something that does require combat. - Tue Sep 29 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: However I'm still just one Genin. - Tue Sep 29 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Tue Sep 29 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) raised his right hand, catching the scroll and opening it up. His eyes scanning the scroll for a moment. ''Hm.'' Not a hard mission to say the least, maybe a bit boring but an accurate assignment for a single Genin.

''Thank you.'' He turned around, exiting the mansion.* - Tue Sep 29 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) cracked his knuckles for a moment, his irises shifting from one corner to another. ''Hm, is that the visitor?'' He wondered, stepping forward. His right hand stretched out with the intent to shake the man's hand. ''My name is Taiga, I'll be your guide for the day sir.'' But he had the wrong person and felt embarrased about his failure. However he was then poked on the shoulder by a middle-aged woman, rather fat to be honest but she had a kind smile. ''Oh, I'm terribly sorry ma'm.'' The teenager bowed infront of her, finding out moments later that she was the client.

Harada enjoyed his first few minutes with the woman, they managed to strike a conversation rather fast. He used this chance to inform her about the places they'd walk to, for example their amazing restaurants and their parks. ''If there's anything you wish to see, then please tell me ma'm.'' The teenager smiled at the woman, who asked for a few different things. Mainly clothes and similar things to buy as presents for her family and friends. This was surely going to be a peacefull and enjoyable mission.

They reached their first stop, the ramen stand. ''I promise you ma'm, this stand sells top quality ramen. You won't be dissapointed by the food!'' He said cheerfully, and kind of like a brat. But he meant no ill intent. They both sat down, ordering one bowl and eating it slowly so the woman could experience the taste. And he predicted it well, the woman was in love with it and hoped to eat here the next time she'd be in the village. That was one part well done, hopefuly the rest would be the same.

Taiga raised his right index finger, aiming at one of the many parks inside their growing village. ''I'm honestly surprised we have visitors at all. Well, Konohagakure is quickly growing into it's former state so maybe that's why.'' He thought as he threw some bread to the ducks and birds. The woman needed a moment to rest after all that walking, it was quite a big village after all. And the country of fire was rather hot compared to other countries. As a civilian of the village he didn't really notice it. ''Are you ready to continue ma'm?'' He asked, his hand sticking out.

The woman grabbed his hand gently and allowed herself to be pulled up by the shinobi. The two of them continued on their path as they spoke about the things they liked and the reason for her visit. ''I see.'' The reason was normal to be honest, nothing to be surprised about. Though now they passed a weapon store, the woman wasn't interested in that. They visited a few more stores, trying out different kinds of foods and drinks made in his village. The mission was reaching it's end.

''Hm, that's a fine choice ma'm.'' Taiga said, nodding at the shirt the woman picked out. It showed the leaf symbol on the back of a white T-shirt with leafs of different colors fell down from the top. She already had a basket full of clothes but she kept on buying more, and he had to carry it as her guide. ''Haha...'' An awkward smile and laugh escaped him, he expected this but for it to actually happen was still a surprise he'd rather not have. He sighned and walked behind her for now.

Flowers, flowers everywhere. They reached a store full of flowers, some pretty and some not so pretty. But still, the woman wanted alot. ''I can barely see anything infront of me. . '' He mumbled, trying to adjust everything the woman had bought as he carried it. Of course it wasn't heavy but everything got in the way of his sight, so he had to be extra careful when it came to walking forward. He had to rely on the visitor to lead the way, which was backwards if anything else. 

''Well, that's the end of our tour ma'm. I enjoyed myself, I hope you did as well.'' Taiga bowed down, now free of all that lifting. The two parted at the Konohagakure gates. And with that he had finished the mission, of course he'd write a small report about it during his walk back to the mansion. ''Well, that was a rather easy mission. Maybe I should've asked Erebus for something a little more engaging? Well, what's done is done.'' He rubbed the back of his head and closed the scroll.* - Tue Sep 29 16:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stepped out of his caravan after reaching Sunagakure. The teenager seemed to be a fairly normal person, aside from the fact that he had those three million yen bounty eyes. ''Let's just hope Sunagakure won't follow a bounty made by Konohagakure.'' The Genin walked deeper into this foreign village, hoping to find anyone.

''Oh, ehm. . Greetings.'' He raised his right hand, waving for a bit at the crowd in the middle. ''Could somebody please tell me where I could find the leader of this village?'' His Konohagakure headband showing behind his hair.* - Tue Sep 29 18:42:08 2015

''I'm not sure how Sunagakure feels about a Konohagakure shinobi right now. .  After what happened a while ago, but then again I don't have many choices.'' He seemed to run off into his worries midway though.

''A-Anyway, you may have heared about a bounty on these eyes of mine. .  Coming from my village, so I had hoped I could join Sunagakure until everything calms down. . Ha. . ha.'' He had an awkward, worried laugh. .  After all, this could go horribly wrong.

He spoke once more :''Oh, how rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself, I'm Harada, Taiga. Shinobi of Kono-. .  Well, former shinobi now with that bounty I think.''* - Tue Sep 29 18:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) grabbed his headband, for the first time taking it off. ''Hm, well. .  Don't need this anymore.'' After all, he had no reason to keep a headband of a village that wanted him dead. The teenager grabbed his tanto and cut through the middle of the symbol.

''Do I have to take an exam or something along those lines to become a shinobi here sir?'' He asked.* - Tue Sep 29 18:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Alright - Tue Sep 29 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) bowed down deeply to show his gratitude, he was given a chance to prove himself and he wanted to make good use of it.

Taiga walked over to Ryujin. ''Well, let's go north then right?'' His mouth turned into a smile for now. Then again she was already leaving without him. So he just followed her.* - Tue Sep 29 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: To be honest...giant scoprions sound kind of scary. - Tue Sep 29 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: They really do. - Tue Sep 29 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I never heard of them even though I lived here for a long time. - Tue Sep 29 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) nodded, while he never came to Sunagakure until now. .  He never heard about giant scorpions. ''Well, it's a mission. So he'll want us to do our best right? I'm sure he believes in your ability if he sends you out to do this.'' He smiled again, but this time with a tanto in hand. He needed a weapon to defend himself during this mission right? Either way his eyes locked on the desert, noticing something pop up out of the sand. ''. . . Oh.'' His dim purple three million bounty eyes turned rather comedic for a moment as his body was showered in the shadow of a scorpion.

He trembled for a moment, they didn't have animals like this in his country. Or well, former country. The teenager didn't hessitate to strike though, as he grabbed two kunais with explosive tags and threw them at the scorpion. ''!'' Half a ram seal was all he needed to hit the animal. His body quickly moved through the smoke as he stabbed the beast in the head, blood gushing over the left side of his body. Disgusting to say the least. ''Ugh, I can't really use fire techniques with all this sand. This is going to be hard.''

Thus, he only had kenjutsu and weapons to rely on. Punching and kicking a beast like that would without a doubt fail. And his techniques weren't meant for this enviroment. He took a deep breath and continued to strike at the problem at hand, his eyes keeping their attention to the stinger most of the time. As that's what he was told to be wary of by Hassan. Taiga threw shurikens all over the place, trembling a bit in his shoes yet still pushing on. Size really was an incredible thing, to make him scared so easily.

Harada leapt on the head of one of the scorpions, his tanto stabbing right into it to slay the sand beast. ''That's another one. . '' There seemed to be alot of them, that's for sure. This made him wonder how Sunagakure managed to stand tall in this desert. Either way, he had to fend these things off right now. And it took him everything he had to do that too. ''Be prepared for the stinger. .  Giant snakes would be terrible. Run when those pop up.'' He mumbled as his weapon sliced and diced everything.

''?!'' His attention was sent to Izanami for a moment, who for some reason managed to duplicate herself. Something he had never seen before. ''I know those seals. . .'' His eyes couldn't tell the difference between the clones and her real body, the chakra was the same after all. Anyway, Taiga thought that he could help in with this. His hands weaving the same seals for the last enemies. He inhaled some oxygen and pulled his head backwards, until spewing it out to combine with her three balls of doom.* - Tue Sep 29 19:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) placed his right hand on the tanto hanging from his back. He smiled at Trilliam for a moment, but unsheathed his blade at the same time. 'Perfection', it was something that Taiga would without a doubt never grasp. But he could try to show his good side right? The Genin took his first step forward, using his strenght on that leg to start his charge with a large leap.

Harada came in at full speed, closing the distance between the two of them with his first attack. The teenager aimed a vertical slice across Trilliam's waist, he made sure not to cut deep if his slice actually connected. Just a thin slice to possibly push the opponent to the ground.* - Tue Sep 29 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, feeling the electricity surge through his body. ''Hm?'' It wasn't really doing anything to him to be honest, the teenager must've had a strong enough body to take the hit without trouble. But it did surprise him for a moment, which allowed for the slash made by Trilliam to slice across his chest. ''Oh, I should've been paying attention.'' He still stood there, wondering why he didn't pay more attention. Though the wound made by the weapon itself was thin, so he didn't feel anything to be honest.

''Hm, if I may ask. Are you a new shinobi? Your attacks lack well. .  Power?'' He asked, his right foot reach upwards to kick Trilliam's chin and send him flying. Possibly ending the spar, though he didn't have the intention of lethaly wounding the nice guy.* - Tue Sep 29 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) pushed his tanto back in his sheath, folding his arms as he thought for a moment.

''Hm, rest for now. I'd say train what you're good at and spend time on that. Everyone was new at one point, if you put in the hard work then it'll pay off. Trust me.''* - Tue Sep 29 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, sir. Is there anyone else I could spar? - Tue Sep 29 21:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: How about you sir, would you care for a spar? - Tue Sep 29 21:37:04 2015
