<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head and thought about the best way to dig a hole. ''Eh, I'll just get a shovel.'' He mumbled, the boy walked off and went to the appointed spot. A shovel laying there for him surprisingly. ''Well ain't that lucky?'' The teenager pushed the shovel into the ground and placed his right foot on it, using his weight and strenght to dig in deeper. After that he pulled the first part of the ground out to make a decent start for his new hole. ''Hm, the scroll doesn't say how deep it has to be. Eh, I'll just stop when I think it's fine.''

Harada pulled the shovel back up from the ground again, slowly digging deeper and deeper until a normal hole was formed infront of him. He'd have to jump in to continue from this point on. ''Hm, I'm getting dirty.'' Taiga wiped the dirt and sand from his face and continued to do this basic labor in the hot burning desert sun. Yeah, it was not a pleasant job. But he had to do something right? Might as well do the mission. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and noticed that he was rather deep at this point.

The Genin had to use every bit of physical strenght in his body to break through the ground now. He really got deep, which meant it was about time for him to make the hole wider. The boy broke the sides of the hole and threw it out of the hole, taking his time to widen it. ''Phew, that should be it right?'' Taiga pulled himself out of the hole, covered in dirt now. He placed the shovel down next to the hole and walked away, wiping his hands off on each other as he whistled.* - Fri Oct  2 23:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) grabbed the tanto on his back and took a deep breath. Deciding that he wanted to try out the technique he was taught a while ago. ''Concentrate Taiga.  .'' The boy covered his blade with chakra, letting it turn into a flaming blade for him to control. Though he lacked experience with the technique which meant that it almost burned himself. ''Woah!'' He moved the blade around a bit, trying to keep it from burning himself. ''Sheesh, that was dangerous!'' He said out loud by accident. But whatever, it still worked.* - Fri Oct  2 23:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) slashed around with his tanto, coating it in his chakra and fire. The trails of flame dissipated in the air as he continued to swing around carefuly. He couldn't do anything rash or go wild because he lacked the experience with the fire. And he didn't want to burn or hurt himself while training. After all he was just practicing a little bit, nothing to get so serious about. ''Hah!'' He slashed in a horizontal line downwards, splitting his chakra and fire in two. Which looked rather amazing.* - Sat Oct  3 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) took a deep breath and unsheathed the tanto from his back. ''Hm, I'll have to swing around this blade a bit so that I can get a good feel for this technique.'' The shinobi said, his chakra coating around the blade. Causing it to heat up until the iron covered itself with flames. Taiga slashed around a bit, burning and even melting some stones with the fire. But it was not easy to keep it under control, if anything it was almost impossible. And then he was also unable to control how much chakra he used for it.

The flames didn't listen to him at all, somtimes going out after a swing and sometimes shooting away from his blade. ''Eh?!'' He didn't expect it to be this hard, especialy after he trained so hard to control his fire chakra. But controling his chakra was only half the work after all, if a technique was not practiced then of course it would turn out like this. The teenager rubbed the back of his head and sighned with dissapointment. He wanted to train this in a different way, that would be so much better.* - Sat Oct  3 15:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) didn't understand why it was so hard to use a technique when he had been training to control his chakra for so long. Especialy since it was precisely for techniques like this. He sighned, unsheathing the tanto from him back and slashing away at the air. The flames burning and melting whatever was around the teenager. But he couldn't properly control it, so at times it'd die out after a single slash and then a moment later it'd burn stronger than before and consume his chakra.

Taiga continued to slash at the air, simple horizontal strikes infront of him with the chakra coating around his iron. Flames burning strongly but yet weak a moment later. It continued like that with each swing, one would be considered average and then it suddenly sucked so bad that he wanted to hide in a hole for all eternity. He sighned with dissapointed at himself. Wondering why it was so hard to do this technique. But he wanted to make it useful for actual combat too.* - Sat Oct  3 15:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm. - Sat Oct  3 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) moved his left hand to the back of his right shoulder. His fingers grasped for the hilt of his tanto, which he unsheathed a second later and directed at Durn. ''Alright, then I'll take the first move.'' Taiga's chakra released from his hand, coating around the iron. It didn't take much to ignite that chakra with flames, making a flaming blade. His feet moved forward, using his dominant leg to push in for a big leap towards his opponent. The distance between the two was small enough for him to close in one go.

''!'' Taiga's grip on his tanto was tight, coming in with a vertical slash across Durn's chest in an attempt to cut and burn right through his clothes. It wasn't intended to be a deep cut, it was simply to test the waters for now. After all he had never used this technique in actual combat before. But it was certainly draining his chakra slowly. ''Hm, I see.'' He mumbled, changing his grip a few times to get a better feel of the fire covered blade.* - Sat Oct  3 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) started to sweat now, wiping it off with his free hand. Durn was much faster than him, and managed to widen the distance easily. Rather he doubled the distance. And he couldn't close it even at top speed. But that doesn't mean Taiga didn't try, his blade was still covered in flames. Meaning that he was ready to strike at any given moment, but he had no chance to do that in the first place. Taiga stopped a few meters infront of Durn, wondering what the man was going to use.

''Ninjutsu?'' He asked, his head pulling up. His eyes noticing the large fireball dropping down from the sky. ''Are you serious?!'' He didn't understand why Durn would use something like that in a village, it was too dangerous. But maybe the man wanted to bring Taiga down with this bluff, either way he really felt the heat coming from that. His own blade's fire was no match for that fire, he smiled uncomfortably at that giant fireball right now.

Taiga never heard of something like this in the first place, but what caught his attention is the fact that he used a Fire technique without a tiger handseal. ''Those exist?'' He thought, his sword still pointed forward. He had no idea what Durn was playing at, but he took this fireball as a bluff for now. A spar in a village, and then such a destructive move. It made no sense to him, though that didn't mean that he wasn't suffering. As could be seen by his sweat and panting.* - Sat Oct  3 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) had his teeth grit, the tanto in his hand was being held on tightly. ''So he really is serious?'' He thought, still running after Durn with everything he had. But he was unable to reach the man, their speed and experience was simply that far away. The flames on his sword was still burning strongly at the moment, but the giant fireball was closing in on him. This simply meant that he was going to get burned alive by this technique. But it was a spar, so Durn would stop at some point right?

Still, the burning and pain was horrible. He landed on his knees first, his hands trembling as he had a hard time holding on to the tanto in his hands. He gasped for air, sweat sliding down his face while his mind was being strained by the technique. In the end he released his own Ninjutsu and dropped to the ground on his side. His eyes only half open at this point, trying to stay awake. Though he had a hard time doing so with a giant fireball burning him alive. .  In his mind.* - Sat Oct  3 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) moved his eyes up at Durn, he had a hard time moving. If anything he just allowed anything to happen while he panted, though why he was hit in the face and knocked out went past his head. He had already lost and it was a spar, no need to go that far. But yeah, the teenager had fainted, been ko'd like a Pokemon, whatever you'd want to call it.* - Sat Oct  3 17:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his body just a bit to face the wall, he didn't care about showing what he could do. Because he still had to practice those techniques anyway. ''Eh, sure.'' Taiga clapped his hands together and took a moment to collect his chakra, though this was done quickly. Flames appeared infront of the teenager, shooting forward at the wall as it formed into a circle next to it. A simple technique meant for combination attacks or trapping the opponent after a strategy.

The fire technique was released a few seconds later. ''Eh, then one more technique.'' He mumbled, his hands weaving together to make five different handseals, the last being the tiger seal of course. He pulled his head back and took a deep breath, the oxygen and chakra in his body mixing so that the boy could blow it all out into a big rolling ball of possible death. The sand was blown away just a bit as the flames clashed with the wall until the shinobi stopped his ninjutsu.* - Sat Oct  3 19:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: The Ninja Art: Flamethrower. - Sat Oct  3 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Flamethrower? - Sat Oct  3 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: First time I've heard of it. - Sat Oct  3 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, his hands reaching out for the tanto on his back. He grabbed it quickly and placed it infront of him, he didn't have any problem handling a blade atleast. He took no moment to prepare himself, the flames just came out of nowhere and coated the iron of the blade in a second or two. He slashed it around a bit, showing that it was still rough around the edges. ''I intend to spend some time practicing Chakra Flow, but it might take a while to get the hang of it.''* - Sat Oct  3 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, his weapon still coated in flames. He forgot to cancel the technique because his attention was set on the fire spewing out of her mouth. ''I see, so that's also possible.'' It reminded him of the fireball, but he could see the difference. One was simply spewing it out with a single handseal while the other took multiple and had a wider ranger due to being a big ball of flames. ''That's a smart way of using Katon. And it requires a single seal, so it takes no time to attack.''* - Sat Oct  3 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Just about it. - Sat Oct  3 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: The Tiger handseal is widely used for many techniques. - Sat Oct  3 19:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, that's also true. - Sat Oct  3 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Go on and practice it. - Sat Oct  3 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I am sure you will get it down in no time. - Sat Oct  3 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his gaze to his hands, only now noticing that he still had his tanto on fire. ''Oh. . '' He laughed it off but it was a little embarrasing to say the least. The teenager canceled the technique a second later and returned the weapon to it's sheath. ''Well that was wasted chakra. . '' He thought, his eyes now staring at the wall infront of him. Taiga pressed his hands together and formed the tiger handseal quickly, the proces going similar to Goukakyuu from here on or so he thought.

The flames in his stomache mixed with his chakra, making it easier for him to spew it all out a moment later. But the flames were weak and stopped coming out of his mouth after a while. ''Hm, I need to prepare the flames quicker.'' He mumbled to himself, rubbing the back of his head. But he knew that now, so maybe he'd be able to correct his mistake on his second try. Harada took a deep breath and mixed the oxygen in his lungs with his chakra once more to prepare the jutsu.

Flames escaped his mouth, shooting forward like a Dragon would breathe fire. The flames reached the wall infront of him just barely, but it managed to stay up for a little while. He ended the technique slowly and turned his head to Al-Saachez. ''Hm, how was that?'' He wasn't too sure about it himself, so he decided to ask the person who taught him the technique. The boy could still feel the heat in his mouth, spewing fire was not a pleasant feeling for him.* - Sat Oct  3 19:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubbed the back of his head for a moment, standing at the entrance of this sandy desert. ''Hm. .'' He yawned and grabbed the tanto out of his sheath. Swinging it around with chakra turning into flames to surround the iron. The Genin slashes infront of him while his eyes kept staring forward to see if anyone would appear infront of the village.  ''Orakuru, Katsune. . Hideki. How troublesome.'' The mission at hand didn't seem important at all when compared to their troubles.

Taiga continued his training, guarding the village hidden in the desert while also practicing his technique. There was nothing else to do after all, so getting some practice in was the best thing to do. He blinked and noticed that there was still nobody coming near the village. Maybe his flaming sword and the fact that he was swinging it around like a maniac scared people off. If so then he did a good job guarding the village right? Atleast nobody dangerous would approach the village.

The desert sand blew through the village entrance, Sunagakure was a place filled and surrounded by sand after all. ''Huff, huff!'' He kept up a rythm for his breathing, the same could be said about his sword practice. Redoing the Chakra Flow everytime he did a new strike forward, the sweat flying off his body every now and then. It was easy to do and kept him from doing nothing, this simply meant that he was using his time for multiple purposes. And there was nothing wrong with multitasking. ''It really is a quiet day huh?''

''. .  That sounds plausible, but is it really possible to accomplish that? Of course I would like that, but there'll be problems on the way to accomplishing that.'' He said in response to Durn's idea, his chakra swings going down once more. The chakra draining from his hands and coating the blade with fire. He had no idea if he was getting better at the technique or not. But if he was then that was good for him, practice was a good way to pass the time after all. ''. . But does everyone really have to be elementalists?''

The guarding was going well, and so was his training. Swinging around like a maniac with a fire sword took alot out of him but he managed to defend the village this way. ''But also, where do you intend to keep that organization? Plus I'm a Sunagakure shinobi now.'' He stopped his Ninjutsu for now and placed his tanto in the ground infront of him, sitting down to rest for a while. Maybe heading back to the village square would be a good idea. But they had to guard for a while longer.* - Sat Oct  3 21:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) stood back up, his right hand grabbing the hilt of his tanto. And then like King Arthur the young man pulled the blade out of the ground. Flames appeared from the tip, as if pulling it out was a holy ritual that granted him the rulership over an entire country. ''Always wanted to try something spectacular like that.'' He said, the flames now consuming the entire blade till the hilt, almost burning the user's own hand. But he managed to keep that from happening. He smiled and turned his attention over to Durn and Kang.

''Huff, Huff!'' The teenager slashed down to the ground twice, after that he slashed to the giant rock wall to his side. Slashing through it like butter, the heat making it much easier as it burned the stone away. ''Hm, well I'm starting to get better at this technique.'' He mumbled, still cutting at the wall a bit to leave his mark in it. ''There's a problem with having so many Elementalists grouped together though, I mean you're an exception. But not everyone is strong when it comes to close combat.''

The teenager said that to Durn who wanted to make an organization. His training continued on, though he didn't pay attention to Kang at the moment. And the guarding duty was already finished as well, so he could just continue his training as he pleased. The flaming blade was getting easier to control after all, and he showed that by seeming somewhat adept at using it like a normal blade. As if the flames were an extension and not a way to burn things around the blade.

Harada grabbed a kunai and placed it on the flaming blade, watching it melt in two pieces as it fell to the ground. ''Hm.'' It was going rather fast, which meant that he was getting good at using this particular technique. And boy did that make him happy, he really loved this. It mixed two things he was somewhat good at, Katon and kenjutsu. He'd be sure to use this technique alot from now on. His attention was currently turned away from even Durn at this point as he seemed really into it.

Taiga grabbed a water bottle, keeping himself hydrated by pouring some on his body as well as drinking the rest of it. But the water on his body evaporated rather quickly by the burning sun and flaming blade. He couldn't escape the heat and that was probably the most annoying thing about training Katon under the sun in a desert. He wiped the sweat from his face and played with his flaming sword like a little kid. ''Hehe.'' He seemed rather satisfied with how things were going.

Harada took a deep breath and decided that it was time to start finishing this training session. He took a few more basic strikes down to the ground, watching it melt into a hole after each strike hitting it. ''Alright, that should be enough for now.'' He said, sheathing the blade back into the sheath on his back. He turned to the other two and rubbed his head. ''Well, should we head back to the village square and report that nothing happened while guarding the entrance?''* - Sat Oct  3 21:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowned, his eyes on Baen's eyes for a second and then back at the man's face. Taiga wasn't going to trust or shake the hand of somebody who just insulted him, not to mention a random stranger. He didn't even know his name.

Harada leapt back quickly and placed one hand on the tanto on his back. ''Yeah sorry, I'm rather on edge right now after somebody tried to assasinate somebody in this village a while ago. Not to mention you not telling me your name or reason for needing me. '' After all the man somehow knew about his appearance, not to mention him talking about his eyes and needing him. Sounded rather fishy.* - Sat Oct  3 22:58:08 2015

Thus quickly unsheathing his tanto and slashing at the man who appeared next to him with flames releasing from his blade. Chakra Flow was useful simply because it needed no handseals after all. ''Yeah, okay. You've gone from creepy to really creepy.'' He said, of course making sure to keep some distance. 

''Sorry, but I don't like stalkers. And I don't like men that way, so keep your distance.''* - Sat Oct  3 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned on his heels to follow Baen, taking a step or two back while doing so to keep some distance between the two. His blade was still burning on, he had enough chakra to last for a while so it didn't matter to him. ''Okay, sure it might've been rude of us to be hostile like this. .  But.'' He took a moment to calm himself down so he could list down what made the man suspicious.

''First of, you never told your name and you didn't answer my questions. You called me a fuck boy, not that nice. You're being rather creepy by trying to touch me everytime, if it didn't get through you yet. .  I don't like you being so close up to me. And then lastly, I asked how you know about me. Because you knew my appearance, so either somebody told you or my bounty has a description of me. Considering that people are trying to assasinate each other these days I'm going with the latter one hundred percent of the time just to be safe.'' After that he pulled his blade up and pointed the tip at Ossa, the flames still burning on.* - Sat Oct  3 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: How nice. Are you brothers or something? - Sat Oct  3 23:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So can I get some hits in, since you know. You tried to kill me~ - Sat Oct  3 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: How about no? Maybe it'd be best if you left me alone. Like I told you before I drew my blade. - Sat Oct  3 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What if I say no. - Sat Oct  3 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: He still hasn't told me his name or anything else. - Sat Oct  3 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You see, you being creepy like this and not answering my questions is what got you in this mess in the first place. - Sat Oct  3 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Meh. If I wanted you dead, you'd of died. - Sat Oct  3 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I literaly asked who you are, how you know me and what you want from me. - Sat Oct  3 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Did you? - Sat Oct  3 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 23:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) frowns, still suspicious of the man. But he decided to release his tanto with one hand for now to shake the man's hand. ''. . .Alright, now answer the other questions.'' He released his grip on the man's hand a second later, making sure that the flames on his tanto were burning fiercly. As a way to tell Baen to take a few steps back, Taiga was being hostile and he didn't plan on hiding it at all. * - Sat Oct  3 23:48:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Is it really worth it to kill an innocent kid over money? - Sun Oct  4 00:02:59 2015
