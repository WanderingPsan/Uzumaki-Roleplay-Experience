''So you said you threw a kunai at a guy in a restaurant, you're not going to do that to me . . Right?''* - Sun Sep 20 19:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That, that's really dark. - Sun Sep 20 19:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his head, noticing a waitress giving him his sushi and water. ''Thank you.'' All he wanted was a nice dinner and chat, but it suddenly became a depressing situation. 

He had to lift the mood somehow. ''So, what do you like to do for fun Katsune?'' Taiga took a bite of his sushi after he finished his question.* - Sun Sep 20 19:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They're like tentacles. - Sun Sep 20 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) looked down at his food, for some reason he didn't feel like finishing that after hearing about Zetsumo's tentacle body. ''. . I wonder how his body functions with threads inside. Anyway, is there anything you'd like to talk about. Something you wish to know?'' His expression was a little pale from the current topic, but he tried not to show it.* - Sun Sep 20 19:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Sun Sep 20 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where are you from? - Sun Sep 20 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Konohagakure, you know. That one village that's basically dead. - Sun Sep 20 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) grabbed hold of the headband on his neck, showing the leaf symbol.* - Sun Sep 20 19:14:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Citizen. - Sun Sep 20 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So I honestly don't really remember anything, I just did what a kid my age would do at the time. - Sun Sep 20 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure how you got that headband, since the academy's been empty for at least five years. - Sun Sep 20 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's how long I was there under Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 20 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, it's just a keepsake. - Sun Sep 20 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Funny. I happen to have one myself. - Sun Sep 20 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: The village is basically destroyed, so I just left. I do have some combat experience, so maybe this is my way of identifying as a shinobi. - Sun Sep 20 19:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean with the academy not functioning, this is the only way I could get a headband. - Sun Sep 20 19:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But, if the village wasn't the way it currently is. .  I might have never stepped outside of those walls. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good idea. Zetsumo's gonna kill everyone in Konoha that gets in his way when he re-takes it. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: May I ask, why does Zetsumo want to take Konohagakure? There's not much value in it the way it is. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean, if he just leaves them alone they can rebuild in peace. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It wasn't destroyed really. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure's taken it. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They were careful to not wreck it for that reason I'm sure. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why do other villages have to take the freedom of another village. .  - Sun Sep 20 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, do you have any friends? - Sun Sep 20 19:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Because I've been observing the way people talk to others here in Amegakure, and it isn't all that buddy buddy. - Sun Sep 20 19:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have some, yeah. - Sun Sep 20 19:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You look a little young for drinking games. - Sun Sep 20 19:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I bet I look a bit young to be forced to kill innocent girls for "mental fortitude training" too, don't I? - Sun Sep 20 19:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well I did that anyway too. - Sun Sep 20 19:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You know, that's something you might want to keep to yourself. It could scare people off. - Sun Sep 20 19:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You must not realize which village you're in. - Sun Sep 20 19:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was Zetsumo that had me do it. - Sun Sep 20 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's not about having done those things. - Sun Sep 20 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's about talking about it during dinner. - Sun Sep 20 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm not one to judge people for their actions. - Sun Sep 20 19:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I have no right to do so. - Sun Sep 20 19:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So, what's fun about drinking games? - Sun Sep 20 19:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: In the end all you're doing is drink alcohol right? - Sun Sep 20 19:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't judge. . . - Sun Sep 20 19:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: That tentacle talk already ruined my appetite anyway. - Sun Sep 20 19:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not stuck up, and see yourselves as equal. That's what even normal drinking with someone usually means, I think? - Sun Sep 20 19:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinked, the man hadn't done anything weird or bad yet. So maybe he was an alright guy. Taiga calmed down, his hands now resting on his waist. He looked at the others, one was already forming handseals. .  That was probably a bad idea. But he decided to wait for the cloaked figure's reaction.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you're actually going to do it? - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, nothing really changes for me in the end. - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Had to. He came at me with a sword. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . .Well, I'm sorry that war pushed you to do so. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But you moved to Amegakure for a few years. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So your house, might possibly not be your house anymore. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You're most likely homeless at this point. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's why I'm just gonna buy it, of course. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Are you going to live your life as a shinobi here? - Mon Sep 21 17:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) blinks, he didn't expect that. Either way, it meant that he had a new ally now. ''I see, well I hope the two of us can get along as Konohagakure shinobi.''* - Mon Sep 21 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, it's a bit strange. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm not used to talking so much with other people. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That explains a lot. - Mon Sep 21 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . That hurts Katsune. - Mon Sep 21 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That really hurts. - Mon Sep 21 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, is it a big house? - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Things you left? You didn't take everything with you to Amegakure? - Mon Sep 21 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. We were taken by surprise, surrounded by three thousand. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We had to flee. Zetsumo flew away. I swam underground. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sheesh, what did you leave behind? Basic household things? - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some of it was important. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sentimental value. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, I don't get that. Why would you want to have things that remind you of the lover whom you had to kill? - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because he taught me things. I'd be a very different person if not for him. - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I 'was' a different person. - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Really? What were you like before? - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Mon Sep 21 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Less world-weary. - Mon Sep 21 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I would've paid to see a Katsune like that. - Mon Sep 21 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can't ever be like that again. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Damn. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being like that leads to people dying. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If I may, can I come with you to your house? I have nothing better to do anyway, and I'm curious as to what you left behind. - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Katsune is a real depressing person. . . - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. You can come. - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) rubs the back of his head. He expected her to decline and get aggitated, apparently he didn't understand her at all. But that didn't matter, he simply followed her through the streets.* - Mon Sep 21 17:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: It really is big. - Mon Sep 21 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We had sake here. That doesn't go bad. It'd be warm, though. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, well. I don't think a house that's been empty for five years has any food Katsune. But even so, I'm good. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not five years. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A few months at most. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We lost the battle against Amegakure a few months ago. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's when we had to leave. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure* - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You can drink your sake, I'm only sixteen. So I shouldn't. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You seem to be around my age, seventeen maybe? Or eighteen? - Mon Sep 21 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) never really gave Katsune's figure that much attention, but now that he did he could see that she was probably younger than he thought.

''Katsune, underage drinking is not a good thing.''* - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've done lots of stuff that weren't good things. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I've earned the right to be an alchoholic. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He bought me my gauntlets. Chakra flow. Very expensive. I've been saving up for years and still...I'd not have been able to afford them to this day. - Mon Sep 21 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So you had a rich lover and Zetsumo paid big bucks, sheesh you've sure got it made. - Mon Sep 21 17:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 21 17:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He bought me those, a long time ago. - Mon Sep 21 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) went from a normal facial expression to a shocked expression which then evolved into just a frown with his lips going inwards. His eyes gone wide just a bit. He was even trembling, probably to prevent himself from laughing at the stuffed animals.

''W-Well, atleast you've got a girly side to you after all.'' He turned around, spitting out a quick laugh.* - Mon Sep 21 17:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) turned his head back to face Katsune, his face showing some sort of sympathy for all the animals. ''It's okay Katsune, there's nothing to be embarrased about. It just meant that Orakuru wanted you to be happy right? Maybe he could've tried different presents but still.''

''Also, please don't attack me. I'm not fond of pain.''* - Mon Sep 21 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) grabbed a kunai and his tanto, sitting down in the middle of her house just sharpening his blade. ''So Katsune, is your brain being flooded with memories of your life in Konohagakure right now?''

He didn't look at her, because he'd probably end up cutting a finger off if he didn't pay attention to his weapons.* - Mon Sep 21 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Do those memories make you happy? - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: If his hands move too fast, I'll look away. - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: No one's catching me in genjutsu again. - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Careful, you do not want to be Taiga, the guy with nine fingers. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Course, I'm only thinking about the good ones. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then coming back to Konohagakure was a good thing. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right? - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm...? - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You said all of you are comrades from war who've spend years together. .  - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
