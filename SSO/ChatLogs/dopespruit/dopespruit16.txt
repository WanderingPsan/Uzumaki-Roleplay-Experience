''I won't forget.'' His eyes went back to Baen for a moment, his eyes trying to tell him something along the lines of ''Well, that answered one of my questions I asked you last time.''

After that his eyes met Reisen's chest, and back to his magazine for a second but then back to her chest. And finally her face. ''. . .I want so say nice. .  '' He thought, but then he actually spoke. ''Ehm, maybe you should dress a bit more modest.''* - Wed Oct  7 23:48:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Well, I know what I'm going to use tonight. - Wed Oct  7 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) shifted his attention to the boy, for a moment he knew what he had to do, dropping the magazine and reaching for the weapon on his back. But then it dawned on him, he wasn't fast enough. Not only that, the boy had two people with him. What if he dodged that? He knew how strong Baen was, the teenager was done for. And he never did anything wrong, just an innocent young man who was pulled into this mess.

His expression changed to a mixture of grief, sadness and dissapointment. Everything he remembered about Suitengu came to his mind in his final moments, and everything clicked together. He should've trusted his guts in the end. His eyes stared at the boy, coldly as he managed to get out his last few sentences. ''So it was you. . '' It took only a split second for him to make his last line with a wide grin, smiling at death. ''You're a monster.''

After that it was as the boy had acted out, Taiga died a quick death and had his body held up by him and his freaky multiple arm body. Well, astleast he didn't have to be scared of getting ganked twenty-four/seven.* - Thu Oct  8 00:17:29 2015
