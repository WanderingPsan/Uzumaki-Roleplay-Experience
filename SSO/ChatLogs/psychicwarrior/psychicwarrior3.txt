<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Psychic_Warrior) sits there and glances up at Hideki.

"I'm not the one you're looking for." He stated calmly. 

"The real one is in the Uchiha House."* - Sat Oct 10 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Psychic_Warrior) // Suddenly, Isshin's right fist jets out from underneath the table, mainly to throw the table and flip it upwards into the air. It aimed to crash into Ambrocio's chain. Of course, Isshin was sure that it wasn't enough to abate him. It was why Isshin aimed to grab hold of the man's massive appendage as it aimed to lock onto him, and then proceed to throw Ambrocio straight through the wall with a burly throw.

"You have the wrong guy."* - Sat Oct 10 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Psychic_Warrior) was utterly surprised by the incredible physical durability that this man had. As the other Isshin appeared, Isshin decided to capture him. He dashes over to Isshin and quickly aims to grab him by his cloak, since the table was removed of earlier in the fight. Should he grab hold of Isshin's cloak, he would toss Isshin to the floor and restrain him by his neck.

"This. Is who you're looking for."* - Sat Oct 10 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Psychic_Warrior) quickly erupts. His right hand, which was gripping on Isshin, attempts to use him as a bodybag to protect him from potential lethal injury. Isshin was fairly scared, so he just used the fake Isshin to protect himself, and act as a shield. Hopefully, it didn't kill fake Isshin, but if it did, it was because of Ambrocio's incredulous rage.* - Sat Oct 10 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) rose his eyebrows at Hana, calling him a softie. After the years, Shinjin had toned down greatly after all. Initially, he had been cocky, hardy, and always butting heads with Raizek. Now that Uchiha, Raizek, was dead, Shinjin didn't have as much to go for.

"A quick learner indeed." He dares not to comment on the softie side part, since he had no comment. 

"One more try you say? Good luck." Shinjin said, half-heartedly.* - Sat Oct 10 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) nodded. He was approving of her development--it was truly rapid. 

"Not bad." Shinjin stated. "Not many grasp the concept of chakra control os rapidly." He realizes that she had sunk and facepalmed.

As Hana escaped the water, Shinjin's eyes readjust and set their gaze.

"My name? It's not really important, why are you so curious?"* - Sat Oct 10 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well... - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It's good to know others, right? So, starting with name sounds good. Right? - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean, I don't know. - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I suppose... - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Long as you don't tell anybody, I don't mind. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I don't like telling my name to people. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It means, I won't tell no one. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: My name is Hana, I also don't like telling my name to people. Unless they beat me up in a ight. - Sat Oct 10 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You don't say my name and I won't say yours. - Sat Oct 10 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Deal? - Sat Oct 10 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) blinks.

"Scouts honor.." He chuckled. He kept his eyes on Hana who had just confessed her name to him.

Was it like a secret pass off to her? He nods quietly, obliging her. "Deal. My name is Shinjin."* - Sat Oct 10 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) lifts his eyebrows once more.

"Uhh... Sure." He states, unknowingly. He shook her hand firmly, deciding to seal the deal as she may have put it, in her "hip" way.* - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Kids these days. - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Good! - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Does this seal the deal officially? - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: WOOH. Anyways, can we... get to training. - Sat Oct 10 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) smirks at her.

"Ah, so the princess still wants to continue training. Fine, that's fine by me. Then, let me teach you how to use some electricity. If you're a weapon user, you can imbue your weapons with electricity." Shinjin stated. "Get off of the water briefly."

He states. He sequences three handseals and slams his hand on the ground. Electricity floods out from the ground and crackles in the water, giving a show of light. Some water steams off of the water from the electricity.* - Sat Oct 10 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // "Yes, that's possible. Electricity is going to help your weapons become -that- much more badass." He grinned, grunting lightly. "So, that's basically what you have to do."

He was suddenly slapped on the back. He didn't feel pain, at least. "Lord..." He scratches the back of his head. "Is this how training with you is going to be? So familiar. If I were your sensei, would my treatment be any different?" He questioned. 

* - Sat Oct 10 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Your treatment? - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anyways, that's what I'm going to teach you. How to use electricity. So. We're going to go onto step one.  - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ---- - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Nothing. - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'll be treating you the same way, just calling you Sensei. - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Well..... - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You know, teacher- instructor, and so on. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then there's not much of a difference. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Do you act like this around everyone? - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nope. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Which.. is weird actually. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm more of a bitchy attitude. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sound more real this way, at least. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But I have no idea, why I don't have it with you. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Maybe it's because i have that..... - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Electrifying aura. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ... - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hahaha. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Cute. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Anyways. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Tsk. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Step one? - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Right. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Put your index finger in the water. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And try to create a zap of electricity. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Lies. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What? - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I do not want to get electrified. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Just your index. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ... - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sigh. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And make electricity. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I swear. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: If I die, I will come back somehow and haunt you forever. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) gapes his mouth open for a brief moment, before closing it.* - Sat Oct 10 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) folds his arms across his chest. However, he does position himself behind Hana slightly, so that just incase Hana jolted backwards, Shinjin could cover for her. 

Get it? Jolted backwards. * - Sat Oct 10 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // His hands reach to grip onto Hana's waist as she is pushed back. Shinjin chuckled softly. 

"You're fairly gullible aren't you? It's a first step, that's for sure. A rather startling one." He stated. 

"At the very least, you now know how to use electricity. You needed a conductor to do it though, which beginners start with. Usually, they start with iron. I just made you use water for shits and giggles."* - Sat Oct 10 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned. "You almost died, you say? That's funny." Shinjin stated, laughing lightly after she accuses him of almost killing her.

His gaze sets on her cute pink colored cheeks. Unfortunately, while he was succulently absorbing the eyecandy before him, she had decided to give him a little threat. Shinjin chuckled after she said so, thoughtfully thinking to himself about what she had just said. 

When she questions step two, he stands back up.

"Step two is going to be simple. You're going to create electricity in between your hands, using your fingertips."* - Sat Oct 10 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's a bit harder, because you won't have the conductor to help you. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: But you'll get it in no time. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine, I can do that. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: --Oh, want me to do that now? - Sat Oct 10 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What do I do, exactly? Just focus on my lightning element onto my fingers? - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Go ahead and try. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: So. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Clasp your hands together. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And then slowly pull them out from one another. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And try and create electricity between your fingers. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I can do that. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Pfffft. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) chuckled. He observes Hana quietly and he gives her a broad smile. 

"You're doing well. But, just because you've got a couple of sparks, doesn't mean you have it all down." Shinjin noted. And as he may have predicted just then, it disperses.

However, Shinjin was very certain it wasn't because Hana had lacking chakra control. She had already demonstrated her genius with chakra earlier.

"We'll take a break. You're probably running low on chakra, anyways." Shinjin stated.* - Sat Oct 10 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // He stood there beside Hana, realizing the difference in their heights only briefly after she had noticed his own towering stature. His right arm attempts to wrap around Hana's waist. 

"Why don't you and I have a little spar?" Shinjin grinned, teasing her. "What do you say?" He questions.

"You wouldn't mind a little spar, would you, princess?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Little does she know, I don't mean actual fisticuffs. - Sat Oct 10 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // "Oh, so you're a Queen now, are you?" His left hand attempts to tickle Hana by her armpit. "Then I guess I must be a King, if not the Grand Chancellor of all things royal and becoming." He stated, teasing her for the most part. His right hand brought her closer to his body, while his left hand attempted to have its way with her and force her to laugh.* - Sat Oct 10 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned at her, gripping onto her tighter than ever as he played with her. "Com'on, what kind of Queen laughs so obscenely?" He questioned, laughing as he did so. As she returned fire as though they were having war, Shinjin couldn't help but burst into a degree of laughter as well. To Shinjin---this was their spar. 

"Hey, stop tickling me! That's my job."* - Sat Oct 10 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grunted lightly. "Dangit, you've got both hands now!" He shouted. He started to fall over from all the tickling. Shinjin's body, towering over Hana, aimed to pull her down with him as he was falling though, since his right arm was wrapped around her waist, aiming to have her fall ontop of him. "Clever girl." He whispers to her.* - Sat Oct 10 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) chuckled. "I won't -try- anything." Shinjin stated. As she helped him up, Shinjin's right hand grips onto her hand and he proceeds to pull himself up. As he stood up, he pats himself down briefly.

"I think our training's about over for today. You've learned quite a bit, in a short amount of time. We'll continue tomorrow. You think that's alright with you?" He questioned. If she wanted to continue, he had no problems.* - Sat Oct 10 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure, we can.. I don't care. - Sat Oct 10 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Don't forget about me though. - Sat Oct 10 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Wanna go get something to eat or something? Or we can continue to finish our training. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean... I would like to train more, but I don't want to bore you. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Or anything-- besides, my chakra is running a bit low. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- I'm talking a lot. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, I won't forget about you. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We could get something to eat, I guess. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you like to eat? - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Anything, I don't mind. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ooooh! Have you tasted their steak? It's to die for. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Steak? - Sat Oct 10 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I haven't tried it. - Sat Oct 10 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // "A h--" He was stopped as she grabbed onto his hand, intertwining her fingers with his own. He followed her to the restaurant, not understanding what all the fuss was about.* - Sat Oct 10 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) entered the restaurant and sat down at the table slightly reluctantly. He was being forced! Hana was some demon in disguise. Shinjin didn't really react though, he was okay with the treatment. A very cooked and juicy steak. She was very specific with her order, too.

"Alright. So. You want me... to try this steak?" He stated, as it sat in front of him, steaming. He grabs hold of a fork and a knife. He starts to cut with the knife and breaks the knife.

"...." He begins to dig into the steak with the fork instead and just takes a big bite out of it.* - Sat Oct 10 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) tastes the steak and slowly, without changing his facial expression, places the steak back on the plate. Shinjin really liked the steak. He was a carnivore, at heart, and it was to be expected. However, Shinjin doesn't show any weakness at the reaction. He coughs to the side into the palm of his hand. 

"It was okay." He stated calmly.* - Sat Oct 10 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at Hana briefly. He digs into the steak once more, chomping out another delectable bite out of it.

"Why did I ask for all of those things? Because I want to settle down. I'm done with the ninja world, done with the ninja life, and I'm pretty done fighting. Back in my day, there used to be a group I hung out with. They're all dead now."* - Sat Oct 10 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But aren't you.. like very strong or something? I mean... I'm sorry for what happened to your friends. - Sat Oct 10 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But, that's not a bad idea to settle down. - Sat Oct 10 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'm strong, yes. - Sat Oct 10 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Doesn't really mean anything in the end. - Sat Oct 10 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Settling down is best for me. - Sat Oct 10 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hopefully, Hideki could help you find a few of those things, mhm. - Sat Oct 10 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: He'll find me a house, I'm sure. - Sat Oct 10 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) notices that Hana was patting his shoulder. Shinjin nodded calmly.

"Yeah, probably."* - Sat Oct 10 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So, what do you want to do now? - Sat Oct 10 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ...Netflix & Chill? -omit- - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anything, really. - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you want to do, Queen? - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I don't know, King. - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Want to go find the others? - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Or we could go train some more? Really, anything you want, haha. - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Unless you want to have a tickle fighT! - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anything I want you say? - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A tickle fight might be nice. - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: How old are you, Hana? - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm sixteen, why? - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Oh she's a minor. - Sat Oct 10 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Wondering if you were able to drink or not. - Sat Oct 10 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I am able to drink. - Sat Oct 10 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sixteen is the adult age, dummy. - Sat Oct 10 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Is it? - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Used to be eighteen back in my days. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: They let the kids go younger and younger. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: How about some sake then? - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure-- and I am no kid. I'm an adult, hmph. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But sure! - Sat Oct 10 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Would it be a challenge? - Sat Oct 10 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A challenge. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Let's see how many bottles we can drink. - Sat Oct 10 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Whoever loses, does whatever the winner wants. - Sat Oct 10 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay! - Sat Oct 10 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: How do we play this? - Sat Oct 10 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We'll keep drinking. - Sat Oct 10 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And whoever gives or goes unconscious loses. - Sat Oct 10 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Hardcore style. - Sat Oct 10 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) orders several bottles of sake. He grabs the first bottle of sake and chugs it down, waiting for its effects. * - Sat Oct 10 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) drinks his second bottle of sake, before dropping it back on the table.

"Aaah."* - Sat Oct 10 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grapples the next bottle and chugs it down. He winced from the second bottle, whose effects were heavy on him for some reason. He was pushed, and Shinjin reciprocates by pushing back.* - Sat Oct 10 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) chugs the next bottle down, continuing to feel added effects.* - Sat Oct 10 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) drinks the next bottle, feeling less effects from the previous one. His right arm suddenly wraps around Hana's waist and brings her closer to him.* - Sat Oct 10 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned. He had downed Hana. He drops his sake bottle and wrapped his arm around her. "Let's get you into a bed." He stated. He picks up Hana, piggybacking her on his back. He too was drunk, so he did move a bit weirdly and in a zig-zag pattern, but he does hopefully, make it back to his house to lay Hana down.* - Sat Oct 10 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: I asked for a house when I have one... - Sat Oct 10 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Granted... my house is no longer a good house. - Sat Oct 10 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) entered his house with Hana in tow and tosses her onto his bed. His house was pretty banged up. His flooring and walls were all messed up. They seemed to be peeling from years of misuse and mistreatment. Shinjin's sink had several dishes that weren't clean and his house was absurdly messy---years without a maid or any sense of cleaning.* - Sat Oct 10 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Thought you could use a rest. - Sat Oct 10 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And we did say the winner gets whatever he wants. - Sat Oct 10 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Don't worry, I know you aren't 'easy' to get. - Sat Oct 10 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: A-And what is it that you want? - Sat Oct 10 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) leans over Hana. His right hand cups the back of her head. 

"What do I want exactly is a good question." He states. He nears her face, face-to-face barely an inch away. 

"So, from this position, can you tell what I want?"* - Sat Oct 10 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned. "No, I'm not taking your virgin---well, I'll technically take one of your virginities." He stated. Suddenly, he brings his face into Hana's face and aims to kiss her. His tongue attempts to join with her tongue and intertwine so that the saliva mixed and matched with one another. His right hand, burly and musclar, aims to wrap around the back of her head to push her into it as it was a passionate french kiss.* - Sat Oct 10 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) returns the stare, keeping his eyes set and locked on her own eyes. He backs off briefly, drunken state probably encouraging much more daring actions. He glances at his house and returns his glance at her.

"Now you know why I want a new home."* - Sat Oct 10 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) returns the grip for Hana's balance. "Live with you? Is that a proposal by any chance?" He asked, playfully. As she smiled at him and faced him, Shinjin's eyes widen.

"Not....necessarily." He said, looking at the side, avoiding eye contact at this point. * - Sat Oct 10 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She must never know. - Sat Oct 10 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Not.. really a proposal, I just don't think you should live here, especially if you want to settle down. - Sat Oct 10 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Then, what did you want? - Sat Oct 10 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: . . . ..  . - Sat Oct 10 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Stop worrying about it! - Sat Oct 10 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, yeah, I'll stop living here. - Sat Oct 10 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I know the drill. - Sat Oct 10 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Haha, tell me! - Sat Oct 10 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grips onto Hana's hips for a brief moment as she pecked his lips.

"I don't mind.... wanting you, if that's the question you're asking." 

He was too prideful to say anything more. Shinjin kept his hold on Hana though, tightly keeping her closely knitted to his rough and well-toned body. * - Sat Oct 10 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) wrapped his arms around Hana's body and brought her closer to his body. He returns the kiss lightly and just holds her to him.

"I wouldn't just use you for sex. That's a pointless relationship. Didn't we just go eat steak and train? I'm sure our days would pass similar to that." He felt up her breasts briefly.

"...Are you actually sixteen? Just wondering."* - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But... I developed, quickly. - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Why? - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Why you ask, mmm? - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at the sides.

"I'm much older than you." Shinjin stated briefly.* - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So? - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Maybe nine years --- - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That doesn't bother you? - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I don't care. - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: No. - Sat Oct 10 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It's sexy. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Actually. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: And you are sexy. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ....Kids grow up so fast these days. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm not a kid! - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yes, yes. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Queen Hana. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean, does it bother YOU that I am younger? - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And all this talk about me being sexy. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ----Oh no. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's sexy. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And you are sexy. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nope, you are. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: King Shinjin. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Flattery will get you nowhere, vixen. - Sat Oct 10 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh? - Sat Oct 10 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) nears Hana a bit more. He attempts to push her onto the bed and kiss her once more, this time in the same passionate fashion that he did the first kiss. Perhaps it was more like Shinjin was just trying to hold her close to him.

Shinjin lost a lot of things in his life. He didn't want to lose anymore--especially not before they were supposed to expire in life. Maybe that's why he was acting in such a loving manner towards Hana--much more than he did to any other girl.

Because back then, he thought he'd have plenty of time. He only realized how little time ninja had after years of experience.* - Sat Oct 10 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We should eat some more steak sometime.... It was pretty good actually.. - Sat Oct 10 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) returns the smile to Hana. He was happy to be with her. Behind his tough guy persona, there was to some extent, a caring persona who liked keeping what he had. It might've been called greed to some people---it could've been interpreted as love by others though.

"Maybe get some sauce on that steak too, next time. With wine cups, like the fancy people might do it."

All this talk about wealth--Shinjin's never touched a lick of it to be fair, just look at his surroundings.

He grips onto Hana's sides as he backed off from the kiss. He was suddenly poked and his cheek was stroked. He was going to question it, but sure enough, Hana led in with conversation.

"You think so? Well... You may like me, but I think I love you." He said, admittedly.* - Sat Oct 10 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, and also... - Sat Oct 10 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Don't worry about me being stupid and dying quick. - Sat Oct 10 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Because, I'm not stupid annnnd... - Sat Oct 10 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I can protect myself very well. - Sat Oct 10 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Trust me. - Sat Oct 10 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll teach you everything to protect yourself. - Sat Oct 10 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) hugged her back.

"I trust you, Miss Prodigal Queen."* - Sat Oct 10 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But, I have a question.... if you are so powerful, and all... why do you stay here? - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you expect me to do? - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Go out and fight everyone in the world and make a name for myself? - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Go out to a different village? - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It was never the life for me. - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: No, honey. - Sat Oct 10 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I meant as in.. find a village to reside in. - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Konoha's always been my home. - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And it probably always will be. - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I met Nigen and my friends here. - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Raizek and stuff... - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'm not sure I could discard my memories so easily. - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hey.. - Sat Oct 10 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You have me now. - Sat Oct 10 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'll help you through it. - Sat Oct 10 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Together. - Sat Oct 10 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I won't leave your side, I promise. - Sat Oct 10 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) kisses her on the neck.

"Thanks. And with me by your side..."

"No one is going to mess with you. Guarantee it."* - Sat Oct 10 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, sure. - Sat Oct 10 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll teach Hideki sometime or another... - Sat Oct 10 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Let's get going, Hana. - Sat Oct 10 07:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Who are these people? - Sat Oct 10 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Who do you think were those people back there? - Sat Oct 10 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: This is my home. - Sat Oct 10 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I don't know who those people were. - Sat Oct 10 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You have a nicer home than I do. - Sat Oct 10 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well, our home. - Sat Oct 10 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Our home. - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I can train you and teach you stuff in here too. - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Away... - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: From the meddlesome world. - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I know, hun. This seem like a good space too.  - Sat Oct 10 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grabs hold of Hana by her waist and brings her closer to him.

"I'll teach you what I know. Everything. And by that point, I -highly- doubt anyone could hurt you."* - Sat Oct 10 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you mean? - Sat Oct 10 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Why, is what I mean. - Sat Oct 10 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I can't be showing off.. my goods. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Oh right. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Your goods after all.... - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You kn- unless you want me too dre-- Oh. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Are only for this client's eyes. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Then, haha. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I should change soon. - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) pulls Hana closer to him with his right arm. 

"Yeah. You want me to give you some money to buy what you want?" Shinjin asked. 

"I've got bills."* - Sat Oct 10 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sure, sure. - Sat Oct 10 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: When the village finally has a Kage, I might do some menial work to get us some income. - Sat Oct 10 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Who knows. - Sat Oct 10 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright honey. - Sat Oct 10 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm gonna take some rest. - Sat Oct 10 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) heads to bed. "I'll get some rest as well. You want to sleep with me? Cuddle, of course. Nothing more."* - Sat Oct 10 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) walks over to the bed. He slides off his headband and places it on the side on a desk.

He didn't wear his headband to bed. That was just weird.

He enters the bed, laying beside Hana. His hand immediately aims to comfort her lonely side, wrapping around her with the bulk of his arm to place her close to him. He'd bring the blanket and pull it over the two of them shortly after.* - Sat Oct 10 08:00:00 2015
