He flashes forward, appearing in front of Muhhamed with incredible speed. His right hand yanks his 'Down' above Muhhamed with a quick flash. "Dark Lightning." His strike is sent burrowing downwards towards Muhhamed's left shoulder blade, trying to penetrate the clavicle and fracture the scapula underneath.

Simultaneously, his other blade is used to attempt stabbing straight through Muhhamed's kidney.* - Thu Nov  5 07:07:05 2015

"Unfortunately, I am not assigned to kill any of you---nor was I paid enough to engage into a suicide kamikaze mission against all of you." He quietly states. 

He sinks into the darkness of the wall, travelling away from the area.

Out of nowhere, Macbeth swings downwards after a violent twist. He slams his hands against the ground, splitting gravity as a result. The vectors twist and turn, resulting in the sand being diverted and forced back by the forces of gravity, probably unexpected by Tetsumi.

Not only that, but Tetsumi's entire body would fly off of the ground, as though he were levitating, for only a brief second. On his particular area, in a six feet circumference, the gravity had been remarkably changed. Gravity was propelling him sideways, leaving him almost like a mannequin in mid-air.

"You are one of the sand manipulators." Macbeth's speed is impressive---nearly demonlike in his approach. He is flashed before Tetsumi's sand and already escaped his grasp by the time he joins up with his technique.

"Dark Lightning." He rides the wave of gravity, amplifying his next strike. While Tetsumi was in the air, Macbeth aimed to go parallel to him and swing downwards against his shoulder, most likely causing a grievous wound if it landed.

Not only that, but it would interrupt any attempt of Izutora, as he too would find himself yanked from the ground he felt comfortable on.* - Fri Nov  6 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) | | Macbeth's reactions are swift, precise, and seasoned as if he had done them for years. He moves his body adjacent to Izutora's Dynamic Entry, letting it swoop by above his right clavicle, just beyond the sternal side. Suddenly, his right blade is rocketed at his opponent's calf, diving in with the hunger of the Sin of Gluttony as though it were a ravenous lion, seeking out its sustenance for survival. That was how fast the strike was in tandem with a second blow. 

Should his left blade penetrate Izutora's leg, his right blade is risen to quite literally plunge into Izutora's stomach region and remove him from the combat. In one swift removal of the swords, Macbeth attempts to leave Izutora on the ground, bleeding in a miserable status, while readjusting his eyesight on Kuro---the very next threat.

"Ah, a Shirogane. . . However, your abilities seem weird. You must be the Ninja mutant." He sweeps his blades of blood. 

"You speak folly to a necromancer who dines in the blood of his enemies." He adjusts his posture to face Kuro with intimidation.* - Fri Nov  6 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) | | Quickly, his katana are swung through the air direct in front of himself. They are side by side, clanking and clashing with their gun metallic surfaces. Izutora was gone from the fight assuredly. However, now he had to deal with a new opponent --- Fujitora.

However, Fujitora was a man that could be handled. 

"Gravity Split." The gravity's vectors shift to the left and right. Spiders would be uprooted from their attempts at him, being forced against Kuro's body and Ketsuki's. Not only that, but even the six seals were removed --- material objects obeyed the laws of physics and were ultimately stopped by the powers of gravity. 

Not only that, but Fujitora's own body would experience the effects of gravity. Because it was split at his sagittal plane, it meant that his left arm and left leg would point towards the left. His right arm and right leg would point towards the right. Therefore, a splitz would be forcibly formed. 

He zooms at his opponent at this point, leaping through the air into the air above the gravity. He uses downward gravity movement to force him into the -editted- gravity vectors. He'd swing at his opponent, spinning around in mid-air once he had turned sideways, to try and quite literally slice deep into Fujitora's exposed right arm and right leg, perhaps even slicing his arm off should he not be careful or prudent enough to avoid the attack.* - Fri Nov  6 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) | | "You are the law you say? How very... contemptible. You seek to give yourself justification for the throne that you seat your fat arse upon." He states, slicing away at one of the cloths that dared near his presence.

"I will only forgive your improprieties this once." He states. Suddenly, Macbeth's entire body flashes forward towards the door. He quite literally, against the speed at which Tetsumi's sand moved to engage him, had slid out of the door with a sudden pace. His right blade is used to act as a helicopter chopper to dice and slice away at the various pellets of sand that were being used to assault him. 

"I will end your life --- Fuuinjutsu Specialist."

Regardless of the cloth, it was not possible to aim. Why? Fujitora was outside. Sharingan could not penetrate through walls. * - Fri Nov  6 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) | | Both blades erect themselves defensively. Up is used to deflect the majority of Wheels of Heaven's blow against his side. Of course, Macbeth has difficulty facing the boomerang's rotational movement. Nonetheless, it does not impede Macbeth enough to stop his next blade. Down is utilized to be swung at the clone's chest, erasing it from its existence before it could pull off such a bearhug.

Next were the ligers and wolves that were after him. Macbeth's right katana sinks through the hole of chakram, before spinning it around on his katana violently.

He adapted the chakram to join with his katana. He swings at the ligers and the wolves, shredding them with the chakram in play.

Once the bullet came at him though, Macbeth dispatches the chakram and tosses it in the way of the bullet, intercepting its path.* - Fri Nov  6 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) | | A hail of chakram ran from above him. Macbeth's first assumption would be to escape via running.

However, that's simply not possible. Electricity is being flowed through each chakram.

He can't necessarily go back---that's the same direction of a dead-end and the chakram's destination. Not only that, but if he went forward, he'd be bombarded by chakram. The air was not safe either, due to electricity flowing through.

Not only that, but Macbeth's blade was a conductor of electricity. 

There was only one way to do it. He swings both of his blades forward, dispersing the chakram battlefield and sending them to the left and right side respectively.

Yet, he didn't anticipate the electricity stream through the chakrams. The connection of the violent waves of electrons would sink into Macbeth's blade upon the contact.

It appeared the gravity being distorted was -not- an effect of the dark chakra singularly, but was merely an extension of the blade. Meaning, a source of chakra could run through the distorted gravity if it could run through the same conductor the gravity was being flowed through.

His blades are ignited in electricity, electrocuting his hands. 

He is covered in minor burns, with paralysis running through his fingertips.

Other than that though, he is unscathed.

However, Macbeth was unable to -stop- Ketsuki at the execution of this technique. Not only that, but Macbeth's hands shook as he grasps his sword and attempts to form any type of hand sign. He -simply- needed to clap his hands.

However, that opportunity was probably not going to be given to him. Suddenly, the seals land on him as he is in the genjutsu.

They remove him of the genjutsu of course, but they constantly overheat his innards. He bit his lip and charges at Koji at this point.

Notably, he is slower. However, that doesn't mean he cannot wipe Koji off the face of the planet should he not dodge. His right hand and left hand simultaneously send a left-handed upward swing and a right-handed downward swing, in milliseconds of each other.* - Fri Nov  6 05:55:50 2015

Unfortunately, Kuro's speed had stopped him from too many wounds. Macbeth is yanked out of the way, though ultimately, it does appear as though he is going to die. He is bleeding heavily from the side of his arm from the chakram and the tenketsu closure had done quite a few hits before he had been fully extended out of the path of carnage by the two mele combatants.* - Fri Nov  6 06:39:21 2015

However, at the same token, this particular Edge also joined into the Fire attack. Fire was his specialty, after all. He did enjoy the fireworks, but did deem it necessary for some more to be done. His hands joined together, firing off a flame dance.

The mist spreads rapidly, encouraging a block of Izanami's charge and encouraging the widespread attack of the fireball with his expertise in flame.

If possible, he'd mitigate the explosive radius by exploding it in mid-air, instead of directly on his person.

If that was the case, Edge would emerge from the smoke, rolling backwards before flipping upright. His right and left hand unveil several shuriken and weaponry.

"You know, I love flying targets. Especially moving targets. Let's have a fight between two marksmen."

His Henge fades.* - Wed Nov 25 20:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kenji(Psychic_Warrior) | | Two smaller falcons were coming at him. Three clones were on three falcons. 

There are ten shuriken within Kenji's grasp. Kenji chuckles. He had been breathing in chakra earlier and now, he was going to execute. He'd execute handseals, before firing off a large gaseous mixture of chakra.

"Let's use this combination."

The two falcons incoming would be shot by two shuriken from Kenji. Once they had exploded, the Misty Flames Dance would attract the fire from Trilliam's explosion to engulf the clones and their falcons, hopefully eradicating them from the fight. Should it land, the mud river and mud dragon would be intercepted as the falcon is exploded. 

As soon as Trilliam fired his guided missile at him, Kenji replies with three shuriken, one for the small rocket and two for Trilliam's actual body.* - Wed Nov 25 21:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kenji(Psychic_Warrior) | | Suddenly, the fireball erupts from her maw. Kenji flips to the side, avoiding the technique with a kick on the ground. He had avoided the technique relatively easily, by half of its Shadow Clone nature. Luckily, he wasn't faced with the real one: who knows what she would've done to him. Suddenly though, he had not expected Trilliam to execute. Both clones had fired off bullets at him. The man zooms to the side, avoiding one of them, before being speared right in the side by Trilliam's bullet.

Kenji manages to mitigate the force heavily, but it does still dig into his body and electrocute his side. Kenji drops to the ground momentarily. He drags out additional shuriken, and to stop Trilliam's advance, tosses them into the air, blows fire on them, and fires them off at Trilliam in a cone-like fashion to stop his evasive maneuvers.* - Wed Nov 25 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kenji(Psychic_Warrior) | | Suddenly, the homing missile was zoomed into the Earth construct that was created. Kenji laid against the ground, faced with a nuclear missile.

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

He shouts, before being incinerated. The microwave-oven that Trilliam had formed kills Kenji on the spot, resulting in a volcano's eruption. * - Wed Nov 25 21:49:26 2015

A black vortex erupts out of nowhere, cutting through space-time itself. Emerging from it is Shinigami.

Culling his blade from its scabbard, Shinigami's inexorable and implacable optics steady on Muhammed and Marrisa. 

A flashing juncture of split second had it been, when his blade flew at Marrisa's body. Bifurcation from a vertical standpoint was executed.

Upon contact, Marrisa's body is vaporized; nothing is left behind of her.

Her existence has been erased.

His eyes return to Muhammed.

"Yes?"* - Thu Nov 26 03:52:57 2015
