<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) observes that Takeda was able to counteract the flames; he had countervailed it with a steady stream of water. Shinjin stepped forward. He wasn't interested in the talk between the two. Suddenly, Shinjin jets forward, moving at his opponent. Both of his teammates had released water to countervail the flames, leaving them utterly useless against Shinjin.

Shinjin approaches his target and targets his stomach. His right fist aims to pummel the stomach cavity inwards by targeting the solar plexus's general vicinity. His right hand is cocked, and bam, it is sent rocketing forward like a meteorite. His only goal was to knock out the Rogue Ninja in one blow.* - Sat Oct 10 18:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at Takeda. He punches the tree and causes a massive cavity in the tree, probably breaking the tree in the process. His right hand pushes the tree's trunk and he knocks it over like a domino to crash into the other tree next to it.

"I'm pretty sure."* - Sat Oct 10 18:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: So, let's get going. - Sat Oct 10 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) steps over to the body. He heaves Gakuto upon his shoulder and carries him like he was some kind of bodybag. He proceeds to walk towards the road, following Ortho and Takeda, if Takeda followed.* - Sat Oct 10 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // The explosion blows up a portion of Shinjin's vest. Shinjin is pissed off because the new vest was destroyed. "Bastard."* - Sat Oct 10 18:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) cracks his neck.

"Yeah, this guy is dead. Stand here."

Suddenly, electricity surges through his body. He zooms back to his original area, intent on killing the man who had just ruined his clothing.

"Lightning Mode - Lexus." He flies off like a fucking -beast-.* - Sat Oct 10 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gakuto(Brosis55) says: ---- - Sat Oct 10 18:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) flies right overhead Gakuto. He lands on the ground and literally jets at Gakuto once more. His body, if cared to be analyzed by a sensor, was bursting with chakra at the seams. Shinjin's body rockets at Gakuto at incredible speeds. His right hand aims to grab hold of Gakuto's head. He'd proceed to drag Gakuto's head through the ground and perhaps even smash him into the nearest tree, to knock him out cold and perhaps damage his cranium.* - Sat Oct 10 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) deactivates his Lightning Mode and drags Gakuto over to the gate.

"You bled. Now I know you're definitely not a fake."* - Sat Oct 10 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) drags Gakuto over and tosses him onto the ground.* - Sat Oct 10 18:54:30 2015

"I'm just... doing the upkeep for the house. That's all."* - Sat Oct 10 19:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) folds his arms across her chest.

"What? You want me to publicize or something?" Shinjin asked. His right hand removes itself from the fold and his left arm hangs by his side. His right hand thus attempts to place itself on Hana's waist.* - Sat Oct 10 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well, no not really. I mean, I don't really care hah. But how was the mission? - Sat Oct 10 19:09:00 2015

"Of course you don't bore me. Why do you think I live with you?"* - Sat Oct 10 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll chill, sure. - Sat Oct 10 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) was pulled up against Hana. He pulls his arm around her neck and wraps around her shoulder.

"I wouldn't end up going with some other girl. Most of them aren't interesting, like you." Shinjin stated. "And if you really want to relax, then why don't we have a little fun?" Shinjin asked.

"Stamina training, I call it."* - Sat Oct 10 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: How would we do this, stamina training? - Sat Oct 10 19:20:06 2015

"What do you say?"* - Sat Oct 10 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You want to have, sex? - Sat Oct 10 19:22:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Or maybe you could cook? - Sat Oct 10 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I uhhhh, sure. I'm not that great of a cooker but I know how to make good hamburgers. - Sat Oct 10 19:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) rose his eyebrows at Hana. He sits down at a chair in the meantime.

"No, I'd not consider it. I consider you my lover. Not just some sex toy. If I wanted a sex toy, I'd probably just buy one and be secluded. Probably fuck every girl I saw. But, if I'm devoting myself to you, that probably insinuates something different, right, Hana?"

He smiled back at her. His arms rest on the table in the meantime.* - Sat Oct 10 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) coughed suddenly at the question. Shinjin grabs hold of the burger and begins to eat it, not even commenting on the question. He was twenty-five years old and he didn't want to talk about it.* - Sat Oct 10 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: --Honey? - Sat Oct 10 19:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: That's hard to believe? - Sat Oct 10 19:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But now you are, and half of the village wants your training. - Sat Oct 10 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Eh... - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's not sold that easily. - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015

"This is pretty good."* - Sat Oct 10 19:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Or maybe combined with both? - Sat Oct 10 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe. - Sat Oct 10 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: That is, if you don't leave me for some other chick. - Sat Oct 10 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) finishes his hamburger and stood up.

"You want to take a shower together with me maybe?" He asked, rather provocatively.* - Sat Oct 10 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure. - Sat Oct 10 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) chuckles in response to her answer. His hands move to unzip his vest. He temporarily places it to the side as he removes his vest. His vest reveals his chiseled abs and his pectorals, which were bulging with incredible muscular finesse. Shinjin then heads over to the bathroom, waiting for Hana to follow. * - Sat Oct 10 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grips her waist with his hands.

"Want my help to undress you, or do you think you can handle yourself, Queen?"* - Sat Oct 10 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) smirks. His right hand reaches over to her bra's strap and attempts to remove it from her upper body, to reveal her breasts. Shinjin's left hand reaches for her waist to pull her a bit closer to his muscular chest, so that her breasts press against his pectorals.* - Sat Oct 10 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) brings Hana closer to him. "Well, I've seen your twins now. And don't worry, you'll see my twins too in a moment." He stated. His right hand reaches for his pants and pulls them down, to reveal his fairly sizable member, which was hard for Hana. While he didn't intend to have sex in the shower, they might, if things went the right way.

He'd return the kiss on her lips as well, aiming to wrap his tongue around hers.

"Com'on, let's get in the shower." After breaking the kiss, he'd try to pull her into the shower with him.* - Sat Oct 10 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) noticed how clean shaven she was, expecting it because of her youth and how pristine she appeared to be. He entered the shower. As the hot water rained down on the two of them, he realized she had taken the first move. He kisses her back briefly, his member pressing against her vagina. Hell, his member squeezed its way between her thighs as well, as his hands began to run across her ass.

He squeezed her asscheeks tightly with both of his hands, squeezing them and giving them a light slap with each of his hands.

"Mmmm.... Looks like you wanted it, huh?"* - Sat Oct 10 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) let his eyes run across Hana's body. His hands slapped her ass again and again, anticipating sex to be the next step. As she kissed his neck and ran her hands across his back, Shinjin was having trouble containing his sexual urges and lustful desires. He smirked at her and responded.

"Yeah. Let's do it." He said, his cock pulling away from her thighs. He presses the head of it against her vagina's entrance and his pectorals pressed against her breasts. "Let's start nice and easy." He said, as the head of his massive rod squirmed and wiggled its way into Hana's pussy, penetrating it in a go but not inserting the whole thing yet.* - Sat Oct 10 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) went slowly, noticing that her hymen had been broken. "Why wouldn't I like this plump ass of yours?" Shinjin asked. "I got to thank your mother and father for birthing such a beautiful woman." He stated, as he entered her cunt. He groaned slightly at the feeling of penetrating her. His hands were still cupping her asscheeks and pulling her up on his cock. 

He slowly entered, pushing his cock inside of her and slowly thrusting into her. His cock gradually pushed into her depths and were squeezed by her walls. He could tell that she was a virgin by how tight she was. * - Sat Oct 10 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) keeps on fucking her, digging into her body with his cock. His long member begins to push all the way into her body. His hands suddenly yank her thighs up so that her legs wrapped around him, so that he could carry her while he fucked up, letting her rely on him for this one.

He whispers back to her. "It feels great to me, too, god, I fucking love you." Shinjin stated, as he continued to fuck her. His right hand dug its index finger into her asshole, playing with her asshole while he fucked her vagina simultaneously for dual penetration.* - Sat Oct 10 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // "Yeah, I'll fuck you harder. We'll be together until the day we die." Shinjin muttered into her ears passionately and lovingly. He suddenly aimed to kiss her while his fingers prod at her ass and asshole simultaneously. His cock continued to pummel the entrance to her flower. He pushes her against the shower wall as the water rained over the two of their skins. 

Shinjin's body began to speed up ever so gradually. He pumped harder and faster. His right hand began to surge electricity, controlled so that the water wouldn't harm them. His right hand removes itself from her asshole to grip onto her nipple. The electricity surges through her nipple in an attempt to make her climax.* - Sat Oct 10 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) kept on fucking her. His right hand kept on surging chakra into her breasts as he continued to play with her using electricity to his advantage. "God, I fucking love you. You're going to make me cum soon too, Hana." Shinjin shouted. He grips onto her much more tightly this time. His left hand reaches for her asscheek and begins to pour in another current of chakra to make her cum once more. He was going to have her enjoy the pleasure that he was able to create for her with both his electricity and his massive dick.

He thrusts a couple more times to join with her as he too, was ready to cum. He yanked his dick out of her body and began to spurt his white ropes of semen all over her stomach and breasts. * - Sat Oct 10 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) lets go of her legs, letting her stand on her own at this point. He lets the water clean off the semen that was on her body and relaxes against her. 

"Yeah. That was good." Shinji stated. "I love you too, Hana." Shinjin murmured underneath his breath, mainly as a whisper to Hana and to act as a testimony to his love for her. * - Sat Oct 10 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) nodded. "Let's go train, Hana. I think I've... relaxed enough." He said, holding her tightly to him.* - Sat Oct 10 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright! - Sat Oct 10 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) walks behind her and follows her closely. He grapples hold of his clothes and puts them on. He didn't choose any new clothes--he wasn't a fashion star after all.

"You first."* - Sat Oct 10 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) rose his eyebrows.

"Other way? I wouldn't mind." He chuckled. "Yeah, we can train right here. I figured I'd teach you a little cool move."* - Sat Oct 10 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, you know.. as in.. the other.. umm.. heh. And uhh! Yeah! Sure, we can. - Sat Oct 10 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What little trick do you have? - Sat Oct 10 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's called a rabbit punch. - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What? - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Haha, that sounds a bit funny but sure. - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: How does it work, honey? - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Like this. - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) extends his arm. He points it at Hana before letting it whish by the side of her. It didn't touch her, but it did go right past her face.

"You send a straight. Your opponent dodges it... And then."

He brings his arm back, tapping Hana's head from behind.

"You yank your fist back to hit their head."* - Sat Oct 10 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, that's all you do. - Sat Oct 10 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) doesn't really mind her fist colliding with his shoulder. He's a man, and is pretty dang tough.

"Nice try. One more try."* - Sat Oct 10 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) smirks. "Ah, the bracelet gets you on this one! One zero, bracelet victory." Shinjin grinned. "Well, one more try and you'll get it, you prodigal Queen."* - Sat Oct 10 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned. "Not bad at all. You learn pretty fast, you know." He stated, slapping her on the shoulder weakly so that he didn't hurt her. 

She had succeeded well. "Alright, we can move on to some more lessons."* - Sat Oct 10 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe, yessir!  What's the next lesson, boss? - Sat Oct 10 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grinned.

"I'm going to teach you something harder to use. It's a B-Rank Taijutsu technique, that I want you to know is dangerous to use. Only use it in deadly situations."* - Sat Oct 10 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's called Sekken. - Sat Oct 10 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: A B-rank? I don't think.. I can do that, but I can try honey. - Sat Oct 10 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try it. - Sat Oct 10 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright! Hehe. - Sat Oct 10 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) steps back briefly. He would show her how to do it first.

"Follow what I do." Shinjin faces forward with his entire body straight in a line. His legs are spread out shoulder-width apart. His right arm is cocked backwards at a perfect ninety-degree angle. Shinjin stresses the muscles in his arm and the muscles in his legs. He steps forward with his right arm and twists his entire body towards his fist, causing the fist to be accelerated with both weight and his raw power.

"Sekken." He'd punch the air, causing a rough sound to utter outwards.

"That's how you do it. Sekken isn't a special punch. No. It's the -perfect- punch. People often don't move their waist and their legs in tandem with their punch. When you can punch perfectly, you cause the Sekken to be born."* - Sat Oct 10 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try it. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You have to move your waist perfectly. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Use your hips like you used them with me. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oooh? - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe. - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay! - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) claps his hands. 

"You've done well." He chuckled. "I didn't expect you to learn it this quickly. Now you've got an attack that will really help you handle the ruffians that may harass you."* - Sat Oct 10 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe, I told you I could do it baby. - Sat Oct 10 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Want to go back to the others or you have anymore tricks, your beautiful girlfriend can learn? - Sat Oct 10 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Hmmmm? - Sat Oct 10 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I've got plenty of tricks up my sleeves. - Sat Oct 10 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: But I'm sure this is good enough. - Sat Oct 10 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) slaps Hana's ass.* - Sat Oct 10 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grins and wraps his bulky arm around her shoulder. 

"Great." He kisses her lightly. "And yeah, sure. I'll go and teach those scrubs. You stay home and be safe. I'll be back soon." He stated. He felt the hickey and murmured underneath his breath.

"I'll be off then."* - Sat Oct 10 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I suppose you all are here to restore this village? - Sun Oct 11 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: . . . - Sun Oct 11 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: We could be admiring the rubble. - Sun Oct 11 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: How did you jump to that conclusion? - Sun Oct 11 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh. You just look like charitable people. - Sun Oct 11 00:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Not really. - Sun Oct 11 00:08:32 2015
