<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Likeeee? - Tue Oct 13 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) chuckles.

"Have you.... ever blown me off before? Just wondering."* - Tue Oct 13 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nope. - Tue Oct 13 00:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 13 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) bit his lip. He has the scroll in his hand and dips his brush into an inkpot. He draws out ink and begins to stroke across the scroll, writing what he desired to message to the Fire Daimyo.* - Tue Oct 13 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) continued to write letters across the scroll, flinching occasionally as she continued stroking his member. When she started to lick his member, his hand is slowly drawn towards the back of her head, mainly to brush her hair gently.* - Tue Oct 13 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) // Both of his hands are drawn to Hana's head. He parts her hair and plays with her hair, running his fingers through her long strips of raven black hair. "God, I love your ebony black hair. You're so beautiful, Hana." Shinjin murmured. "I wish I could stay with you forever. After this, why don't... we get something to eat?" He asked, chuckling. 

As she popped out and suddenly deepthroated his member, Shinjin flinches lightly. "You're getting excited, aren't you?" He murmured, throwing his head back just a bit. His dick slapped her face and rubbed its precum all over her cheeks and the side of her lips, throbbing in ecstasy.* - Tue Oct 13 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) glances at the side. "Now that I'm... a Hokage. I'm going to be a lot more busier, that's all.. I'll miss being with you with the majority of my time, teaching you privately and stuff." He stated, as his balls were being massaged. * - Tue Oct 13 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) kept on bucking his hips inside of her mouth. Suddenly, he squirmed, his cock twitching wildly. "Fuck... I'm about to cum." He murmured lightly. He grips onto Hana's head from behind.

"Look Hana. I love you. I'll be Kage, and I'll love you at the same time. I'll be a husband of a Kage to you." Shinjin stated to her, trying to pull her back into the mood as well as show his commitment to her.

"I love you." He stated. He came at the same time, spurting his semen towards Hana's face and probably in her mouth if she was still sucking.* - Tue Oct 13 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) kept his pants down for a moment, before pulling it up as she sucked on his cock. He glances at her and as she asks her question, Shinjin suddenly puts his brush into the inkpot and starts writing.

"Y-Yes. I was writing. It wasn't what it was." He states calmly, scribbling quickly what he wanted to say to the Daimyo. * - Tue Oct 13 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) nods. He was licked and shudders. "Yeah, the letters are going well. Jeez, you must be hungry or somethin--- how could you be hungry after that meal? You go around licking earlobes or something?" Shinjin joked, as he kept on writing the letter.* - Tue Oct 13 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: An alliance with Kumogakure, Sunagakure, or Kirigakure? - Tue Oct 13 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Whoever has the higher power, Suna. - Tue Oct 13 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) takes it.

"Good work."* - Tue Oct 13 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) nods quietly over at Kuro. "Yes, my name is Zeus. Thank you." He calmly replies, returning his gaze over at Ambrocio. He steps forward and nods.

"Ambrocio. I wanted to give you a mission soon. However, I thought us sparring might do you some good."* - Tue Oct 13 04:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: So. - Tue Oct 13 05:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: When you transform via anger---anger being the catalyst to your transformation---you lose control. - Tue Oct 13 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: I wanted to teach you something essential to you as a ninja. - Tue Oct 13 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Do you know how to dispel genjutsu? - Tue Oct 13 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: To be frank, not effectively. No. - Tue Oct 13 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then. - Tue Oct 13 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll demonstrate it to you. - Tue Oct 13 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: And you'll imitate. - Tue Oct 13 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Right. - Tue Oct 13 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) // "Well, simply put, I can't just demonstrate it to you. You can't see the chakra system. Therefore, I'm going to give you instructions. Disperse your chakra briefly by sending an impulse of chakra through your chakra system. Do so against this genjutsu. When you see reality again, I will know that you have completed your task."

Shinjin commences the training by executing a sequence of three handseals. Before Ambrocio was a massive fireball that descended from the skies, aiming to incinerate him in the mental frame.

"Go. Show me your Kai."* - Tue Oct 13 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Afterwards, he needs to learn how to heighten his physical strength. - Tue Oct 13 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Without that transformation. - Tue Oct 13 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Not bad. - Tue Oct 13 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: You'll realize how to use it in time. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Just practice. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Now. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: We're going to spar. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Don't use that transformation of yours. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Control it. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Restrain it. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: -- Right.. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I'm only capable of restraining myself in my first state. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: The second one, well. - Tue Oct 13 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: None of the states, then? - Tue Oct 13 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: You can use your first state if you can. - Tue Oct 13 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Let's go though. - Tue Oct 13 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) kept his guard up. He entered the traditional boxing stance though; it was orthodox, traditional, and it was a stance that Shinjin entered when he was sparring. His right fist suddenly jets out, quickly as a hook to deviate the path of Ambrocio's quick straight.

Normally, straights made it faster than hooks because of the routes that each took. Unfortunately, in this case, perhaps Shinjin's was much more faster because of how proficient he was in boxing and because of how fast his attacks rocketed in the first place. His left hand jets out with a jab, aiming towards Ambrocio's kneecap. Why the kneecap? Because it was an overlooked region of Ambrocio's body. * - Tue Oct 13 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) examines Ambrocio's style of combat. Ambrocio also was posing something similar to Shinjin's. He had the stance down; perhaps he didn't have the experience down. Shinjin could tell that Ambrocio's style of combat was refined though; it was knowledgeable and was down to the basics to a fault.

To a fault. He had struck his knee briefly and had caused Ambrocio's to back away. Shinjin remains stationary though, allowing Ambrocio's next move to come into play. A fellhook towards his torso. Shinjin's right arm raises in an attempt to deviate the blow again, by not only cushioning the attack with his forearm, but by moving his forearm while the strike connected, deviate the blow in its entirety. 

His left hand follows in a swift jab to his chin.

Before connection though, he pauses, realizing another presence in the vicinity.* - Tue Oct 13 05:36:12 2015
