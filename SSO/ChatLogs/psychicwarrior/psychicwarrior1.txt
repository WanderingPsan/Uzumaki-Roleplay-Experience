<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reign(Psychic_Warrior) // The sheen of his glistening gray blade illuminates the room. It bounces off the sun's rays that seem to shine through the unblocked windows. Unfortunately, it appeared Reign was a man of action; he was not a man of words. Reign's Kubikirihoucho had previously been uprooted from his corpus caecus. At this point, a gust was generated from the arc of his blade, which was delivered promptly in a lateral fashion in an attempt to bifurcate the Raikage should he not be agile enough to perform a dodging maneuver. 

However, even if Reign were to miss, his blade translates back to his person eagerly. If a parry or counter were to ensue in between moves, there would be clear distinction between a rookie's ability and a professional killer's; after all, Reign would not sit down and let himself be hit so simply.* - Sat Oct  3 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reign(Psychic_Warrior) // Eluded by the pesky rabbit, Reign returns his attention to the group. Fortunately, Reign's face of Asura enabled him vision of his target before he had even come close enough to surprise attack him. Reign's body parallels his target's, raising and prompting a defensive barrier in the form of the Kubikirihoucho being raised perpendicular to the ground.

"An impressive feat of yours, to swing that sword so many times in such a small interval of time." Reign commented, aiming to block every strike with the width and span of the Kubikirihoucho.

"Unfortunately, that little toy isn't going to break my Kubikirihoucho."* - Sat Oct  3 05:37:55 2015

"Why do I wish to attack you? That's the talk of a man who does not know the purpose of shinobi. A man who does not realize the money that is to be earned in the art of killing."

He places the blade across his shoulders, in resting position. It wasn't much of a resting position though; a trained eye could tell that Reign was prepared to swing at any moment--the tension in the air was relatively high. 

"Shinobi are tools for killing. I fulfill my role in life by killing people. And I have yet to be killed in return. That is all."* - Sat Oct  3 05:50:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reign(Psychic_Warrior) was distracted by the Gale Palm, minimally though. The Gale Palm breezes over him; Reign is unshaken by the current's approach. His hair is blown. Kuro's words are ignored for the most part, as Reign was being stemmed off from Kuro's attempts at conversation by the incredible combo by Mamoru. His Kubikirihoucho positions to block the left lateral slash.

Suddenly, he is cut on the right side, a lack of speed on his part. 

"He's fast with his swings." Reign thought to himself briefly.

As the somersault swing came, Reign swings his Kubikirihoucho upwards in an attempt to smash the Chakra Saber and have it shatter into a million pieces. * - Sat Oct  3 06:03:31 2015
