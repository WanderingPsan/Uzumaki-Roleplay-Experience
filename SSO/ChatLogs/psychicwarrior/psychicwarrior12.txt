<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yes or no. - Fri Oct 23 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I wouldn't say so. If you follow the bank, as Konoha and Kumogakure did. - Fri Oct 23 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Then that's two major villages under their bank, meaning their currency will become prominent. As money is filtered to and fro. - Fri Oct 23 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The Kazekage told us every village besides Kiri has joined... - Fri Oct 23 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Not to mention they are subordinate under the peace organization treaty. - Fri Oct 23 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Which essentially links three major villages. - Fri Oct 23 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We can still have our own original currency. - Fri Oct 23 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Understood, but when that money starts to go through the Sunagakure bank, then it's only a matter of time until it becomes a country wide currency. That both Konoha and Kumogakure share. - Fri Oct 23 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A three country-wide. - Fri Oct 23 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Seeing as the Gezo don't affect our daily lives, it's safe to be more concerned about a three village alliance. And what if Kirigakure joins, that means all major villages are in cahoots, with Sunagakure at it's head. - Fri Oct 23 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Money..is money.. - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: In the end it's Kirigakure's problem. - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'd say it's more than that. - Fri Oct 23 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Or..he can put in a safety net. - Fri Oct 23 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: They couldn't stop Konoha and Kirigakure. - Fri Oct 23 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Even if Kumogakure and Sunagakure teamed up. They couldn't stop Konoha.  - Fri Oct 23 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Mostly because i'd side with whoever's fighting Suna. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Lord Hokage, all you would have to do is make it clear that you will still be using normal yen as the main source of Konohagakure's currency. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They can convert whatever they wish after it is distributed, but when we accept it. It must be in yen, or ryo. - Fri Oct 23 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You could also deny their bank as a whole. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'd be a bit more fun. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kirigakure is in the worst position for this.. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You'd have to deny the bank as a whole. If you accepted the terms and still tried to maintain your own currency, i'm sure it would be an issue. It wouldn't really mean anything to be under the same bank. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What are you talking about? Of course there'd be a point. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We don't know how they handle their money. If we still wanted to do business with them..it may be needed. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It was just the safer move. I would personally pick to not go with the bank at all.. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // Suddenly, Shinjin brought his arms in a shield-like fashion. His legs bend and he enters a crouching position. Electricity surges within his body, invisible to the naked eye, as it works through his tissue and rapidly revitalizes the speed at which messages are broadcasted from neuron to neuron. Thus, he activates the Lightning Mode - Lexus. 

However, it was invisible to the eye and was not as prominent or threatening. At best, Lexus was an invisible device that could trick an opponent into thinking nothing could happen.

For a real threat to appear, Shinjin had to have a second upgrade.

"Lightning Mode - GTR."

Shinjin brings his arms back down to his waist, as yellow electricity flies around, sparking around his person in a golden sheen of auroric properties. As though to demonstrate its speed, Shinjin disappears in a flicker of yellow light, flashing to the side of the room and back. * - Fri Oct 23 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I should probably go get to training. I'm a little off, after all... Mrm. - Sat Oct 24 22:30:24 2015

However, as he had the realization of who it was that was buried in there, Shinjin's eyebrows narrowed and furrowed into one of anger. He slowly recomposes himself.

He only asks one question.

"What happened?"* - Fri Oct 30 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) keeps on examining the grave, glancing back to Takeda sometime. He didn't understand why she did it. And Shinjin didn't know what he'd do at this point. He had lost the woman he loved and cherished. He was a ninja. A tool though. He sucked up his feelings temporarily. He wasn't a child like Takeda, as smart as Takeda may be. Shinjin had faced up to the cruel and harsh realities of the world. He gulps the last of his saliva down and folds his arms across his chest.

He stands there in silence.* - Fri Oct 30 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) examines Takeda for a moment. "Light coexists with darkness. You don't know which one you're in. When you step forward, you could be in a mix of both. But you'll keep on trudging because life forces you to." Shinjin commented, placing his arms behind his back. "I believe that in Hana's name, we must strive to make Konohagakure the best village possible."* - Fri Oct 30 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) had his hand shaken by Takeda.

"Thank you Takeda. I'll need someone as smart as you and as strong-willed as you for Konohagakure to pull through this. We won't become the next Kumogakure. We shall protect the village to the end and we will be a success." Shinjin muttered. He starts to walk off, cloak flailing madly in the wind.* - Fri Oct 30 02:25:29 2015
