<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: He learned his ABC's well. - Sun Oct 11 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) steps over to Takeda first, since he rose the Ram Handseal first.

"Now then. Let's start." He weaves three handseals. Upon the completion of the final handseal, the genjutsu sequence and trigger had been done, set in stone. Moments later, perhaps a couple more seconds given, Takeda would experience a rise in the temperature in his vicinity. The sky melded and broke to allow entrance to a massive meteorite. Well, not a meteorite--it was more of a massive Fireball.

"Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu." Shinjin stated out.

It was in an attempt to confuse him.

"Now then, surge your chakra rapidly using the Ram Handseal to use Kai."* - Sun Oct 11 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) bit his lip and decided not to scream at the pain of his balls being squeezed.* - Sun Oct 11 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Okay, okay, my bad! - Sun Oct 11 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sooo, you broke the promise. - Sun Oct 11 03:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at her breasts. He widened his eyes and his eyebrows narrowed. He steps over to the plates and nodded. 

"Yeah... I guess..." He walks over to the plates and decides to fix them as she asked.* - Sun Oct 11 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) found his ass patted. He didn't really like the feeling, but it had to be done for the forgiveness of Hana. He looks up at the ceiling and sighed.

"I think...I'll take B."* - Sun Oct 11 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: B? - Sun Oct 11 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Haha, good choice. - Sun Oct 11 03:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Heh. - Sun Oct 11 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) couldn't touch her. He was bound by laws. Damnit.

He rose his eyebrows as his dick grew hard.

"I .... uhhh.... steak?"* - Sun Oct 11 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances to the side. He had his dick poked and he felt a bit more played with than he wanted to be. He sighs. "Damnit. HOW MANY DAYS IS THIS GOING TO LAST?"* - Sun Oct 11 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Also, should've have never said my name, Zeus.~ - Sun Oct 11 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at the side.

"He doesn't remember!" Shinjin stated.* - Sun Oct 11 04:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Sun Oct 11 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) bit his lip. He places his hands on the side of the bed, setting his gaze on her.

"You're going to make me go crazy."* - Sun Oct 11 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: .................... - Sun Oct 11 04:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) was kissed on the neck.

"I'm alright, I'm alright." Shinjin grunted. He was trying to think of loopholes to this game.* - Sun Oct 11 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She's tempting me... - Sun Oct 11 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Waaay too much. - Sun Oct 11 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Hah, and he's suppose to be the man? He could've touched me all along, if he was rough, instead of a wuss. - Sun Oct 11 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: But I admire that, he is listening to me and accepting my punishment. A bit more, and I can drive him off edge. - Sun Oct 11 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) shudders as he felt her breasts along his back. Shinjin slowly takes a deep breath. His right hand runs along the zipper of his vest and takes it off briefly. "Know what...? I can't take any more of this." Shinjin stated. He turns around to face Hana and his left hand reaches to grasp hold of her waist. He'd push her onto the bed and he'd plant a kiss on her lips, pressing her to the bed. * - Sun Oct 11 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) bit his lip. "Yeah. About time." Shinjin stated. "I mean, you didn't think I'd last all that time when you were stripped naked in front of me like the beautiful thing you were."Shinjin shouted. "Looking like the sexiest thing in my life and you think I wouldn't have a reaction. You're going to pay for this with my sexual frustration." Shinjin murmured. "That frustration for the past few minutes and that torment." He stated, yanking off his vest. He pulls down his pants.

His boner was hard as all hell, rigid and all the way pointing towards her. Shinjin pushes her further on the bed and he presses his dick again the entrance to her asshole this time. 

"I think I'll try this hole today."* - Sun Oct 11 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // He pulled up ontop of the bed. His knees were on the bed and he reared his lower half back behind Hana. His cock's head presses against the entrance to her asshole and slowly, the head of his dick entered. However, Shinjin wasn't so gentle this time. He was much more rough. His cock started to burrow its way inside of Hana's asshole. His left and right hand grabbed onto her tits and began to milk them. 

He starts to press her against the bed, pushing her down on the bed to the point that he was practically humping her at his maximum speed. 

"Fuck yeah, fuck, fuck. You bad, naughty girl. Looks like I, as the King, have to punish you."* - Sun Oct 11 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) kept on humping her, pushing his thick, meaty member inside of her again and again. He repeatedly pounded her entrance and his testicles kept bouncing to smack against her asscheeks. His left hand and right hand surged with electricity, letting loose a control loss technique to have her orgasm. 

He leaned over her body and bit down on her shoulder weakly, just to mix pain with pleasure and have her perhaps rolling her eyes from the ecstasy of the sexual experience. Shinjin was beginning to sweat profusely, but that wouldn't stop him from fucking her asshole until her legs couldn't move.

"By the time I'm done with your punishment..." He pants in between words. "You won't even be able to walk properly." Shinjin shouted, determined to keep on fucking her at full throttle, sounds emitting loudly from each time his pelvis smacked against her.* - Sun Oct 11 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) kept on fucking her relentlessly, plowing into her like a beast. His hands gripped her breasts and started to fondle them some more, to play with her large assets. His right hand reared back briefly just to spank her harshly on her asscheek. He yanked his cock out of her asshole just for a moment. He stuffs her pussy afterwards, thrusting his long dick inside of her vagina to give some loving to her other hole too.

Even beyond her orgasm, Shinjin would bring her to numerous climaxes. He kept on fucking her, moving his hips back and forth repeatedly and jamming her inside stuffed with his long dick. He breathed heavily as he fucked her. 

"I'm going to cum soon. Fuck." Shinjin muttered. "You've been using those breasts of yours to torment me, how about you use those breasts to massage the little King in between my legs, you naughty Queen." Shinjin demanded, pulling his cock out of her pussy and offering it to her.* - Sun Oct 11 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) had pounded both her pussy and her asshole by that point, having her orgasm out of pure pleasure and ecstasy that was running down her body.

He realized how fast she turned around. He groaned loudly as his cock was placed in between her breasts and was titjobbed. He bit his lip. "Fuck!" His precum was tasted and he felt unrivalled sensations running down his dick and throughout his body. He couldn't take it anymore and had to cum. 

He came inside of her mouth first, spurting out a rope of semen inside of her mouth to coat her mouth a sticky white. He'd pull his cock out and then proceed to layer her tits and her stomach in white, as well as the rest of her face.* - Sun Oct 11 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) forced out all of his semen inside of Hana's mouth. He deposited his cum and had filled her mouth up to the brim with his love juices. He slowly pulled out and noticed how much she had contained.

As she swallowed it and licked up the cum, Shinjin grabbed onto her waist. He laid down beside Hana and pulled her into a hug.

"I'm surprised you took it so well."* - Sun Oct 11 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm. Why not kiss me lips? - Sun Oct 11 06:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) grabs a menu and slides it over to Ambrocio's side of the table casually.* - Sun Oct 11 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Nor have we really talked, eh? - Sun Oct 11 19:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) reaches for another spare menu. He props it against the edge of the table and opens it. His eyes glance at the menu from time to time as he examines what he'd like to order from its table of contents.

"Training the Genin is as easy as ever. They're learning basic things. Suimen and Kai. Chakra control." 

He stated calmly. "Missions been going well for you?"* - Sun Oct 11 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I haven't been given much. I don't think Hideki appreciates me helping the others, for obvious reasons. I've been moving rubble. Meh.. - Sun Oct 11 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Moving rubble is a job on its own though, with the destruction and all. - Sun Oct 11 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Plus, you're probably one of the only guys who would survive if something broke and fell on you. - Sun Oct 11 19:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It'll cost a lot. - Sun Oct 11 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He's going to need that filled if he ever plans on rebuilding the manor.. - Sun Oct 11 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: True. - Sun Oct 11 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) had ordered similar to Ambrocio, deciding that he would order an eight ounce steak as well. He was eating light, but it was also apparent that Shinjin might be eating a bit unhealthy since he wasn't including the greens either in his meal.

He did order a side of barbecue sauce, which also meant that he was gearing towards that unhealthy side.

"And you used something strange yourself. I've never seen it before---well, from the lycanthropes I have. But yours is oddly distinct from theirs." He replied, understanding they were delving into each other's tactics and styles of combat.* - Sun Oct 11 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) observes Ambrocio's reaction.

"Embarassing people is one of my most interesting jutsu at least.." He chuckled gently. He places his elbow on the table and his free hand grips onto a glass of water set down by a waiter earlier
.
"Last one remaining huh? A survivor story."* - Sun Oct 11 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // Having his grip set on the water glass, Shinjin brought it up to his lips for the refreshing water to run down his esophagus. The food had arrived shortly after; the waiter dropped the food in front of both Ambrocio and him so that they could enjoy it. The cutlery and the other materials were on the sides of the plate. 

"Sand engulfed them huh? Sunagakure, probably. They're always filled with it." Shinjin stated, as he drank water. He puts the glass back on the table and proceeds to slice into the steak.

"You're a lot more smarter than the rest of your kind, I'm sure. Since you didn't die." He glances to the side as he eats.

"My runner up in terms of techniques? You'll figure that one out."* - Sun Oct 11 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) nods.

"Angry as others, huh?" He saws off a piece and begins to eat. "Your anger can't be compared to them, anywho. To the average joe." His voice was slightly muffled from chewing.

"I'm not in any clan myself. I'm just from Konoha. Was a Genin six years ago--now look at me---I'm a Jounin." He chuckled. "Funny how things work."* - Sun Oct 11 20:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Because close-combat is unavoidable. - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A roundhouse kick towards the lower-end of your opponent, then followed by a higher kick. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's supposed to mimic a hurricane. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, I've learned a bit of it before from something. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then I want you both to mimic me. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: First, observe. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Keep in mind that you don't want to reveal you're aiming for a second kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You force a good amount of pressure in the first kick to make them assume it was the kick you put all your power in. - Mon Oct 12 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And then you transition into your second kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You'll figure it out by watching--both of you are smart. - Mon Oct 12 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) inhales deeply initially. Shinjin enters a traditional Taijutsu stance by dragging his right foot backwards. Quickly, Shinjin transitions from his stance to a lower-position by bringing his head downwards. He bends at the waist and leaps forward, swinging his right foot in a whirlwind-like fashion. Simultaneously, his right hand finds itself planted against the ground to provide balance and leverage on the supposed target, as well as to provide a smooth transition into the second stage of the technique; should he have just slid on the ground like a breakdancer, viable openings were present. 

After the first strike that was clearly positioned towards the lower end, on Shinjin's second turnabout, his legs are motioned towards the upper region of a supposed imaginary faux body. Shinjin then regains himself by swinging his body backwards so that his legs slide across the dirt and reposition in a v-shaped manner. He then pushes back with his right hand, still firmly planted on the ground, to regain his positioning. 

Notably, his right hand had been spinning during this motion; it was easier to spin his right hand on the sand. In different scenarios, to a genius's eye, the spininng motion using the right hand would be difficult; for example, using it in a location where the ground wasn't smooth and able to be parted so easily.* - Mon Oct 12 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: At the same time, you can use this technique in the opposite fashion. - Mon Oct 12 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: By bringing it to the higher end first. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: The reason why I use the low kick first is because traditionally, the Leaf Whirlwind is common. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Therefore, you'll notice many people starting with the high kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It makes it too predictable. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: By starting with the supposed end movement and then transitioning into the supposed first movement, you trick your opponent. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That's all there is to it. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try both ways though, so that you get practice. - Mon Oct 12 00:06:24 2015
