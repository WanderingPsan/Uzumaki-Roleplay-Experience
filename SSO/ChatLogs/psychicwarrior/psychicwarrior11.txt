<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: Be careful here, This is where my bestfriend was cut to pieces. - Tue Oct 20 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ---- - Tue Oct 20 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ......... - Tue Oct 20 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Asian people though.... - Tue Oct 20 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) shakes his head.* - Tue Oct 20 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances at Muhhamed. Along Shinjin were Takeda and Hana. Hana was probably the respective to Katsune, in terms of company. His eyes settle their gaze on Muhhamed in finality, as he steps over to face him directly.

"Thank you for your reception." He briskly says.* - Tue Oct 20 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Guess He's busy. - Tue Oct 20 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) follows Muhhamed in the meantime, taking in the sights rather lightly. He didn't really care enough for them. The statue was nice, in comparison to the old Oshino statue they had in Konoha. That too, was broken though, so in reality, Konohagakure lacked a proper statue. They lacked a monument, as well. Perhaps Shinjin would get the mountains behind the mansion to be carved out with the faces of the Hokage.

That'd be a nice tradition.* - Tue Oct 20 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) folds his arms on his chest.

"Yes. Currently, I am in a treaty with Kumogakure. Trade and whatnot. So, I'm wondering what my treaty with Kumogakure may entail should I join this treaty. Explain to me the details."* - Tue Oct 20 00:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But if you don't join the bank, trading with these nations will be impossible. - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Because your currency will be void. - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Plus if you join early, your nation will become richer. - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I see. - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: So you're changing the currency. - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It's that simple. - Tue Oct 20 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It works like any other bank. - Tue Oct 20 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then I'll accept the deal of entering the National Bank. - Tue Oct 20 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Lastly. - Tue Oct 20 00:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Really late.. - Tue Oct 20 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So lets work out a deal. - Tue Oct 20 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Mhmmm. - Tue Oct 20 01:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) glances on the table for a writing utensil. Should he find one, Shinjin would read the contents of the treaty first, and sign if it was appropriate. 

Though, he does let Takeda glance at the treaty first, as though letting him confirm.* - Tue Oct 20 01:06:59 2015
