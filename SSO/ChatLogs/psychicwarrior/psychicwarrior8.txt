<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nonsense. We're going against the Kage- we'll need every bit of teamwork and help we can get. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Anyways. Before we talk any further, lets go outside. - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: We got this, Takeda. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright? - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm by your side, come on. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Fine. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // It was fairly impressive that they decided to start off with the transformation. Each of them were doing handseals too.

Shinjin isn't an idiot. They were doing the handseals for the Kawarimi no Jutsu, which was perfectly fine. His eyes scatter over to Ketsuki to see what she was doing, as the perpetrator and commander of the strategy at hand. Unfortunately though, Shinjin may quite literally have a decade of experience in combat in comparison to those he was going to be facing off against.

"Well then. Show me what you can do." Suddenly, he runs through three handseals. These three handseals were for a unique technique. He slams his hand on the ground and suddenly ejects a massive spray of electricity to strike Takeda, Hana, Ambrocio, and Ketsuki. 

He was most vigilant about Ketsuki. Perhaps she set up a Kawarimi outside of the academy? Who knows. However, if she didn't, she might be quite the target.

"Lightning Tempest."* - Fri Oct 16 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: IM DEAD - Fri Oct 16 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: W-Would this be counted as a mission reward?! - Fri Oct 16 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) smirks. "Yeah. Perhaps. Well, you guys are doing well so far. I wonder how well you'll be able to handle this though." Shinjin leaps into the air rather abruptly. His eyes were on Ketsuki and Ambrocio though. Perhaps Shinjin didn't want to target Hana and Takeda for some strange reason.

However, he was also more trusting of Ambrocio. Even if he unleashed a high level technique, he would restrain it and make sure their safety was not in jeopardy.

"Flash Fire." Shinjin muttered. Suddenly, a steady current of senbon flood out of a small ring that forms around both of his hands, as they cup together. Senbons fly out, tens at a time, numbering up to several hundred at this point as they spread out rapidly with enough aim to target their entire area.* - Fri Oct 16 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She uses her brain well. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She knows that metal conducts electricity. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: However, that doesn't compensate for the force and pressure that is added onto these electric constructs. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: It'll absorb a couple and be blown away from excess force. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: If she had a shield of metal though, that could ground itself. . . .  - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She'd have effectively countered me. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: If only I was faster... and could throw more of these... Tch. - Fri Oct 16 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Damn, Shinjin looks so good from behind. - Fri Oct 16 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Okay, just.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Stay out of Ambro-Sensei's line of sight, now. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Just stay /out of his fucking way/.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // Ambrocio had successfully shielded Ketsuki from the strike. Shinjin grinned. As expected, of the Chuunin representative of Konohagakure. Hana's movements were also far too quick for Shinjin to so easily notice. "Tch. She's really fast. I expect such skill from her though." He chuckled.

He proceeds to tackle on the concept of the other three. However, he first dashes to the third bell, standing in front of it to make it more difficult for them to access it. Additionally, Shinjin prepares handseals. He was targeting Hana this time.

"Mist Servant Jutsu." Suddenly, thousands of Shinjins would appear from almost nowhere, as though he had used a massive clone Jutsu. * - Fri Oct 16 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // It was very impressive. Ambrocio was directing his anger and channeling his energy towards handling Shinjin. It was the right disposition. He shudders briefly, but shakes it off. Shinjin's years of experience were not in vain; he wasn't going to be scared because of a transformation that made Ambrocio -look- monstrous. There was a big difference between being monstrous and looking the part. 

Shinjin's aware though. Ketsuki's movements were clever, but mostly they appeared to be preventive measures from damage from collaterals that Ambrocio may ensue. Shinjin shifts his gear in a brief moment.

Hana was moving towards the wall. Shinjin knew he could not handle Ambrocio easily, unless he awakened his primal instinct.

"Ruthless Violence." Shinjin murmured. Suddenly, his posture roughens. His face grows in tune with the feral nature of his original combat style. His right fist is launched immediately, fiercely outcompeting the sluggish movement that was his fist. His right fist aimed to smash itself into Ambrocio's sternum and completely halt his movement. His right foot attempts to smash itself atop of Ambrocio's foot, stomping on his foot, disabling movement, and giving Shinjin a presentable opportunity by rooting him in place.

His left hand aimed to grab hold of Ambrocio by the Chuunin Vest and toss him right into the wall behind himself, to crush the wall and ruin Hana's attempts of running up the wall.* - Fri Oct 16 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yo. - Fri Oct 16 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ambrocio handle ossa for me - Fri Oct 16 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // Quickly, after handling Ambrocio, Shinjin approaches Hana. With quick speed and easy movement, Shinjin reacts to Hana's movements.

Hana was fast. However, it was a speed that Shinjin apparently could handle. "You're very fast, Hana. However, you have to work on your speed more if you want to outpace me that easily!" Shinjin stated. His fist flies out at her, though reverts to a palm thrust after a moment. He pushes outwards in an attempt to smack her right into the flowerpot, perhaps knocking her out or leaving her in a daze. 

He didn't focus on Ketsuki, who was still hiding under the crook of the staircase.* - Fri Oct 16 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Guess this is over. - Fri Oct 16 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) lifts his eyebrows.

"You were very close to winning, at least."* - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hmph. - Fri Oct 16 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) smiles lightly. He glances over at Ambrocio, who was falling asleep.

"Wake up teddy bear-kun."

He steps over to Ambrocio. His right hand attempts to grip his chest and send a current of electricity down Ambrocio's body, perhaps making him climax by doing so.

Just for fun.* - Fri Oct 16 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ew. - Fri Oct 16 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) pushes Ambrocio back.

"Clean up Ambrocio. We have training later."* - Fri Oct 16 02:57:55 2015
