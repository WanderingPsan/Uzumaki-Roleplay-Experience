<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) nodded. "Relax. I don't plan on doing anything more." Reguel stated. His hand aims to grip Yan's fingers, wrapping around them and clasping his hand with his. He decided to start off slow though, in the arm wrestle. It was more to test Yan's physical power.

"Alright, don't hold back on me." Reguel stated. "Go." He applies pressure, starting gradual at first.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) applies the pressure against Yan's hand. He realizes that he was still overpowering Yan slightly. However, he was fine. The goal wasn't to show off. It was simply to train. Plus, Reguel could use a hand in learning to control his strength. He aims to standstill with Yan briefly, slowly tugging at him back and forth to try and push him back.

"You aren't that bad."* - Thu Oct  8 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) nods quietly. Slowly, he forcibly pushes down Yan's hand and gradually descends it with the application of both pressure and the assistance of gravity by his side. Reguel's hand pushes Yan's hand down and succeeds in winning the arm wrestling competition. Reguel removes his hand from Yan's afterwards.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Usually spars start with them further away..I suppose I should challenge myself. - Thu Oct  8 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) smiles. "Well, thank you very much." Reguel stated. He runs through a sequence of three handseals. His right hand slams the ground suddenly. A current of electricity stems through the ground, deriving from the palm of his hand and surging through the sands of Sunagakure's plains. The electricity from the ground aimed to electrocute Yan from the bottom and tap into his heels. 

Upon the execution, Reguel wasted little time in getting closer to Yan too.* - Thu Oct  8 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) // // The Water-Style Raging Waves technique. It was a pretty common technique, something that Reguel had seen at least once in his life. He takes the Water Jutsu head-on. However, Reguel didn't just stand down. His electricity runs through the ground at this point. His hand's motion was being blocked by the water. 

Because Yan's water came from his mouth and had splashed onto Reguel from the front, it was likely that Yan's own water blocked Yan's eyes from witnessing the electricity surging within Reguel's hand and his aim to smash it into the sand. When the sand was electrocuted, he'd electrocute Yan's footing and cause his nerve tissue to stiffen, resulting in perhaps harder to act upon movement. 

Should that be the case, Reguel pumps through and attempts to slam a roundhouse kick into Yan's side, nothing too hard so that he didn't hurt his partner.* - Thu Oct  8 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) observes the handseal. Now that Shadow Clones, or whatever were being formed, Reguel had additional reason to be a bit more wary. Howver, Reguel performs once more. His handseals are rapid in their execution and his hand aims to press the ground. 

At least, that's what it looks like. It is a feint. He attempts to lull Yan into the assumption that the electricity was aimed to the ground. He leaps into the air, smashing the ground with his hand and using both of his legs to leap high into the air above his opponent.

Yan's water may have been better. Reguel was an expert in handling tough defenses, especially those of Doton Users.

"An Earth Ninjutsu elementalist.." He grinned. Inside, he was giddy that he was going to get the opportunity to show off his electrical prowess.

"Flash Fire." He creates a circle with his hands, rounding them, before firing off hundreds of Senbon towards the Earth Clones aiming to disperse them before the ninjutsu could be completed, as well as damage Yan.* - Thu Oct  8 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // The senbon raze through the stones as they came to obstruct their path. Shinjin drops on the ground afterwards, zooming forward in tandem with his senbons, as they bombarded Yan and his five clones. 

Sure, there was now a construct around his person. That didn't seem to bother Shinjin that much. Shinjin was talented in electricity: electricity was going to solve his dilemma in terms of fighting and derailing the Earth Ninjutsu from being any effect.

Shinjin's hands join together to consecutively form three handseals. His electricity aims to disintegrate the construct of earth that was only directly in front of him.

Not only that, but the electricity would pass through the Earthen Corridor and zoom through the ground. Because Yan could not see Shinjin within the Earthen Corridor, Shinjin presumed Yan would have greater difficulty countervailing the attempt at electrocution via the ground, thereby conjoining the electrical effects of both standards from the sky and from the ground.* - Thu Oct  8 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) // A wealth of water indeed. It was very impressive, at least from Shinjin's point of view. Shinjin had heard the water streaming along the surface before he had even seen it, awkwardly enough. This one was definitely a Raging Waves technique. 

Shinjin begins to storm through the water as it begins to drain. Electrocution flooded through his body and debilitated Shinjin. To an extent, at least. Shinjin's body was reinforced. Epithelial tissue on his body was almost as durable as steel, rivalling perhaps even the toughest of magnesium-reinforced titanium alloys. Shinjin proceeds through the waves and crashed the ground, uprooting himself from the wake of the currents, and aiming to land next to Yan's body. 

As his clones were destroyed and he was now alone, Shinjin aimed to grab him by the shoulder.

"I'd say that it's enough for now. Good spar."

Shinjin did have to compliment him--Yan had used electricity to empower his own water. It was a strategy many had used before against Shinjin, but Yan's strategy to use a water tank at the same time was also what caught Shinjin off guard and had preoccupied his attention.* - Thu Oct  8 04:57:23 2015

Tetsumi spoke gently. His eyes wander towards Izutora, who had positioned himself to his left. His eyes thus wander to Ambrocio, as though grabbing a sense of the fight. People were moving around in convenient locations. Perhaps a gank was ensuing. 

It doesn't matter whether Hideki activated his Mangekyou or not. In a burst of lightning fast speed, Tetsumi zoomed towards Hideki, eyes centered on his stomach. His right hand pulled back and aimed to thrust itself into Hideki's stomach, perhaps caving it inwards and breaking his stomach cavity.

"Sekken." He muttered softly. * - Thu Oct  8 22:40:38 2015

His skin was darker than white, much more. The male rests his eyes on the two assailants. "Enough of this." His right hand jets towards his opponent Hideki. His right hand aims to grip onto Hideki's chest. With their close proximity and the speed of his hand, it was inevitable that he may get struck.

"Both of you, remove yourselves. Or else suffer more consequences than you already face."

He stated. His free hand aimed to intercept the blade, perhaps being cut in the process but also gripping onto Kojiro.

If both were gripped, he'd release his chakra.

"Control Loss Technique." He'd aim to have them release their bladders in public and remove their will to fight. * - Thu Oct  8 22:57:42 2015

Isshin prepared three handseals in the meantime though, perhaps meaningfully at least. Isshin's hands roll in order to complete his handseals and he stays stationary, waiting for the scorpion mother that may near them. He stayed behind Koji, believing him to be the safest and most viable asset.* - Fri Oct  9 04:22:49 2015

Maybe the baby ones wouldn't register the genjutsu, but surely the father had to! Isshin's genjutsu floods out in the form of a dissipated wave of chakra that moves in a cone-like fashion to entrap the scorpion within its confines, stunning it in terms of its mentality and deteriorating its mental vigor. * - Fri Oct  9 04:29:39 2015
