<br><font color=yellow>*Takumo(Infinite Swag) || It was a cool day in Konoha. The weather was cool, the humidity was low. By the calm streets, there was a house expelling smoke. By the house, there was a group of fat people doing a pretty much cool barbecue. The smell was great. Big hamburgers were located in the grill, and by the side, a lot of bread pieces. An old fat guy was located taking care of the food, Takumo's father.

In the central table, Takumo was sat, reading a taijutsu performance book. He was the only active Akimichi, making him not that bad. He still had the power inhetered by his clan traits, just not that fat. Snacking some nachos, he was looking at the stances that the book was showing with good designed pictures.

The smell of the hamburguers was taking control of the yard. Takumo's father grabbed the hamburguers, and put them in the bread. Placing two pieces of cheese, and covering them with another the another part of the bread. The old guy put them inside a plate, and placed it ontop of the table, saying: "We'll get hard ninjutsu training if you eat all of those ten cheeseburgers." Takumo had a brainstorm, but a disgusting face. He was trying to be different, doing diets and such, but he usually never succeded.

Grabbing on the chesseburgers, he openned his mouth a little bit, and snacking it once. Feeling the fat of the meat, his head started to spin from the inside. He couldn't disguise his Akimichi hunger. He quickly tossed it all, and chewed it in a rush. Feeling the great pleasure, he tossed more five cheseburgers, with his mouth wide openned.

The food dropped to his stomach, and started to be disgested. He stared at the four left burguers, with a OGODWHY face. He thought he couldn't let the training fail, and put three cheseburgues one top of another, and tossed them all at his open mouth. Eating it quickly to hide the horrofying feeling, he started to have a really bad face. He started to sweat hardly on the side of his forehead, and thinking of the awesome training he'd have.

Staring deeply at the last cheeseburguers and it's contents, he grabbed it, and put it on his mouth, entirely. This wasn't a good idea. He felt the previously eaten food starting to come out, rubbing his belly with his right hand. He chewed it quickly like a machine, and put it in. He stood on the chair for a good time, silent and staring at the nothingness, trying to do not vomit. After some minutes, he managed to get up, walking to his dad, with the empty plate on hand. As soon as his father noticed the plate, he said: "Get ready." Takumo grinned with half of his mouth, looking sorta awkward inside...*

As soon as his father noticed the plate, he said: "Get ready." Takumo grinned with half of his mouth, looking sorta awkward inside...

He left the yard, following his father to the training ground. Arriving at the place, he stood in front of his father, staring at his eyes deeply. "Well, I'll teach you the first technique derived from the Expansion Jutsu, the Human Boulder jutsu. You simply turn into a ball and release chakra from your four members, spinning with incredible speed. You can make your hair turn into spikes and hurts them all if experience!" His father's words were clear.

"I'll give you an example son." The Akimichi started to channalize chakra around his body, increasing the flush of it through the chakra system. Suddenly, the side of the guy increased, turning into a ball-like form. The mass of meat started to spin with incredible speed, and hitting a wall of rocks. It started to pierce through the wall, passing to the other side. "That how you do it." His father said, cleaning his clothing.

The boy walked forward, staring at the other side of the wall of rocks, that was still idle. He performed the tiger handseal for help, and started to channalize his chakra through his whole body. His mass suddenly bulged, turning into a great ball of meat. His clothes turned bigger too. Now he was wondering how he could spin like his father did.

Wondering at his ball form, the kid had an idea. He started to channalize chakra on the surface of his ball shape, controlling it to spin expelling chakra at the holes made when he retracted his arms and legs. The shaped form of chakra made his spin with great speed, hitting the wall with great force. It started to remove pieces of the wall, dropping them by the ground.

Looking like he wasn't going to pierce through the wall, Takumo remembered of something his father used to do it: the hair. His father's hair was spiky, being controlled by chakra to stand this way. In no time, the guy channalized chakra on his hair, with a circular motion with a tendention to the north. It turned really spiky and hard, coming out of the ball.

The wall soon started to crash, dropping it's contents on the ground. Takumo released the jutsu next to his father, landing in front of him. "I guess I did it..." said the kid, with a grin on his face. The walked back to the clan district, awaiting the next cheeseburguers.

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) was going home with his father after learning the Human Boulder jutsu, feeling a bit starved. He started to think of his father's food. The plate filled with cooked pork, chicken... Another plate of spaghetti, and a lot of soda. The brainstorm was so big that he started to feel the smell of the food. The anxiousity was enormous, making his stomach growl. His father looked at it for a second, with a grin on his face, then looked forward again.

Takumo began to remember about his childhood. He was pretty dedicated at school, but never had a mother, since he died when he was born. His father was always there when the academy classes were finished, and always asked all Takumo got skill and grade-wise. His father never had a lot of complication, though, since Takumo was the smartest person of the class. Takumo kicked a rock and almost fell for a second, but recovered the balance, and continued his brainstorming.

The hard days of training he had to learn ninjutsu and taijutsu. Even in the cold weather, he was there, with his father, training how to become stronger on his kekkei genkai. Takumo trained taijutsu secretly, since he wanted to be different and common at the same time. The kid was able to mix both strenght and ninjutsu effect, making his fatass clan jutsus stronger.

The cold breeze passed by Takumo's clothing. The kid stopped brainstorm, and was now concentrated on the surrounding. It was winter in that day. The trees were frozen, the ground seemed a little tricky. The sun was hidden behind the cold clouds. A black flash passed in front of him with incredible speed, as his father put his left hand in front of Takumo's body, blocking the way.

His father's eyebrows were narrowed. Something was awkward there. A concealed figure appeared in front of them, with black torn robes. He grabbed a kunai from his pouch, and put it in front of his body, showing a stance and a murderous intention. That was the great time for Takumo to shine.

The kid channalized chakra through his whole body, stuffing mass-wise. His arms and legs were retracted, expelling chakra. The ball formed kid started to spin with incredible speed. His hair turned into spikes, increasing the effectiveness of the attack. He rolled towards the concealed figure to try to stop him quickly. When he got closer, his father appeared in front of him using the same jutsu. They hit eachother, knocking back.

As Takumo's father motioned to make him leave, the concealed figure, being a skilled figure, threw the kunai aiming at Takumo's father's back. As soon as Takumo started to run away, and his father turned to the concealed figure's side, the evil man started to perform a severies of handseals. Looking back while running, Takumo was trying to be aware of what was happening. When the guy stopped performing the handseals, the kunai multiplied itself, leaving no time of response to Takumo's father.

The scene was horrible. Takumo's only friend, was now... dropped dead. Tears started to drip from his eyes, showing the desperation. Takumo quickly changed his way, heading to the concealed figure. He grabbed four shuriken, and threw them at the guy's direction. When the concealed figure was busy trying to avoid them, the kid, filled with anger, channalize chakra through his body again, turning into his ball-like mode. He rolled towards the guy, and used a rock to jump on the air, and landed on top of him. His spiky hair started to cut the guy apart, turning his flesh into pure blood.

Turning back to normal, he fell next to his father's corpse, staring deeply at his blank eyes. Tears started to drip again, turning instantly into frozen liquid before hitting the ground.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) tosses the guy by the fence.*

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Genjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Don't know anything about it and if I ever get hit by one I'll probably be defeated without any resistance.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I can't help with that...
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Then Taijutsu.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (genius trait)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I'll need to finish training a Jutsu of mine.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Named?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not finished yet.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: You have water?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Me too.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I got Fire and Water, though.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i dun want chakra ne more)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (ffs, you cant lolswitch perks)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (can i have massive strenght ?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (no)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (why)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: What do you want help with it?
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked around on the training ground while his now newly made Sensei by the Hokage-Sama him/herself was watching him. '' Alright, I'll get my notebook out and start reading the instructions. '' , he blinked a few times while placing his hand in a backpouch, inside was a small book with notes that he flipped open and began to read.

'' Alrighty then. '' , Harada stretched his legs and closed his eyes, slowly gathering up Chakra inside of his body as he performed the Ram seal, thinking about a wide flood of water that could reach about four meters infront of him and three meters wide, he stayed focussed as he channeled the Chakra towards his mouth.

With the next handseal he turned the Chakra into water, as it became to what seemed more of a puking manner then a spitting manner, he wasn't used to this and needed to get some experience until he could do it without barfing his organs out of his mouth. 

Now infront of him laid a two meter wide and three meter long flood of slippery water, he showed improvement but it wasn't sticky yet, it couldn't stick the oponent to the ground and corner him/her into a trap with this. '' Damn, I still need to work on it some more. '' , he said to himself.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Just 2 more Rp's :S )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's getting close.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (thats more than 2 rps)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (1 rp = 6 lines)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :S Nah. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u got a lot tho)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (Trin just told us)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I make Para's :S )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i'm telling that)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u made more than 2 rps on this)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (didnt u say u needed 3?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I made 4 Rps with 3 Paras. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( And this one with 4. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( :l )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( 7 in total. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (how many do u need?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( So 2 more Rps. )
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (4x3=12)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (+4=16)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (u got 16 rps)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: ((World)(Malcolm1rock)(Genin D+)Sotokon: How many lines are considred 1 rp?
(World)(Typhlosion101)(Genin D+)Sashi: ^
(World)(Malcolm1rock)(Genin D+)Sotokon: Cause you guys made a req. didn't you?
(World)(Trinity606)(Chuunin C+)Yamanaka, Suzy: at least 6-7
)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: ((( D-rank = 5 rps | C-Rank = 9 | B-rank = 10 | A-Rank = 15 | Kinjutsu = 25 ) 
))
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked through the water as he felt his shoes getting wet, it didn't feel that nice to him knowing that he barfed it out himself, but he was glad to know that his jutsu was finnaly getting somewhere. He rubbed his chin and walked back to his regular spot now staring at the left side. '' Alright, now I'll add in the Sticky part of the jutsu. ''

Harada began to close his eyes while charging his Chakra into one single point, his stomache was overflowing with focussed mental and physical energy as he made the Ram seal once again, he followed it up with a Tiger seal immideatly and made the Chakra flow up inside of his neck as he imagined a pool of water spewing outside of his mouth that could stick anything to it like gum or glue.

'' Water Style : Starch Syrup Capturing! '' , Haru chanted the name of the Jutsu while shooting out the syrup like water infront of him, it was a smaller pool then he imagined, it didn't take much Chakra out of him at all. He now knew that he had actually already finished it, he only needed to put in a bit more Chakra. '' Alright, next time I'll finish it. '' *
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Great job.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: I'm waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Just a little more, wait a little bit.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: And you'll see it finished!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (Do I really need 2 rps to learn a jutsu...)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (owait its c rank)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (i need 6)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) grinned at Takumo, the boy grabbed a shuriken out of his holster and aimed it at his left cheeck, as he swung it towards him but making it just far enough from the cheeck to not make any actual harm. He hoped for him to jump to the right and fall into his trap, he needed to see if his Jutsu was ready to be used in battle so he estimated his jumping power and clenched his hands into fists.

'' Ram! '' , Haru chanted the word while performing the hand seal and thinking of his Chakra being put into a large pool of syrup that would be able to stick anything it touched to the ground, he took a deep breath as he poured in a good amount of Chakra this time to make it bigger then the last one.  He stared at Takumo, hoping that he did jump into his trap.

Once more the boy made a hand seal and this time it was the ' Tiger ' seal, he made a form with his hands resembling the Ram, while opening his mouth barely to let a spray of Syrup shoot out of it, like a fast flooding fountain, aimed at a four meter lenght and three meters wide area infront of him, if Takumo landed in the Syrup then his feet would be stuck ontop of it unless he had Chakra on them before connecting with the Syrup. If he added Chakra to his feet after connecting then it would already be to late.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) jumped to the right trying to dodge the weapon, falling into the guy's trap. He quickly noticed his feet being trapped by the water, mentioning: "Good trick, boy." The fat dude channalized chakra into his feet area, expanding it, and releasing the trap.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Great jutsu is this one.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hehe.
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) || His shit would hit the ground.*
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: So.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: You just create the water with chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Spit it on the water.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: And what?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not as easy as it sounds.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: You also need to make it sticky.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: It's not easy to explain.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Tell me what you do.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I imagine a sticky Syrup like water coming out of my mouth through the use of Chakra that turns into that.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: That's practically it.
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (Do u have monstrous strength perk?)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: (no)
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (K)

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) follows meating away.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed as the Genin bum-rushed him. Bringing the parrallel arm that mimiced Saishi's up he attempted to slap his hand away. If he succeded he would then used his opposite arm, opening his fist into a palm and attempt to fire said palm into the Genin's chest. If he connected it would push the Genin back to the point of stumbling over.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You'ld end up like Rose lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Juu wanna end up like Rose?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) begins to do a string of handseals. He then finishes with a roar. "Katon: Goukakyuu!!" He exclaims as he releases a huge fireball. The gigantic ball of fire would be aimed at hitting the ground in between the many shinobi present. If they don't dodge it would hit them and cause a great amount of damage.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (AND AKAMICHI NUB NEEDS TO GET OUTTA HERE)

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) ran by the mountains, looking for Suzy.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And it takes more then one palm to paralyze.)
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) says: Too late...

<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: J.s)
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) hesitates a moment, not being from this village. "Should I got with him...?" He thought for a moment. Thinking of the hostile situation, he nodded and tried to run off with Evan.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) le leave.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Damn...

<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: We must continue!
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: ...Evan?
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Nrmmm... What about you, big man?
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) pronounced "big" in a manner that sounded like "fat"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) ignores the dumb nigga that called him fat.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Hmmm... You are right, I should not be so mean!
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: I should be nice as a guest of this village!

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) still ignores.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: Have at you!!!
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) slowly enters his Hachimon fighting stance, but lowers his center of gravity. He'd begin the words "Leaf," as he obviously were about to attack. The boy did this slow enough to be noticeable, and hopefully be stopped before he actually attacked a Jounin of the leaf.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (U gonna react?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) gave a little look at the side, then continued to look back at the nothingness.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) lunges forward at a full sprint. However, he decides to go right past the man, having thought better than to attack him. Since the man has been ignoring him and will most likely let him get away, the green boy runs off to the direction he came from.*
<br><font color=green>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) says: (I'ma run now, k?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) lets him.*

<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( The scope of the attack is altered by controlling the volume of chakra that is mustered. The released flames will engulf their target, and leave a crater on the ground's surface.  )
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) Standing up on the wall near the outsides of the Hokage Mansion  he'd begin to remove remove his cloak, as toss it behind him off onto the roof, as he'd begin to remove his hand as he'd keep that in his hands as he'd look down at the cloaked man. "An Uchiha clan memeber huh? I thought you guys no longer exsisted? but for a ninja that skilled in the art of fireball jutsu, and the third level of sharingan you're more than the average criminal aren't you?".*
<br><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) whispers: Any relevant information.

<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) chuckles. "Hahah, about time you came and fought me face to face....Now, let's get this over with! Come at me bro!!" He would says as he began doing handseals.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He was casually walking up to the seen, hoping to find Lord Hokage. "Hopefully he'll stay true to his word!" Alastor thought, as a large smile crossed his face. He saw a series of people in the distance, wondering what was going on. "Hmm...might want to check that out," he said as quickened his pace, a seriouse look now crossing his face.

When he arrived on the scene, his first thought was there was a fight going on. He saw the blackened ground, and Lord Hokage facing a man whom Alastor had never seen before. "What the hell..." He mumbled to himself, back up a few steps and preparing his guard.*

<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) "I've always wondered what it's like to fight an Uchiha Clan Memeber, and just for this occasion i've been saving this technique". He'd spread his legs apart as he'd clapse his hands together as he ran down the wall he was standing on, perfectly commiting his chakra to his feet, as he'd ran down weaving a barrage of hand seals in matter of a few seconds focusing his chakra. Then after landing to the ground, he burst off in a agile speed with his arms dangling behind him as he'd ran foward toward Seithin, as he reached into his back weapon pouch, as he commenced with flicking out 5 shuriken toward Seithin Gringe.*
