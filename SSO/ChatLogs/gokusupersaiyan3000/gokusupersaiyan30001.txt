<br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) strolls up, a smug look on his face. He was chained from head to toe in anti-conductive material and two ANBU level shinobi keeping a firm grip on his shoulders.

"Tch, I can walk on my own damn it. I'm not your slaves," spoke the prisoner. "Can we just get going? I have better things to do than be led around like I'm some lost puppy."* - Mon Sep 14 10:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Who is that.. is he a prisoner? - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) made an attempt to jerk his self away from Seisuke's touch, but it was in vain. A grunt of anger escaped him as he turned to look at the personal guards of Seisuke. "You fucking assholes, how about you let me free and just say you delivered me successfully?" Of course, Jatsu was more than likely ignored so he simply strolled along with the group of people; he was devising a plan though.* - Mon Sep 14 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) released another grunt, it was apparent that he was the typical hot-head. The words of Seisuke did nothing to help the cause, but it made the prisoner think that possible the guy was wealthy as hell. With a slight smirk, Jatsu would wait until he came across a local shop before getting the guards attention. "Hey, I'm thirsty.. can I get a quick drink..?"* - Mon Sep 14 11:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) was led into the building, showing no sign of rebuttal. By time the guards managed to provide him with the liquid, he didn't hesitate to gulp it into his mouth. With a slow, deep, exhale through his nose, Jatsu would concentrate. Within a few seconds, while allowing his lightning affinity to spark and conduct within his mouth due to the water. That being said, while still not knowing about the seal placed on him, the prisoner aimed to spit the lightning infused water on the guards huddled around him.* - Mon Sep 14 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) 's attention was naturally altered when his attack on the guards prevailed. Just as his eyes fixated on the Gezo Representative, a devastating blow was landed on him; he staggered back in a daze. Multiple factors were raining down on him at this point and time; he didn't exactly understand why all of a sudden he was so weak. Jatsu knew he wasn't that strong of a person when it comes to taking and delivering physical damage, but he also knew that he wasn't a push over in most cases. On top of the hit from Seisuke, an inner drain was overcoming him and caused him to drop to his knees in submission. "W-What the hell.. is going on," thought the prisoner as he lowered his head in an attempt to center his mind and body.* - Mon Sep 14 11:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) 's body thrashed and jolted across the room, there was no reason counter attack he could make. A loud thud signaled the ending of Jatsu, there was barely any fight left in him. The nautious feeling that reigned over him with an iron fist proved to be definite, giving him not the least bit of chance to overcome the odds. Still, though, Jatsu was able to gloat that he took out three guards with just a mouth full of water and his own natural ability with the lightning affinity. Nevertheless, props had to be given to Seisuke; a fellow that thought on his feet in an instant and took advantage of an opening he saw. "I-I give," murmured the prisoner as he dropped to his knees again.* - Mon Sep 14 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) followed orders without any rebuttal, there was likely nothing he could do at this point and time. With his hands now hooked behind his head, Jatsu took it upon his self to lay flat on his stomach and simply wait for further instructions. All the while, Jatsu was feeling the constant drain and weakness from within.* - Mon Sep 14 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) 's journey to Konohagakure was easy going, but by time he got there he would more than likely be on his last breath. Seisuke did successfully turn in the prisoner, but the poor rebel died minutes after the Gezo Representative left.* - Mon Sep 14 12:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*GokuSuperSaiyan3000(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) looks at the body of the fallen.* - Mon Sep 14 12:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Jatsu(GokuSuperSaiyan3000) was being restraint by two guards, each having a firm grip on his shoulders. At the sight of Baen, Jatsu didn't waste time to get introduced. "Let's get this show on the road, kid."* - Mon Sep 14 20:14:30 2015
