<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped up from the bench, cracks resounding from her body while she stretched out.* - Wed Nov 11 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Coming? - Wed Nov 11 18:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...though my memory only extends so far. I'll tell you what I know. - Wed Nov 11 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep breath and decided to start with the beginning.

"The Mizukage at the time of my becoming a genin was Noriko, at that time we were at peace; relatively little ever happened. A few years after that however, we were at war with a man called Zetsumo. Zetsumo was a powerful man, capable of manifesting several large black creatures constructed of threads. Each creature could use one of the elements. Not long after that Noriko fell ill and soon died, to be replaced by her husband a man by the name of Tethys....following so far?"* - Wed Nov 11 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *yawn* Right...onwards then. - Wed Nov 11 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are you tired? - Wed Nov 11 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: With Tethys as Kage, Kirigakure began to flourish; we gained more troops and our economy was bolstered.. - Wed Nov 11 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A little, but I'm okay. - Wed Nov 11 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Continuing - Wed Nov 11 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We began many covert missions against Zetsumo and we had several skirmishes. - Wed Nov 11 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Most of which we seemed to be gaining victory. - Wed Nov 11 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok, ok - Wed Nov 11 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then, when everything seemed to be going so well. Tethys traveled to another village alone and was ambushed by Zetsumo and a few of his followers. - Wed Nov 11 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He died in that battle. - Wed Nov 11 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Do you know about any details of that battle? - Wed Nov 11 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Unfortunately no....they died with Tethys - Wed Nov 11 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I see - Wed Nov 11 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways. - Wed Nov 11 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The new kage to be elected was Koeki. Though...I don't fault her, she had a difficult job being elected mid-war; she didn't do a very good job. - Wed Nov 11 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Things started to fail, troops started to dwindle. Everything went downhill. - Wed Nov 11 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then, by some chance. Zetsumo entered the village himself. - Wed Nov 11 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We happened to have a man by the name of Kenshin with us at the time. - Wed Nov 11 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: With him, Hassan and Koeki. - Wed Nov 11 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Zetsumo was made short work of and the war came to an end with our victory. - Wed Nov 11 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh see, and this is the history of Zetsumo's reign? - Wed Nov 11 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Lera? - Wed Nov 11 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Must have fallen asleep - Wed Nov 11 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm..what?? Ah sorry...just thinking. - Wed Nov 11 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh ok - Wed Nov 11 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...where was I... - Wed Nov 11 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. Zetsumo died and we had peace again. - Wed Nov 11 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But like all things. Peace doesn't last forever. - Wed Nov 11 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You may know this one. Edge? - Wed Nov 11 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Edge... I heard rumors about him - Wed Nov 11 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...well. He happened. - Wed Nov 11 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He came to the village and quite literally just...destroyed it. - Wed Nov 11 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't know why. I wasn't there. - Wed Nov 11 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I heard that he summoned a Tailed beast. - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whether its true or not, I don't know. But the devestation was very real. - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Koeki died because of it. - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Kirigakure was left Kageless yet again. - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Tailed beast? - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah yes....I've never actually seen one myself. - Wed Nov 11 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But they're gigantic creatures with a number of tails. Ranging from one to nine. - Wed Nov 11 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're frighteningly powerful. - Wed Nov 11 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: More than capable of finishing a village. - Wed Nov 11 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I might have to study on them more... - Wed Nov 11 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok OK.... and then? - Wed Nov 11 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Wed Nov 11 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kirigakure seemed to be done, there was nothing left; bodies littered the streets and the smell of decay was all pervading. - Wed Nov 11 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And then, Kirie took the stand be became the next Mizuke; to being the rebuilding process. - Wed Nov 11 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not long after...my fiance at the time died and I returned to Kirigakure to help with the rebuilding. - Wed Nov 11 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Things weren't perfect, but we were beginning to come back again. I even found love in an old childhood friend again. - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then....it all went bad 'again' - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thats sweet - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was away. Training in isolation when it happened. - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Mansion was Bombed, I don't know exactly who did it; though I have suspicions. - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... oh - Wed Nov 11 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Immediately after we were attacked again, by a man named Ortho. he did a fair amount of damage before leaving. - Wed Nov 11 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kirie died in the explosions...and we had no kage again. - Wed Nov 11 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was at a loss to be honest. I didn't know what I should do. - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then it got even worse. - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ortho returned again...-again- while I was not there to defend. - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And my second lover lost her life... - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As you might imagine. That put me in a real dark place. - Wed Nov 11 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I wanted to protect the people. - Wed Nov 11 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh, are you ok? - Wed Nov 11 19:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Truthfully, I have no idea who he is or where he came from. - Wed Nov 11 19:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alrighty then. - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know Earth Flash - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods* - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So I'll show you Raiton flash... - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its technically easier than Earth Flash and Weaker. - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But in my opinion its much more useful. - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I see. - Wed Nov 11 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) clapped her hands together, an act entirely unecessary for the use of this jutsu, she just liked theatrics. As soon as her hands came together, she would surge chakra to the skin of her body. Several visible sparks in the form of a lightning blue aura manifested around her for only a moment.

"As you can see, this one allows you to channel Raiton out of your entire body. Pretty damn good if someone has a hold of you, ignore the clap thats not actually necessary. Fortunately, you don't have to be able to hold the raiton at all. Just surge it from within and release it all at once. Its, at best, strong enough to dull someones movements or push them away. It doesn't do any lasting damage."* - Wed Nov 11 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped a little closer, observing the air around Izanami for the tell-tale sparks. It wasn't always viewable, so if the girl did succeed and it wasn't seen; Lera would definitely feel it.

"You can treat it almost the same as Kai. But you combine it with Raiton and only surge your chakra, instead of stopping your flow first."* - Wed Nov 11 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm.... - Wed Nov 11 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held up her hand, feeling the raiton tingle over her skin; it was similar to getting a bad static shock at this level, but it would surely get better with practice.

"Good! You're a fast learner. I only know one more technique for Raiton, if you want to learn?"* - Wed Nov 11 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm. - Wed Nov 11 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Please.~ - Wed Nov 11 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright then. - Wed Nov 11 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) she turned away from Izanami; taking a few steps before pointing her body at a nearby rock. In plan view of Izanami, she put her palms together and began focusing chakra into them. As she drew them apart, sparks would fly between them and a bright blue ball of Raiton would form at the centre. She gave a little thrust of her hand and sent the ball of lightning flying into the rock where it caused a considerable amount of damage.

"This one is aptly named Lightning Ball. The key here is to get the shape right, if you can't contain the lightning in a ball and then be able to throw it; then it may well just go off in your hands or even just not form at all. Rather than form a full ball at first, start small; go with a golf ball, then a tennist ball and so on so forth."* - Wed Nov 11 20:15:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (no worries :) - Thu Nov 12 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) caught side of Kiyoko and literally went slack jaw, she didn't care what she looked like; what she did care about however was the fact that she'd been hurt. She rushed forward and took a knee in front of the girl.

When she spoked in hushed tones, there was no anger or anything of the like in her voice just sheer worry "What happened???"* - Thu Nov 12 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) tried to take her hand as gently as possible, she wasn't put off by the harsh tones at all; though she looked and felt guilty.

"I'm sorry...I should've been here..."* - Thu Nov 12 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: How though...who...? - Thu Nov 12 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked deep into her eyes, deciphering what she already knew and what she'd guessed. In truth, it was pretty obvious really so she just came out and said it.

"You were...trying to help him weren't you..."* - Thu Nov 12 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: May I ask what happened? - Thu Nov 12 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) shook her head, guessing Kiyoko's thoughts.

"I...I'm not mad, i'm just scared..."* - Thu Nov 12 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gently lowered her lips to the womans hand, breathing in her scent and closing her eyes. She stayed like that for a few moments before looking back up at her, the desperation in her eyes was pretty strong; she couldn't do it again, the next time she lost someone she would break.

"I can't be mad...how could I ever be mad at you for doing what you want to do? But please...please don't scare me like this again."* - Thu Nov 12 13:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I won't...but...next time...next time let me be there...? - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yes, he already agreed. - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And we will do it at the hospital, with armed guards outside... and Nari there when necessary. - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...and a panic button... - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) noted the shift of Kiyoko's eyes, it would normally indicate there was something she wasn't been told but she trusted Kiyoko implicitly.

"Okay...Thank you."* - Thu Nov 12 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: There's something I need to tell you in private, it's a story about something that happened afterwards. - Thu Nov 12 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Rather right afterwards. - Thu Nov 12 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Alright.. - Thu Nov 12 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Very well. - Thu Nov 12 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood up and moved around behind Kiyoko, intending to push her if Kiyoko allowed it.

"Where to...?"* - Thu Nov 12 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *nod* Right... - Thu Nov 12 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on a cushion in front of Kiyoko and looked up at her, waiting expectantly for the talk. It was a little worrying, whenever someone said 'we need to talk' it usually meant something bad.* - Thu Nov 12 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) listened with absolute intensity absorbing every word she spoke, she winced a little at the sight of the scars; though she didn't care whether it scarred her body, she just cared because it must've have caused her considerable pain. As her story waxed on, Lera's eyes widened and she cringed a little bit as she made a pretty good guess as to who the mystery man was. She only knew of one man after her life and that was Ortho. When Kiyoko finally said his name, it was only a comfirmation.

For a while she pondered over her own thoughts considering what she should say and how she should act. This clearly meant that she now owed that man Ortho, owed him more than she had owed anyone else. She cared little for what he'd wanted to do to her, but to save Kiyoko from the brink of death there was nothing she could ever be more grateful for. After a while, she knew what she wanted to do and thus took to her knees and lowered her head; speaking in a tone that could only be described as subserviant.

"Kiyoko...from this day onwards. I pledge myself to you in every capability that I have. My life is yours until the day I breathe my last breath. Even if you decide you don't want me; I will fight for you from the shadows. Now and always, I love you."* - Thu Nov 12 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her head, tears were trailing down either side of her face; mirroring Kiyoko's own.

"Thank you...thank you so much. As for Ortho...I'm grateful, more grateful than he can ever know. After this, I owe him."* - Thu Nov 12 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No... no you don't owe him. I owe him, okay? - Thu Nov 12 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: In a way...he save both of our lives. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I don't think I can handle it again. If I lost you...I'm not strong enough. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....teasing of course. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. It was already yours to begin with. - Thu Nov 12 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Thu Nov 12 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath and returned the kiss, passionate but gentle. She was extremely careful, perhaps overly careful not to jostle Kiyoko's body too much. Even through that gentleness though, her excitement was obvious; before she'd never really had a true purpose and hadn't really even believe in having a purpose. Now though, now she knew with full certainty that Kiyoko was her purpose and her reason to exist.

After a few seconds, Lera ended the kiss but still kept a light grip on Kiyoko's hand "Its like...I can't explain it. Its as if everything that kept me...tethered, kept me alive. Its as if all of that has snapped, replaced by one single tether; the strongest rope. Woven diamond tieing me to the most important person of my life"* - Thu Nov 12 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Am I...making sense? - Thu Nov 12 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I want to...but not yet...first I'll buy a ring. - Thu Nov 12 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sank onto the cushion with a happy sigh, still gripping Kiyoko's fingers with a outstretched arm.

"I'm really glad you came to talk to me that day."* - Thu Nov 12 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. I'll start preparing my best 'nice' girl speech. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't pretend, you be you. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know you want me to stay around them but if they can't accept you then I don't want them. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) reached up and tapped her on the nose, smiling at her not unkindly.

"Whether they accept me or not. They'll come to understand, in the end they're still family."* - Thu Nov 12 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I feel like I should tell her my dark secret...I don't want her to think bad of me... - Thu Nov 12 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... I suppose. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera can I ask you something. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you... really do those things to him? - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do what...? - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you torture him - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *? - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Torture Ortho? what?? - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I assume thats who you're talking about. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You, Kirie, Violet, and Elon were named as people who had tortured him. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What really? I've never tortured anyone in my life. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you told him this? - Thu Nov 12 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Truthfully. I had no idea as to why he was doing what he was doing. - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It was completely random and out of no-where. - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did those other three? - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't speak for Elon or Kirie. But for definite, Violet was too kind to do something like that. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He said you all were 'named'. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Said it many times. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So this was why he was after my life...? - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And why he killed Violet? - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...don't understand though. Me and Violet never did a thing to him. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In fact. I was alone surviving on that forest island - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: FOr well over a month and i'd spoken to Ortho just fine moments before I left. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He only admitted to killing Violet and Elon. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This is why I'm confused. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then it seems it was all a big misunderstanding. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...somebody did say to me that they believed someone else killed Kirie. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...this thing he things you and others did. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Part of it... - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Part if it is awful. - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What did he say? - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Part of it was just physical torture which he believed you to be part of. - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But the bad part.... they put him under a genjutsu that made him relive his parents deaths over and over... - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What? - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah.... - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...None of us have that ability. - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or had...it seems. Violet had no Genjutsu ability, Kirie had about the same as me. - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well... all of them are dead... I won't speak for them. - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Elon was...barely ever around so I can't see him having done anything. - Thu Nov 12 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Shh... - Thu Nov 12 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't believe this....did he just fabricate this? Or did someone trick him into it.. - Thu Nov 12 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Maybe Edge...? - Thu Nov 12 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I feel someone fabricated him. - Thu Nov 12 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why lie to the person who you could have killed to get revenge? - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...guess.. - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He wasn't even going to tell me who he was. - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its probably dangerous... - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But i should talk to him. - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Not until I started thanking him and telling him I owed my life. - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No... no no... - Thu Nov 12 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....It feels wrong - Thu Nov 12 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To leave it like this. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If you want contact let me speak to him for you. I don't want to chance old feelings springing up. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe...if I send a clone. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or maybe even a message bird. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sorry... - Thu Nov 12 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This is just...unexpected. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I actually thought he'd gone crazy. - Thu Nov 12 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I will talk to him okay? - Thu Nov 12 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose...maybe...you should talk to him...but. - Thu Nov 12 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I can't help but worry I guess.. - Thu Nov 12 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes I know. - Thu Nov 12 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: On the topic of...dark secrets. - Thu Nov 12 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I do have one. - Thu Nov 12 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One I should tell you and the reason why I tell you to cherish your family. - Thu Nov 12 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay. - Thu Nov 12 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep shuddery breath before speaking. 

"Long story...buckle in I guess. I told you before how my family were strict, the same as yours. Well, they took it to a different level. When I was about...eight, my mother and father left kirigakure for their estate. They left me behind, sending me money so I could survive. They basically told me to 'grow up'...so I did. I became my own person and i grew away from them. I didn't need them anymore. However, they had different ideas. About a year and a half ago, they hired a man to 'collect' me. I went with him just to see what they wanted and apparently they wanted to marry me off, to increase their standing. That part I've told you before."* - Thu Nov 12 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sure you can guess what I told them to do with that idea. - Thu Nov 12 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Go on... - Thu Nov 12 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and took in another breath, it was coming to the parts where Kiyoko might...dislike her.

"Everything seemed okay for a while, until Kirigakure was attacked by Edge and almost everything was destroyed. Not long after that, Seisuke lost his life and I was left...in a fragile state of mind. At the time i'd been living in Sunagakure, but I soon returned to Kirigakure in order to help rebuild. It was then that everything went...wrong. I'd been looking after a little girl, a kid who'd lost her parents. I'd gotten pretty attatched in all honesty. I left one day to do a short mission and returned to find her...gone with a note from my parents. The note told me that they'd 'taken' her and that if I did not take my place then the girl would take it for me."* - Thu Nov 12 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess you could say I was angry... - Thu Nov 12 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Furious even. - Thu Nov 12 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I wish I'd handle it better though...now that I look back on things. - Thu Nov 12 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I really well and truly regret what I did... - Thu Nov 12 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But... - Thu Nov 12 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) mustered up her courage and then looked her dead in the eye.

"I killed him. I killed my biological father. Thats my...dark secret."* - Thu Nov 12 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I regret it more than anything i've ever done....thats why I tell you to cherish them. - Thu Nov 12 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I do...despite what he did, he's still my father. I could have just warned him, shown him what he was dealing with. - Thu Nov 12 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But instead I burned him alive... - Thu Nov 12 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I -enjoyed- it. - Thu Nov 12 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I hope he burns in hell. - Thu Nov 12 15:07:56 2015
