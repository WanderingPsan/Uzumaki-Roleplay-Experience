<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) released his shoulder, so he would just drop straight back to the ground. She however, floated back down gracefully.* - Tue Oct  6 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I need some shit that will dazzle the crowd. - Tue Oct  6 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gradually opened her eyes, turning to the side to see Seisuke in the bed with her. They had to keep these things a secret from Muhammed, she wasn't so much scared of what he'd do; more so that the knowledge of what the two had been doing would give him a heart attack. She still remember his reaction after messing with him, he'd seriously looked like his heart was about to explode.

As much as she found messing with the old guy funny, she didn't want to kill him prematurely. So she thought it best to steer clear of those sort of topics for at least a few years. With a slight groan, she sat up and pulled herself out of the bed; there was no need to disentangle herself from the covers, it was so hot in this place they just didn't bother with them. With a groggy yawn, she flitted through into the bathroom.

As someone who was born from a wealthy family, Lera was used to and even prefered a lifed of luxury and oppulence. She believed that to live the life of a shinobi without going insane, you had to at least enjoy the little things. The little things could be anything: a comfortable bed, food, a nice hot bath or even something as simple as a hug from the person you loved. Lera, thought of herself as being a master of this little motto.

This was why she was at least a little bit dissapointed with their current situation, Sunagakure was in a state of poverty; the amenities were well...for lack of a better word, Lacking. This bathroom had no shower, all it contained was a small bath and a toilet. Nothing compared to the huge bathroom and onsen with enough room for several people she had back in Kirigakure. Despite this, she was still happy with the way things had gone.

Not only could she spend more time with Seisuke here, but she also had her father and sensei close by as well as the opportunity to gain more strength. If she was given the choice again, she wouldn't change a thing. Still feeling a little groggy, she turned the taps on the bath; which proceeded to expel a drizzle of barely warm water. She looked at the water with distate as it filled the tub, she would have to find a way to help Muhammed bring more money into the village.

Once the bath was filled, she dipped her hand into it and began focusing her chakra towards her palm. At least the lack of warm water was a good chance to train her control over Katon. She obviously couldn't ignite a flame under the water, but she was able to spread heat throughout it using the chakra flow technique. It took her a few attempts to really warm the water up, but soon the tell-tale whisps of steam were rising from the waters surface.

She stepped into the tub with a happy sigh, letting the water soak out all the sweat from a particularly hot night. It was true that she liked it here in Sunagakure, but she still thought of Kirigakure as her home. One day she'd go back there, perhaps to fulfill her eventual goal of reaching Mizukage. She looked down at her tiny had, opening and closing it in a fist. It was still too small, this hand didn't hold enough strength for her to take that leap.

She'd decided to approach her goal one little step at a time. Undoubtedly, people would underestimate her; perhaps even assume there was nothing to her at all. It was at that moment that she would take that leap and show the neysayers that she wasn't just some little girl. That day was still a long way off however, what she needed was something that set her apart from the norm; something that would single her out as unique...and powerful. But what?

With a sigh, she sank back into the water; noticing that it was starting to get colder as time passed. She could easily heat it again but it wouldn't do her any good to stay in there for so long. With a reluctant sigh, she dragged herself from the water and dried off; picking up some clean clothes on her way through the bedroom. Seisuke seemed to still be fast asleep, so she left him to it; he was always working, he needed to get some rest.

She noted with a satisfied smile that the pair of them were getting more and more comfortable with each other, at the start; shows of affection had been hesitant and somewhat embarrassing. Now though, everything was just automatic; though he still seemed to get a little red in the face, but then she thought it was kinda cute not that she would ever say that to his face.

Finally ready to go, she stepped outside; greeted by the morning sun. She would probably never get used to this, it was always so sunny here; what she wouldn't give for just a little bit of rain. In the end, she just had to deal with this opressive heat and get on with her training. As she walked through the village, most of the occupents now ignored her; having gotten used to the 'outsider'

She might have been Muhammeds adoptive daughter, but that only counted for so much. In the end, she would have to prove herself to the inhabitants of Sunagakure if they were going to trust her. She started slow, helping out the refugees with odd jobs here and there. It was usually something as simple as carrying something heavy, or helping them light a fire; with the ocasional little errand of getting some food for them.

Lera didn't mind helping the people so much, more often than not she actually had the chance to practice her skills while doing so. One paticular pair she helped was an obviously malnourished woman and her child, the child seemed healthy and strong obviously fed relatively well. It was almost as if the woman was neglecting her own well-being to make sure the child stayed healthy and never went hungry.

It made Lera smile to see that was still a little love and care in the world, even among people who'd suffered as much as these refugees. She decided to help them, moving closer while they struggled with their loads. The woman carried a huge pack full to the brimb with wood, she'd obviously spent a long time gathering it. The childs pack was comparitively smaller, but he was simply not strong enough to carry it.

As Lera approached, she placed her hands on both the packs and made to removed them from the pair "Here, let me help you" as soon as her hands were on the packs, their weight halved and then halved again. The two let her lift packs and hold them on her shoulders, she made it look incredibly easy. The two sighed with relief, though looked a little awed; assuming Lera was just incredibly strong. She wasn't about to correct them, better that fewer people know her trick.

"Thank you...its nice to see someone willing to help, everyone has their own troubles to deal with lately." Lera gave her a quick nod and a smile towards the awed child "Its not problem Ma'am, I figured I'd spend the day helping out wherever I could in the village. Lead on, i'll follow" the woman gave a gracious curtsy and began walking deeper into the village. The child took to walking directly beside Lera, staring up at her with wide eyes. It took him a little while to pluck up the courage to speak to her.

"Miss miss...you're a shinobi aren't you??" Lera averted her gaze down to the little boy, smiling down at him with as much warmth as she could muster "Yep, I'm a shinobi" the little boys awe only seemed to grow after that and he just continued to stare up at her, without saying a single word. They soon arrived at their house, a little squat barely suitable for a dog; let alone two people. She dropped the wood down and passed the two a little money, enough to feed them for months.

The woman just stared at the bag of money in her hand, almost like she'd never seen so much in her life. In truth, Lera had begun to see money as nothing more than an object a long time ago. While she was poor in comparison to Seisuke, she had more than enough money to support herself for a lifetime. In some ways, the shinobi had it easy in day to day living; all they had to worry about was dieing in battle, a small relief compared to living in poverty.

The woman seemed to take a deep breath, tucking the money awake before lowering to her knees and ducking her head "Thank you, thank you so much. You may have just saved our lives. Thank you." it was then that Lera realised the severity of the situation, people were dieing because they didn't have enough money and food to survive, surely it was the Shinobi's job to help "And I would do it again gladly, I didn't know things were this bad. I'm going to suggest Missions directly helping the refugees to Muhammed, don't worry; things will get better"

"I sure hope you're right, for everyones sake." with a little nod, the woman turned to her daily tasks and Lera moved to leave the house; waving towards the child as she went. Thing seemed to be bad and she knew that despite all her reassurences, things were only going to get worse. With war on the horizon, it was likely that many of these refugees would die. With a sigh, she wandered through village; heading to do the only thing she could to help. Train.

Once she'd reached a safe place, she faced the wall used so often as her training post. It was blackened and burned, covered in deep cracks that she'd yet to repair. Considering the wall was made entirely of Earth, repairing it was a pretty easy thing to do. Not only that, but it would actually be good training. Forming a single handseal, she created a clone to stand at her side. The clone stepped towards the wall, breathing in deep and gathering chakra to its lungs.

Without a shred of hesitation, it began spitting out a torrent of mud; coating the wall in the substance and filling in the various cracks. Lera herself then stepped forwards and formed several handseals of her own, directing chakra to her throat. With a single hand drawn to her mouth, she began blowing through her fingers. A large steady stream of flames spread from her mouth, impacting the wall and the still wet mud. She regulated the power of her flames in order to prevent further damage and simply focused on the clones mud.

She and the clone worked in unison, the clone filling in the walls defects with mud and Lera coating it in flame to dry it out and leave it hardened. The combination seemed to be working well, as the mud dried it simple became another part of the wall; thus repairing the damage she'd been causing in her practices. It took a while to finish the job effectively, as they both had to constantly re-apply their jutsus when they ended.

Eventually the job was complete and Lera was left to disperse the clone and sit back to view her handywork. Seeing what she'd done, she considered several other combinations; such as encasing someone in mud and then hardening it with flames. It would make a perfect trap and could well help her in capturing anyone without actually causing death. Either way, the time for practicing combinations could come later; for now, she had more training to complete.* - Tue Oct  6 12:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Tue Oct  6 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the scroll from Kilm and opened it up, she'd already seen a decent demonstration from Kilm; but it was always good to have a written description of the jutsu to go along with it. The scroll described it more or less the way she expected it to, though she couldn't quite get her head around how she could produce a flamable gas without suffocating herself. Her Katon training was coming along very nicely, but she still struggled with some aspects.

The jutsu was the ability to exhale a cloud of flamable gas, produced via Katon chakra somehow; she wasn't sure how that was accomplished, but she could already see the various uses for it. Already, she could see herself spreading the gas over a wide range;  it would be invisible to her opponents and unavoidable once ignited. The only danger was being caught in the explosions herself and even that could easily be avoided with a simple escape underground.

Figuring she understood at least the basic outline of the jutsu, she rolled the scroll back up and placed it in her holster. Taking in a deep breath, she formed the handseals outlined within the scroll and attempted to change the composition of the air in her lungs. It was difficult to imagine what form the gas was supposed to take, other than simple adding her Katon chakra to the mix; the rest was a guess at best.

Once she thought she had at least the basic composition down, she exhaled and released what could only be described as ordinary air. Her breath seemed to shimmer leaving her mouth, but there was no special properties other than a strange sulphuric smell. She wafted the air in front of her face, trying to get rid of the sharp smell and went over in her head what might've gone wrong here.

There were a great deal of possibilities, she'd obviously achieved something; judging by the smell, so that was the best place to start. Ignoring the smell, she took in another breath and started the process all over again. Rather than just adding Katon and hoping for the best, she treated the jutsu exactly as she would if she were actually trying to breath the flames, with a subtle difference.

Instead of just of igniting the chakra as she normaly would, she left it as it was and imagined the chakra taking on a smokey form. The moment her idea took effect, she suddenly felt extremely short of breath and began choking repeatedly. As she choked, the smokey substance she'd imagined leaked out of her nose and mouth, exactly as if she'd tried to smoke something. If this was what it felt like to smoke, then she'd never know why anyone did it.

After the choking had subsided, she sat down on her backside and settled for taking big deep breaths to clear the acrid burning sensation in her lungs and throat. After several minutes like this, the feeling finally subside and she took a quick swig of her water. Obviously, something had gone horribly wrong there and if she'd taken that a step further then it wouldn't be a surprise if she ended up suffocating.

Clearly, manifesting whatever it was in her lungs was an extremely bad idea; so for fear of choking herself, she'd use the jutsu like most of her other Katon types. Instead of applying Katon in her lungs, she'd apply it as the breath left her mouth. This meant she would have less time to get the right form, it would take longer but that was okay. It was better than suffocating herself anyway.

Now that she'd Fully recovered, she stood back up and breated in the clear, albeit dusty, air. Once the handseals were formed, she began exhaling her built up air and chakra; applying the katon nature as the gas left her mouth. As she'd attempted before, she merely refrained from igniting it; treating it like a fireball but without the act of ignition. It actually seemed to work, at least somewhat. The substance that came from her mouth was a mixture of smoke, soot and a clear shimmering gas.

Assuming that was the effect she needed, she jumped back and manifested a small ball of flames on her palm. She tossed it towards the concoction she'd made and was greeted by a multitude of sparks and flashes. Whatever it was, it wasn't correct; but it was extremely close. She just needed to remove the soot and the smoke and isolate that clear gas.

Forming the handseals again, she took in yet another breath and began to exhale it. She tried to do it differently again, focusing on the idea of that clear gas and ignoring any thoughts of flame and smoke. This time, there was no soot of smoke from her mouth; instead just a stead stream of that clear shimmering substance that spread outwards and away from their group.

To test it out, she took a few steps backwards and tossed another ball of fire. This time, she was greeted by a great ball of flames that spread wherever the gas was. It was almost like a minature explosion, though it lacked any real power as of yet. With practice however, power would come and she needed that power if she was going to survive in this world.* - Tue Oct  6 13:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* - Tue Oct  6 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stretched her body out and cracked her neck from side to side, looking Shin up and down; it was difficult to tell what sort of style he'd be using. Though, the same would be said the other way around; she would just go with the usual, trap him and see what happens.

Forming a single seal, she'd create a total of four clones; each one would spread out around her, making it difficult to pick just one target.* - Tue Oct  6 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) two of her clones stepped forwards, running through five handseals each. Once prepared, they brought their hands to their mouths and breathed out a torrent of flames. The flames spread outwards, mixing together to form a huge ball of fire. She actually held the jutsu back, stopping the flames from hitting Shin himself for fear of causing serious damage. The intention was to simply stop his own technique from hitting her.

The original Lera stepped forwards just as the fireballs were being prepared, forming a single handseal and directing her chakra towards Shin. If it went as expected, a large dome of solid rock would spring up around him; taking shape but leaving a person sized hole directly at the top. Her final two clones would already be rushing towards this hole. Intending to jump atop the dome and look down into it. The first formed a few more handseals and breathed a clear gas into the dome, while the other pulled out a single kunai and set it on fire. She refrained from dropping it in though, merely curious to see Shins reaction.* - Tue Oct  6 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched two of her clones get destroyed, while she glanced upwards at the airborn Shin. It wasn't a paticularly good place for him to be, especially against her. The two clones on either side of her clapped their hands together while Lera formed three handseals. Each of them took in a deep breath, gathering chakra to their lungs and readying the attack.

Lera let hers off before the clones did, releasing a large amount of sharp Wind shards; if they struck Shin, he would find himself covered in stinging bruises. She at least reduced the power enough to stop it from tearing into his skin. The two clones would release their jutsus moments after Lera, exhaling a violent blast of wind. The intent was to hit him with the shards and then blast him out of the air.* - Tue Oct  6 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) merely shook her head and sank into the ground, going deep enough to avoid getting hit by flames. Her clones did the same thing, joining her under the earth. She assumed that three powerful jutsu would've been enough to overcome the elemental weakness. Either way, she was safe underground and began moving her and her two remaining clones in opposite directions.* - Tue Oct  6 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) and her two clones emerged in seperate locations, making it impossible ti discern which of the three were real. Having used Hiding like a mole, she knew Shins exact location and one of the Leras was in direct sight of him. The other two Leras reared back their heads and spat out torrents of mud, covering the entire area in the stuff; including the place where Shin was hiding.

Then, the one who had clear sight formed three handseals; directing chakra to the newly formed mud and creating a large dragon head that would rise from it. It would open its great maw and release a torrent of hardened mud bullets, these were designed to cause some serious pain. This time, she didn't hold back on the power.* - Tue Oct  6 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Maybe - Tue Oct  6 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: *omit* - Tue Oct  6 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched all this happening, seeing the clones accuracy drop. She wasn't sure why exactly he'd done it, but it left her with a perfect opportunity to attack. As a pure decoy, her one free clone started rising into the sky; floating as if to escape any attack. At the same time, it was forming a multitude of handseals; looking as if it were preparing something large.

The original intended to sink into the ground, dissapearing at the same moment her second clone dispersed; the intent was to make it appear as if the floating clone was in fact the original and the one now hiding underground had dispersed as a clone.* - Tue Oct  6 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rose from the ground and looked up at his handiwork, nodding to herself.
