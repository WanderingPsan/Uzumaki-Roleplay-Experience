<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared down at her hands with a discontent expression, she hated when she couldn't train because of an Injury; though in truth it didn't really happen all that often. She was lucky to be engaged to an excellent Medic and Doctor. She felt a little bad, coming out here with the intention to practice the very thing that had injured her; after Kiyoko had told her to wait for her hands to heal. It wasn't something she could just stop practicing, it was far too exciting.

It wasn't every day that one got the chance to invent an entirely new element; an element, she hoped, that had yet to be created by anyone. She didn't really know how she was able to do it, whether it was something she'd been born capable of or if it was something that anyone could learn at any time. She did remember being told that the elemental combinations were generally limited to people born with that ability, a Kekkei Genkai they called it. Though, she also knew that that usualy was a combination of two elements.

With a frown she turned her gaze away from her still healing hands and forced them into a single hand seal, summoning forth a clone for her training. Despite going against Kiyoko's wishes and continuing her training, Lera was not stupid. She now knew just how dangerous this new element and what it could do to her if she made a mistake, which is why she was now using a clone to practice for her. It would probably slow the training down a bit, she couldn't do this with multiple clones as the strain would prove too much. She would just have to make do.

Lera took her distance from the clone, who watched her go with a hesitant smile. The clones were essentially her, they still felt pain and had all the same memories as her; she almost felt a little sorry for it, even though it was technically her. The clone took in a deep breath and raised its hands to begin channeling the chakra. She could see immediately the crease in its forehead and the swet dripping from its brow. Focusing three elements at once wasn't just dangerous, it was also immensely difficult.

Slowly, as the chakra started to take hold, a small speck of golden light formed between the palms of her clone; steadily growing into a tiny sphere. It was a different experience watching it from afar, she could truly appreciate what she was trying to do when she wasn't concentrating so hard on it. The deep vibrating hum that came with the creation of the energy soon filled the air, now that she was watching it as an observer; she could almost see the vibrations coming off the sphere causing an ever so slight blur to her clones hands.

Much to her surprise the sphere started to grow again, though from the look of panic on her clones face she figured that it was not intentional. The clone steadily lost control of the growing sphere and Lera quickly erected a wall in front of her for protection. Even from behind the wall, she saw the bright light that abruptly shone and then dissapeared. As quickly as possible, she jumped over the wall and was greeted by the sight of her clone a mere moment before it vanished.

Usually, upon recieving a powerful enough attack, a clone would just dissapear immediately. This was different though, she saw a horrific image of herself with missing arms and half of her chest blown away. The injuries were not normal either, there were no signs of cuts or burns or any other conventional injury. It was like someone had simply decided that those missing parts didn't need to exist anymore and so they didn't. She suddenly felt very glad she'd not used the technique herself, she was tougher than her clones yes; but even if she'd survived, it would be in no fit condition to continue as a shinobi.

A little shudder ran through her body at the thought, but then...the possibilities of this ability were immense. She almost couldn't wait to see the look on Hassan's face if she somehow managed to master this and show him. Now though, she could see that stability wasn't the only problem; if she could not contain the technique then there would be no point in using it at all. What good was a technique if she risked death every time she wanted to use it, no it wouldn't do like this at all.

While she sought inspiration, she practiced combining her chakra's; holding her hands out and creating the single speck of golden light. She made doubly sure to go no higher than that, knowing that she would be incapable of controlling it if she did. At this level she was able to freely create and destroy the chakra's preventing herself from being hurt. Continuously doing this process was helping her control over the technique, she sort of saw it like a muscle. Like any muscle in the body, you started by lifting small objects before progressing to larger ones.

She figured, the more she 'flexed' this tiny speck of Dust - her thoughts suddenly halted in mid-process, her eyebrows raising in surprise. In her absent minded thought about control, she had come up with the perfect name for this 'element'. She would call it Dust Release, it was somehow fitting when you considered its ability to destroy objects on an atomic level. She'd considered Particle release as well, but Dust just sounded better somehow. That being said, she still didn't really know what the element was; it was dangerous and it was powerful, but what actually was it?

While she pondered over this idea, that tiny speck of gold was continuously winking in and out of existence; the combination of elements had become an almost instinctual thing by this point. All that was left was to continue practicing until she could control or contain larger amounts of the element. For now she thought, it would be best to work on stabilising the element. Even if she did contain it, it would be useless if it didn't stay stable enough to be thrown at anything. Though, with her aversion to killing when it wasn't necessary, it would likely not be used much.

Either way, this element would give her an edge in battle; that extra little oomph to push her enemies to the brink. She would have her sword, her large variety of Ninjutsu, her impossible levels of chakra and then she would have Dust. It would be her last resort, the one thing she only uses if its absolutely necessary. For the moment she pushed those thoughts from her mind and summoned a clone, the clone went a large distance from her and began practicing the Dust element; focusing larger amounts than Lera herself.

She figured that if she had her clone practicing on adding more chakra, then Lera herself would not have to worry about killing herself by accident. At the same time, Lera would be 'flexing' her own chakra; forming it into the elusive speck of golden dust and then turning it off. With her clone practicing larger amounts and herself practicing continued and sustatined use of the element; she figured this would be done in a little over a week.* - Thu Nov 19 17:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Durable cloth. . . Do-able I suppose. I'd assume this is your desire so that you can avoid being slowed down, right? - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That and I don't paticularly like armour. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: besides the other idea I had, but that can wait. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I see. I was going to suggest light armor, but this isn't too hard either. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Is that all? I have time if you want to discuss more. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Paticularly...I want them made in a similar appearence to my current outfit. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) opens up her jacket, she was wearing her 'battle' outfit that Kiyoko knew well. A tight wrapping of white cloth over her breast and loose fitting pants (Basically Erza's no armour form)* - Fri Nov 20 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And if you have time then I could put in an order I guess. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I wanted to make a little more money first. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and then pointed to her left arm.

"A full arm gauntlet, covering my hand and arm all the way up past the shoulder. Though the added defensive ability to block blades is nice, I mainly want it so I can flow chakra through the material."* - Fri Nov 20 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at Kiyoko and gave a silent wink.

"The business is flourishing."* - Fri Nov 20 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sounds reasonable. - Fri Nov 20 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll give you an extra hundred thousand for spiked knuckles on those gauntlets. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'll see how much more that'll cost me. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure thing. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just on a random note....i'd like it to be red... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The gauntlet I mean. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kind of like a deep crimson. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope thats about it. When i get more money i'll have more of that cloth made though. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll have Kiyoko's clothes made from it... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: All of that includes the Kukiri set's? - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It seems like so much stuff... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Oh no, the Kuriki Set would probably cost like six-hundred grand per. Lera can afford it, sure enough. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looks at Kiyoko again.

"Yup. Don't worry about it. I should have about twenty to thirty million left in my savings?"* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh.. the big set is the same? - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: After paying that is. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Plenty enough to build a house befitting Kiyoko... - Fri Nov 20 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Most likely. <@Kiyoko> - Fri Nov 20 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, Thats about everything. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just give me a time when you want to examine the weapon. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind when. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pats Samehada effectionately, its pretty obvious thats the weapon she'd been talking about.* - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No worries. - Fri Nov 20 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulps down the rest of her coffee.* - Fri Nov 20 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Well then, don't let me hold you two up. I'm going to finish up my dumplings, you are free to go. - Fri Nov 20 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. Sure, I'll see you later Marco. - Fri Nov 20 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't stand just yet, she didn't want to force Kiyoko to leave if she had not finished her tea yet.* - Fri Nov 20 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled and took her by the hand, leading her off elsewhere.* - Fri Nov 20 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wh-wha I can't take this! - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh but you must. - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why? - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It's a gift. - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Can't I just appreciate the gift of friendship? - Fri Nov 20 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: You can but you must take that gift as well. - Fri Nov 20 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Will you start training me again? - Fri Nov 20 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Sure~ - Fri Nov 20 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Eh..fine alright... thank you Hanae. - Fri Nov 20 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, I'm not really that old Chikyu. - Fri Nov 20 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean, I'm only fifteen. - Fri Nov 20 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: If your old enough to choose to drink, smoke, and be a shinobi. Then, you're old enough to get a date. - Fri Nov 20 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, apparently not though. - Fri Nov 20 15:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh please, stop being so down on yourself. Why would a girl want a guy thats not confident. Suck it up, smile and ask without the fear of rejection. - Fri Nov 20 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ...I already do that. - Fri Nov 20 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like I said, been rejected three times already. - Fri Nov 20 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Guess it doesn't matter though. - Fri Nov 20 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Gonna run out of women to actually ask out at this rate... - Fri Nov 20 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Stop it, Akira. I knew someone who was just like you, and once she got confident. She found a person to date. - Fri Nov 20 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I swear like...seventy percent of the women here are lesbian... - Fri Nov 20 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: I swear all the women here are straight, I wish their was someone like me. - Fri Nov 20 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ...I am confident though. - Fri Nov 20 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You don't sound confident! - Fri Nov 20 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Plus there aren't a lot of single women around...heh. - Fri Nov 20 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..Why don't you ask Chikyu out...sounds like she's hinting. - Fri Nov 20 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Me and Him...HAHAHAHAHAH!' - Fri Nov 20 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't ask Chikyu. - Fri Nov 20 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I already know she isn't into my gender. - Fri Nov 20 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Theres only like...one other women I would consider asking out. - Fri Nov 20 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: So ask her out! - Fri Nov 20 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But she would probably physically hurt me if I did...Heh. - Fri Nov 20 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, if she would hit you while you have a cast. Then, I don't think you would want to date her in the first place. - Fri Nov 20 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Nah...she'd probably hit me for being stupid. - Fri Nov 20 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Just ask her out, if seeking out love is stupid then who would want to be smart! - Fri Nov 20 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...o-oh. - Fri Nov 20 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I didn't know...Chikyu. - Fri Nov 20 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Thats cool. I don't mind, hahaha! - Fri Nov 20 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Well I'm off. - Fri Nov 20 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'll kepe in contact with you Sanoke. - Fri Nov 20 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean, it's not like I want anything too serious right now. - Fri Nov 20 15:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just kinda want someone to talk to and stuff. - Fri Nov 20 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well thats what friends are for! - Fri Nov 20 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I wouldn't know, I don't have any...or well not many. - Fri Nov 20 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Guess I have lots of time to do that now though right? - Fri Nov 20 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey Marrisa. - Fri Nov 20 15:42:04 2015
