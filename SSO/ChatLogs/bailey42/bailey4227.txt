<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: See you - Sun Oct 25 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped away from the crowds and moved to a secluded area in the village, she could almost feel Samehada shivering on her back as it absorbed her chakra. The fact that she could withstand its absorption even slightly, meant that she had a chance of mastering this blade. She had to remember though, it wasn't just a generic sword; this blade had thoughts and feelings. She didn't know exactly how sentient it was, but it certainly knew what it was doing.

Once she found a good place, she sat down with Samehada placed across her legs; she couldn't help but wince at the amount of chakra it was taking from her, it seemed to be enjoying it though so that was a good sign "Thats right Samehada...take as much as you want and when the time comes...we'll fight side by side." It didn't show any sign of having understood or even heard her, it just kept sucking away at her chakra.

The first step to mastering this weapon was to learn how to stand its constant need for more chakra. Though it had been sealed away for such a long time without a supply, this could merely be its way of making up for it. While it kept on sucking, she worked on breathing excercising; trying to regulate her chakra and keep her levels from falling too low. It truly was fortunate she had so much of it, without that she wouldn't have been able to stand this for more than a few seconds at best.

The blade seemed to appreciate her willingness to give up chakra so easily, but it didn't stop; if it did this in a fight she would be at a serious disadvantage. There was really a very long way to go before this was at a level she could fight with. For now, she would let this continue; the true training could begin when she entered the labyrinth. This was just step one of many, soon she would be fighting for her life on a daily basis.

She could sort've imagine the outcome already, one or two months living in a hostile environment; spending every waking moment in a fight to survive. It would change her, there was no doubt and that was what she was banking on. To be able to survive the island and come back several steps higher from when she left. She could already imagine the surprise on Hassan and Kiries faces when she returned; it brought a little smile to her lips.* - Sun Oct 25 20:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wanders off.* - Mon Oct 26 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had arrived late to the party so-to-speak, she stepped off the small boat onto the island; a vision of sprawling forests not far off from the beach. In truth, she hadn't expected a 'labyrinth' in the literal sense, but she didn't see how this island earned that name at all; she supposed she would find out. The man who'd brought her here on the boat wished her lucked and pushed off from the shore; leaving her behind to fend for herself.

Fujitora, Nina and Marissa were already here; there may have even been a few others, though she hadn't been here when they arrived so she didn't know who. On a nearby tree, close to the shore, was a note pinned to the bark. She pulled it from the kunai and began to read it. It seemed to be a short explanation of what was going on, Fujitora was waiting in safe area inside the forest; it was her job to find him. She pulled out a compass and was surprised to find that it was spinning wildly.

With a snap, she closed the compass and tucked it back into her jacker; clearly a compass was just not going to work if she had to find her way, she had to make it to Fujitora as quickly as was possible and there was only really one way she could do that. With a little bite of her thumb, she formed a few handseals and pressed a blood smeered hand into the ground. Giving off a puff of smoke, Jenna the wolf arrived. The wolf shook itself and looked around; if its eyebrows could raise, then thats what it would be doing.

"Master...where are we? This place doesn't smell right..." Lera had expected this place to be odd, but for even Jenna to aknowledge it; this would be harder than she could have ever imagined "I'm here to train Jenna and I'll probably be here for a long time. First though, we have to find my brother; do you think you could help me with that?" Jenna looked to Lera and then to the forest "I don't want to go in there...its...wrong somehow, but for I will help you master. Do you have his scent?"

Lera gave a relieved smile, she couldn't really force Jenna to do anything; she didn't have the heart for that. With a little nod, she pulled out a scroll from her jacket and handed it over to Jenna; it was the scroll her and Fuji had been sending back and forth to each other, hopefully Fuji's scent would be strong enough to catch. Jenna brought her nose close to it and took several long sniffs "Your scent is mixed in strong master, but I think I can get the other scent on it. Shall I follow it?"

"Yes please Jenna, lead away" the little wolf nodded to her master before wandering off into the forest with her nose to the ground, Lera not far behind. The moment they entered the forest Jenna let out a small whimper and Lera felt an overwhelming sense of not belonging, her supernatural senses were not that strong; so she couldn't even begin to imagine what Jenna was feeling "Jenna, if you can't do it its fine, I don't want to make you do this."

Jenna seemed to spend a few moments collecting herself, pawing the ground rapidly in an attempts to calm down. Eventually, she seemed to calm though Lera could still see the fear in her eyes "No Master, I won't let you be here by yourself. I can smell out any dangers before they come, just follow me.." with only a little bit of hesitation, the wolf turned away and started following after the scent once more. Grateful for her friend, Lera continued to follow.

Unsurprisingly, the dangers of this forest made themselves apparent almost immediately; Jenna suddenly looked up and made a warning bark off to the right of Lera. She reacted almost immediately, turning in that direction and gripping the hilt of Samehada. She was greeted by the sight of a large wild cat; lunging from the branches of a nearby tree. If Jenna had not warned her, she might not have reacted in time to bring Samehada down on its neck.

The weapon slammed into the back of the wild cats neck with a solid thunk. She could see right away that Samehada was not made to cut with; more so to kill with a strong blunt hit. The cats neck went with a sickening snap, slamming it into the ground dead. It lay twitching for a few moments before it finally fell silent "Master, that thing smells weird; it doesn't smell like a cat at all" with Jenna's input, Lera felt the need to examine the beast more closely and was surprised by what she found.

At first glance it looked like a cat, upon a closer look however...it was a monstrous thing. It was heavily muscled for one, sporting a muscle mass approximately three times that of a normal wild cat; if that thing had landed on her...she might not have been able to get away. To make matters worse, it seemed to had hooked claws; sharpened to fine blades, they would've torn her skin to shreds. Then there was its teeth, abnormally long canines; sharp and strong enough to pierce the break through bone.

All in all, this wasn't a simple predator; this was a monstrous killing machine, built to hunt and kill anything it came across...and this was barely past the entrance to the labyrinth, what further horrors could be waiting inside. She couldn't help the sickly feeling of fear rising up through her stomach, it sent shivers through her body and brought a slow smile to her face. This place lived up to its repuation and for that she was glad, it would make her that much stronger surviving it.

The thoughtful smile still on her face, she turned to Jenna who was still experimentally sniffing the corpse "You think that thing is edible Jenna?" Jenna's head shot up, giving Lera and incredulous look "Edible? You want to eat it?? I thought you couldn't cook though" Lera couldn't help find humor in that, it was true though; she couldn't cook a piece of bread, let alone meat "All I have to do is sear it over a fire, as long as it doesn't poison me; food is food.

Jenna gave her a doubtful look before sniffing at the corpse again with a sigh "Well, it doesn't smell bad..just different. I think you can probably eat it yes." Lera gave a short nod before pulling out a strip of cloth and a kunai, she wasn't hugely hungry right now but if she was going to stay here for a while, she had to learn how to live off the land. With a slight grimace, she cut a few chunks of meat from the creatures corpse and lay them on the cloth. She was aware that the blood would draw more predators, so she would have to be fast.

"Jenna, if you want to try some. Do it now, before I bury it." Jenna gave a little nod before sinking her teeth in the open wounds left on the creature. She chewed through meat and sinew, pulling off a chunk in her sharp teeth "It tastes...weird, but it seems okay. A bit...chewy though." Lera nodded and found herself several small rocks and a thin piece of slate, contrary to popular belief; large fires didn't keep predators away, they did infact draw them closer. The smoke created by such fires was like telegraphing your location, Lera was no master at survival but she had enough experience to know what she was doing.

She arranged the rocks in a circle, small enough so the thin slate could be laid on top; yet big enough so a small fire could be kindled within. Before actually starting the fire, she made sure to press her hand on the corpse and push it deep into the earth; giving it an impromptu burial. Jenna made no signs of having sniffed out another predator, so she assumed she'd gotten this right. Following instructions she'd read in a book some time ago, she began to kindle a tiny fire in the center of the rocks she'd gathered.

Actually creating the flame was easy, she provided a small spark from the tip of her finger and set the kindling on fire. She'd not gotten very far with it when she realised her mistake and it was such a stupid one as well. She herself could create flames of varying heats without making it to big, why did she need to build a fire from scratch when she could just literally cook the meat in her bare hands. She was about to do just that when another thought ocurred to her.

The chances of it ever happening were quite slim, but if she were to ever somehow be incapable of creating a flame; then it would be good to know that she could survive without it. So with a determined nod, she set about kindling the fire to be as hot as possible without creating too much light or smoke. She mostly followed the instructions from books she'd read, with varying degrees of success. It took her a while, but she did eventually get a fire hot enough to cook food.

The next step was to gingerly place the thin slate over the flame, setting it on top of the rocks so the flames licked against the top of it. She experimentally tapped her finger on the slate, already feeling the heat leeking through it. It certainly wasn't perfect, but it would be good enough to do he job for sure. She took the meat from the cloth and put it down on the slate, just a few minutes later it began to sizzle and pop; drops of fat shooting off onto her the ground. If she'd thought about it more carefully, then she could have made a dome around her to protect from predators...unfortunately she didn't.

It was once again, Jenna's warning that allowed her to react in time "Master! Theres more, the same smell as before; there and there!" Lera immediately sprang into action, drawing Samehada from her back and forming her left hand into a blade. She set her eyes on the are Jenna indicated, rewarded by the sight of two pairs of yellow eyes staring at her from a tree. The moment she spotted them, they lunged; dropping from the tree and heading straight for her. This time, she was ready for them and with a simple side step they both flew past her.

On their way past, she swung her hand out; fingers channeling Fuuton chakra to the tips and ripping through the first of the two cats. She left a humungous fatal gash from her chest all the way down to its behind, it landed in a heap; making attempts to move but as its lifeblood leaked away it gradually fell into silence. The second creature now watched her cautiously, circling slowly while it found the best way to attack. In Lera's eyes that only made the creature more dangerous, most wild creatures would only do one of two things when its partner was killed. Those being, either running away or continuing to attack blindly.

All of a sudden, the creature charged forwards; looking as if it were going to lunge once again, however it instead slid across the ground; claws outstretched and mouth open, as if it were knowlingly aiming for her legs. Thankfully, it had only gauged the danger from her hands and not Samehada which she now brandished in two hands. As soon as it was close enough, she brought it down; point first onto the creatures back. There was another sickening crunch as bones in the creatures body snapped from the blow.

It attempted to rise, showing resilience that just wasn't present in your average wild animal; so she brought Samehada down one more time for good measure. This time, its spine snapped causing its legs to twitch uselessly as it slowly died from the various punctured organs within. Assuming it was safe now, she tied Samehada back onto her back and pushed both corpses back into the ground; being sure to cover any spilled blood with a coating of mud. Jenna looked around like a frightened rabbit, obviously put off by the presence of predators higher on the food chain than her; but she eventually seemed to calm down.

"Don't worry Jenna, they may be strong but I'm here; they won't hurt you." Jenna took in a few more calming breaths before moving closer to Lera and sitting at her side. By this point the meat she'd starting cooking was just about done, the reddish flesh had turned a darkened brown and Lera gave it a few more turns on the slate before she jabbed a kunai into it, making sure it was cooked all the way through. Thankfully it seemed to be browned right through the middle, though the surface was starting to take on a blackened look.

So with a little grimace, she took a piece of the meat and popped it into her mouth; slowly beginning to chew. Jenna had been right, the meat did taste strange and it was exceptionally tough to chew; she couldn't paticularly say she enjoyed it. However, if she were to stay here for more than a few days then she was going to have to get used to it. Next time though she would just use a Katon technique to cook the food; it would save a significant amount of time she could be using to rest or train.

As soon as she was done eating, she spat a little water on the flame and buried the used slate in the mud; it would hopefully stop any more predators from being drawn to the smell and then catching onto her trail. With a little nod, she gestured to Jenna and had her begin following Fujitoras trail once more. The wolf set off immediately, the usual bounce was gone from her step; replaced with an ever present anxiety, she knew better than Lera just how dangerous this situation was but she didn't want to leave her master behind.

Things went relatively well for the next hour or so, which surprised Lera considering she was supposed to be spending every waking moment fighting for her life here; however she soon figured out why that was. She saw a light towards the end of the trail and immediately assumed they'd either reached the other end of the forest or the place Fujitora was holed up. She was quickly proven wrong on both those accounts. The first thing she heard when she stepped out of the forest was the sound of water, lapping against the shore; so she assumed her first guess had been correct.

Yet after looking around for a few moments, she saw the area where she'd arrived on the island and even the tree that still had a kunai sticking out of it. Jenna realised the same thing, letting out a small whine "I'm sorry master! I followed the trail but it just leads back to here..." Lera nodded, she expected as much; obviously the forest wasn't going to make it that easy for her "Its okay Jenna, I have a feeling this is the forests way of telling me I need to survive alone." Jenna let out another whine and bowed her head, before dissapearing at Lera's direction.

As soon as she was alone, the full sense of what she was about to do settled on her; she may well be alone here for months, no human contact and constantly striving to survive. If she wanted to get through this, she had to lose the remaining softness in her heart and become the biggest monster on this island. Heart as heavy as ever, she turned from the beach and began her walk into the forest; this time she had her eyes and ears fully focused on the surroundings, she had to know immediately if a predators came close; she would quickly die if she failed.

Every few steps, she would slice a gash into a tree; marking her progress as she went along, at least then she would know if she ended up moving in circles. Thankfully, that didn't seem the case; she kept a constant straight line, moving steadily whilst watching everything around her. A growl to her right alerted her to the presence of another monster, a monster that stepped out of the shadows; shocking Lera with its sheer bulk. It appeared to be a bull of some kind, though grotesquely mutated; several times larger than the usual thing.

Its horns glistened with fresh blood, bloody foam dripped from its bared teeth. Its teeth were not made for a herbivore, they were the teeth of a carnivore; a carnivore more than used to getting its prey one hundred percent of the time. She could see by its body that it had earned its victories through blood and battle, scars from old wounds criss crossed the rippling muscles on its body. This one wouldn't be easy to fight, this one might actually be able to kill her.

The two stared at one another for a long time, Lera's adrenaline filled and calculative; the bulls tinged with reddened anger with an intelligence hidden behind that quite frankly frightened Lera. This creature knew how to kill and it saw the same aspect in Lera. Finally, the deathly silence was broken as the bull let out a mighty roar and lowered its head; charging forwards with horns first. Its head tossed from side to side, swinging the horns at unpredictable angles and making it that much harder to dodge.

Unlike the other prey it had captured though, Lera could fly. With a great leap, she charged up into the air; barely making it in time for the bull to pass by underneath her. The tree however was not so lucky. Its great head came into contact with a force that should have cracked open its skull and broken its neck. Instead, it kept on charging; horns and head tearing through the wood like paper. She couldn't help but let out a little whistle of appreciation; one hit, even just a graze, would finish her off for good. This thing was dangerous.

In most situations, she wouldn't need to kill it; she could just fly away and leave the beast behind. Yet as it slowly turned and looked up at her, she knew that wasn't possible. Its eyes, still tinged with hatred, told her everything. No matter where she escaped, it would find her again; never had it lost a prey before. Then there was the need to prove herself, technically she could get an arial view and fly straight for Fujitora but then that would defeat the purpose of this entire excercise. No, she would have to kill it and continue to find her own way.

While she thought out a plan in the air, the bull circled underneath; its eyes never leaving her. She knew the moment she moved would be the moment it sprang into actions, its muscles were already twitching with anticipation. To test its skin, she pulled out a few of her shuriken and tossed them down at the creature; only to watch as the shuriken bounced of its stone hard muscles. This meant she would have to get up close and personal in order to do any real damage to it. So, with samehada in one hand; she position herself over the Bull before suddenly releasing her technique and dropping towards it.

The bull let out a scream of rage and jumped back just as her blade was passing by its head; it immediately lunged for her, swinging a sharp horn for her body. The hit never got a chance to connect as Lera didn't stop falling even as she touched the ground. Once she hit the earth, she immediately sank; going quite deep due to her momentum. She might not have been able to hear the bull whilst underground; but she could feel its screams of rage, its prey had never escaped it twice. Once maybe, but never twice.

She stayed underground whilst she thought of a plan, the best way would be to attack it from a distance with powerful jutsu. However, she was not confident that she could kill it in one hit and by the time her jutsu had been let off; it would simply gut her. There was only one other way she could think of, but it was extremely risky; if it went wrong in any way, then she would undoubtedly die here. So first, she moved to a position behind the Bull and popped up above ground. Then she formed a single handseal and created two clones to stand on either side, next; she took the most foolish risk of her life.

The bull noticed her presence almost immediately as she'd known it would, it had not expected to see three of however; though that made it pause for just a mere moment. With how close it was, it was unable to work up a full charge which is where its greatest strength lay; that didn't make it any less dangerous however, it could still just as easily stick a horn in her gut which it was about to do. Before it had the chance to move, her two clones lunged; grasping either horn with their full body strengths, to add to that both used Domu to further increase that strength.

This was intended to stop the bull from thrashing side to side and reduce the danger from those horns, it was somewhat successful; but the real test came next. Leaning forwards, Lera grasped a horn in each hand; gasping with effort as the bull pushed back against her. Its strength was unholy, it was taking two clones and herself just to stop it from running her down and Lera was quite confident in her strength. This went on for several minutes, until Lera pulled chakra through her body; giving her own strength the boost it needed for victory.

The bull suddenly realised that it was fighting a losing battle here and it gave a cry of frustration, putting in every ounce of strength it could muster. It was so damn strong as well, if it had been able to get a full charge up; theres no way she would have stopped it, the thing would've blown her away. Yet, with a final grunt; she gave a savage twist, pulling the bulls head to the side and the rest of its body with it. She couldn't afford to give it a chance to recover, any mercy would be the end of her. So with her fingers gathered in Fuuton chakra, she brought down her hand and speared through its throat.

In the process, she severed its skull from its spine; rendering it immobile. It could only watch as its own lifeblood pooled out of its body and settled in a large puddle on the ground. Gradually, the life lefts its body and its eyes slowly drifted close and just like that; the mighty beasts life abruptly came to an end. Lera sat slumped against a tree, panting quietly and trying to work the feeling back into her arms. At the same time her two clones would be keeping a watchful eye out, making sure that nothing could sneak up on her while she rested.

For a little while, she stared at the beasts corpse and could only shake her head at the fact she'd killed such a magnificent creature. However, in this forest, in this hellhole; it was survival of the fittest and she would damn well make sure she was the fittest. As a sign of respect to the beast, she decided to eat some of its meat and then bury its body; she imagined that it often ate the loser, so she would give it the same show of respect. With her fingers still an impossibly sharp blade, she started cutting thin strips of meat from the beasts hide; finding a flat stone to lay them on.

She got herself a full fifty strips in total; eating it all would certainly be impossible, but she'd brought salt she could turn the leftovers into jerky. Before she began, this time she created a large dome around herself and the corpss; she was confident that no predator she'd seen so far could get through. She did at least leave a small hole, small enough to stop anything getting in; but big enough to provide her with light. To start, she created a makeshift drying rack; for the meat she didn't eat to be layed across. She took forty of the strips and lay them on the rack, placing a small fire underneath.

She was not a good cook for sure, but she hoped that this would dry the meat out faster and make salting it a bit easier. She wagered it would take at least an hour, enough time to dry the meat and then still make a few more hours time on foot. She still had ten strips that she could eat now, once they were cooked of course; but first the corspe needed to be disposed off. She had a little trouble pushing it underground, due to its sheer size; but was successful in the end. With that out of the way, she took the flat stone and lay it on the ground.

She then proceeded to form a few handseals and blow a steady stream of weak flames directly onto the meat. It shriveled up quickly, both burning and cooking at the same time. She didn't care so much if she'd burned it, though she liked luxury; in the end food was still food, no matter how burned it was. It barely a minute to cook the meat, after which she blew a steady stream of wind onto to cool it down. Once it was cooled, she gathered the pieces and began to eat; it was better tasting than the wild cats, juicier somehow. Though, it still wasn't the best meat she'd ever had and quite tough to chew.

Once she finished, she lay on the ground; positioning hands underneath her head and closed her eyes for a nap, the whole time at least one of her clones was awake; making sure that nothing got in. It wouldn't do for her to die in her sleep, thats for sure. She was awoken to one of her clones tapping her on the arm, waking her exactly after one hour of sleep. She looked around bleary eyed; noting that the other clone was asleep as well. With a sigh, she formed another handseal and dispersed the clone; grunting as she took on their exhaustion. It could've been worse though, if the clones hadn't taken it in turns to sleep themselves.

She immediately went over to the meat, which had darkened in the hour it was drying for. She experimentally gave one piece a bite, chewing and swallowing. It was certainly dry alright and the warm fire had done the job of cooking it through, now she just had to salt it. From her bag of supplies, she took out a roll of smooth cloth and a bag of salt. Once the cloth was spread out, she starting spreaing salt over it; making sure to cover most if not all of it. She then took up the strips of meat and began laying them on the cloth.

Once done, she took the salt again and started spreading it over the meat; all this salt might have seemed like overkill, but salt was a great preservative for things like meat. This would make her little snacks last for a week at least. Once it was all finished, she rolled the cloth back up and tied it off at both ends; effectively trapping the meat in a little salty heaven. With that all out of the way, she cleared up after herself and then let herself sink into the ground; if there was anything outside waiting to get in, she would be able to sense it. Thankfully, she seemed to be alone.

With that, Lera began her adventure once more; cautiously making her way throughout the forest and hopefully towards the place Fujitora was camped. Despite her hopes, she didn't think she would be finding his hidey hole any time soon and that honestly suited her just fine. The longer she spent out here, the more training she would get out of it. All things considered, she hadn't had an easy time so far for sure; but she hadn't come across anything that she could not yet handle either. Keeping this in mind, she was expecting things to get exponentially harder.

A thought occured to Lera for a moment, how would she survive here if she didn't find running water; but then she remembered that she could actually create water now, so that wouldn't be an issue. She was letting her thoughts run when a sudden light caught her attention, a light shining through the trees straight ahead. When she considered what had happened the first time she'd seen light through the tree, she was more than a little dubious but she would never find out if she didn't investigate it.* - Mon Oct 26 13:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped through the trees a little hesitantly, surprised to find that it was just a clearing within the forest; a collection of a few stones in the middle. She was curious about its purpose, for their didn't seem to be anything of worth around; but then she noticed the large birds nest in the middle. It was huge for a nest, larger than any natural bird of prey; she wondered what it could belong to. She soon found out, a loud squawk alerting her to the presence in the sky. She looked up to see a hail of feathers flying towards her, without enough time to dodge she did the next best thing.

With a clap of her hands, she breathed in deep and blew out a gale. The gale connected with the feathers, knocking them out of the sky before continuing onto the bird. Unfortunately, it seemed to do little else other than unbalance the bird; she wasn't close enough to knock it down. Looking at the bird closely, she could see that it was extremely large and possibly very fast. It had a similar appearence to a vulture, with a long neck just asking to be broken in two. She felt like this one would be easier than the bull and in a way she was right, the hard part however was catching it.

She soon found how hard that would be when the bird flew right for her, reaching speeds she hadn't thought possible for a bird so big. She escaped by sinking beneath the earth, feeling rather than seeing, the bird slice through several trees with its razor sharp wings. Her first thought here was to kill it with fire, but she also wanted to provide herself with a greater test and make use of samehada. The way she thought of was once again a great risk to her own safety, yet she still wanted to take it; risks were the fastest way for her to gain strength right now.

With a smile, she popped up above ground; searching for the bird of prey. It didn't take her long to find it, hovering high above the rocks also searching for her. They laid eyes on each other for a few moments, before the bird tucked into another dive; heading straight for her. It was impossibly fast, she had to react with the perfect timing otherwise she would die. As it flew towards her, she was lightening her body; feeling herself tak on the weight of a feather. Within a few moments more, the bird was upon her.

Her timing was thankfully perfect, she jumped mere moments before it hit her; floating upwards above the bird and twisting at the same time. She lunged out with Samehada, slamming the blade against its neck. As she expected, the birds neck was quite weak; likely its entire body was. Having been reliant of range and speed, it hadn't had the body to withstand attacks. The neck expectently went crunch, snapping in two and cutting off the connection to the rest of its body. It crashed through the trees, eventually coming to a rest in a large heap. She didn't bother checking if it was dead, even if it wasn't it would be soon.

Now though, she was quite tired and starting to believe Fuji's words that she would be fighting for her life every step of the way. She needed to sleep and that meant finding somewhere safe. With a sigh, she gathered her wits and sank into the ground; using her sensory ability whilst underneath to locate a suitable place. It didn't take her long to find one, a small cove of trees; creating a makeshift cave, it didn't feel occupied and hopefully she wasn't wrong about that.

Thankfully, when she arrived, it seemed she'd been right; there was no creature waiting to take a bite in here, at least none that she could see. To be extra safe; she formed several handseals and started lining the walls with solid rock, as solid as she could make it. Then she went to the entrance and created several layers of mud wall, leaving enough of a gap so that she could breathe. It wasn't too difficult to stay warm, she just regulated her Katon chakra throughout her body; letting the warmth spread. From there, she fell asleep; though a part of her brain never fully switched off, ears open for attackers.* - Mon Oct 26 14:02:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) found herself suddenly sucked into a vacuum hole, tumbling downwards at an explosive rate until she was spat out into a ravine. Her instincts kicked in almost immediately, lightening her weight so she would not fall any further. It was then that she saw the falcons, hundreds of them blotting out the sky. With a curse under neath her breath, she flew down to the bottom; landing gracefully ontop of the flowing water.

She spared no time in forming a handseal, summoning four clones positioned around her. In turn each and every clone started forming handseals of their own, preparing to light the place up.* - Mon Oct 26 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dove down into the water, attempting to reach the bottom as quickly as she could; her heavy gear helped her in this. If the bottom was made of earth as expected, then she would attempt to sink into it and hide within the earth for a while. Her clones however, would be working hard at murdering each and every one of the falcons. The method to do so was quite a simple one; having already formed their handseals, they breathing out huge clouds of gas. Even as this was happening though, two of the clones dispersed from the Falcons attacks.

All they needed though, was one little spark and allowing itself to succumb to attacks in the process; one clone could provide. In the centre of its palm, a spark ignited into a ball of flame. As soon as it did, the gas would ignite; sending up a giant ball of flame throughout the entire area.* - Mon Oct 26 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let her clones be finished off, they stood no more chances of getting any more jutsu out in their current state. Lera herself 'swam' through the ground, navigating to a point on the river where the falcons were not swarming. She could sense them as a large swarm, a disturbance in the force so-to-speak(sorry , I had to). Once she reached it, she jumped back up above ground; pointing her attentions to the swarm as a whole.

She quickly formed three handseals, drawing in a great breath. When she exhaled, she released a swarm of wind shards; capable of ripping through muscle and sinew with ease. With any luck this would remove a good amount of the remaining falcons.* - Mon Oct 26 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched the falcons go with a nod, either they'd lost interest or didn't want to lose any more of their number. Either way, she seemed to be mostly safe from them now. For now, she had to think of what to do; reaching Fujitora could be as easy as flying up and seeing the base from afar. However, in doing so she would be defenseless if those Falcons decided to attack again. She could also follow the river, there may well be creatures hiding underneath; but it was better here than waiting for an attack from any possible direction in the forest.

It was then that a simple idea occured to her. She took a bite from her thumb, spreading blood across her palm and forming some handseals. When she brought her hand down to the water, a small wolf would appear at her side. The wolf let out a little curse, nearly falling into the water; it activated Suimen at the last moment to prevent that.

"Master! Why did you summon me on water?" The wolf spoke in an obviously feminite tone, she was still young but old enough to find her own way "Sorry Jenna, I need to borrow your senses. Can you warn me before I'm attacked?"

The wolf regarded her with a roll of the eyes, looking around the area with a little wolfy frown "Sure master...but...I don't like this place. It doesn't feel right. Where are we going first?"

"Well, I think the safest route is to follow the river here; but I'm not sure it will lead me to the goal. For now, we'll continue down the river; if you catch any weird scents tell me alright?" The wolf gave her a nod before trotting down the river after her.* - Mon Oct 26 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Jenna suddenly turned, staring at the bushes hiding the invisible entity "Master, over there; somethings following us!"

Lera went with the 'he who strikes first wins' motto here, pulling out another clone for a quick combination. Her clone clapped its hands together while Lera formed another five. The result was a giant ball of fire from Lera and a humungous gust of wind from the clone, coating the entire area in flames. Hopefully whatever had been hiding there had not been friendly and if it wasn't then hopefully it was dead.

"Good call Jenna."* - Mon Oct 26 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gripped Jenna by the waste and jumped high, allowing the tiger to despose of her clone easily; she continue to rise higher into the sky, until she was well out of the creatures reach. Now she just had to think of a strategy whilst up here, she couldn't use jutsu and fly at the same time; so it had to be something else. For the moment she just watched the tiger, curious as to what it would do now; it was oddly fast for its size and seemed to resist her fire somehow. Whatever it was, it was a problem.* - Mon Oct 26 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) tucked her legs in as the tiger jumped, rising a little bit higher as she did; however, this jump also left it defenseless to attack. As it fell, so did Lera; she removed her jutsu's effect and began to drop. Now that she was no longer under the effects of the lightweight  jutsu; she could channel fuuton chakra to her hand to form an impossibly sharp blade.

Her intention was to fall right by the tiger, landing gracefully on her feet. If all went well, then her hand would have simply traveled through the tigers neck; like a hot knife through butter.* - Mon Oct 26 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started channeling chakra throughout her body as she gripped the hilt of samehada, her skin turned a darker brown; providing her with a boost of strength she needed to block such an attack. With Samehada held across her body it would hopefully prove an effective shield. At the same time, she jumped barely a centimetre off the ground; using the tigers attack strength to push her back and out of the way.* - Mon Oct 26 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) knew full well that samehada could possibly cut through fire such as that, but she didn't trust her skill enough to actually do it. She also knew from her short time with Samehada that it despised fire, she understood why. She quickly dropped Jenna to the ground, who landed and bounded several feet behind her. Then, clasping her hands together; she spat out a great torrent of mud. The mud came into contact with the floor and shot upwards into a large thick wall; hopefully the wall was enough to block flames of this magnitude while Lera moved backwards.* - Mon Oct 26 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled the moment the first fireball struck her wall, Jenna was quickly dissapearing out of sigh; hiding behind a bush, Lera was confident she could stay safe using her nose. With Jenna in safety, she dropped backwards; hitting the earth and continuing down. When the Tiger charged through the smoke, it would simply find that she wasn't there anymore. While it meandered about above ground, she would wait for the opportune moment....

This tiger...its gonna TASTE GREAT!* - Mon Oct 26 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wasn't going to let her tiger friend escape...oh no, she wanted tiger for breakfast and she was going to get it. As it stomped off, Lera shot up and out of the ground; already channeling chakra throughough her body for that extra strength. Then, with Samehada raised above her head; she aimed to slaming it down onto the tigers neck, with all the strength she could muster. To make matters worse for the tiger, she aimed for the spot she'd injured with her hellstab before.* - Mon Oct 26 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) landed lightly on the floor, slamming the blade down on the tiger just a few more times to be sure it was truly dead. Once she was sure, she called Jenna back over; patting the wolf on the head before forming a single handseal. Springing up around her was a dome of hardened rock; she attempted to add multiple layers to protect from likely predators. Then, with Jenna at her side; her potent nose on watch. Lera took a seat with the intention of recovering her chakra. Though her pools were beyond immense, she had still used about thirty percent with all those jutsu; it was better to be safe than sorry.* - Mon Oct 26 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) literally ate the tiger while she was resting, she kept the fire to an absolute minimum; using her jutsus on their lowest settings to set the tiger meat sizzling, Jenna of course at hers raw. However, as soon as Jenna had eaten she dissapeared back to wherever the wolf summons went; she couldn't stay out for too many hours at a time. After she was done, she pushed the tigers body deep into the earth and spent the rest of her peace recovering chakra.* - Mon Oct 26 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt empowered by the beasts meat and soon allowed herself to get up and continued, the rock dome around her simply crumbled away as she walked through it; leaving it to fall into rubble behind her. Without Jenna besides her, she would have a harder time detecting enemies before they approached. So to make up for it, she summoned two clones; clones that would tripple her coverage of the area around her.* - Mon Oct 26 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't quite believe that there was nothing attacking her now, she sort've wished Jenna was able to come out; she'd never summoned a different wolf before, maybe she would have to risk it. Biting into her thumb again, she went through the necessary motions to summon another wolf. Thankfully, one did appeared in a puff of smoke; approximately the same size as Jenna. It blinked a few times at Lera before exclaiming in a male adolescent voice "Oh! You must be Lera, sis told me alot about ya. What can i do for ya miss?"

Lera smiled at the little wolf, patting it on the head "I need you to do what Jenna did for me before, sniff out any dangers before they attack me. Can you do that for me?" the wolf nodded its little head up and down "Yup! I sure can!"

With the wolf at her side, she certainly felt a lot safer; albeit she remained cautious and alert to any dangers the wolf might not be able to detect.* - Mon Oct 26 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rushed off towards the scene of the blast, only to come to a sudden stop to erect a great wall of mud in front of her. The explosion might not have reached her but it was better to be safe in this situation.* - Mon Oct 26 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned the the wild hog and spat out a stream of flames, instant hog roast! Excellent!* - Mon Oct 26 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ran from behind her wall, closing in on the scene of the fight; her wolf and two clones ran close behind her, each one couldn't help but exclaim when they saw the fight. It was some sort of massive beast wreathed in flames, a girl was fighting it nearby; with her life on the line it seemed. She wanted to help the girl, but was held back by a ring of flames that she just could not walk past.* - Mon Oct 26 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned around and walked away, she coulda vaguley be heard muttering the words "lolno."* - Mon Oct 26 19:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly lifted her eyelids, breathing in the dank musty air; she felt well rested and generally in pretty good shape all things considered. The weird energetic feeling she'd gained from eating that tiger before still remained in her body, though she had no idea as to what it meant. With a sigh, she took up a few of the salted strips of meat she had left and munched through them; before creating some water to drink.

Once she felt awake enough, she pushed her way through the stone walls she'd erected and beheld the morning forest. Yesterday had been quite hectic, with battles against giant birds, giant bulls, more giant birds and even a giant fire breathing tiger. Then she'd witnessed that girl Marissa battling what she could only have described as a demon, she hoped the girl had made it through okay. With all these fire based monsters around, she could see where Fujitora had gotten his Katon techniques from.

The forest seemed quiet today, besides the ocasional shiver from Samehada there was no movement around her. She found this odd, she hadn't been attacked since that tiger yesterday; were the animals of the forest simply leaving her be now? Somehow she highly doubted that, there had to be another reason of some kind. After a good twenty minutes of walking she finally came out into another clearing, a small stone building rested in the middle.

With as much caution as she could muster, she approached the building; taking it slow while she looked around for potential enemies. She made it to the building with little issue, everything seemed quiet...a little too quiet. Inscribed on the door appeared to be a paragraph of words; there was no discernable way of opening the door and when she pressed her ear against the door all she could hear was a faint whistle. If she didn't know better...she could almost say it sounded like breathing.

Placing her hands on the door, she gave a great heave; attempting to push it open with pure brute strength. The door didn't even budge, it was like it was part of the wall. Assuming that it was the only way to open it, she pulled back and started to read the paragraph etched into the stone. It read as such 'I am three parts in one. The first a beast with poison in its fangs and emerald scales to match. The second a prey by nature but with horns and hooves that strike fear into the hearts of many. The final a great king, a golden creature with a mane to match.'

She puzzled over that for a few moments, staring at the riddle; for it was obviously a riddle. It seemed to be describing three different animals, but what she didn't understand was the 'three parts of one'. For now, she would figure out what animals it described; though they did seem quite obvious. 'A beast with poison fangs and emerald scales' that could only be a snake, she knew of no other animal that matched that description. 'A prey by nature, with horns and hoove' there were many creatures with horns and many with hooves; but few with both and even fewer were prey. The second animal had to be a goat.

The last one was probably the easiest of the three to guess 'A great king, a golden mane' it was too obvious in all honesty. The third had to be a lion. So she'd figured out the three animals, but what did the 'three parts of one' mean? She puzzled over it for a few minutes and the only thing that made real sense was that it somehow combined all three animals into one being. If such a thing were to exist, it could only be called a monstrosity.

She remembered reading a book quite a long time ago, it was lucky she had almost perfect recall; otherwise she might not have remembered this at all. It had been a book about mytholgical creatures and one such creature did match the description on this door. A creature that had the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of a snake...a chimera. She turned her gaze back to the door, surprised to see that the words had fallen away to be replaced with one simple phrase 'SAY MINE NAME AND PROVE THY WORTH'

With a little bit of trepidation, she whispered the word "Chimera" under her breath; not surprised to hear a solid clunk and the grinding of side as the door slid inwards. The inside was complete darkness, but she could just see some movement in the shadows. The darkness vanished when whatever was inside opened its mouth, revealing the orange glow of fire from within. She beheld the creature, a creature of three parts in one; the chimera. It was as monstrous as she could imagine.

The Chimera let off a roar of immense proportions; blasting her with its acrid sulphurous breath. She could only dive to the side as a great ball of fire followed close after it, the building it housed itself in remained completely undamaged from the spectacle. As Lera came back to her feet, the Chimera bounded outside the building; its abnormally muscled goat legs carrying its size with ease. It must have been at least 8 feet off the ground, without even standing on its hind legs; it was much bigger than expected.

For now she had to find a way of dealing with it, so as it fired another blast of fire towards her; she formed her handseals and slammed both hands into the ground. With ground cave a great crack before it rose up infront of her as a wall, blocking the blast of flame effectively. She couldn't only defend though, she had to go on the attack as well. To start, she formed a series of five handseals; before jabbing her palms forwards at the wall to send a cataclysmic electrical shock through it.

With Lightning being the inherent weakness for Earth, her wall exploded outwards; hitting the chimera with a multitude of electrified shards. It shrieks told her that it had hurt it, but it was more annoyed than damaged. However, she used this moment of distraction; gripping Samehada by the hilt and lunging forwards. The chimera opened its mouth to breath flames, just as Lera was also channeling chakra through her body for the Domu technique. To stop its fire, she went underneath and jabbed Samehada up into its jaw; her strength was more than adequate to slam its mouth shut.

The flames erupted inside the chimera's mouth, causing a blast of black smoke to billow from the corners of its mouth and its nose. It roared in pain as its teeth shattered and tongue was burned by its own flames; the first time it had been bested like this. The snake tail whipped around, aiming to clamp its jaws around Lera. She could see the clear toxic goo that dribble from its fange, just a little bit of that would likely be enough to kill her; she couldn't afford even the tinest of scratches.

She leaned to the side at the last moment, avoiding a bite from the snake and lashing out with her hand. Though she could have easily cut the snakes head off with her hell stab, she instead chose to grab it; clamping its jaws shut with her tight grip and giving a vicious tug. The Chimera roared with rage once again, rearing up on its hind legs to bring a hoof down on her head. Those hooves had the strength to crush rocks with ease, she couldn't block it with her bare hands for sure.

Leaning down into a crouch, she positioned Samehada so its point was facing upwards. Then with the full strength of her body, she lunged upwards; slamming the point of Samehada into the chimera's chest. She undestandably felt and heard the crack of bones as the Chimera roared in yet more pain. It may have been a mythical creature but the way it fought was without intelligence, the three parts of itself obviously waged war on each other. If the three couldn't communicate and coordinate attacks, then it was an easy victory.

Even she couldn't hold the great beasts body up for long, so she gave one last push with samehada before pulling it back to swing down on the tail she still held. It slammed into the snakes tail and cut through it as she used Samehada's saw like nature to shre the skin. As she jumped back, she threw the still writhing snake tail to the side and beheld the Chimera. It was a sorry state, a powerful creature by all means; but sadly unable to utilise its strength due to its divided nature.

The beast still growled at her, though favouring its side; it seemed to still be expecting a fight, but made no move to attack her. Instead a great booming voice echoed within Lera's head, deep and powerfull 'END IT'. Whatever this test was, it seemed to want her to kill the beast before her; she was reluctant to do so considering its inability to fight any longer. So Lera spoke out to this voice "Why? It obviously can't fight anymore, why not just leave it in peace" even as she said this, she knew it was the right thing to do.

The chimera stopped growling and fell inert, tumbling to the ground and vanishing in a cloud of smoke. With a frown, she repositioned Samehada on her back and approached the stone building. The door remained open and light flooded the inside, it wasn't so big; just big enough to fit the chimera, but nothing more. There was a small trickled of water dribbling from a hole in the wall and a slab of stone positioned at the back of the room. Upon investigating the slab, she noted the writing; reading it with a raised eyebrow.

'A test of Knowledge and a test of strength. Thee hath proven thyself traveler. Water is thy reward' she frowned at the writing, watching as it dissapeared from the slab and she turned her attentions to the water. It was barely a trickle, how that was a reward of any kind was anyone guess. With a simple shrug, she positioned her hand underneath the trickle and then raised it to her mouth. The water was oddly sweet, almost as if it had a spoonful of sugar in it; but she noticed no other aspects.

It was when she swallowed that the effect took place. She suddenly felt like she'd eaten a full and satisfying meal, her energy and strength returned ten-fold; she didn't feel at all like she'd just been fighting for her life. Despite her love for luxury, Lera had never been a greedy one; though she could have easily cupped the water water some more or even stored it. She didn't feel the need to do so, it would ruin the purpose of this survival excercise if she had some magical water that kept her alive no matter what.

So she left the building through the door, stretching in the sun. The door slammed shut behind her, making her jump and spin around with her guard up; she relaxed as soon as she saw that it was only the door. There was a new piece of writing on the door, written in place of the riddle. It simply said 'A test of greed, Thy hath succeeded', so if she'd taken the water or drank more than she needed; then it probably would have failed and perhaps even locked her in there. Thank god she hadn't wanted the water.

She didn't know if there would be any more of these 'tests' and she didn't really care, until an decriped figure left the forest and wandered towards her. She watched the figure move towards her with a raised eyebrow, it shambled with the walk of an elder; its open hood revealing the face of an impossibly ancient woman. In a forest full of monsters and who knows what other dangers, how could an old barely moving old woman make through alive? That was her first massive clue that this wasn't just an old woman, this was obviously another sort of test.

She allowed the woman to approach her, through remained cautious of an attack; as soon as she was close enough, her hood fell back to reveal the extent of her appearence. She was practically skeletal, skin stretched so thin that the bone was visible underneath; she hardly looked capable of standing, never mind walking. The old woman opened her mouth, attempting to come out with some words; it seemed to take a few moments before she could talk but eventually she came out with "pl...ease...wa..ter.."

Lera widened her eyes, this was so obviously another test; but what kind of test? The only way to find out would be to do what she would normaly do in this situation. She pulled off her jacket, and ran over to the woman; wrapping it around her body and guiding her to a safer spot away from the door. Lera was a prideful woman, but she would also never allow an innocent to suffer if she had the power to stop it. Though she could have easily just conjured up some water to help the lady, she knew that the water she wanted was not just the normal water.

So she turned back to the door of the stone building, wandering closer to the door to see that as she'd expected; there was more writing there. This time it said 'If thy would risk thyself to help thyne neighbour. Speak mine name'. Knowing that she would probably have to fight the chimera again, she whispered its name and pulled Samehada from her back; prepared to fight once again. The door slammed open, much faster than before; a gout of fire immediately followed after it. She was tempted to cut through it, but instead chose to dive away. It was good that she did, because the jaws of a much larger snake than last time snapped shut behind her.

She moved a short distance away, shocked when a full Nemean lion charged out of the door; followed closely by a huge mountain goat and a great python. The Chimera had no come out as one this time, it had come out in its three seperate parts. This wasn't going to be quite as easy as last time it seemed. The first thing she had to do was even the odds a bit, so she formed a handseal and created three clones to stand with her. Just as two of her clones were preparing jutsu, the snake started to slither towards the point where she'd left the old woman.

Cursing under her breath, Lera jumped up into the sky; leaving her three clones to hold the goat and Lion back. She flew quickly over towards the python, dropping out of the sky above it. With her hand held out in the shape of a blade, she dropped ontop of the python; shoving her hand all the way down to the wrist right into the pythons head. It writhed for a few moments before falling still. However, it had the last laugh; as Lera pulled her hand out a puff of purple smoke followed after it. She involuntarily breathed the smoke in, feeling immediately that it was poison.

She coughed a few times, already starting to feel dizzy and nauseos; but she couldn't afford to rest, not with the Lion and goat still at large. Turning around, she could see that her clones had combined a Suiton, Doton and Raiton technique. Sending a stream of electrified watery mud, right for the Lion. The stream made contact, causing the Lion to shriek with pain and stumble backwards; but it wasn't dead. Oddly enough, the Goat was the one who gave the death blow. This explained why the chimera had been weak, the goat understandably hated the Lion.

It reared back its hooved and brought them down onto the Lions head; slamming it into the ground and crushing it like a watermellon. It gave a loud bleat of victory before running off into the forest, she decided to let it go; it was a creature of prey and they had no real reason to pursue it. As soon as it was gone, her clones vanished of their own accord and Lera fell to her knees; coughing a few times before vomiting into the grass. This poison was actually killing her, her only chance to live now was the water in the stone building.

She forced herself up and went to pick the elder up, the woman clung to her neck; a musty smell emnating from her decrepid form. As soon as they were inside the building Lera confronted the barely flowing water with a look of horror. There was barely any left, probably enough for a single mouthful...most certainly not enough for two people. She grimaced and looked to the new writing on the wall, reading it with a growing sense of horror 'Thee hath passed the test, but now thee is dieing. Make thy choice, for there be only enough water for one.'

Lera scrunched up her face, she wanted to live; to see Violet again more than anything, but when she finally died...could she really confront all her loved ones with the knowledge that she'd rated her life above anothers? The answer was no, she couldn't. So with a sad sigh, she cupped a hand under the trickle; gathering the bare amount that was there and slowly fed it into the Elders mouth. The woman gulped it down, her breathing growing less raspy by the moment. Once she was done, Lera slumpped against the wall; her vision growing blurry and her nausea growing. She just wished she had a chance to apologize to Violet for dieing like this.

A bright like awoke her from her stupor, it emnated from the old woman; growing brighter as her form itself grew higher. A few moments later, Lera's vision cleared and a being she could only Describe as Angelic stood before her. A woman of unparralelled beauty. The woman looked down on Lera for a few moments before finally opening her mouth in a warm smile and speaking 'Thee hath pass all mine tests. Thee are worthy of enlightenment. Go with knowledge of thyself oh selfless one.' the woman the pointed a finger to Lera, a bright light flooding her mind along with knowledge.

It was at that moment that she opened her eyes, finding herself standing on the same clearing as before; now facing the door of the building. Only, the door wasn't a door at all; on close inspection it appeared it could not even be opened. Inscribed into the door was a seal, though it was now spent. If Lera had to guess, then at the moment she'd laid eyes on the door she had been placed under a genjutsu. Though it had all seemed so frighteningly real. Still, she had not gone through it for nothing; aspects of the genjutsu still lingered with her and she understood herself better than ever before.

With a happy sigh, she settled into a light stroll away from the building; there was still so much of herself to improve, but now she liked herself just a little more. It was nice to know that if the situation arose, she would give her life to protect another; hopefully a situation like that never would arise, but she now at least saw herself for the selfless girl she was. Her time in the labyrinth was proving to be more fruitful then she could have ever anticipated, it was still early days however; by the end of these few months, she intended to have mastered this blade and this labyrinth in their entirities.* - Tue Oct 27 13:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) flipped samehada over her head, holding it up in one hand so she could stare at balefully. It was difficult to get the blade to co-operate with her, even though she'd already been fighting and surviving with it in the Labyrinth for over a week. Instead it just continued to take her chakra, giving nothing back in return. That isn't to say it wasn't a useful blade, even if she couldn't fully control it; it still took chakra from the enemies she struck. In a great deal of battles such a thing proved to be pretty useful.

With a sigh, she stowed Samehada on her back and set to walking. Living in the forest was starting become the norm for her, though she missed human contact more than she realised. With everything that had happened; Lera considered herself to have very few true friends. Besides her family and a few other people like Violet and Nina, she didn't have much human contact besides those few. Now that she was completely alone and isolated however, she was finding that she missed people. Monsters and wild animals weren't paticularly good company, especially if they were trying to eat you.

Continuing through the forest, she caught her eye on a glint; a shimmer of light coming from some object through the trees. She knew it was probably some other 'test' provided by the labyrinth, or just something playing a trick on her eyes; But curiosity was getting the better of her. With Samehada's hilt gripped firmly, she started the walk towards the source of light; slipping through the trees and bushes. It was further away than expected, taking almost a full half hour for her to reach it and when she did she could only stare at the object with raised eyebrows.

The only thing that went through her mind was 'what the hell is a mirror doing in the middle of a forest??'. It was a fancy thing, stood straight on the groud with no apparent props to hold it up; it looked more like it was fastened to the ground somehow. Around the mirror was a gold and silver lining, she could just barely see from her position what looked like words etched around the edges. Though she didn't trust it, she couldn't help but move closer; somehow drawn towards the glittering surface like a dog to meat.

She was unable to look into the mirror itself, everytime she tried some overwhelming feeling told her to stop. So instead she focused her eyes on the edges and the words that were inscribed there. Once she was close enough to read, she ran her eyes over the words several times over; trying to decipher their meaning. The words followed as such 'THY GREATEST ENEMY IS THYSELF'. She continued to ponder the words until she noticed a new feeling, the urge to keep her eyes away from the mirror had gone; replaced by a new urge, an urge to look into it no matter the cost.

The logical part of her brain understood that this was probably a bad idea. So she used every ounce of her will to fight against the compulsion, but to no avail. Her eyes slowly dragged down to the mirror, resting on her reflection. Only it was different to her normal reflection, she noticed that difference immediately. It was -moving-, moving when she wasn't. She stared at the image with a dawning sense of dread, her imagination running wild with what this could be. She had an idea...but it couldn't be, could it? There was no possible way of doing something like that surely.

Yet even a skeptic had to reform their views in front of physical evidence. So when her reflection took a step forwards -out- of the mirror, Lera had to believe what she was seeing. Somehow, through some unknown jutsu; she was being made to fight herself. Obviously she knew clone techniques were possible...but this was different, this felt like her like it was really her. The only noticeable difference was that all her features were completely mirrored. Anticpating the fight, Lera pulled Samehada from her back; grimacing when the copy pulled hers too. If this copy held the same skill and strength as her...then this could be trouble.

The mirror moved first, stepping forwards and swinging its weapon towards her. She raised Samehada. clashing the two together with a great crash of noise. Samehada seemed to squirm a bit under her grip, though from the noises it made it seemed more angry at an attempt to copy it then anything. Thankfully, the mirrors weapon seemed inert; nothing more than an oversized shark sword. Though the Mirror could copy her, it was good to know it couldn't copy a legendary sword like Samehada. It mattered little though, the two struggled against each others strength; equally matched in every way.

This continued for a few seconds, before Lera finally pulled back and went in with a few swings of Samehada. The copy met her blow for blow, giving and taking in equal strides; They were too evenly matched, neither could take any ground against the other. Lera was unwilling to start throwing jutsu around, if they were so equally matched then any of her jutsu would just find themselves blocked or returned. The first one to fire a jutsu here may well be the one to lose the fight, something neither wanted.

With this in mind, they simply continued to bash at each other in equal grounds; though she had to admit that it was pretty good training to fight a perfect replica of yourself. Perhaps that was a point to this 'test', to overcome your own weaknesses and beat yourself in open combat. She thought back to the words 'Thy worst enemy is thyself' and it all made sense in a weird kind of way. She really was her own worst enemy because who else knew her better than she did. With that in mind, she decided to push on a weakness she knew she had; her weakness against the fast types.

After jumping away, she returned Samehada to her back and started bouncing on her toes; if she wanted to win then she had to be fast. The copy raised its eyebrows at this but lunged forwards anyway, intent on bringing its fake Samehada down on Lera's head. However, just as the clone lunged, Lera was lightening her body making herself that much faster. Fast enough to overwhelm her copy with just speed alone. Of course, it wouldn't work if her copy used the same technique; but by the time it realised it would hopefully be too late.

Using her lightened body to her advantage, lera shot forwards underneath the clones attack. As soon as she was underneath its guard, she lunged upwards; gripping it by the throat and attempting to bring it to the ground. Once there, she regained her usual weight and pressed her immenseley sharpened hell stab finger to the clones throat. She would've done the killing blow if the clone had not dissolve away to nothing. When she looked back at the mirror, she noticed that the compulsion to look into it was still their...meaning it still worked. This would prove to be good training indeed.* - Wed Oct 28 13:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dropped from a tree, bringing Samehada down point first onto the waiting wild cat. She'd come across an entire pack of them, skulking through the trees looking for prey; with their enhanced senses of smell they'd quickly noticed her. On her ventures through the forest, she'd already killed a good amount of these things; they had monstrous strength, but were pretty predicatable. She also had a feeling that she was probably actually stronger, physically anyway.

As she slammed Samehada down on the freakishly muscular wild cat, she could feel the bones snapping through out its body. It fell limp to the ground while it slowly died from various internal injuries. Samehada wasn't paticularly good at cutting opponents, but it was extremely good at shattering their bodies; which did just fine for Lera. While the wild cat lay dieing on the ground, she turned to the others; Lera had already dispatched three of them, four with the one dieing on the ground.

They may have bene hungry for a meal, but they were also not stupid; they knew they faced an opponent that was possibly too strong for her. Lera wasn't fond of killing if she didn't have to either, so she stood and waited for the cats to make a decision. One of the remaining cats made that decision, lunging at her with its claws outstretched. It looked smaller than the others, probably a young male trying to raise its standing in the pack. A poor choice, for it led to its death.

With simple ease, she side-stepped the cat and brought Samehada down in a two handed swing. The weapon slammed into its back, throwing it to the ground with a sickening thud. This one, if anything, was lucky enough to die instantly from the blow. The strike had been strong enough to shatter every bone along its spine, killing it with the shock alone. With their youngest member killed easily, the wild cats all started to back away before turning to run off into the darkness of the forest. They would know to avoid the sight of Lera in the future.

With the wild cats gone, she lifted Samehada to take a look at it; she tried to have a 'conversation' with the blade at least once a day. Besides the odd wriggle and the ocasional grunt, it didn't really aknowledge much of what she said. It had at least, stopped sucking away at her chakra as much; it still took a little more than it probably needed, but it was at a much more manageable rate now. If she just made sure to keep her chakra levels at a good level, then she could deal with it. Sighing quietly, she slipped the blade back on her back and continued her walk through the forest; by now she'd explored a great portion, but there were sure to be little hidden things she had no knowledge of it.* - Thu Oct 29 19:35:53 2015
