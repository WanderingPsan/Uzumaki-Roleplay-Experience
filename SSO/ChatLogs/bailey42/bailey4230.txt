<br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grunted while her fingers slipped of the inside of the snakes throat, this left her with two options; either she use her maximum of eighteen clones to hopefully burst he way out...or she force it to throw her up. Either one was a risky thing to do, but decided on making it throw her up. Channeling chakra to her abdomen, she began creating large amounts of mud; which she continuously spat out and down the snakes throat. It was fortunate this technique was one that did not require handseals....* - Fri Nov  6 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rolled out of Manda's mouth, immediately fixing her eyes back on the beast. It was already rearing up to crush her, so she continued rolling sideways in an attempts to avoid it. After pushing herself into a roll, she formed a few handseals and attempted to have four earthen spears shoot out of the ground from underneath the giant snake. If she wasn't fast enough to avoid it, then she at least hoped that the spikes would give her time to get out of the way.* - Fri Nov  6 20:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt the water splash against and turned her gaze to Mizumi who'd apparently decided to go turn-coat. With the hope of escaping before Manda completely trapped them in and Mizumi was able to encapsulate her, she formed a single handseal in order to utilise shunshin and get as far as she possibly could. She did of course suffer the natural downsides to Shunshin and was momentarily open to attacks.* - Fri Nov  6 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sent a silent thank you to Ikaro for his help and to whatever benevolent god had pulled the giant snake away. If it was just Mizumi, she could handle it; or at least she thought so anyway. Gripping the hilt of Samehada, she made for a large swing; channeling chakra throughout her body as she did. With the added strength from her Domu technique and her natural strength, she hoped to do a fair amount of damage to the man.* - Fri Nov  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) actually did use her shunshin technique this time, attempting to escape the clones that had surrounded her completely. Though she was of course disoriented by the high speeds and thus ended up being knocked over by the wind she'd literally stepped right into.* - Fri Nov  6 22:02:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked up to see Ortho's approach, forming five handseals as he did. She was disoriented from her shunshin and unable to move fast but she didn't need to move to at least attempt this. Once her handseals were formed, she released an explosive blast of wind directly at the pouch already being pushed towards by Ortho's wind. She didn't know what was in it, but it probably wasn't going to be good for her either way. Whether Ikaro managed to save her or not, she hoped at least that keeping that pouch at least a little further away from her would protect her a bit. As soon as it was done, she turned her back to it and started to move; doing everything in her power to survive.* - Fri Nov  6 22:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) channeled chakra throughout her body, hardening her skin to a rock like consistency while she move. What happened next was a blur, either she was badly wounded by the explosion or she was dragged away by the mizukage, possibly protecting her further from the explosion in the process. Either way, there was little more she could do but resign herself to whatever came her way.* - Fri Nov  6 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You can leave if you like. - Sat Nov  7 11:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'll give it a try.. - Sat Nov  7 11:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *yawn* - Sat Nov  7 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled the large blade off her back and propped it upright on the ground  infront of her.

"What do we do now...hm, buddy?" yes, she was talking to a sword.* - Sat Nov  7 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll A little squeaking grunt could be heard, it sounded like it came from Lera. it hadn't, but thats what it seemed like.* - Sat Nov  7 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at Zenaki.* - Sat Nov  7 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Whats she been doing now...? - Sat Nov  7 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll With kiyoko coming closer she'd be able to see the blade/club...wriggle. As if it were trying to get comfortable.* - Sat Nov  7 11:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sat Nov  7 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Uh..... - Sat Nov  7 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Maybe... I should just.....go back to what I was doing. - Sat Nov  7 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raises and eyebrow and looks to the girl taking a seat next to her.

"Hmmm? Can I help you?"* - Sat Nov  7 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) burst out into a little giggle, the girls reaction amused her.

"You don't have to be nervous of me. I don't bite...though he might." she said whilst gesturing to Samehada.* - Sat Nov  7 11:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stroked the blade affectionately, it was hard to not like it despite its insatiable hunger for chakra.

"Well, he's quite hungry...all the time actually. I wouldn't reccomend touching him unless you're confident in your chakra reservers. Oh and he's not a clud, he may not look it but he's a blade."* - Sat Nov  7 11:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed again, while Samehada wiggled some more; he made sounds that sounded a lot like dissaproval.

"Woah woah, don't say that. You'll hurt his feelings. Though, if he keeps this up he really will get fat."* - Sat Nov  7 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of course he did, He is alive you know. - Sat Nov  7 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: But...how is that possible? - Sat Nov  7 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sat Nov  7 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Between me and you, he's quite a special blade. There are only a few others like him, though he's the only living blade. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh....I... I don't really know a whole lot about swords. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmmmm. Thats fine. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But yeah. Really don't touch him, he might take a little more from you than you'd like. He's taking chakra from me even now. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If he bites, why doesn't he eat yo--e-erg.. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well, he doesn't eat people. He eats chakra. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...Isn't that... sort of the same thing? Chakra is part of us. - Sat Nov  7 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I suppose, you can look at it that way. - Sat Nov  7 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You sound different. - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I sound different? How so? - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You aren't from this region are you? - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Oh no. I'm from Kirigakure. - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh, the wet place. - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Pfft, yeah. The 'wet place' - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its fine. I'm more of a wanderer now. - Sat Nov  7 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You don't --if you don't mind me asking, don't like your home anymore? - Sat Nov  7 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its not that no. I still send money and help out when I can., - Sat Nov  7 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But theres only two things I have left that I care for. Both are here. - Sat Nov  7 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhm. People. My father and brother to be specific. - Sat Nov  7 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Huh... still got your family, that's rare. - Sat Nov  7 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ah well. They're quite resiliant. - Sat Nov  7 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: What about you? hm? Do you have anyone you care for? - Sat Nov  7 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Fairly demanding family. - Sat Nov  7 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I see.... - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Demanding  is the nice word. - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Truth be told, I'm actually adopted. My biological father is dead, dunno where my mother is. - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: So...I suggest, you hold onto what you can get. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It isn't blood that makes a person family. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...blood just holds on ...with more resiliance. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I suppose. You do have a point, I hated my biological family as well. - Sat Nov  7 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Because as someone who's lost almost everything...even the smallest things are worth holding onto. - Sat Nov  7 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hm... - Sat Nov  7 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You don't look...very old to have lost so much. - Sat Nov  7 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Thats just the way of the shinobi world I suppose. - Sat Nov  7 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Makes me feel like I've wasted my life so far... we look similar in age. - Sat Nov  7 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I was just unlucky enough to be in the wrong places at the wrong times. - Sat Nov  7 12:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...but haven't you done more things you are proud of? - Sat Nov  7 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: ....No..not really. Like I said...I've never been where I was needed...things always seem to happen while I'm away... - Sat Nov  7 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Because as most paths tend to be...its one way. - Sat Nov  7 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Then...find another? - Sat Nov  7 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well. Quite simply I'm just not going to love anyone again, then i don't have to go through losing them again. - Sat Nov  7 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That's what this is about? - Sat Nov  7 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhm well. I suppose so. I'm just going to keep living I guess, I wouldn't say i'm better off alone...more like...people are better off without me. - Sat Nov  7 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...that's....just a -horrible- mentality. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: -Horrible-. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Yes it is, I don't want anyone to end up like me.  - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Just because they are with you doesn't mean that he will end up like you. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: No I mean. Uh. I've been in two serious relationships. The first was the owner of this sword, he died while I was not there to help him. - Sat Nov  7 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: The second died while I was in the same village, I was asleep. Its not a nice feeling...to be so close while so useless. - Sat Nov  7 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Both of those cases sound like they -were not- your fault at all. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe so, but it doesn't change the fact that I couldn't do anything. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hell I even failed to kill the man responsible. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Maybe you shoul learn that, bad things happen in life. You won't always be there to help but that doesn't make it your fault. Plus, if it did happen... maybe it was meant to happen. I know that sounds shitty but...I mean some people believe in that stuff. Destiny and what have you. - Sat Nov  7 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ah well...destiny or not. This is the path i've chosen. I'm hoping to become strong enough to stop these sorts of things from happening again. - Sat Nov  7 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You gave me the advice not to let go of that which I have. So you are saying if someone came along that potentially would mean something greater to you...you would avoid them? Is that not hypocritical? - Sat Nov  7 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I told you that because you shouldn't end up like me. - Sat Nov  7 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Soooooooo hypocritical?~ - Sat Nov  7 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Pretty much. - Sat Nov  7 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think you should get over this feeling that you shouldn't be happy and with someone. Things might look grim, may have been grim your entire life... but that doesn't mean it can't change. - Sat Nov  7 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well, you might be right. But it doesn't matter, Whatever happens happens I guess. Right now though...I have no intentions of doing anything like that. - Sat Nov  7 12:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Kiyoko Nakano. - Sat Nov  7 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her hand with a nod, shaking it lightly.

"Lera. Just Lera."* - Sat Nov  7 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh yes. - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Samehada....what does that mean? - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It means Shark Skin - Sat Nov  7 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: .....heh... I get it. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Cute. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmmm. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I must be pestering you, I'll head off. - Sat Nov  7 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its fine. I don't mind at all. - Sat Nov  7 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Honestly... I came over here because I thought you were crazy...talking to your 'club'...  - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey Sanoke. - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't seen you in a while... - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ortho...no he is alive... - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . THen why did Kana tell me he wasn't. - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Do you know where he is? - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No idea and no...he attacked me yesterday. - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I survived it seems...because he had a change of heart... - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . A change of heart? So there's good in him. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: They were my friends. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Yes I know. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How are things back in Kiri now? - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I intend to finish him as well. Though...not quite yet. - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's much more powerful than I thought. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) thinks:  . . Wow she is scary. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And things are...okay I think. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Good, no more attacks? - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --New? What. . . - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And besides Ortho's attempt on my life, no. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Do you know him? - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. I have no idea. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uhm. . . Well that's weird. Hrm. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He seems sincere enough, he's been putting his own money into rebuilding. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: he also holds similar abilities to Zetsumo... - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Those threads... - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Something to investigate. I'll do something about it. I get the feeling if I go to Kiri bluntly, I'll be  attacked. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, I don't think so. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Never hurts to be cautious. - Sat Nov  7 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No I haven't seen him. - Sat Nov  7 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll need to perfect my new jutsu before all of that, though. - Sat Nov  7 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: I see, Thanks. - Sat Nov  7 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. . .All of that chatter aside. - Sat Nov  7 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: WHat's up? I know things been hard on ya. But how are you? - Sat Nov  7 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...heh, you're about the seventh person to ask me that. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: All of that just went over my head. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm as well as I can be. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm, well alright. Stick around Suna a little longer. Things need to settle down in this world first. - Sat Nov  7 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? No, just someone I met recently. - Sat Nov  7 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: This man. . Trying to gauge at my eyes? No. . Just paranoia. - Sat Nov  7 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: A medic huh... - Sat Nov  7 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, a medic. Good, we need some more of those. Mainly cause. . Uhm. Our current crop isn't always as reliable as it can be. - Sat Nov  7 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why's that? - Sat Nov  7 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: One is sometimes busy. The other wants to be -paid- to heal. - Sat Nov  7 13:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gripped the hilt of Samehada and pulled it from her back, holding it up easily with a single hand; she hadn't been able to practice against a large blade wielder yet so this was going to be a good experience.

"Certainly."

Without any further ado, she charged forwards and swung her blade downwards towards Chikyu; she was aiming for the shoulder more than anything but had no desire to really hurt the girl.* - Sat Nov  7 14:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her eyebrows in surprise at the girls skillfull counter, she certainly knew how to use that sword. Samehada was knocked away as expected but with her superior strength shew as able to keep a firm grip on the hilt. Following up on that counter, she span her body round; using the momentum from Chikyu's block to slam Samehada into her side. On account of her twisting the blade so only the flat edge would strike, the attack was much slower than it might normally be.* - Sat Nov  7 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was surprised yet again by Chikyu's sudden counter attack, she'd more or less gathered that her advantage was quite a big one in this fight. Even if her skill with the sword was greater, Lera's physical attributes were simply better. It seemed like this was going to turn into a fight of who could overpower the other. Lera wasn't one to let herself lose though, while her Samehada was brought to the ground; she gripped the hilt with both her hands and began using her strength to the fullest.

Samehada was brought upwards to cover her body, while she pushed the flat of the blade towards Chikyu with all her might. She expected that with her strength she could probably throw the girl off her feet.* - Sat Nov  7 15:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped to the side, intending to perform a similar move to Chikyu. She raised Samehada and brought it down towards Chikyu's blade, intending to knock it downwards and unbalance the girl. She then continued into a right step, bringing samehada with her and attempting to slam the hilt into the girls chest. If all was succesfful, she hoped to subdue her completely.* - Sat Nov  7 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) figured Chikyu would probably know a bit of taijutsu as well, but this confirmed it. The misdirect might have worked, and indeed it did, but with samehada's length; something was bound to hit. With her hilt strike misdirected; she simple pressed her hand against Samehada and moved to push that into her body instead.* - Sat Nov  7 15:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt the sting of the bullet hit her in the shoulder, but thats all it was; a stinging sensation. She'd likely have a slight bruise but nothing more than that.

"Another interesting technique...but still, not quite enough."* - Sat Nov  7 18:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) activated her Domu armour once again and simply broke out of the wires via brute strength.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: A great strategy. . . . - Sat Nov  7 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) recieved a nice kick to the face, but for Momura it was like kicking solid rock. Lera's head tilted to the side from the kick, but she recieved little to no damage from it.

"Not bad not bad. hmmm...I want you to show me this other technique as well, is mud fine for your purposes?"* - Sat Nov  7 18:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: K-Kind of.. - Sat Nov  7 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let the punch rebound off her chest, she made the effort to also deactivate her Domu. So Hanai didn't hurt his hand.* - Sat Nov  7 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grunted as the fist slammed into her chest, Hanai...was not what he seemed. She stumbled backwards and fell on her ass, staring at the 'boy' with a wide eyed expression.

"Well damn....you're not quite what you seem are you?"* - Sat Nov  7 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No no...Don't apologise. That was good, You're most definitely at a higher level in Close combat then I am. - Sat Nov  7 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: S-Sorry. - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Jeez...feels like I got hit by a tree. - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I didn't mean it.... - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No need to apologise, my mistake for underestimating you. - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well...if you're that good. I don't need to hold back. Do I? - Sat Nov  7 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: M-Mmm..... - Sat Nov  7 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: I-I'm not that good.... - Sat Nov  7 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well then~ - Sat Nov  7 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9gg - Sat Nov  7 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jumped to her feet and clapped her hands together and pushed her palm forwards. It looked nothing more than a generic palm strike, but before it struck a great blast of wind flew from her palm. Intent on Throwing Hanai off his feet and sending him flying a few feet away.* - Sat Nov  7 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh wow! I haven't seen anyone able to make wind with just a punch! - Sat Nov  7 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: S-She's really strong. - Sat Nov  7 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: M-Maybe if I can at least keep up with her, I'd be able to protect Momura in the future. . . . - Sat Nov  7 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: It's a good... test. - Sat Nov  7 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: G-Go h-hanai!!! - Sat Nov  7 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) breathed in deeply and spat out a huge amount of mud, specifically aimed it at the boys feet; though it wouldn't do much after the initial shot, she hoped to make him slip on the mud. While he recovered from that, she began back stepping and preparing to use another jutsu. The kid was surprisingly strong, she would have to pull out a little more than intended to subdue him probably.* - Sat Nov  7 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched him go, dodging past the mud and running across the wall. She held a happy smile on her face, it'd been a while since she'd fought in a spar with her specialty. Whilst directing her chakra towards the mud, she formed a single handseal and created five clones from it. The clones rushed towards her, intent on acting as a defensive meat shield to Hanai's approach. Meanwhile, Lera took an even greater distance; preparing to use yet another jutsu. She figured that for his sheer brawn, he may well be susceptible to genjutsu and she intended to play on that.* - Sat Nov  7 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt the strike on the back of her head, though it didn't hurt that much it did catch her by surprise. She raised an eyebrow and twisted to the side, forming another handseal to spawn a single Shadow Clone. This clone attended to Momura, assentially blocking her path and waiting for the girl to attack.

As for the mud clones, they would indeed be damaged by shuriken; however as the shuriken sunk into their bodies whatever damage was simply repaired, though it used Lera's own chakra to do this. In order to prevent Hanai from reaching the original, they charged forwards; intent on blocking his path. Instead of attacking through, they seemed to attempt to...hug him.* - Sat Nov  7 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) thinks: Interesting, Another Gate user. - Sat Nov  7 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hadn't expected to need to use an escape method in this fight, but the boy was surprising her with every move he made. She had no idea what exactly he was doing, but she was well aware that it would be impossible to stop him should she stay on the ground. Channeling chakra throughout her body and to her legs, she pushed off the ground and jumped high into the sky. She didn't stop there however, she just kept rising until she was a good distance above the attacking pair.

Her mud clones would all consecutively turn to Hanai as Lera made her escape, one formed a single handseal and directed its chakra to both Hanai and Momura. If it worked as intended, a large earthen dome would rise upwards around the pair; essentially trapping them in.

The shadow clone would respond to the wires with a shrug, letting them wrap around her body. However, at the last moment it surged a small amount of chakra throughout its body; hoping to send a small charge of Raiton down the wires to numb Momura's arms.* - Sat Nov  7 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: O-Oh right.. - Sat Nov  7 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: She can fly.. - Sat Nov  7 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) thinks: Watching them spar motivates me. - Sat Nov  7 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) thinks: Oh, The gate i'm trying to get. - Sat Nov  7 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Interesting spar. - Sat Nov  7 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) flinched in surprise as her leg was grabbed, but it was no matter. Her technique Quickly extended to both Hanai and Momura; causing all three of them to continuously rise into the sky. While Hanai's technique did successfully pull her to his level, it mattered little for they would continuously rise higher and higher into the sky. Then reaching behind her back, she gripped Samehada and brandished it in one hand, she refrained from letting it actually touch Hanai; for fear of it taking too much chakra from him.

"Now whatever you do, don't drop her~"* - Sat Nov  7 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) continued to rise while Hanai dropped to the ground, however he soon vanished and appeared behind her; her was definitely fast, a taijutsu user beyond any she'd probably ever met. He would certainly make a good sparring partner in the future. She was unwilling to get grabbed from behind, even knowing that they would simply continue to rise. Instead, she quite simply burst into flames; surrounding her with a flaming orange aura. It would be quite painful and possibly even dangerous for Hanai to grab hold of this. The wires Momura had thrown were disintegrated before they could thouch her.

It went without saying, the moment she activated the fire shroud; she would begin to fall, being incapable of holding two jutsu at once. Meanwhile, her shadow clone inside the dome would dissapear and her four Doton clones would slowly sink into the ground and get themselves into position....* - Sat Nov  7 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed as Momura attempted to do exactly what her clones were about to, two leapt up from the grounds and went to catch him. The moment he was safe in their arms, one of the clones reformed into mud; covering his light burns with the cooled substance, it would likely be a relief. Lera herself, deactivated the fire shroud and dropped the ground into the waiting arms of another one of her clones.

"Apologies, I might have gone a little overboard there."* - Sat Nov  7 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let her clones go poof.* - Sat Nov  7 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh, sure I guess. - Sat Nov  7 20:01:04 2015
