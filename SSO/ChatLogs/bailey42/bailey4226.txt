<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Everyone gets hurt by someone close to them. That's why I'm getting stronger, so that I won't lose anyone else. - Sat Oct 24 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Its about that boy isnt it - Sat Oct 24 07:30:08 2015

"As long as my daughter is safe, I don't really care what you say to me."* - Sat Oct 24 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I couldnt have said it better - Sat Oct 24 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You still gave me money wrong. Ever heard of being on time with an allowance? - Sat Oct 24 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Damn, that girl learns fast...thats right, milk it. - Sat Oct 24 07:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And when I mean anything, I mean -any- thing. - Sat Oct 24 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well..... - Sat Oct 24 07:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Maybe another element or so. - Sat Oct 24 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I dont need to but it is noted. But right now I feel I need to test your strength... - Sat Oct 24 07:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I heard that - Sat Oct 24 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: Just what the hell is going on here? - Sat Oct 24 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Lera... take care of Nina - Sat Oct 24 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmhmm - Sat Oct 24 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: How do I even know they're truly not moochers..? - Sat Oct 24 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I should kill them both to save Nina future heartache.. - Sat Oct 24 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'll take on that burden.. - Sat Oct 24 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: ..Still, Nina seems fond of them.. - Sat Oct 24 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'll leave them be for now.. - Sat Oct 24 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) began moving forwards after Violet, albeit at a slower pace. She hadn't really cared much about testing Ortho, but violet seemed eager so she'd let her handle that. Lera kept her attention on Nina, seeing the fire empowered by wind but knowing that Violet could avoid it; she didn't feel the need to stop it herself. Once she was withing range of Nina, she'd draw back her head and spit out a torrent of mud; she obviously didn't want to hurt the girl so her focus would be on capturing her.* - Sat Oct 24 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: First, we are from Suna, and second, NEither Nina or ORtho hail from our village. This is a spar they wanted, I will only interfear if I am ordered too, or it becomes life threatening. - Sat Oct 24 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: That hurt... he is fast... and can use two attacks at once... maybe he can protect her - Sat Oct 24 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't help but look over at Violet with a worried expression, Ortho was strong; probably an even better elementalist than she was, could Violet handle it? First she had to subdue Nina though, which she attempted by forming a single handseal and creating five mud clones. The clones would sprint at Nina, none attempting to punch but to simply grab hold of her. If it was successful, then the clones would immediately start to form back into mud; with the intent of trapping Nina.* - Sat Oct 24 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved to Violets side, kneeling beside her and checking her injuries.* - Sat Oct 24 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hmph, don't think you're that much stronger than me Ortho. I'm catching up. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm weak, Nina.. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You know that you're better than me. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Yeah, I know you are. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Good. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's why you were teaching me before, mhm. - Sat Oct 24 09:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No comment. - Sat Oct 24 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Ninjutsu users are still pain though... I still have a ways to go to overcome m weakness - Sat Oct 24 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gathered Violet up in her arms.

"She's going to need a medic..."* - Sat Oct 24 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Nina is in good hands... besides him being a modest dick sometimes - Sat Oct 24 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm confident you can look after our daughter. - Sat Oct 24 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I think you're mistaken. - Sat Oct 24 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Until I advance my arsenal of jutsu's, I'm weak. - Sat Oct 24 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Despite me taking care of Nina before you two showed up in her life.. - Sat Oct 24 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Oct 24 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like I said, i don't care what you say to me. - Sat Oct 24 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If she's safe its fine. - Sat Oct 24 09:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. didn't mean that as an insult. - Sat Oct 24 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then you should probably work on that. - Sat Oct 24 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Was just saying I've been walking a thin line.- - Sat Oct 24 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Sat Oct 24 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. You're an elementalist like me then? - Sat Oct 24 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And a better one at that. - Sat Oct 24 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Elementalist, yes. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Better than you, least likely. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You seem to be able to use two jutsu at once - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't do that. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm. Lets just say I cheat? - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh huh - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What elements? - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: All. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Seriously? Wow, the first person i've met with more elements than me. - Sat Oct 24 09:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) concentrated on her fingers, manifesting the four fingers with relative ease. She didn't think it could be that difficult, but then Hassan said to concentrate five times more chakra into it. Just adding more chakra to a jutsu was far easier said than done, she expermentally lowered her pinky finger; leaving chakra to be focused into just three fingers. The moment she did the jutsu simply failed and she was left frowing at her fingers.

The difference between the jutsu was like the difference between using Flamethrower and Fireball, the power and concentration were on entirely different levels. If she wanted to learn how to use the three finger jutsu, then she first had to figure out how to concentrate the chakra at a higher level. This wasn't going to be easy thats for sure, but then Hassan's training sessions never were.

Considering what she needed to do first, she started by using the Four fingers as she normally would. There were plenty of cactus around, which she pierced or simply sliced into two halves with her fingers. As she practiced, she worked on increasing the concentration of chakra in her fingers; almost like flexing a muscle she constantly increased and decreased it. It was fortunate she had such immense pools of chakra, she might have run out wasting all this chakra otherwise.

She used her usual mental image with the fingers, imagining her chakra as a green substance that coated her fingers and sharpened off into points at the end of each tip. This gave her fingers extreme cutting power, more so than any sword and as she got better at close range battle; her killing potential with this technique only rose.

That being said, Lera had no interest in learning these techniques purely for the sake of killing. Her debt to Kirigakure was a large one, having failed to be there during its destruction. To pay that debt, she needed to grow stronger; so when it was inveitably attacked again. She would be able to defend it with extreme prejudice. The possibilities of using this technique alongside Samehada were large.

While she practiced she went through various imaginary poses, imagining a large sized blade in her right hand which she swung at invisible opponents. Her left hand remained concentrating her chakra into extremely fine points, spearing whatever enemy got past the sword. If she were able to cast more than one jutsu at once...she would also be able to harden her skin using Domu. The potential for battle if she used these techniques was almost endless.

Slowly but surely she was starting to get the hand of holding more and more chakra in her hand. It was still not quite at the five times point, but it was a noticeable difference. Every now and then she would glance at the old man she called father, she couldn't help looking a little bit worried for him. Despite what she said about his 'immortality' he really was starting to get old and it was starting show. She sort've hoped he would retire soon and leave things to the next generation.

Feeling the heat of the sun, she stopped for a few minutes to pull off her jacket; she was wearing a bikini top underneath with several holsters and other pieces of weaponry strapped to her side. The seal holding Samehada was still in plain view, though she intended to have Fujitora remove that seal as soon as possible. It was time she started to practice wielding the weapon.

She took a big gulp from a bottle of water she kept on one of her holsters, looking over the damage she'd done to the cacti around the area. Most were still leeking from various holes punctured in their skin, if not entirely in pieces. The four finger technique was already an extremely potent one, just imagining what it could do with three fingers...it would be quite a powerful move to have in her arsenal thats for sure.

With a sigh she tucked the water back onto her holster and wiped the sweat from her forehead, she didn't know how everyone could deal with this opressive heat on a daily basis...let alone train in it. The sooner she learned the Suiton techniques from Kilm the better off she'd be, she'd never have this sort've problem again.

Taking in a breath, she focused the chakra around her fingers once more. However this time, she tried to reduce her fingers to three instead. It took a bit of effort, but the chakra successfully focused purely around those fingers. That didn't mean the technique was a success however, it just mean that she could now focus the chakra on just three fingers; the power, unfortunately, stayed the same as four fingers.

To test this theory out, she approached a nearby cactus and jabbed her fingers into it. Her fingers sunk through it as expected, but it seemed to be no different to when she'd used the four fingers; only the fact that the surface area of her attack had been reduced. At least she'd accomplished the first step, focusing chakra onto a smaller area; she just needed to increase the output now.

To do this, she took a seat on the ground; crossing both legs and holding her fingers upwards in front of her face. She closed her eyes and imagined the fingers, feeling the chakra flowing through them and creating a mental image of the blade she was creating.  Like always, she envisioned the chakra as a pale aqua green, putting a colour to her elements always helped her manifest them that much faster.

For the moment she worked on adding more chakra to the mix, concentrating it to a much higher degree. While she did this, she envisioned the blade growing sharper and sharper, until it could pierce even the most solid of metals. It wasn't easy going, as the image of her chakra grew brighter and brighter; so did the difficulty. It was getting much much harder to focus the chakra as she continued and she kept having to reduce it in order to stop the technique from failing entirely.

Bit by bit though, the focus grew. She could almost see the tips of the wind blade extending slowly upwards as she added more chakra, soon she reached the four times point and thats where the difficulty reached its peak. For the moment she released the jutsu, so she could take yet another gulp from her water bottle. She was panting ever so slightly, but not from lack of chakra; it was mostly due to this heat, it was difficult to go from the cool misty Kirigakure to the opressively hot sunny Sunagakure.

Once she'd drank her fill, she took the water bottle and poured its remainder on her face. She would be able to get it refilled in the village for sure, something she would definitely do before leaving. Once she felt sufficiently cooled enough, she took to her feet for one final time and faced off towards the cacti again. If Hassans use of these techniques was anything to go by, then if she learned this , a simple jab would be enough to tear one of these things in half.

With three fingers held out she started to focus chakra again, to the highest concentration she was currently capable of. It wasn't quite five times the four finger nukite just yet, but it was very close. If you looked closely you could even see the faint shimmer taking the shape of a blade around her fingers. Without any further waiting, she charged forwards lunging her fingers towards the cactus.

As she lunged she tried to increase the focus of her fingers to the five times point, using the adrenaline of an attack to push it to the edge. She was successfull. The moment her fingers touched the cacti, she ripped a large hole in its center; blasting it into two pieces more than cutting it. However the moment the technique was used, it vanished from her fingers; she wasn't quite good enough to keep it active permenantly yet...but with some practice.

Turning her head towards Hassan she said "Hows that pops?"* - Sat Oct 24 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) awoke to the sound of soft singing, she blearily opened her eyes to find the elderly woman sitting on a chair beside her bed. Though she now had a father, she only had a few fleeting memories of having a mother and never had she experienced having grandparents. It was a nice feeling, so she lay still for a while just listening to the woman sing until reality set back in. She sat up and gave the woman a warm smile, who adressed her in a soft voice "Finally awake? You slept for a good twelve hours there."

Lera looked around the room and down at herself, surprised to find herself clothed in a fresh night gown and fresh bandages covering her palms. The woman noticed her surprise and tutted under her breath "I took the liberty of changing your clothes and those bandages, you've really done a number on those hands and its all self inflicted isn't it?" Lera rested her solemn eyes on the woman and gave a quick nod "Thank you for the bed, but...i really must go back to work."

The woman gave a sad sigh, she didn't like to see grown men and women pushing themselves this hard; nevermind a girl barely in her teens "Won't you consider resting for a bit, from what I can see you truly push yourself far too hard. What could make a young girl like you work this hard?" while Lera swung herself out of bed, she considered how much she could tell the woman and just settled for everything "I've made so many mistakes, lost so many people. I failed my friend, failed my fiance and above all...I failed my village. I have debts to pay, debts I can't pay without more strength."

The woman didn't even hesitate in her next action, she pulled Lera into her arms and encompassed her in a big hug. The world was full of lost loved one these days, she herself had lost her daughter; lera was about her age and she felt an overwhelming urge to comfort her. She'd never heard of such a young girl holding so much pressure over her own head, trying to accomplish was entire groups of people struggled to do in years. Above all else, she'd lost so many of her loved ones; girls like this just weren't supposed to happen.

Lera was surprised by the sudden hug, even more so she was surprised by the warmth and love in it. It wasn't the same as when she hugged violet, that was a different type of love. This...this was parental love, she remembered when her own mother held her like this...too many years ago to remember clearly. Lera couldn't help herself, this is what she'd been missing; a mothers love. She began to cry, softly at first; but then the sobs were wracking her body and she cried openly into the womans arms.

The woman comforted her for a long time, doing only what a mother could do. Lera's sobs slowly trailed off until all was silent and she was able to take a few calming breaths. It felt good to get it all out, to finally let go of the tight leash on her emotions. The woman carried on stroking her hair for a while before finally pulling away and smiling warmly at the girl in her arms "There, its better to let it out isn't it?" Lera gave a shaky laugh, feeling more than a little embarrassed for her little outburst "I haven't cried like that since Seisuke died..."

The lady assumed she was talking about her lost Fiance, she'd also mentioned the name a lot in her sleep among various other names "You really care for a lot of people don't you, you have a very big heart...just remember to keep some for yourself okay? Now you come back here whenever you need a hug, this old lady would like the company. My name is Siera by the way." Lera openly grinned at Siera, nodding her agreement "I would like that a lot and I'll try to keep some for myself. Thank you for helping me...I feel a lot better and my name is Lera."

Siera raised her eyebrows, she'd heard that name before; but from the stories other villagers had told her, she expected a much older and much bigger woman; not this tiny little teenager "Lera huh. Well Lera, I think you'll find the people in this village owe you more than you think. I hear you've helped a lot of people here, more than some shinobi would." Lera didn't think of it like that, in her eyes she owed the village not the other way around "I...I wasn't here during the attack...I was safe in Sunagakure with my father, I failed to protect the village...and above all i failed to protect the people. I have a new goal now because of it."

"A new goal hm? and what would that be? More power? Sometimes there is more to this world than power." Lera thought for a while before replying, she didn't expect anyone to understand her line of thought but she tried anyway "I'll always strive to gain more power, not for me though..so I can stop things like this from ever happening. I don't want to bring more power to this village...I want to bring it peace. Thats my goal."

Siera was surprised by her proclamation. Most shinobi stereotypically sought to gain power for their own gain, not for other people "...Have you ever killed Lera?" at that question Lera bowed her head, killing was never something to be proud of "..Yeah..I don't like killing, but sometimes its...necessary. A lot of my techniques are made to capture...but there are some people who just...well, you can't afford to be nice in this world." Her words were contradictory, but she truly believed that some people just had to die.

"I see...well, I can't say I'm happy to hear you have blood on your hands...but I understand. I trust you to do the right thing okay? Now run along, and stay out of trouble!" Lera stepped away from the woman and bowed feeling a little lighter than she had in a long time "I will...try. Thank you for helping me, it seems I needed it more than I realised..." Siera nodded and smiled while Lera walked out, stepping into the fresh misty air. For once everything didn't seem quite so bleak.

Of course, she immediately went back to training; but since her weapon was broken, she couldn't practice with that. The only thing she could do was go back to her usual line of training, though she had not learned any jutsu for some time and her current techniques were mostly all mastered. Instead she decided to practice fighting multiple opponents in close combat, opponents that were stronger than your generic thug anyway. The clones were perfect for this and since she didn't want to exhaust herself too much, she would only summon three.

The moment her clones were summoned they began attacking her, swinging fists and feet in no real skill. They were of course all naturally weaker than she, but that didn't matter so much. The first two punches she blocked, but the third she caught directly on her jaw. Her head span to the side and she briefly saw stars; though her clones were weaker than her, she wasn't paticulary durable either. She had learned several close combat Ninjutsu, one which would destroy her clones immediately...but where was the fun if she won too quickly.

Spinning on her foot, she made to sweep at all three of their legs in a line; the first clone fell nice, while the other two jumped her attack easily. They wasted no time in attacking her back, each sending two telephonic punches to her head. She ducked them easily, slamming palms into the stomachs of both her standing clones. They flew briefly before landing on the floor in heaps. By this point her third clone was up and recovered, attacking her again. One good hit though and it dissapeared entirely.

The other two got up as well, charging at her with arms outstretched. Truthfully this was too easy, her clones dissapeared too quickly to make it a good training session. She dodged their attacks easily and returned them in kind, bringing the pair down in a matter of seconds. Once it was over, she let out a sigh and wandered off to find people; maybe someone would want to spar with her.* - Sat Oct 24 11:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) navigated her way through the village, coming up to the meeting point for the mission to start. The village was still, to be frank, a mess; though things were coming along very nicely there was still a lot of work to be done before it could be considered complete. She nodded to the various builders and villagers as she wandered by, often recieving a greeting in return and a clap on the back.

Finally she reached the entrance of the village, where the foreigner was also just arriving; she'd timed it quite perfectly. The foreigner looked her up and down, taking in her closed off clothing and the huge bandaged sword on her back. Eventually, he held out his hand which Lera carefully took and shook "I'm Lera and i've been asked to show you around the village today, though...as you can see, we're still in the process of rebuilding."

She put on her most polite and professional voice, figuring that it would be best to set a good example to these foreigners. If they won approval from enough nobles, they may get more funding; which would see the village rebuilt that much faster. The foreign man nodded to her before replying, roaming his eyes around the village "Yes I can see that. My name is Jinseng, its a pleasure to meet you Lera. Show me the rounds."

She gestured for him to follow, before leading off into the village as a whole. She first started with the areas that were still in construction, explaining how things were going to the foreigner as she walked "Its slow going for the moment, but things are progressing; we hope for the village to be fully rebuilt in a few months at most. At that point we'll get back to work, building our forces and various other aspects."

Whilst walking she would ocasionaly stop to help a builder lift a heavy object, whether it be a piece of rubble or a large beam for construction. The foreigner didn't seem to mind the improptu stops and Lera continued to talk even through them. Finally, they eventually left the areas still under construction and entered the parts that were done.

She showed him the new looking buildings and how they'd made small improvements, as well as how they were trying to replace everything lost by various families "We'll most likely be down on population for a while, but in time people will start to return and we have every intention of keeping them as safe as possible."

Jinseng stared at her for a while and then to the newer buildings, obviously he'd come here to see how thing were going; he needed to know if Kirigakure was up to the job still. It seemed as if they were "You're very dedicated to you're village. Keep up the good work, if Kirigakure has a few more shinobi like you I can see that its going to be just fine.

Lera graced the man with a smile before leading him to the final stop at the mansion "Thank you. I'm indebted to this village and I wish to do everything I can to pay that debt back; even if I must use my life. Anyway, this is the last stop; the mansion is here but now I must leave you. There are a few more jobs I must do" Jinseng gave her a quick nod and turned to the mansion, leaving Lera to go do her other missions.* - Sat Oct 24 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) left the mansion behind, soon coming to a residential district within the village. There were various villagers going about their business and some workers clearing away rubble and making repairs to buildings. Her mission today was an incredibly simple one and honestly it was something she did on a daily basis anyway. She found comfort in going around the village to help whoever needed it and this just made it an official mission.

Eventually, she came to one of the newly repaired houses and gave a knock on the door. There was the sounds of shuffling from within until an elderly lady finally opened the door to behold her "Oh! You must be the shinobi I sent for to help me carry things around the town~ You look plenty strong enough for the task, just give me a moment and I'll get my shoes!"

She shuffled off back inside for a few minutes before re-appearing in a coat with a handbag hanging over her arm "Right lets go then!". She led Lera through the town, who mostly remained silent throughout. Eventually, they came across a small shop with wood stacked up outside. They strode in together and the elderly lady wandered up to the desk and started speaking to the clerk.

A few moments later, the clerky retreated into the back and came back with a large bundle of wood. It was obviously heavy, if the well muscled clerk was struggling with it. The elderly lady looked at the wood and then Lera "Are you sure you can carry that? Oh dear me, I didn't realise it would be quite so much." Lera just nodded and walked up to the wood, grasping it with one hand and lifting it easily to one shoulder.

The clerk raised his eyebrows and wandered back into his backroom, muttering something about unnatural shinobi's. The elder just clapped slowly exclaiming "My my! So strong! Come on then, back home we go." Lera trailed after her, carrying the load on her shoulder until they finally reached the elders home. Once there, she placed the wood where the woman pointed and began to leave.* - Sat Oct 24 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked down at the final mission, hardly even able to believe what she was reading. A missing cat? Really? She was capable of wiping out entire groups of bandits and she was being sent to find a missing cat. She sighed slowly and gave her head a shake, as soon as this village was up on its feet she would have to ask for some more challenging missions; this was just far too easy as it was.

The cat would have to be somewhere in the village and there was only really one way to find it quickly. So she bit into her thumb and rubbed blood on her palm, before slamming it to the ground and summoning her wolf Jenna. The wolf looked around for a few minutes before looking up to Lera. Jenna was bigger now and starting to lose that innocence that went along with being a pup "Master? Did you need me for something?"

Lera nodded and started to explain the mission "I've been asked to find a missing cat, yes I know its...a little silly for a mission. But a mission is a mission, I'll do what I need to do." the little wolf snorted and shook her head. She had pretty much the same opinion as Lera on these easy missions "Bah...do you have anything with its scent? It shouldn't take long, then I can go back to my nap."

Lera pulled out a small collar from her jacket and held it infront of the wolfs nose, it took a few long sniffs and started to wander off with its nose pressed to the ground. It didn't take long for Jenna's powerful nose to find the trail and she soon started trotting off, fast enough to gain good groun but not fast enough so Lera couldn't keep up.

They soon came across a small alleyway which Jenna stationed herself in front of "In there!". Lera gave a nodded and ran up the side of the wall, position herself on the roof so she could get a good look down. The cat was asleep, curled up in a corner; it was a fat lazy thing, probably just wandered out to follow the smell of food or something. With another sigh, she dropped down in front of it and made for a grab; before heading off to return it to the owner.* - Sat Oct 24 15:30:33 2015
