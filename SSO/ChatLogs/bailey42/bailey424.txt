<br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched Hassan dodge her technique and she wasn't fast enough to sink back to safety as he moved to land in front of her. She went as if to form another handseal when everything abruptly went black. She jolted in surprise, wondering what he'd even done to her. She could still feel the ground beneath her feet and the air on her face, so whatever he'd done had simply blinded her.

Her moments hesitation was probably more than enough for him to bring her down, if not; she'd concentrate on the mud beneath her feet and summon it upwards, trying to engulf the area around her in it.* - Fri Sep 18 14:28:03 2015

She was very rarely injured in a fight, this only being the second time in total. Even with that inexperience, she struggled to get upright; swaying on unsteady feet to look into the darkness that she assumed was still on her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stamped to the end of the wooden dock, she was angry; not only with Seisuke but with herself. She'd believed he would stand and fight with them, instead he chose to run away and leave them all to die. She couldn't help the tears, flowing freely down her face while she formed handseals for a jutsu. Wind from her lungs spewed outwards, sending shards and bullets that slammed into the water.

She just wished she were stronger, strong enough to fight someone like Zetsumo. Who better to fight someone like him then another who could control most of the elements. Yet it wasn't enough, she was too weak...far too weak to make a difference and that weakness just broke her up inside. So she made her decision, she would fight and she would die; Tethys had gone down with honor, a battle cry on his lips. So would she.* - Fri Sep 18 15:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: I wonder how many labor workers we have. Maybe we could make a giant wall around a specified part of the village? - Fri Sep 18 16:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: Apply barrier-based seals to it as well, and allow only those with it's formula to pass through. - Fri Sep 18 16:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) thinks: What is this about attacking? - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We're risking a longer and extended battle, where if you go all in. We can quickly wipe one force away. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The army will be able to retreat before Zetsumo shows up, that much is certain if we place the attack at the furthest point from him. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Then retreat back if its a must. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I'd rather not be in a repetitive cycle of war. If we open a door to victory I say we take it. Even if it's a trap door. - Fri Sep 18 18:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I just told you we have more men then he does surrounding Kiri. We break free of that, and we can restock feed the troops already weak and get water to the villag.e - Fri Sep 18 18:15:53 2015
