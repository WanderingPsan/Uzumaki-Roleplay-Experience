<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: --Although, I'm assuming gawking at the beauty of women is a very big source of entertainment, due to the large count of males to female in this area. - Sat Sep 12 10:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked a couple of times, averting her gaze from the prince's eyes; though she still had absolutely no idea he was a prince. As soon as he came out with that second sentence, she struggled to not stutter over her words.

"Ah uh...y-yeah...uhm...thanks..but I'm not...Ugh. All I really do is train...uhm so...Yeah..."* - Sat Sep 12 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: God damnit, words! use your words! - Sat Sep 12 10:47:53 2015

"Uh...Y-yeah...I'm sorry...damn i'm screwing this up aren't I.."* - Sat Sep 12 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: ...He's staying here...Everyday there is a new reason for me to leave... - Sat Sep 12 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulped again and nodded, taking note of his little speech. She didn't want to be friends with someone who would act that way towards her friends. So she decided to watch him and make her own judgements.

"Well...if you're sure...Then okay."* - Sat Sep 12 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh, I can help you with that Jin. - Sat Sep 12 11:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One second.. - Sat Sep 12 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) made a motion as if she were to dive into water, though instead slipped underground. It took her just a few moments to locate Jins back and resurface at the point where it was buried. Once back on the surface, she stood near Seisuke again, waiting for his reply.* - Sat Sep 12 11:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked out onto the water with no apparent effort from herself.

"Its pretty simple, you just have to coat the soles of your feet in chakra and step onto the water. You can practice with a tree first if you want, since water is harder to walk on. Your choice. You have to remember to use just the right amount of chakra, too much and it goes up in your face. Too little and you fall. Good luck~"* - Sat Sep 12 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: More or less~ - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You just gotta practice at it. - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave a little nod of her head and wandered away, a little grin on her face as she walked. Teaching people always warmed her heart a little.* - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: .. - Sat Sep 12 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Kinda bored.. - Sat Sep 12 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Time to train. - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) left the area of the kages mansion, using shunshin to travel in short hops towards a suitable place to train. She had the nice idea of using it to get to places, at least for now; it was probably the easiest way to practic the technique. Though, after every short hope she had to bend over; clutching her stomach to stop herself throwing up. She really hoped that the side effects would start to get better after getting better at the technique. Like this it wasn't even worth using the technique at all.

Eventually, she arrived at the place she wanted to train; the small 'dock' close to the place they'd spar'd with Tethys earlier. It was as good a place as any, especially since she didn't really want to be pointing her jutsu at anything paticularly breakable. For a while, she just rested; sitting on the end of the dock and looking out at the water. Repeated use of shunshin really took it out of her, she could feel that there was plenty of chakra left in her; but physically it felt like she'd run a mile.

While she sat resting herself up, she considered what to train today; there was still those genjutsu to master, but in reality she was far more interested in mastering her latest Fuuton technique. it was while she thought of this that she noticed Setsuna taking up a position at the other end of the dock. She turned her head to look over at her and gave a wave.

"Hey~"* - Sat Sep 12 14:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned a little moving down the dock towards Setsuna.

"Are you okay? You seem a little...worried."* - Sat Sep 12 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Welp, I'm not so good at this kind of stuff. But even I can tell your not feeling okay. - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't substitute for violet...but uh...do you want a hug? - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: H..Huh..? Y..You don't have to... - Sat Sep 12 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why am I stuttering..? Where's all my confidence gone? - Sat Sep 12 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nonsense~ - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We're friends right? - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Friends help each other. - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: B..But.. I can handle this... it's... it's okay.. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I really can't.. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh come here silly. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) attempted to wrap her up in a hug.* - Sat Sep 12 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I know I'm small...but she so tiny~ - Sat Sep 12 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep breath and went for her specialty, her mother had always asked her to do this for her when she'd been feeling down and it had seemed to work. Maybe it would work on Setsuna as well.

With a little mental preperation, Lera began to sing. She was a little nervous, the only times she'd ever sung for people was for a mission and for her mother; but she was confident in her voice and for good reason. Her voice rose and fell in perfect pitch as she sung out a little lullaby, hoping to calm Setsuna a little.* - Sat Sep 12 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) paused for a few moments in her song to talk to Setsuna.

"You don't have to hold back, I don't know whats wrong with you. But you have friends and you have Violet. Whatevers wrong you can get through it with us right?"* - Sat Sep 12 14:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Bah, Ignore the neysayers. You're strong, you're nice and you an awesome friend~ Just remember, if you ever need a shoulder to lean on. You have plenty~ - Sat Sep 12 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: B.. But I still need to improve... I.. I still need to get stronger... e.. even if there are people for me to cry to.. I.. I don't want to burden anyone. - Sat Sep 12 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're never a burden. Never tell yourself that. - Sat Sep 12 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Friends help each other, thats what we do. - Sat Sep 12 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I.. I.. - Sat Sep 12 15:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shhh. Its okay, just stay for as long as you need to. - Sat Sep 12 15:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started to stroke her hair.* - Sat Sep 12 15:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) just held onto her, rocking her and stroking her hair. Every now and then she'd sing softly.* - Sat Sep 12 15:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 15:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're welcome~ You know you can come to me whenever right? I don't mind. - Sat Sep 12 15:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: O... okay.. - Sat Sep 12 15:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm... sorry for stuttering... I... can't really help it... I'm really anxious...  - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay really. - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Only a year ago, I could barely speak to people at all. I stuttered so much all the time...hehehe - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But ya know. I realised something. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't care what other people think of me. And neither should you. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You should just be who you want to be. Right? - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: But.... I don't know who I want to be... all I know is that I wanted to be a medic.. and that I wanted to be really good at swordsmanship and Fuuton.. I don't know why...... I.. I've blocked out most of my past..m.. mostly the happy stuff I'.. I've only been able to block out. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But thats okay. Don't you see. Noone stays the same forever, nor does anyone really every know who they are. - Sat Sep 12 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just live the way you want to live, right now. - Sat Sep 12 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And take things as they come. - Sat Sep 12 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If someone has a problem with it, then you have Violet and me to back you up~ - Sat Sep 12 15:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, I've got your back~ - Sat Sep 12 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're feeling better then? - Sat Sep 12 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Y..Yeah.. I just need time to figure things out.. - Sat Sep 12 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, take all the time you need. I can stay with you for as long as you want. - Sat Sep 12 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Well.. c.. can we spar? - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Training'll take my mind.. off things... - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No? Then I'll go first. - Sat Sep 12 15:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath, she didn't paticularly feel good about fighting a girl who was just so recenlty upset; but if it helped her feel better then she was happy to help, at least for now she would hold back a little and see what Setsuna was capable of first. Forming a single handseal, she created two clones from the ground on either side of her; having them stand between her and Setsuna as a sort of shield.

With them in the way, she moved a little further backwards and started forming more handseals in perperation for another jutsu.* - Sat Sep 12 15:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished her handseals, her clones parting way so Setsune and the original could see one another perfectly. She intended to make eye contact with the girl, it was all she needed to trap her inside the genjutsu. If successful, Setsuna would find herself suddenly surrounded by yet more clones; clones that seemed to attack relentlessly without pause. For every clone setsuna struck down, two more would form to take its place. It seemed to be never ending.

While this went on, her Doton clones would worm there way into the crowd; looking for an opening to unleash an actual phsyical attack.* - Sat Sep 12 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked in surprise the moment her genjutsu was shattered and easily at that, her genjutsu wasn't paticularly good; but it was impressive all the same. The moment the genjutsu had vanished, her two clones would lunge for Setsuna. Not intending to hit her but to grab hold of her. If successful, they'd form back into mud; intent on completely binding her movement at least for a short while.

While that went on, Lera began moving forwards; forming more handseals and reaching for her holster. From within the holster, she withdrew four shuriken; attaching to one of them a wire that was attached to a little reel in her holster. As the jutsu set itself in place, Fuuton chakra would channel itself into the shuriken; causing them to rise into the air and float around her; propelled by some invisible force.* - Sat Sep 12 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched Setsuna sink into the ground, her four shuriken immediately stopped spinning and dropped into her waiting grasp. Ready for her to put away into her holster. From a single nod, she directed her clones to also sink into the ground; joining Setsuna there where they likely had the larger advantage. She was aware that Setsuna would be able to sense everything happening, so trying to surprise her was pointless. Instead, she performed the same jutsu; sinking underground show she could also sense everything.* - Sat Sep 12 16:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt Setsuna leave the earth, following her progress as she abruptly vanished. She could feel the tree that Setsuna had climbed, but not Setsuna herself in it; which meant she was too high up for Lera to sense her. Knowing that there may well be a surprise attack waiting for her, she set one of her clones up first; having it be the bait. With how the clone was indistinguishable from the original, she hoped that Setsuna would mistake it for her and unleash whatever surprise might be waiting.* - Sat Sep 12 16:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned as she felt a new substance flow onto the ground above her, it actually made her senses a little fuzzy; whatever it was, it wasn't pretty. The clone however, having been ignored, would see the sticky substance; although unsure of what to make of it, it would still at least attempt to shift it. It ran through several handseals, gathering the remainder of the chakra within its body. With quick efficiency, it summoned forth a river of mud; directing it towards the sticky substance. The clone would then sink back into the ground, not to hide; but because it had consumed all the chakra given to it.

Meanwhile, the original and the second clone would be on the move; though she had to make use of it soon as it was also quickly running out of chakra. With that in mind, it popped up above ground; tossing a few shuriken at Setsuna, though it was more to distract rather than harm.* - Sat Sep 12 16:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) popped up back above ground, immediately putting her attention on the spot she knew Setsuna had been hiding. It was difficult to see through all those leaves; but she could just make out Setsuna, a lot of Setsuna actually.

"Oh, you've gotten much better at that. Lets see how well you can stay up there then."

Taking a position not far in front of the tree, she ran through a string of handseals; taking in a deep breath before releasing it in one go. The breath infused itself with her Fuuton chakra, sending a huge gust of wind directly at the tree. Much to her delight, the tree groaned and creeked as it was pushed back violently disloding a large number of its leaves in the process. Once the gust was over, the tree wobbled back and forth; hopefully dislodging its inhabitants.* - Sat Sep 12 17:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised an eyebrow and quickly sank into the ground again, moving through the earth once again until she was at the base of the tree Setsuna hid in. Her clone would crouch and then leap as high as it could, hoping to come down on top of the mud as it hit the ground. It stayed ontop with little effort, literally finding itself perfectly in its element. It was soon going to be out of chakra, so it did something odd.

Forming the handseals needed, it suddenly spat a torrent of mud upwards at the tree; coming close to Setsuna but instead hitting the bark and dribbling down until it hit the bottom. It would soon after dissapear, leaving behind a long trail of wet mud down the tree. Now Lera just had to act before it dried.* - Sat Sep 12 17:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt everything that went on above, raising her eyebrow; why did Setsuna abandon the tree? She waited for a few moments, catching Setsuna use the Sution jutsu; a jutsu with effectively soaked the ground. This only made her plan all the more easier. Once she felt it was safe, Lera popped back up above ground; her clone effectively destroyed, but her plan most definitely not thwarted.

Her hands immediately went through five handseals, chakra around her hands beginning to spark with blue electricity. Using the wet and muddy ground to her advantage, she slammed her hands down on it; sending a wide current of Raiton directly towards Setsuna. Her Raiton was by no means a poweful thing, though all she intend to accomplish in this case was just stun the girl.* - Sat Sep 12 17:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched Setsuna for a few moments more, before giving a lospided grind and dropping her guard.

"Okay~ I think thats enough, we're both getting tired."

In truth she'd barely used half her chakra and hadn't moved about that much, but it was better to spare Setsuna that detail.* - Sat Sep 12 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I practice Doton and Fuuton the most; though I know Katon and that Raiton as well. - Sat Sep 12 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ah? You should teach Violet how to use Raiton. She's been wanting to learn it.. - Sat Sep 12 17:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would, but I'm not really very skilled with it. We both know another genin who's good with it though. - Sat Sep 12 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah.. that guy. I don't trust him though... it's just because he's a male and well..I've had problems with them in the past... - Sat Sep 12 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...understand; but you've got us watching your back. - Sat Sep 12 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Besides, i've already fought him once. he's actually really weak.. - Sat Sep 12 17:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: What if he tries to take Violet from me though..? That's what I'm concerned about. She told me twice now that she'll always love me... but still.. - Sat Sep 12 17:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked a few times at Setsuna before suddenly bursting into laughter.

"Oh Setsuna. Nobody could take her from you, I think thats actually impossible. I've seen the way she looks at you."* - Sat Sep 12 17:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: H..Huh..? Well... yeah.. I can agree with you. - Sat Sep 12 17:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't know why I worry.. I mean you and Violet have reassured me... I'm just stressed out, I guesss. - Sat Sep 12 17:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'll never lose her. I won't pretend to understand the whole love thing, but you mean the world to her. - Sat Sep 12 17:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Then.. I guess I'll have to trust nothing happens, then.. - Sat Sep 12 17:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Sat Sep 12 17:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Come on then, I dunno about you but I need a bite to eat and a rest. - Sat Sep 12 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And maybe a bath would be nice...its not good for staying clean...all these Doton jutsu. - Sat Sep 12 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah.. I guess. - Sat Sep 12 17:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can come clean up at my place. - Sat Sep 12 17:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) led Setsuna into her house, pointing her towards the wash room and getting her some fresh clothes.

"The bath room is over there, you can use my clothes for the time being; I'm a bit bigger than you so they'll fit. I'll order some food, I would cook but uh...well I can barely make toast...soooo yeah."* - Sat Sep 12 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) just waited for Setsuna to finish in the bathroom before she went in there herself.* - Sat Sep 12 17:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Done? Cool, just pick what you want from the menu and we'll order. Make yourself at home if you want?~ - Sat Sep 12 18:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uh... whatever you have had before, I guess... - Sat Sep 12 18:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) left Setsuna with the menu and the thousands of books that covered almost every surface of her home, there were several slightly 'questionable' books on the table; apparently recently read. With that out of the way, she took off into the bathroom and began washing herself off just as Setsuna had.* - Sat Sep 12 18:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished up quickly in the bathroom, coming out wrapped in a dressing gown. She took a seat next to Setsuna, patting her lightly on the shoulder.

"Have you decided? Pick whatever you want, moneys not an issue."* - Sat Sep 12 18:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and quickly ordered two helpings of curry, ordinarily she'd order the spiciest thing on the list but figured that would be mean to Setsuna.

"Okay~"* - Sat Sep 12 18:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Your house is nice.. - Sat Sep 12 18:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered off to train.* - Sun Sep 13 06:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) came out of the mansion area, she didn't paticularly like the feeling of being ignored; though she did want to help the guy who seemed to need friends, she'd been there before and knew what it felt like. To take her mind off of things, she decided to do a bit of practice with her jutsu. As per usual, she started with Shunshin; heading towards her destination in small hops. She was happy to note that she needed less time between each jump to recover now; either she was getting used to the nauseous feeling. Or the side effects were actually steadily getting better.

Either way, there was still much practice to do with the technique before she could call it really useful; There were plenty of other ways she could escape a fight that didn't leave her feeling like she was going to vomit. Though, even if she never had need to use the technique; the practice and experience was always a good thing to have.

Eventually, she arrived at her position on the dock and it seemed there was no Setsuna to distract her from training this time. Not that she really minded, she still got a little warm glow when she thought of how she'd managed to cheer the girl up. She waited for a little while longer, making sure that the side effects from using shunshin over and over had abated before she moved onto the jutsu she really wanted to practice today.

The jutsu in question was the one Hassan had taught her recently, she wanted to master it as soon as possible; especially since Hassan mentioned that her training was going to get kicked up a notch. If that was the case, she had to master her techniques as soon as possible; she wanted to make him proud of her.

She was still a little cautious about using the technique, at least not until she had enough control to limit the power behind it; it was a powerful enough jutsu that she could simply injure of even kill purely by accident, which wasn't good for obvious reasons. So until she had better control over it, she would not use it in a spar unless her opponent could actually handle it.

With a deep breath, she started gathering her chakra and forming hadnseals. It was true that her skill with it was much better than before, but it wasn't enough to say she had mastered it; not even close. That being said, the effects were quite dramatic. Once the jutsu was ready, she released her held breath all at once; sending it forwards much the same as she would with Great Breakthrough.

However, instead of a gust of wind she released several small bullets; as if she'd fired a high powered shotgun. Each bullet that hit the water let out a large explosive torrent of it, throwing up water high into the air. This wasn't actually what she wanted to see, the bullets shouldn't have thrown water up at all; Instead going straight through barely disturbing the water at all. It just went to show that she needed more practice.

With a sigh, she sat down on the end of the docks and decided to take a little break. She was unaware of her new audience, so to pass the time a little; she started to sing. It was probably her favourite hobby besides reading and for good reason, her singing voice was pretty damn perfect.* - Sun Sep 13 08:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled back her head again, bringing chakra to the crux of her throat and composing it to Fuuton. She exhaled explosively, releasing that in one go straight into the water. It would have to be said that she was indeed and extremely fast learner; after only practicing for a few hours her skill with this advanced Fuuton technique was already improved dramatically. It was safe to say that she may even be able to use it effectively in battle now.

Either way, it didn't matter so much; because there was still so much she had to practice with it. That being said, she formed the handseals yet again and released the air within her throat. Fuuton rocketed from her mouth; smashing into the water and throwing it up into the air like before. She was trying to create more bullets, but the more she added the more unstable the jutsu became; she would often just lose control and entirely and end up firing off a Great Breakthrough instead.

After each attempt, she took a seat and took some time to think about her mistakes and what she could do to improve it. Chakra control was probably the most obvious aspect, but that wasn't all there was too it. Her skill with Fuuton and the technique itself were good deciding factors, though by practicing the technique she could kill three birds with one stone and practice all three things. It was an extremely effective training method for her and the more she practice, the more she could feel herself improving.* - Sun Sep 13 09:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... hmmm - Sun Sep 13 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why not send people to capture or kill the 'brains'? - Sun Sep 13 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Brawn is nothing without the brains. - Sun Sep 13 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The fact that he escaped the battle in Konohagakure with no troops and already had one-hundred to just guard Himura when I arrived tells me we're in a run for our money. - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: But I don't lose bets on fighting outcomes. - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. We'll win. - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The first step is believing right? - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I believe we have a chance - Sun Sep 13 10:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: .... - Sun Sep 13 10:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I just wish we I would have mastered that sword before it was time... - Sun Sep 13 10:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tethys-Sama....can you teach me how to sense? - Sun Sep 13 10:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: If you have the 1k RPP to spend after we done, sure. -omit-. - Sun Sep 13 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I got 1k RPP -omit- - Sun Sep 13 10:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: One other key detail. - Sun Sep 13 10:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: We've been letting spies into the village apparently. - Sun Sep 13 10:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Is that so? - Sun Sep 13 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes, Some of Zetsumos men knew me. - Sun Sep 13 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: And said they had been in the village before. - Sun Sep 13 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Describe them. - Sun Sep 13 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh, Orange jacket. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'm aware of Hanabi being- - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hanabi. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: She came here once. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Damn, Also who did you send after me? - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I should've killed- - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Someone came for me. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But ran before they got captured. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I didn't send Baen after you. His mission was to go scout the outskirts of Konohagakure. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: He stumbled upon that village. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, Must have been him then. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: And I took advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So yeah Tethys, Other than that there isn't much to report. - Sun Sep 13 10:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I didn't get a chance to speak to Zetsumo himself but I got a good look at him. - Sun Sep 13 10:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They did try to interrogate me but I just played dumb. - Sun Sep 13 10:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Once thing I will say though Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Zetsumos men seem quite Genjutsu heavy. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So it's probably best to teach everyone Kai. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Genjutsu... - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can help with teaching part. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, this one girl. - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ...She was quite...scary... - Sun Sep 13 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: She left me burning...fore quite a few minutes... - Sun Sep 13 10:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If I ever see her again... - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But that gives us another thing to work on. They'll need to either see us or us see them for their trigger. If we can somehow, make an attack on them while their view is disrupted. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We would have quiet the advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm... - Sun Sep 13 10:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 13 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Smoke, or poison bombs... The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down. And, ninjutsu users will be great in being able to give sweeping attacks that won't need direct line of fire. - Sun Sep 13 10:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We should have more sensors... - Sun Sep 13 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It might be a good idea if some of us that can go underground, scout the outskirts periodically. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, they could also notice if their in genjutsus or not with their abilities. That way it be a awareness and protection. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. We can't sense chakra whilst underground, but we know everything that goes on above ground. - Sun Sep 13 10:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Then popped out - Sun Sep 13 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I was still talking about sensors, in our forces. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I know what you mean. - Sun Sep 13 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ... It be nice to know if they have any sensors or medics. They could be pegged from prime targets... Sadly I can't expect that info so easy to come by. - Sun Sep 13 10:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They probably do to be fair, though they didn't notice me until I walked by them all. - Sun Sep 13 10:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Don't know why the fuck I went back there. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also for those that don't know. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Zetsumo looks like a more evil version of Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'll have to step my game up then. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Also me and you need to speak about those eyes, Tethys. - Sun Sep 13 10:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I need to know more on that, classified or not. - Sun Sep 13 10:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I know as much as you know. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Kirigakure wants them. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well that guy put me down fast. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I haven't seen any special abilities from them. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Then you know more than me. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: All I saw was a burning red in his eyes and then gone. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I guess someone who's 'just a genin' is never going to be in the know...gotta step it up.. - Sun Sep 13 10:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I woke up in chains. - Sun Sep 13 10:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Please tell me everything is over? - Mon Sep 14 09:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: If I did, I'd be lying to you. - Mon Sep 14 09:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: No one has Tanto training either. - Mon Sep 14 09:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Apparently. - Mon Sep 14 09:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Even though you're supposed to have Tanto training to become a Genin... - Mon Sep 14 09:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: ..tch.. - Mon Sep 14 09:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: They're idiots. - Mon Sep 14 09:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: If they graduated from our academy then they know the basics of using a tanto. - Mon Sep 14 09:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: As for the radios, they should have one religiously. - Mon Sep 14 09:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Luckly, at least they were more then willing to listen to orders. And Himura, Kida, and the one tan taijutsu guy kept up rounds. surveying the beaches and guiding the villagers to safe houses. - Mon Sep 14 09:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Lera - Mon Sep 14 09:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I was more cautious this time around. - Mon Sep 14 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Can you help me with some of my raition training? I still havent been given a proper lesson... - Mon Sep 14 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure...but uh, my skill isn't really that good with it either. - Mon Sep 14 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: To be honest I dont think it matters now - Mon Sep 14 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure you'd be better asking Ken? - Mon Sep 14 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I will ask him when he gets up; but I rather get knowledge from any and everyone who knows it also - Mon Sep 14 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure okay. I can show you the little bit I know. - Mon Sep 14 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: May as well do it here. - Mon Sep 14 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: great! - Mon Sep 14 09:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held up a finger, telling Violet to wait here while she rushed off to get what she needed. When she came back, she held a cup of water. The cup she placed on the ground, gesturing for Violet to sit on the other side.* - Mon Sep 14 09:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and put both her hands around the cup.

"The way I was learning is pretty simple really, though...I dunno how hard it'll be for you. I do it by chanelling my chakra into the water and envisioning it as a tiny spark. A spark that spins faster and faster until the friction produces lighting...like so.

She creased her forehead in concentration, doing everything exactly as explained. She seemed to struggle a little before a spark finally ran through the water, jumping from the surface with a crackle.

"Like I said...I'm not very good at it yet, but its much easier if you start with water. Give it a go~"* - Mon Sep 14 09:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like I said...you probably need a teacher with more skill than me.. - Mon Sep 14 10:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: No Lera I know I might need a master at the element but any training is good training - Mon Sep 14 10:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: True I guess. - Mon Sep 14 10:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hmm. From this point on I'm only handing out B ranked missions and up. - Mon Sep 14 10:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Lera-san, Would you care to take them with me? - Mon Sep 14 10:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: On an S-rank mission...? - Mon Sep 14 10:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh..yeah..honor. - Mon Sep 14 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Getting hurt is bound to happen, for both of us. - Mon Sep 14 10:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: More like suicide. - Mon Sep 14 10:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Do you know how to channel wind chakra? - Mon Sep 14 11:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh...no. - Mon Sep 14 11:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Mmm... - Mon Sep 14 11:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's a problem. - Mon Sep 14 11:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well I do, but...you mean Chakra flow right..? - Mon Sep 14 11:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Rotating shuriken is kinda similar to chakra flow... - Mon Sep 14 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 14 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Now concentrate that flow to the hand. - Mon Sep 14 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The hand? Hrm...Okay. - Mon Sep 14 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held out her hand and started to concentrate on it, she'd never tried to flow chakra to a part of her body before; so this was something new. Though, she didn't think it could be that hard. It turned out she was very very wrong. Though she could purposly flow chakra to her hand, taking it anywhere from there just didn't feel possible. She tried composing the chakra to wind, but with little effect. The best she accomplished was a little wisp from the center of her palm.

"This is...harder than I thought."* - Mon Sep 14 11:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah, there also isn't enough chakra. - Mon Sep 14 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Flow about 10 times as much chakra, convert it all to wind chakra. - Mon Sep 14 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So add more chakra, I can do that. - Mon Sep 14 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And focus it all to your hand. - Mon Sep 14 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That won't make it so you can do it. - Mon Sep 14 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But that's how it's done. - Mon Sep 14 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: This is the easy part, don't fuck it up. - Mon Sep 14 11:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) concentrated harder on her hand, her forehead creasing into little furrows. Adding more chakra wasn't usualy an easy feat, though with her larger than average pools; she had it a little easier than others. That wasn't to say she could accomplish anything though, it had to be said there was plenty to work on for her chakra control. Either way, she followed Hassan's instructions to the tee. She imagined all her focused chakra lighting up her hand with a blue glow, a glow that steadily turned green.

She always envisioned the wind chakra as a murky green colour; so extending that colour to her hand did seem to help at least. Though from there, she didn't know where to take it; her hand appeared to have made no changes on the outside, though she could feel the tight focus of chakra hidden within.

"uh..okay, what now?"* - Mon Sep 14 11:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes sensei. - Mon Sep 14 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 12:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sergeant Muhhamed? - Mon Sep 14 12:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on the floor and stared intently at her hand, concentrating everything into her hand alone was already a difficult feat. Having all that chakra focused on just her fingertips seemed like an impossible feat, though if she hadn't seen Hassan perform the jutsu perfect then she would not have believed it.

She'd watched his demonstration with her complete focus, even if he was a little silly; she absorbed every single word he said and held onto them like a lifeline. It shocked her to think that just a year ago there was noone in this world she trusted with her life, now she could barely count them on both hands. She smiled up at Hassan, it was all thanks to him in the end; the man who'd successfully broken  her out of her shell. Not only had he taught her to fight, but he also taught her to live.

Moving away from her thoughts, she began focusing on the chakra in her hand again; she always found that visionary tactics always worked best for her. If she could imagine the chakra doing what she wanted to do, then half the time it would work; at least it would work after a few attempts anyway. She kept telling herself that this would be no different, though she somehow knew she was wrong there.

She remembered the last jutsu she'd learning from Hassan, at the time it had seemed like an incredibly skillful level of control was needed for the jutsu; which was true. However, what she had to attempt to do now was beyond anything else she'd ever learned before. She already had to concentrate just to keep the chakra in her hand, but to focus that even further; this was going to take time and a lot of practice she wagered.

Finally, closing her eyes; she wrapped the fingers of her left hand around her wrist and straightened the fingers of her right, forming into the shape of a blade. She copied Hassan exactly, if her fingers must act as a blade then they should take on the shape of one. The next step was going to take her considerably longer, if she was capable of it at all. Not to say she wasn't going to give it her best attempt.

She envisioned the green fuuton chakra in her hand being pushed upwards; concentrating itself in the upper regions of her hand before getting further and further upwards. With every milimetre she focused, it got significantly harder. If she had to equate it to something it would be lifting an extremely heavy weight. The chakra moved barely even half way up her hand before snapping back like a rubber band.

With this failure, she lost her concentration completely; falling backwards into the grass and panting heavily. It felt like she'd just run a mile, for all intents and purposes she may as well have. She laughed a little while laid in the grass, this was going to be much harder than she could have imagined. Yet, she didn't feel frustrated because of it. Instead, she relished the challenge; she'd yet to find something she could not accomplish, if she worked hard at it then this would be no difference.

She would take it in short steps, doing a little bit at a time; as if she were training a muscle. If you steadily increased the weight over time then you would eventually be able to lift heavier and heavier weights. This was no different, she just had to treat the chakra as a muscle a single extension of her body that had to be trained like everything else. Slowly, she brought herself back up into a sitting position and stared down at her hand.

With the new idea of taking it slowly, she once again began focusing the chakra to her hand exactly like before. However, instead of attempting to focus it into her fingertips; she would draw the chakra into a single point on the centre of her palm. She realised that it would be impossible to accomplish even that straight away, so she treated it like a muscle.

Her forehead seemed to crease in concentration, causing sweat to steadily coat it and glisten in the sun. She continuously began increasing the focus of her chakra, making the point smaller and then larger again. Not only would this help her perform the jutsu, but it would also help her practice her control over chakra itself. With each run, the centre of the point would get smaller; she was finding that it was actually easier to do it this way then go straight for the greatest focus.

Though she was bound to fail the attempts eventually, the constant contraction of her chakra was steadily wearing her thin. Her pools barely seemed to be decreasing at all, though the decrease was indeed there; she just had a lot of chakra to expend. In the end, it was the mental exhaustion that cause her to fail. The chakra in her hand suddenly expanded rapidly with no control from her; small spouts of wind seeming to shoot from her palm.

With an exhausted sigh, she fell backwards once more; feeling completely drained. It was an odd feeling, her body itself had done no excercise at all; but her mind was drained dry. It was better to take a rest then forcefully push herself to the point of no return. If she wanted to get this technique down today, then closing her eyes for a few minutes was the best way to do thing. She barely noticed when those few minutes turned into half an hour.

With a slight groan, she got back up; feeling a little stupid for how much time had passed, but Hassan must have understood her exhaustion because he said nothing. It was hard to think that the man would've gone through this sort of training at one point in his life. Though she couldn't imagine him as anything but the grizzled old veteran that he was.

With an inward sigh, she returned her attentions to her hand; she though that she'd at least gotten better at focusing the chakra now and was ready to attempt it in her fingertips. Though, she was going to flex the chakra again; before attempting to perform the jutsu completely. Now, it seemed to take much less effort to focus the chakra into her hand; which proved her theory correct, the chakra really was just like any other muscle that could be trained.

With the chakra in her hand, she composed it to wind once more; seeing the green colour in her minds eye. It seemed much brighter and vivid than before, which she hoped was a good sign. Slowly but surely, she started to draw the chakra into a tighter space; focusing it towards her finger. It felt less like she was trying to lift a horse now, though it was still a difficult feat. She got much further than halfway over her palm this time, reaching past the knuckles and into the fingers themselves.

This was when it started to get more difficult, she recognised this as the sign that her chakra could snap back at any moment and drew it back to cover her whole hand once more. She kept it up like this for some time, focusing her chakra and pulling it back over and over. With each go, she was able to focus the chakra just a little bit more..until it finally centred on the tips of her fingers. As per Hassan's instructions she kept it there, concentrating on keeping it there for as long as possible.

For once, she wasn't forced to release it and instead slowly let it slide back and release of her own accord. She was nearly there, she could almost taste the victory; now she just had to actually attempt using it. First though, she took another short rest; gathering her wits and energy back, even with her huge pools of chakra she was starting to feel the drain. She could probably only attempt it a few more times.

She was aware of Seisuke's sudden arrival, but chose to ignore it; learning was the more important thing right now, though Seisuke made her curious. For now, she pushed those sorts of thoughts from her mind and focused on recovering her energy. It was less so the chakra that she was drained of and more the mental drain that came with having to concentrate so hard for so long. When she'd recovered enough to try again, she made a little inward nod and turned back to her hand.

She decided to start out simple copying the same thing Hassan had done. It toom some effort but she was able to focus the Fuuton chakra into her finger tips on the first attempt, though it took some concentration to keep it active; she figured that after some practice she could do it purely by instinct. With her hand ready to go, she turned to the floor and slowly lowered her fingers towards it; utilising it like the sharp point of a blade.

Much to her delight, her fingers sunk into the stone like a hot knife through butter; there was some resistance and it did seem harder than Hassan had made it look, but then he was a master so he would obviously be better at it. For now, she was just relieved that the jutsu had worked. Wanting to test the limits of it, she turned to the nearby tree and swung her hand like a blade. With a crack, her fingers cut straight through the bark; leaving her to let out a cry of delight. Though it had stung her fingers a bit, it was safe to say the jutsu was almost a complete success.

Letting the chakra go, she dropped down onto the grass and laid back; obviously Hassan had gone into one of his famous dazes and though Seisuke was here, she was too exhausted to start a conversation herself. Instead, she just waited for him to talk.* - Mon Sep 14 12:41:23 2015

"Thanks....."* - Mon Sep 14 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hooked her arm through his, deciding to just go along with it for once.

"I eat just about anything."* - Mon Sep 14 12:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a good long look at the menu, finding her favourites within instants. With a nod, she turned to the waited and asked for; two appertizers, three different curry dishes the spiciest they had, two bowls of Chow mein and a piece of cake.

"Hmmm. Regretting it yet?"* - Mon Sep 14 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: This is going to...Put a serious dent in my wallet... - Mon Sep 14 13:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at his face closely, taking in the stutter. She kept a poker face for just a few minutes before bursting into laughter.

"Just kidding!~ Even I can't eat that much."

She waved the waiter back and cut her order in half, it was still a lot when you considered her size; but more managable for definite.* - Mon Sep 14 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned away and looked off over at the other tables, she was silent for a while before replying.

"I haven't spoken to her in almost two years. They still send me money...but she just packed up and left with her new boyfriend..."* - Mon Sep 14 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to grin at him, putting an arm over his shoulder to give him a little squeeze.

"You're sweet, but its okay. Hassan-sensei is my family"* - Mon Sep 14 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared into his eyes for a while, she couldn't decide if he was actually being serious; not something a person who barely knew you would normaly say.

"I...don't know what to say...but thanks and yeah, Hassan-sensei taught me how to live."* - Mon Sep 14 13:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was well and truly finding herself being drawn in by this boy, she was finding it difficult to believe everything the others had said about him. Ever so slowly, she reached under the table and grasped his hand, more out of thanks then anything else.

"You're just full of compliments aren't you~ And yes, although he's a little strange. Hassan-sensei is one of the best guys you'll ever meet."* - Mon Sep 14 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a little bit, laying her head on the table so her hair fell over her face. She continued to peek up at him through the strands; watching him carefully still, making her own judgements about him.

"I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish...but yep, He's definitely a strange guy."* - Mon Sep 14 13:37:42 2015
