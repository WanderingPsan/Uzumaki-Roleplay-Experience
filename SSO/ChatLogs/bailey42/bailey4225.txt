<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Then its a good job we put our clothes on, wouldn't want to share that with them huh. - Thu Oct 22 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Arata would also be seeing an abnormal amount of chakra in Lera's body.* - Thu Oct 22 16:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: We can just ignore them. - Thu Oct 22 16:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Sure that will work - Thu Oct 22 16:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe I should throw some mud at them. - Thu Oct 22 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Do it... - Thu Oct 22 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Let me just prepare the field. - Thu Oct 22 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath, gathering chakra in her sternum. When she exhaled, she released a torrent of mud. The mud would spread over the area, falling over the side of the cliff in several directions. She just wanted to get their two eavesdroppers a bit muddy, no intentions to kill them.* - Thu Oct 22 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Thu Oct 22 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well then... - Thu Oct 22 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: . . .Yo. - Thu Oct 22 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) cracked her neck from side to side, a little evil grin spreading over her face.

"You're eavesdropping hmmm?"* - Thu Oct 22 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm going to fuck with them a bit... - Thu Oct 22 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Go for it - Thu Oct 22 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: She has Doton, I could learn a few jutsu from her...Well..If she teaches me that is. - Thu Oct 22 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a few steps forwards, the grin on her face only growing wider.

"So you don't know what happens to boys who eavesdrop...?"

She formed a single handseal, creating eight clones. Each and every clone held an implement generally used for applying make up.

"....Makeover."* - Thu Oct 22 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Thats the worst lie ever' - Thu Oct 22 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Please make up a better excuse - Thu Oct 22 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: So some one wants to run? - Thu Oct 22 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I will go after the runner, you take care of the righter - Thu Oct 22 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Sure - Thu Oct 22 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) noted that the man was quite fast, very accomplished in Taijutsu; something that seemed to run with people who had eyes like that. She didn't really care about her clones, Lera had never been onto to conserve chakra. Instead, she just formed three handseals and directed her chakra towards Arata. If it worked as planned, an earthen dome would rise up around Arata; hopefully trapping him completely.* - Thu Oct 22 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: -0 - Thu Oct 22 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: omit - Thu Oct 22 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised an eyebrow when Arata broke through her dome, that weird taijutsu he used really was quite potent. She wasn't quite done fucking with them yet though, she wanted to scare the pair just a little bit more.

So as all of her remaining clones dispersed, she pushed off; lightening her to gain a little extra speed. Once she reached the edge, she jumped; however, instead of falling she stayed suspended in mid-air. Looking down upon the two men.

"Now now...no escaping."* - Thu Oct 22 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't make a huge effort to chase, instead, she went part of the distance; before dropping to the ground. While she was falling, she pulled the giant sword from her back and slammed it point first into the ground. It was quite obvious that she wasn't really trying to catch them, though she was having a lot of fun. Just to fuck with them even more, she suddenly exploded into flames; her appearence nothing short of demonic as she stalked towards them.* - Thu Oct 22 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: .....Izanami uses that same technique. - Thu Oct 22 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmmmmm. - Thu Oct 22 17:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: For what jutsu? - Thu Oct 22 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That would suit you - Thu Oct 22 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, We'll see... - Thu Oct 22 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Hm.. - Thu Oct 22 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Why lipstick though.. - Thu Oct 22 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: It would look very cute, wouldnt you agree Lera? - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: Her name is Lera. Noted. - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stopped being on fire.* - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Hm.. - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Alright....... - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) thinks: It's for jutsu.. - Thu Oct 22 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out a stick from her holster, she twizzled the little cap to reveal a little pink shaft. If allowed, she'd move closer and colour his lips in a vivid pink. She was tempted to draw a dick, but that was too far.* - Thu Oct 22 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Perfect! - Thu Oct 22 17:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: What would it take to get that jutsu? - Thu Oct 22 17:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arata(Assassin241) says: Cool. - Thu Oct 22 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed just one handseal, the same generally used for all elemental clones, and formed two clones from the earth around her.

"Think of it like the basic bunshin, but channel your element into it. These are made out of mud rather than stone, so they're quite good at reforming and binding people. Also, you may have to create the mud first; with practice you could do it without."* - Thu Oct 22 17:47:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slammed her blade into the tree for what felt like the several thousandth time today, her hands were heavily wrapped in protective bandages; though the self inflicted wounds were slowly beginning to heal. Her blade however was only getting worse, she'd taken to using Doton chakra flow simply to rpevent it from shattering and it was helping. This wouldn't work forever though, even in the spar she'd had with Daisuke the blade had taken some damage.

She was so close to completing the first stage of training though, as soon as she had this down she would have Fujitora unseal the Samehada so she could begin practice with that; she still considered having this blade repaired and changed into a proper weapon, but she may just mount it on a wall as a reminder for her hard work. The blade slammed against the tree for one final time, allowing her to turn and slump to the floor. 

She really was getting so much better with the sword. What would exhaust her before now merely left her panting for breath. A little bit longer and she would be able to start practicing with the Samehada, she half expected that Fuji would have her go through the labryinth before allowing her to use the blade though. Which is why she'd asked to be put through the test herself, she would enjoy the challenge it provided. It was quickly becoming a feature where she just didn't experience a real -challenge- lately.

Sighing quietly, she got up and decided to go for a walk; perhaps find something she could do to pass the time, maybe even practice a little. As she passed through the village, a few of the builders raised their heads to nod their greeting and even villagers seemed to stop to say hello. Lera was quite terse with them, not un-polite; but she wasn't very talkative. She would generally only respond with a nod of her own, very ocasionally saying 'hello'.

As one of the few remaining shinobi in Kirigakure, the villagers knew her quite well; by appearence if not by name. Lera would ocasionally stop and help someone out, whether it was a villager struggling to carry something or a builder having trouble with some rubble. One such occurence was happening nearby, some unstable rubble had collapsed; trapping a builder in a small space underneath. He was prevented from escaping by a humungous slab of concrete which several builders and villlagers were trying uselessly to move.

So Lera stepped up to the scene and waded through the worried onlookers, she waved her hand at the builders; moving them out of her way so she could move the slab herself. The stone was several times bigger than her, probably weighing more than a ton; which left no wonder why several grown men couldn't lift it. She could hear the struggles of the man trapped underneath and the crack of rubble holding the slab up. A few more minutes and the victim would find themselves crushed underneath.

Bending down, she wrapped her arms around the slab; bracing her legs before pushing upwards. The slab shifted but didn't lift off the ground, it was too heavy even for her. However, even now she was working to lower the slabs weight to a more managable level and after just a few moments, she lifted it off the ground with a grunt. The onlookers watched in awe as she easily shifted the giant slab to the side and placed it on empty ground. From there it was easy to pull bits of wood and stone out of the way and lift the builder clear.

Luckily, the man was completely unharmed; if only a little shaken. She placed him back on his feet and stared him directly in the eye, forcing his gaze onto hers "Look at me, yes like that. Calm down, tell me if anything hurts." he stared at her for a while and then just shook his head "Th-thank you, I thought I was a goner there. I'm not hurt, you got me out just in time...really...thank you" Lera nodded and released the man turning away to leave as if nothing had ever happened.

A few of the villagers turned to leave as well, some knew her and knew what she could do; but the ones who didn't applauded, a builder even offered to shake her hand, which she refused "I have a large debt to pay this village, I won't accept gratitude until its paid with interest." she was thinking about her failure to be here when she was needed most, it was true that she may have just died but she still felt as if she'd failed her village.

The looks on the builders and villagers faces grew more serious as they took in her words, were they working hard enough themselves? The head builder didn't seem to think so as he turned from her and shouted to his men "Alright men! You heard the lady, lets get this done double time!" a series of cheers ran through the builders who immediately returned to their work, harder than ever. Lera enjoyed their enthusiasm and so walked away with a little secret smile on her face.

She helped several people that day, stopping to help an elderly lady carry her goods, buying and distributing food, even offering to watch after a mothers children while she worked. As per usual, she used a variety of clones to help her with these tasks and understandably would find herself exhausted because of it. She pressed on though, helping out whereever it was possible to do so; she owed it to the village and the people within it.

She was shocked however when knowledge from one of her clones suddenly returned, it hadn't dispersed for lack of chakra; no, instead it had been destroyed. The question was, what in this village had the strength to destroy her clones? The answer was simple, besides her fellow shinobi; nothing did. She quickly processed the information, the clone had been out in the forest with a woman; helping to gather herbs and wood. Then something had struck it from behind, something that could sneak up on her; the question was, would she be quick enough to help the woman?

She immediately dropped what she was doing and turned to the old man she'd been helping "One of my clones had been destroyed, someone is in trouble." the old man didn't even hesitate "Go! We don't need any more deaths in this village!" Lera nodded and began sprinting off towards the spot her clone had been destroyed. She channeled chakra through her body while she moved, increasing her speed and getting herself there that much faster.

Lera had never been good with physical stamina, but thankfully the technique she used saved her a lot of it. Maybe she would find a way to change chakra into stamina one day, she had plenty of that after all. Pushing these thoughts to the side for now, she quickly navigated towards the area her clone had been destroyed, stopping to survey the scene once she was there. There were signs of a struggle and several sets of footsteps, which suggested several people.

She knew however, that her clone had only been attacked by a single person; which meant they'd planned this. Though, perhaps they hadn't realised her clone was fake; whether she'd been the target or the woman had been, it was impossible to tell. There was no time to stand and think about it however, so she took off after the footsteps; moving as quickly as she possibly could. Lera may not have been fast for a shinobi, but for the standards of a human; she was extremely quick.

In one would take an hour for a group of civilians to move through, it could take her mere minutes. Thankfully, she'd been quick enough to arrive at the scene that the attackers had not had time to get far. She stopped and perched herself in a tree the moment she heard laughter. The scene was a pretty generic one, a group of men surrounding a woman who was hunched against a tree. The woman was of course the one Lera's clone had been helping, her dress was torn in many places; inluding her breasts, which the woman now attempted to cover.

She surveyed the group, looking at each one and was shocked to find one of them was wearing a kirigakure headband with one extra detail. A long scratch over the symbol of their village. She could not abide by this, a shinobi choosing to leave was fair enough; but a shinobi choosing to drag the name of their village in the mud, that was -not- okay. Her eyes blazing with anger, she dropped down from the tree and approached the group from behind. She didn't care if they notice, she -wanted- them to notice.

As was only natural, the rogue shinobi heard her first; spinning around to face off against her. There was a momentary flash of fear in his eyes until he beheld her face "Oh look look! She came on her own! Brilliant, two for the price of one! You just saved us the trouble of looking for the 'real' you girl. The shadow clone technique though, very nice, very impressive. Is that what they're teaching genin nowa-days?" Lera didn't bother dignifying him with a reply, instead just drawing her oversized sword and channeling Doton chakra through it.

A few of the other men stepped up to stand next to the rogue, cruel grins lining their faces. A few however looked worried, they knew how strong shinobi could be "Are ya sure this is alright boss? I mean...she's still a shinobi, can we deal with her?" the rogue snorted and looked towards his men "Don't forget, I didn't used to be Jounin for nothing, this girl is just a genin. You saw how easily I dealt with that clone. Like, clones are weaker but she can probably make at max one."

Lera raised and eyebrow at that, he'd been a jounin? The standards of jounin must've been pretty low before he'd gone rogue then "Let me tell you something interesting. That clone you destroyed was one of eighteen, it had barely even five percent of my chakra and besides..I'm the only genin that can rival her kage in battle..." the men exchanged nervous glances, if she was telling the truth then they were royaly screwed. In some ways, Lera was telling the truth; she truly thought she could beat Kirie in the right situation.

"Eighteen clones? Rival the kage? Bahahaha, big words for such a little girl. Well I'm calling your bluff, now just lay down quietly little girl." at that, he clapped his hands together and created a ball of lightning. It was sub-par in power even if that, she could produce more power in her Raiton and she wasn't even trained in it. As the ball approached her, she merely swung her hand to the side; extinguishing the lightning with concentrated Fuuton at her fingertips. To the rogue however, it had looked like she'd destroyed it bare handed; unable to see the invisible fuuton surrounding her fingers.

Without giving him any more chances to react, she lunged forwards; driving her blade point first towards his chest. He managed to block it barely with a concealed kunai, but the sheer force of it sent him careening backwards. A few of the other men turned tail and ran when this happened, seeing just how outmatched they were. She let them go, she didn't desire to kill any more than necessary and these men would be harmless without their rogue leader.

The remaining men however immediately went to attack her, however they were just too slow. She channeled chakra into her body, covering her skin in the dark colour that was unique to Doton. She mostly didn't even bother to defend herself against their attacks. Instead she just let their attacks strike her skin, it was as if they'd tried to break steel. One of their weapons actually shattered on contact with her body. While a lot of shinobi could break through this technique easily, your average civilian just couldn't.

She disabled two of the men with a well placed punch and kick, but left the remaining few to deal with the shinobi; he was the biggest threat here. Even if he was weak, he'd still been a jounin; there had to be a reason for that. By this point the rogue had recovered and was launching a series of quick strikes with his kunai. She used her blade to block most of them, but the damage done to it was bad; the cracks spreading along her weapon seemed to no longer be just superficial.

With a quick swing, she pushed him away; ignoring the attacks to her from the other men, none even got through her tough skin anyway. She swung the blade towards her opponent, greeted by a sickening crunch as the blade was driven home into his side. He was just barely able to block it with one hand, but his arm was broken because of her strength. While he grunted from the pain, she lunged in for another attack; at the last moment, the rogue stepped to the side causing her strike to sail past.

It connected point first with a large rock, though cracks spread along the rocks surface; her blade suffered far worse. With a great clang, her blade shattered in the middle; causing her to drop it to the ground with an annoyed grunt. She'd actually quite liked that weapon, but it had never been made for fights like this. The man yelled in triumph, assuming that the weapon had been her main arsenal. He was of course entirely wrong.

She clapped her hands together as he approached, breathing in deeply before exhaling violently; point blank into his chest. He might have actually stood a chance as well, if he'd not underestimated her; instead he'd assumed victory the moment her weapon had been lost. There was a great crack as her fuuton technique slammed into his chest. His chest literally caved in from the force of her attack and he was sent flying into a nearby tree.

He was lucky to have died instantly instead of suffering painfully. By this point the other men had stopped attacking and instead stood with shaking knees staring right at her, they were terrified of course; sure that she was going to kill them. Instead of following through with that, she merely smiled sweetly and said "Boo." They didn't waste time running away, screaming as they went. The two men she'd hit earlier now lay unmoving, she hadn't realised she'd hit them that hard.

They didn't matter however, instead she went over towards the woman who was still huddled against a tree and wasted no time wrapping a jacket around her body. She was barely a few years older than Lera, but she still clung to her like a terrified child. The sobs were unmistakeable and as much as Lera wanted to sit here to console her, it was better she got away from the dead bodies. She picked the woman up and held her gently in her arms, the best place to go was to the old man; the elderly always had a way with comforting the young.

It only took a few minutes to get back to the old man via air, she landed by the man who was now helped by his wife. The pair immediately rushed over to Lera and the woman, pulling her towards their home and a place where the woman could rest. Lera had to sit with her for a while before she finally fell into an exhausted sleep and she could pry herself away; the woman would be in better hands with the elderly lady anway.

As she turned to leave, the man and his wife blocked her path and pointed towards a bedroom with stern expressions on their faces "My husband used to be a shinobi, he knows just how taxing that clone technique you use is and I've heard rumors you're in over ten places at once! You look completely exhausted, now get some rest" while the woman spoke the man just nodded his head in agreement. 

They were right of course, Lera was drained to nearly nothing; during the fight her clones had been slowly finishing their jobs and dissapearing as per her orders. As everyone of them vanished, she'd gained their exhaustion; still though, there was always more work to do and she couldn't afford to rest "I can't I don't have the time, I'm fine really." they didn't buy her excuses, so when the man grabbed her by the arm and dragged her towards a bedroom; she had no choice but to follow.

He was surprisingly strong for his old age, perhaps even as strong as she was when not exhausted. She allowed herself to be put into the bed and even tucked in, she didn't seem to have much choice in the matter. Once she was in bed, the couple gave her their marching orders "Now you get some sleep, we don't want to hear a peep out of you for at least eight hours. You can get back to work later got it?" Lera resigned herself to it and nodded meekly, but she couldn't help smile. It was nice to be cared for like this and the gratitude she felt for it was overwhelming, as they left the room she quietly whispered "Thank you..." and abruptly fell asleep.* - Fri Oct 23 13:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What is it? - Fri Oct 23 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I've been thinking about finally expanding into my two other elemental affinities; Raiton and Doton. You have both those elements if I remember correctly. - Fri Oct 23 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes. - Fri Oct 23 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Have any basic jutsu you could show me to get me started? - Fri Oct 23 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm, I guess. - Fri Oct 23 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Follow me. - Fri Oct 23 14:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Either. I don't mind. - Fri Oct 23 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright, we'll start with my best. - Fri Oct 23 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) suddenly pulled in a deep breath, gathering chakra in her lungs before she released. Upon exhaling, she mixed her breath with Doton to create a stream of mud. The mud splashed into the ground similarly to a river, washing towards the nearby water.

"Mud Silhouette, it requires no handseals and can be used either through the mouth or from the ground. Expelling mud from your mouth is much harder however. I would say...treat it almos the same as your Suiton techniques, only combine it with Doton instead."* - Fri Oct 23 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Fri Oct 23 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its the most basic Doton technique I know. - Fri Oct 23 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And often a pre-requisite for other doton techniques. - Fri Oct 23 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I see. It could have a few applicable uses, no doubt. - Fri Oct 23 14:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Not at the moment. - Fri Oct 23 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Fri Oct 23 14:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm... - Fri Oct 23 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you mean basic manipulation of those elements? Or the basic jutsu. - Fri Oct 23 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Honestly, all I need you to show me is the hand seals and the jutsu's execution.  - Fri Oct 23 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If its like that. - Fri Oct 23 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then I could just throw you the scrolls. - Fri Oct 23 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: That's fine, I suppose. - Fri Oct 23 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ironically...the most basic of Doton and Raiton techniques don't require handseals. - Fri Oct 23 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I see. . . - Fri Oct 23 14:38:04 2015
