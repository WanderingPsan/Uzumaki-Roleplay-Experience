<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets do it. - Tue Sep 29 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: W-What? - Tue Sep 29 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets do it. - Tue Sep 29 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets get Married. - Tue Sep 29 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had a stroke of inspiration, forming a handseal and summoning three clones of herself. These clones spread outwards forming a circle around her and looking as if they were going to attack. Jenna also stood by her, although the wolf wasn't really a fighter she would at least try to help. With a little focus on her chakra, Lera began focusing on Doton; having it spread across her skin and darkening it.

The idea was simple, all three of her clones would attack her at once and she would try to fight back. Her Taijutsu was below standards for the average shinobi for sure, but the same could be said for her clones; the intention here was simply to test the limits of her Domu, whilst practicing it at the same time.

All at once, her clones came at her; throwing punches and kicks. For the moment, Lera just stood and took whatever was thrown her way; letting the Domu absorb whatever damage was inflicted. For the most part it actually seemed to be working, she could feel the hits and there were some slight stinging from them; but no damage was being done.

Eventually, she lashed out to one of her clone; felling her fist connect with its chest. It was immediately thrown backwards and dispersed; which showed her increased strength when under the influence of Domu, just another useful little bonus. The clones, seeing that one of them had been destroyed; renewed their attacks, making it more difficult to him them.

Lera however had no need to dodge, simply allowing the pair to strike at her skin as many times as they wanted. With her ability to just take their hits, it was easy to lash out and smash her fist into each of them. Within a few moments they were dispersed, leaving Lera to drop the jutsu and go onto conversing with Seisuke.* - Tue Sep 29 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked directly into Seisuke's eyes, her own resolute and determined to carry this through.

"I...never really thought about it before. But I don't want anyone besides you, so lets make it official."* - Tue Sep 29 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood silently for a few moments, wondering what it was Seisuke needed to do. Then she leaned forward to give him a quick kiss on the lips.

"Okay, I can wait for you."* - Tue Sep 29 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) returned the hug, squishing herself against his body.

"I want to, i'm already tied to you forever; I want it to be official."* - Tue Sep 29 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I love you too. Forever and always. - Tue Sep 29 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: R-Right. - Tue Sep 29 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly got off his lap and got down on her knees in front of him whilst slowly lowering her mouth...I'm sure you can guess the rest.* - Tue Sep 29 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped into the training room, ignoring the frigid air on her skin. Dummies and posts lined the side of the room, with a large open area in the middle for spar's. She truly had to marvel at this place, the now sleeping Seisuke had clearly done some work on it. She'd come here in the early hours of the morning, before the sun had even risen; her training regime had been broken up as of late, due to the time she spent with Seisuke. 

To make up for this she would start waking earlier; leaving Seisuke to sleep while she trained, although she did value his input he was extremely distracting when she was trying to practice. Her main reason for coming down here was to practice using the summoning technique, she wanted Jenna to gain strength and she wanted to be able to summon more powerful wolves.

Taking a small bite into the skin of her thumb, she rubbed the blood over her palm and formed the necessary handseals. Once ready, a palm was placed on the floor and a small wolf appeared within a cloud of smoke. She had to note that Jenna was definitely growing, probably faster than an ordinary wolf would grow but whether that was due to the fact that this was a summon or because they were training together; Lera wasn't sure.

Jenna wasn't paticularly strong, more suited to scouting out an area than fighting in battle; though her keen sense of smell was definitely useful. There were a lot of ways to practice with the wolf and she'd thought of what was probably the best way to train her not so long ago. Due to the little wolfs cub like nature, geting her to focus for long periods of time wasn't as easy as it could be. So in order to get her to focus with her, she would turn the training into a game.

Bending down, she passed the wolf a little strip of dried meat; letting her chew the tasty little morsel before she spoke "Jenna~ Are you ready to play a little game?"

The wolf perked up immediately, ears standing straight as she stared Lera in the face with bright excited eyes "A game! Yes! Lets play! What are we playing!?"

Lera couldn't help but smile, Jenna's exciteable and giddy nature was contageous; she was always so happy and blissfully un-aware of just how dark the world really was "We're gonna play a little game of hide and seek, I'm going to make some clones and they're going to hide. Then once they've hidden me and you can go and find them okay?" the idea had been a stroke of genius really, to turn it into a game of hide and seek. Like this, Jenna could practice sniffing out hidden enemies and aprehending them

Jenna didn't bother with a reply, instead bobbing her head up and down a few times before running around the room for a sniff. Meanwhile, Lera would form a single handseal and summon a total of eight clones; ignoring the large drain on her chakra, it was fortunate that she didn't need that chakra so much for a game of hide and seek; though she probably practice some of her jutsu while they were out an about. As soon as the clones were ready, they each ran out of the room and off to their various hiding places.

She made sure that the clones spots were varied greatly; some hiding behind simple objects, some in tree's, some would wade through waters in order to throw off their scent and finally, one would be hiding underground for as long as its chakra could last. For her skill with Doton and the huge amounts of chakra at her disposal, it should be a relatively easy task for the clone to stay underground. It would only need to furface its head every once in a while so it could breathe, it was these brief respites that she expected would allow Jenna to find it.

They waited for five minutes, Jenna running around the room like an overly excited child and Lera watching her with a smile on her face. She wondered if this was what it was like to have children, if it was then it wasn't so bad; that could be a subject to discuss with Seisuke later, though she wanted to wait at least a few years until she could protect her child from just about anything. Plus the thought of having children with Seisuke made her stomach feel more than a little giddy, they hadn't even married yet though that seemed to be in the works now.

She still felt a little surprised with herself, with how easy it was to agree to marry him though she had a sneaking suspicion he wanted to ask Hassan first; she'd had no contact with her real family in years, if they were even still alive after the war. It wasn't exactly safe outside of Kirigakure, with all the supplies an army needs Where else to get them from but from the unprotected fields, livestock and homes around the village? Honestly the thought didn't bother her as much as she assumed it would, they had not been her family for a long time.

Shaking away those thoughts, she gestured to Jenna and led her out of the building stating "Okay Jenna, you have to find the other me's; it won't be easy though! Not only do we all have the same scent, but I've told them to do everything they can to shake you off. If you find them all I'll get you and entire rabbit!"

Jenna watched her as she spoke, nodding absently at the instructions; she was clearly eager to go, her nose twitching from all the scents she could already pick up. As soon as the word rabbit was mentioned, her ears perked and she started bouncing on her feet; rabbit was her favourite, better even than chicken and chicken was good. Wihout waiting another moment, the little wolf put her nose down to the ground and started following some invisible trail. Even Lera didn't know exactly where each clone was, so whether the wolf was on the right track was a complete mystery.

Soon, Jenna came to the base of a tree sniffing intently at the trunk; Lera almost had to laugh. Jenna had her nose and eyes on the floor completely oblivious to her goal standing directly behind the tree. The clone was in plain view if you bothered to look, but it took Jenna several moments of intently sniffing the tree before she realised. Once she finally noticed the clone, the little wolf dived behind the tree and tackled the clone to the ground; licking its face. The clone merely grinned up at her and then dissapeared.

With one down, Jenna immediately started sniffing around for a new trail; ignoring the old one completely, she seemed confused by the scents attached to tree noticing that the scent traveled up the tree. She stayed for a while, trying to puzzle over the odd way the scents seem to mix together. Even Lera seemed to be confused, a wolfs nose was very rarely wrong and Jenna was no exception to that rule. She looked around, trying to locate the source of the problem; as soon as she did a little thought went through her mind -Ah...very clever, definitely something I would do.-

Up in the tree, she'd caught a brief glimpse of black. The hair from one of her clones making its hiding spot within the branches of the tree. It was quite clever really, to use the first clone as a distraction while the other hid itself better; but Jenna's nose was impossible to fool, she could smell clearly the clone up in the tree. That soon becam apparent when the little wolf start jumping at the tree on her hind legs, her two front paws pressed against the bark "Up here! Up here! Theres one up here! Thats not fair! I can't climb.."

Grinned and clapped her hands together, opening them up to reveal lines of electricity dancing between her palms. Thrusting her palms forward, she fired what could only be described as a ball of Raiton. It flew straight and true, right through the leaves and into the clone. The clone abruptly dispersed within a cloud of smoke "I said you had to find them, not catch them. Well done~ Only six left now"

Jenna let out a giggle, jumping away from the tree and folowing the trail back to where they started. It was a little disconcerting hearing her giggle, she was a wolf after all, albeit still a child. The pair soon reached the place where they'd started, Jenna wasted no time in putting her nose back to the ground and following another of the trails, but not before counting them. She looked up at Lera in confusion, if a wolf could even look confused Jenna looked it now "Theres only four trails, what happened to the others...?"

Lera nodded absently, she'd more or less guessed that the clones would do something like that; go in groups in order to mix the trails together and make it more difficult for Jenna. It was what she would do after all. In the end, it was all good training for the little wolf; so instead of answering her question she simply said "You can figure it out~". This pulled a sigh from the wolf, who just nodded and continued following the trail. She was already suspecting that this game wasn't a game at all, but training instead. The lure of rabbit was just too strong though, so the little wolf continued on.

Soon, after following a trail for a good few minutes; they came across the slow flowing river, Jenna growled in annoyance. This wouldn't stop her, but it would make finding the clones much much harder. With a little trepidation, the wolf stepped onto the water; showing that Jenna actually knew and was capable of using Suimen, something Lera hadn't known before now. Still smiling, Lera followed closely behind the wolf; who was now not only using her nose but her eyes as well. The water made it harder to pick up scents, but clones would have to leave the river eventually and she was looking for signs of that.

It didn't take her long to spot what she was looking for, slight indentations in the grass leading out of the water and a wetness brought on by the river water. She followed that trail for a few minutes, catching back onto the scent of her target. She found the clone huddled behind a rock, assuming it had shook the wolf off. Jenna playfully nipped the clone on the leg and it dispersed with a little pat to the wolfs head. With that one down there were only five left and Lera suspected there would be one nearby.

It turned out Lera had been correct and the clone had covered its tracks extremely well. Not well enough though. Jenna sniffed the air experimentally and suddenly bounded to another nearby rock, jumping behind it and onto the clone behind it. The clone in question really thought it had covered its tracks completely. Not only had the two clones completely covered the area in their scent, but it had used a Katon jutsu to dry off its clothes at a super fast speed. Jenna however had not been fooled so easily, having smelt the burned fibers of its clothes she had found it with ease.

Having found another two, the pair turned back and began traversing the river as if to go back to the start. Part the way down however, Jenna cocked her head up and looked off into the trees. She had smelt the same burnt fiber smell as before; she hadn't picked it up before as it hadn't seemed so out of place. However, having just found another clone by that very same smell; she began following it. The culprit was easy to find, hiding up in a tree with clothing that was slightly blackened around the edges.

Lera dispatched it much the same way as the other clone who'd been hiding in a tree, by throwing a ball of condensed Raiton at it. At this rate, she would have to start thinking of how she could capture a rabbit for Jenna; she was finding the clones at record speed, very impressive for a wolf of her age. With that clone dealt with, they turned back to the river and headed for the starting point again. So far, they'd only followed two trails and there were still two remaining. At completel random, Jenna picked one of the remaining trails and took off down it.

There were now only three clones left to find and she expected all three were using their jutsu to hide in some way. Her assumptions were confirmed when they came across a large puddle of mud. Lera immediately knew what the clone had done, the question was whether Jenna had noticed as well. Within a few moments it became apparent that she had, as the little wolf bent her nose towards the mud and took in a big sniff; registering the scent it was giving off. By Lera's assumption, the clone had created the mud pile and covered itself in it in order to mask the scent.

It was a good move to make, the mud did actually succeed in completely covering the clones scent thus elminating its scent trail. However, Jenna had been taught well by the elder wolves; being a prodigy of sorts among the wolves for her sense of smell. As long as she had some form scent, she could track it and now she had the muds scent. Though it was very close to the scent of earth which was all around them, Jenna was still able to discern a clear difference between the two.

Now that she had the new scent, she began following it; treading deep into the trees. Eventually they came across a large mound of earth with the clone in clear view to those who knew what to look for. With it being a clone of herself, Lera had guessed at what it would do and she was right. Pressed right up against the mound was her clone, covered from head to toe in dark brown mud. It blended in rather well and at a glance you wouldn't notice there was anything there at all. Jenna however was using her nose, not her sight.

The wolf came to rest at the clones feet and looked up into its face, even Jenna seemed to be quite impressed; she hadn't realised her master was quite this clever. Knowing it had been found, the clone dispersed and passed onto Lera a horrible feeling of being covered in mud, despite her skin remaining as clean as ever. Even though she fought from underground and often used copious amounts of Mud in her jutsu, she still hated the feeling of being covered in it. Far too slimy for her liking.

Now that the sixth clone had been found, Jenna began circling as if looking for another one; it was true that they'd found several of the clones hiding in pairs, but it seemed that wasn't the case this time. Happy that there were no more clones in the area, Jenna turned back the way they came and headed for where the trails started; intending to follow the final trail. There was now a hint of excitement in her step, she was so close to winning and she could already taste the rabbit she would get from Lera.

Following the final trail, Jenna with her nose to the ground and Lera almost knowing exactly what to expect. There was only one more thing she could do in this situation and that was to hide underground. Jenna couldn't follow a trail that simply didn't exist, though she wouldn't make it impossible for her; that wouldn't be fair on the wolf. Part the way down the trail, it split off into two; Jenna didn't spare a single step, heading straight along the first of the two trails.

It didn't take her very long to find the end of it, as it was extremely abrupt. Jenna simply stopped and raised her head, looking around the area in confusion. She could see no clone and the trail simply ended here, it couldn't have just vanished though; it had to be here somewhere. After a few moments of looking, she noticed how the ground under her feet was disturbed as if someone had dug it up and done a really good job at hiding it. Jenna looked briefly to her master, knowing that she used Doton jutsu quite often. It wasn't completely far-fetched that she could hide underground somehow.

With that in mind, the wolf started digging at the disturbed ground; raking her small paw through the earth as she slowly dug a small hole. Soon she reached earth that seemed oddly soft, more like an extremely fine sand. The clone hiding itself underneath knew it had been found and popped its head back upwards, causing Jenna to jump back in surprise. After giving the wolf another scratch behind the ears, it dissapeared; leaving only on clone remaining. Now that Jenna had seen how all the clones had hid, she had all the knowledge she needed to find the last one.

Heading back, they took the trail that had split away before; soon reaching a large river, this clone had also attempted to follow the river; taking steps similar to some of the previous clone, drying its clothes off with Katon and leaving the river that way. Jenna followed the trail of burned clothing soon coming to another clearing of sorts. Like before, the trail simply vanished; leaving behind a small patch of barely disturbed earth. Knowing this trick from before, Jenna began scratching at the earth, trying hard to reveal the clone hiding underneath.

Strangely enough, her digging revealed nothing; there was no clone to be found, somehow it had moved away while still underground. The wolf tilted her head up, looking around the area for some sort of sign; it took her several minutes but she eventually it. Another patch of disturbed earth barely even a few metres away, a spot where the clone had come up to get air. Jenna ran to it and began digging again, dissapointed when she found no clones. She had gotten the hang of this new trick and was immediately looking around for another disturbed piece of earth.

When she saw it, she bounded over to it and immediately noticed a new scent; the scent of fresh mud. She followed that smell, assuming it was the clone now covered in mud in an attempts to mask itself and she was right. She gave a yell of triumph when she jumped on the clone laid on the ground, trying very hard to blend into the floor. As soon as she landed on it, the clone vanished leaving Jenna to look at Lera with a triumphant wolfy grin on her face.

Lera simply sighed and gave Jenna a pat on the head, playing the part of a sad loser. In reality, she was happy with how well Jenna had done; when the wolf grew up a bit she would make an extremely useful ally. Now...just where was she going to get a rabbit.* - Tue Sep 29 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) caught her darned wolf a rabbit, she spent a long time swimming underground searching for some sign of a rabbits hollow. It took her quite a while to finally find one and when she did, she took it as slowly and quietly as possible. Though she was killing a rabbit to feed her wolf, she wasn't a monster; better not to disturb the other rabbits. When she took it underground, letting it suffocate would be easy; but seeing that as too cruel, she snapped its neck instead.

Resurfacing back above ground, she tossed the dead rabbit to Jenna letting her dig into her favourite food with a gusto. She sat in silence for a while, wondering what there was to do with her time. The training session had gone well and though she'd used a good chunk of chakra creating those clones, she didn't even feel remotely tired enough to rest. She could go looking for someone to talk to but didn't feel the need for companionship right now, at least not yet.

While she contemplated her options, Jenna finishing her meal; licking the white grey muzzle of hers clean. Done with her food, she bounded over to Lera and stuck her head in her Masters lap. This caused Lera to smile and scratch the wolf behind her ears, it was nice to have a companion she could summon any time; it made having no friends so much easier. She wasn't sure if wolves were meant to be able to purr, but it sure sounded like Jenna was doing just that. 

Eventually, Jenna lifted her head and looked up at Lera with those bright innocent eyes; the eyes of a child who had yet to see what the world was really like, she would eventually but Lera wanted to let her live in innocence for a little while longer "Master! What are we going to do now? Another game??"

Lera replied with a short shake of the head instead smiling and laying herself down on the grass with Jenna perched on her stomach "I think we should go for a walk through the village instead, we'll play another game later okay?" Jenna seemed to think about this for a few moments, before she nodded her head once and jumped off Lera's stomach. Playing a game later on sounded just as good.

Ever so slowly, Lera forced herself up to her feet; Jenna watching her impatiently, she didn't know how the wolf could have so much energy all the time; Lera just wanted to sleep most of the time. With Jenna trotting along at her side, she wandered off back to the village; deciding to take a walk around it. She had a few reasons for this. First she wanted to stretch her legs and second she wanted Jenna to get a good look at the village as a whole, incase she needed to navigate it alone one day.

Whilst walking, Jenna's head was snapping back and forth as she picked up all the new and interesting smells. She was especially interested by the smells coming out of resteraunts and the small market stands for food. Some people seemed perturbed by the presence of a wolf in the village, but most were either used to odd things like this or they just didn't care. Once people had caught a glimpse of Lera and the symbol of Kirigakure stitched into her clothing they just went back to their work. A shinobi with the wolf generally meant something like that was safe.

In the market Lera bought several things, a few baubles for herself such as a bracelet and a necklace. She also bought a red Bandanna to tie around Jenna's neck. Jenna wasn't best pleased, but it was just too cute to leave it off. She didn't say that to Jenna though, cute for a creature that was supposed to be vicious and fearsome was probably a bad thing.

Eventually they came to rest against wall near an allyway, Lera munching on a burger she'd bought from a food stand not Long ago. Jenna was sat by her feet chewing on a large turkey leg; Like Lera, Jenna had a lot of love for food almost like they were made to be partners. Looking down at the wolf, she realised that this was probably the longest she'd used the summoning jutsu for. It either meant she was getting good enough to Keep Jenna out for huge amounts of time, or Jenna simply hadn't needed to go back yet.

Lera was just wiping her hands off, ready to head off to another part of the village when her ears picked up a whimper. It was quiet, extremely quiet but if she could hear then Jenna would definitely be able to hear it. She looked down at the wolf, who was looking down the nearby dark alley sniffing the air intently "What do you smell Jenna?" the wolf remained silent for a while, continuously sniffinf the air "I can smell a girl and lots of big men. Is that bad?"

As soon as she heard the wolves, she sighed and turned for the allyway. If thats really what Jenna could smell then it meant someone was in trouble down there, probably some half drunk thugs trying to have a bit of fun at some poor girls expense. Lera was by no means the same soft little girl she'd been a year ago, the war and loss of her friends had hardened her into a shinobi. Yet there was no way she could sit and let another girl be harrassed like that.

As casual at could be, she gestured for Jenna to follow and just casually walked down the allyway. Now in the darker area, she could see the men; her assumptions had been correct. They were all wearing the uniforms of work men, even with her human nose she could smell the reeking sweat and alchohol; she couldn't imagine what Jenna might be smelling right now. She risked a quick glance down at the wolf and had to raise her eyebrows, Jenna was surprising her more and more lately. The wolfs eyes had become hard and cold, losing all their previous innocence; she looked exactly like a wolf ready to rip someones throat open.

Holding her hand down to stop Jenna from leaping at the men, though she was half tempted to let her. She took a step forward and made her presence known to them "Now now gentlmen, I think she's had enough no? Why don't all go home and have a nice long rest eh?"

The men whirled around to look at her, fearing some rightful retribution from the authorities but when the saw it was just a teenage they began laughing. They were either too drunk to notice she was a shinobi, or they thought her being a child made her weak; they were wrong of course, but they could dream. One of the smaller men stepped forward, a potbelly straining to break free of his sweat stained shirt. He spoke loudly with as much menace as he could, which was about as much as a wet kitten "Run along little girl, wouldn't want to muss up your hair or break a nail now!"

It was then that they notice a growling Jenna stood by her legs, looking very ready to tear out some spleens. Some of them seemed to grow weary looks and even glance at the symbol setting her apart as a shinobi. Lera herself merely let out a light laugh, thinking just how lucky these thugs were that Seisuke wasn't here. If it were him, he would've killed them immediately; Lera at least would only beat them half to death. In a light and threat free tone Lera spoke up "Hmm...She sounds pretty angry, maybe you guys should get out of here. Oh and have a bath, all of you. Ya kinda stink, ya know?"

Some of the mean began backing away, until the heavyset man who was obviously the leader growled at them "She's just a kid! Get your asses back here and take her, we can have a little fun with her as well. Her own fault for putting her foot where it don't belong." The men seemed to be exchanging looks between themselves, nodding at their leaders words. Now that they seemed to have their confidence back, the first fat man who'd spoken to her lunged forwards. Trying to wrap lera up in his meaty sweaty arms.

Jenna moved as if she was going to jump, until Lera put her hand down in the unviversal sign for 'stay'; she wanted to have a bit of fun. Before the man could grab her, she stepped into him; feeling the hardness of her Domu jutsu spread down the length of her arm. With her newly enhanced strength, she plunged her fist forwards into his stomach. Her taijutsu may have been bad, but these guys had about as much fighting sense as a twig; even with just the basic knowledge, they were no match for her.

Lera felt her hand sink to the fat mans stomach, wincing a bit at the feeling of his sweat crusted shirt clinging to her fist. From the view of the other men, it looked like Lera had been grabbed by their friend; each carrying a little smirk on their faces. That was until he fell to the side clutching his stomach and groaning to himself "Really now, I warned you guys now I have to beat all of you up. Its such a shame really." To the girl, still held in the leaders tight, grip she said "Don't worry hun, I'll get you out in a jiffy okay?"

Looking down the back of the alley, she could see that it was a dead end; no other way out besides through Lera and none of them were getting through her. Rather than wait for them to attack her first, which wasn't likely seeing as one of them had pissed themselves after realising she was the real deal, she began walking forwards at a completely leisurely pace. In the end one of them did end up attacking her first, mostly out of fear if his face was anything to go by. He rushed forwards, swinging his fists wildly with no real chance of hitting anything but air.

Lera just stepped to the side and stuck out her foot, he went right over it like a sack of bricks; tumbling down towards the ground. Before he could land, she turned and slammed a fist in the back of his head, knocking him unconciouss instantly. To another shinobi, a student even; her movements would likely appear clumsy and uncoordinated, but to a group of half drunken thugs she was a monster. Upon seeing another one them go down, leaving only two. The leader, who still held his hostage and the guy who'd pissed himself now huddled up in a ball as if he were trying to pretend it wasn't happening.

It was no contest really, they were completely uncoordinated and lacked any sort of real training; they might have stood a chance, or even escaped if they'd employed teamwork but unfortunately for them nothing of the sort happened. Instead, they threw attacks without really looking at what they were hitting, usually hitting each other more than she did. Eventually, she grew bored of their pathetic attempt of beating her to a pulp and started lashing out. They had about as much durability as a wet piece of paper, if she'd gone to use a jutsu its very likely she would've killed one or two by accident.

With each strike, one fell to the side landing on the ground with a great thud. They were either unconciouss or feeling as if they'd been hit by a sledgehammer, how a little girl could punch with such strength they didn't know. They also didn't know that the strongest of shinobi could shatter buildings with a single punch, by comparison she was nothing. After a few moments of fighting, all the thugs were on the ground; leaving only the leader and pissboy. Pissboy was still huddled into a corncer, muttering to himself like some pathetic little animal. She almost felt sorry for him, She was nice enough at least to only knock him out with a quick kick to the head.

With only the leader left, she considered her options; he still had a hostage, she didn't want the girl to get hurt really but how could she get her out without harming her. It was then a sudden idea came to her head, she would use an ultimatum and the more she thought of what that could be the more she liked it. Staring the man intently in the eye, she opened her mouth speaking as sweetly as she could "Let her go. If you harm her at all I'll kill you. If you let her go however, I'll only beat you half to death. A good deal no?"

The man looked around frantically, looking for some method of escape. When he thought he'd seen one, he threw the girl forwards, who Lera promptly caught, and he ran for the back of the alley. Lera simply set the girl on her feet and clapped her hands, breathing in deeply before blowing out a great gale of wind towards the retreating man. She atleast held back enough so he wouldn't be thrown through the wall, instead he was slammed against it face first and left to slump to the ground. Lera took her time getting to the man, while Jenna now comforted the hostage girl.

As soon as she reached him, she knelt down over him and looked into her bleary eyes "If I ever hear about any of you doing a thing like this again, I'll hunt you down one by one. Next time you won't survive" to emphasise her point, she channeled chakra to her fingers and pushed them into the hard stone wall behind them before turning and leaving the broken man behind. Jenna had been doing a good job of calming down the girl, using her cuteness to her full advantage. The girl sat dumbly staring at the wall, a trembling hand resting on the wolfs fur. She only looked to be a little older than Lera, she was such a little thing.

Trying to be as calming and kind as possible, Lera knelt infront of the girl and started to speak "Hello there, I'm Lera. Did they hurt you anywhere? Did you want me to take you somewhere?" the girl stared dumbly at Lera for a few moments before latching onto her with a hug "Thankyou thankyou, I was so scared...I thought...I thought they were going to do horrible things to me."

Lera smiled in sympathy, patting the girl gently on the back and trying to get her on her feet; thankfully she didn't seem to be hurt, if only a little bit shaken by the ordeal "Is there anywhere I can take you?" the girl continued hugging her for a few moments before she seemed to regain her composure "Oh..n-no, sorry..thankyou I mean uh...you were amazing...I hear stories about shinobi, but to see one in action...Uhm, I'm sure you're really busy...I'll uhm let you go..."

The girl finally released her death like hug on Lera and stepped backwards, before sprinting off back into the market. She was rather abrupt with her exit, which left Lera wondering if the girl was actually just a little bit scared of her. In hindsight though, that was probably a good thing; a little bit of fear here and there would stop things like this from happening again. She took a look down at Jenna, noting that the wolf was looking at her with a newfound respect. She openened her mouth and spoke a few words that made Lera incredibly happy "I'm glad you're the one who signed our scroll master."

Lera blinked in surprise, not expecting such a thing from a wolf; such loyal and powerful creatures, they rarely showed respect to someone who didn't deserve it "Thank you Jenna, that really means a lot to me. But please, just call me Jenna. Now lets go" The wolf let out a little yelp of agreement and followed her back into the market.* - Tue Sep 29 15:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved all the clothes into a pile and spat a stream of fire onto them, burning them down rather quickly.* - Wed Sep 30 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright~ - Wed Sep 30 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can have the first move. - Wed Sep 30 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked in surprise at Violets speed, she'd improved dramatically since the last time they'd fought; though that was a given since it had been over a year now. If there was one thing she knew, it was that she couldn't let her get close; it would soon end in her defeat. First off, she formed a single handseal and created four clones; positioning them between herself and violet. With Violets skill, she would likely dispatch all four relatively quickly; but it would buy her some time at least. While her clones protected her, Lera would retreat backwards as quickly as possible.* - Wed Sep 30 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Two of the clones would completely forsake their own defense, getting destroyed easily in order to summon large pools of mud that covered the area entirely. Then while Violet finished off her remaining clones, Lera quickly formed her hands into three seperate seals; directing her chakra towards the now mud covered ground.

Rising from the mud was what looked like a large dragon head, opening its deep maw directly towards Violet. A bright light shined from within its mouth, before it fired off a hail of high speed pellets. She dumbed down its power enough to not cause serious damage, but if it struck it more than had the power to knock Violet over and leave her bruised.* - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Work it Violet , twerk it Lera..-omit- - Wed Sep 30 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) brought her hands together in another seal, except this time she didn't summon her clones. Instead, she used the earth around Violets feet to form a large earthen dome. If successful, the dome would spring up around violet, enclosing her inside the large space and trapping her. Lera knew full well that Violet could use the Mole technique and thus escape would be easy. This however would buy her time to use her next technique, which was perfect against those who traveled underground.* - Wed Sep 30 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had just been about to form handseals to fire off her own Raiton jutsu when her dome shattered from the inside out, revealing Violet with her glowing blades. She hadn't known violet was capable of using Raiton, especially not on that scale. Considering she was now up against what was essentially a close combat Raiton user, her best option was to start using her own best element.

Taking a step forwards, she formed five handseals in quick succession and reared back her head. Upon exhaling, she released a huge number of wind shards. Though like usual in a spar, the power was reduced enough to not tear her to shreds; but enough to cause considerable pain.* - Wed Sep 30 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dropped her hands and moved forwards, intending the let Violet use her as a crutch.

"That'll do for now"* - Wed Sep 30 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked and took the scroll outstretched in Fujitora's hand "Uh...thanks? I mean, you don't want anything in return?"* - Wed Sep 30 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, not unless y' see fit...Then Yeah I'd accept.. - Wed Sep 30 06:51:44 2015
