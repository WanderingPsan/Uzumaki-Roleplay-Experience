<br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anything else that might be interesting or suited to me? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's, Rapier, possibly a katana...not liking the katana's all that well though. - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm....You'd look sexy with Sai's...I mean...Hm, Maybe Kukiri's? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What are those? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Damn...didn't get her. - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're short curved blades. Thick and durable. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't think I've ever seen those before. So they are fast but durable? - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's, Rapier, or Kukiri... - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Instead of being curved backwards like a Machete, they're curved forward. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's are small but easy to break. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're generally also used in pairs. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Rapier gives range but even more easy to break. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Kukiri is strong but short. - Tue Nov 10 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I want to look into the rapier and kukiri. - Tue Nov 10 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Probably read up on them. - Tue Nov 10 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. They're sure to have something on them in the library. - Tue Nov 10 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyway.~ - Tue Nov 10 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhhhmmm? - Tue Nov 10 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you know a guy named Aza? - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Aza? Can't say I do. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... okay, I was going to ask you about him. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who is he? - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He has some trouble controlling something and I am going to help hi--oh, he's one of the shinobi here. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahhh. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Boyfriend to someone called Nari. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't know. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't know her either. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just was going to ask you about him if you knew anything. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sort of concerned if he looses I might get hurt. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope sorry, I'm still unfamiliar with some people in this village...? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If he loses it? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Really sweet guy, just has issues controllin-yeah, he has some shinobi skill that makes him forget himself. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Looks Like I have to stick by you then. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Weeeeell, that is very nice as always to hear. For those sessions though I don't think he will want anyone but Nari around. He said that she helps keep him calm though, so there's that? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's pretty secret about it. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...I see... - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I will worry you know...? - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'd rather stick as close as possible... - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't wo--.....ahhhhhha. Called it. - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Well aren't you two love birds? Also, It seems like he needs to be kept in check whenever she is not around. Wouldn't want people to get hurt. - Tue Nov 10 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) scrunched it up and pouted at her.

"I can't help it."* - Tue Nov 10 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...That doesn't stop me from worrying ya know. - Tue Nov 10 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeeeees, I know. - Tue Nov 10 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* - Tue Nov 10 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: It'd be best if you had allies around you while you're doing that. - Tue Nov 10 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I won't insist to be in the room...but...i'm gonna keep an ear out. - Tue Nov 10 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out a big long sigh, she was trying not to be too overprotective but it wasn't that easy to do. She relaxed her muscles and tried not to worry so much, the niggling sensation was always going to be there though.

"I know I know...and I'll never force you to do...or in this case to not do, anything. But...well I can't help but worry, I don't think I ever won't worry."* - Tue Nov 10 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: After the first two times...not going to lose this for a third time.. - Tue Nov 10 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Listen, I don't think he could hurt me if he wanted to.... he told me I reminded him of his mother...and he was crying. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I know why you worry. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Right...It extends to a lot of stuff though...I don't just mean him. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And that's okay. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No no, I know, love. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'll be careful, always for you. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Alright...thank you. I'll try to be careful too. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hah, I don't really believe that but I hope you prove me wrong. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I actually had a pretty nice idea earlier. Something for me to do~ - Tue Nov 10 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh? - Tue Nov 10 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm thinking of opening a business here in Sunagakure. With some of the profits going to the village of course. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...retiring? - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It'll be a business that buys and sells jutsu, I'll also offer my services to teach new jutsu. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nah, not for a long while yet. But its something to keep me busy when I'm not training. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That... sounds nice. Is this your way to stay here? - Tue Nov 10 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Though I could go back to Kirigakure, theres nothing left for me there. - Tue Nov 10 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Everything I care about is here. - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Then don't go back. - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I won't - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not while I have you... - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) caught the girls hand before it was completely pulled away, gripping it genetly between both of hers.

"Selfish? I don't think so. If anything I'm the one being selfish."* - Tue Nov 10 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I just want....you...thats all I want. - Tue Nov 10 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) mirrored Kiyoko's grin with her own.

"I wouldn't have it any other way...Sure you've already figured it out. I'm quite persistent"* - Tue Nov 10 15:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hahahaha. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You enjoyed it though. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Not sure if I'm the one that went after you to charm or if you plotted it all along and trapped me. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who knows~ - Tue Nov 10 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'll get my answers.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm looking forward to the attempt already. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ..did you get your shower fixed? heh. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ehhh, who needs a door anyway. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Still can't believe you ripped it off. - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It was just some interior decoration. - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: it worked though didn't it? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: To prove a point or to ...calm  you down? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe both...? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Who knows what i'll 'rip off' next time... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If we keep it up your whole house is going to need renovated. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: We're already thinking in sync... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: He's standing sort of ...close. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm? - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Pretty sure he just...heard that. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at Kurt with a lazy expression.

"Probably."* - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: And she finds that amusing... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: What? Whats wrong with talking about interior decoration? - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I am minding my own business. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *wink* - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The fact you know what we are talking about shows you can hear us. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It is pretty rude. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Heh, she's embarrassed....cute. - Tue Nov 10 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Doesn't mean I will judge what you are talking about. - Tue Nov 10 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Too cute... - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah...did I say that outloud? - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Woops/ - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....hmph. - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You want to show me how to use wind then?  - Tue Nov 10 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. If you want to learn. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Anything but being teased. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. We'll move over to that rock, I can practice at the same time then. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you want to learn the chakra flow technique spefically? Or just all the techniques I can teach you. - Tue Nov 10 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean the main one would be the chakra flow that I'll be using but if you have something else you'd like to teach me I will learn. - Tue Nov 10 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh, I know a lot of Wind techniques. - Tue Nov 10 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Probably not as many as my father, but enough. - Tue Nov 10 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Up to you.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrnnnn.....Choiceeeessss. - Tue Nov 10 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well alright. I'll at least teach you the basic wind technique. We can go from there. - Tue Nov 10 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alrighty. - Tue Nov 10 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put her hands togethere in a single seal, easily viewable for Kiyoko. She then breathed in deeply and exhaled a stream of wind chakra. The chakra spread across the floor it minature tornadoes.

"Godly wind from the mountain. Or divine wind for short. First, for the wind; imagine an infitely sharp blade, down to the nanometre. Then apply that thought to your chakra. Theres a lot of variety to wind, but the basic concept is 'cutting' so use that as your focal point. For the technique, well...the image is pretty self explanatory I think."* - Tue Nov 10 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You got the wind part down really fast.... - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...That was wind? - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It took me more attempts than that. - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: More like a dud. - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nah, its a good start. Especially if you've never used the element before. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...not at all. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then its good. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll be practicing my jutsu at the same time as well. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 10 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to the oversized rock and put her arms around it. She showed some strain, but with the help of her gravity jutsu she was able to lift it off the floor. The practice she intended to do wasn't to lighten the load though, it was to increase it. So she channeled her chakra through the rock and suddenly increased its weight exponentially. She didn't even bother trying to hold it up; instead just letting it drop with a huge crash. It was an exercise she intended to repeat.* - Tue Nov 10 15:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? Don't mind me, keep going. You nearly have it. - Tue Nov 10 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went the opposite way with the rock this time, simply straight up increasing its weight instead of lifting it up first. As the weight increase, the sand beneath it began to bow to the pressure. The Rock slowly start to sink further into the ground, its sheer weight proving too much for the sandy ground to hold. She knew that if she could just master this technique...there was no way Sanoke would be able to stand up under its effect.* - Tue Nov 10 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled at Kiyoko's success, she knew she wasn't a paticularly good teacher; even though she enjoyed passing on the techniques.

"Mhm, just a little bit of practice and it'll be perfect. This one's best when combined with flames as well. Throw an explosive tag in there and watch the fireworks happen."* - Tue Nov 10 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, I know I know. I'm not very good at explaining things... - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In my head it just sort've...works ya know? - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not quite the same for everyone else though... - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I thought that would take more out of me than it did. - Tue Nov 10 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, its a very basic technique. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Doesn't take a lot to use. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course my chakra is pretty low from healing earlier. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Is it? You should've set something, we could've postponed this. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Bah. Yan and that stuff. - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It isn't all that bad. - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, Looks like I have to carry you home then *nod* - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...oh my.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think you just like treating me like a damsel. - Tue Nov 10 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) picked the girl up in a firemans cradle and carried her off towards her home, once inside she immediately went for the bedroom and gently laid her down on the bed.* - Tue Nov 10 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Comfy? - Tue Nov 10 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She's kind of adorable with how protective she is. - Tue Nov 10 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned and stepped back from the bed, propping her equipment and leaving her jacket on a chair.

"Nope...I kinda wanted to show you something actually."* - Tue Nov 10 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Mn...this room... I love the smell of it. - Tue Nov 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So many books. - Tue Nov 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved towards the piano, wiping a little of the dust away from the exposed keys.

"Just...a little song."* - Tue Nov 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat in front of the piano, running her fingers gently across the keys as she got the feel back for it. She experimentally pressed a few keys down, pleased to hear that the piano was still in tune. Then...with a deep and shaky breath, she started to play and sing.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oQv3leISYU)* - Tue Nov 10 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rested her hands on the keys with a sigh, she couldn't help but let the old emotions stir; but she couldn't put off her hobby forever.

"Yeah...I wrote it...about a year and a half ago. A few weeks before...Samehada's first owner died..."* - Tue Nov 10 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dropped onto the bed next to Kiyoko and stared up to the ceiling.

"Yeah I did..."* - Tue Nov 10 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She must not have been with Violet for very long. - Tue Nov 10 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched Kiyoko's reaction with an open mouth, she hadn't quite expected her to react like that. She was always surprising her.

"Theres something I want to say...its a long one so buckle up. When he...when Seisuke died, I wanted to end it there; I felt like there was no point in living anymore. Whats the point if you can't love any more right? It was family that convinced me otherwise, so I decided to live for his memory instead. Then I met Violet again, we'd already been friends for years and we just sort've took that a step further."

She took a deep breath before continuing on, unsure of what Kiyoko would say to her afterwards "Even with Violet though, the hole in my heart never filled; I still felt so...empty, Violet helped but it wasn't the same. Thats why I'm so thankful to you, so thankful that I met you. Because its like you've stepped right into that hole, as if it were made for you in the first place and everyone else was just keeping it warm. You saved me from a real dark place...and I love you for it."* - Tue Nov 10 16:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled, trying to hold back her own sniffles; she liked to appear as the strong one, but a tear every now and then was okay. Leaning forwards, she rested her cheek against Kiyoko's chest; hugging her closely.

"I don't want anything more than that right now....Thank you..."* - Tue Nov 10 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't help it now, the sobs just came all on their own. She was the shy weak little girl again, finally lifting the shadowed veil from her life in the embrace of someone she truly loved. She couldn't say much past the words "Thank you" no other words could form past her sobs.* - Tue Nov 10 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh god, what have I done to you, poor sweet girl. - Tue Nov 10 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) would finally subside into quiet sniffles, but she still held onto Kiyoko tightly. She managed to let out a shaky laugh, while the tremors slowly subsided.

"ha ha...and I thought I was the strong one. Sorry...i didn't mean to lose it like that."* - Tue Nov 10 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Shh, you didn't lose it. You let go, that's alright. You can let go anytime you need to. Clearly you haven't in a long time. - Tue Nov 10 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I guess...I guess I haven't...funny huh... - Tue Nov 10 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You say you think you were the strong one but you -are-. You have gone through so much loss and survived and remain strong, crying doesn't show weakness.. it shows release. I am weak, I wouldn't even know what to do if I experienced loss. - Tue Nov 10 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I...I don't want you to have to experience. I'm going to do my utmost to prevent it... - Tue Nov 10 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I know you will, but in this world with me now being a shinobi and gaining shinobi friends, you know that is likely impossible. - Tue Nov 10 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I know...I won't promise, but I can try. - Tue Nov 10 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Good, good girl... - Tue Nov 10 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finally took control of herself once more and repositioned herself so her head was right next Kiyoko's.

"Soooooo....when am I meeting those parents of yours." her confident grin was back, teasing kiyoko a little.* - Tue Nov 10 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm? Whats the question? - Tue Nov 10 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you used to always being in control in a relationship? Or are you just getting a chance with me because I'm so weak.~ - Tue Nov 10 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm...well, usualy I am in control with these things. But even I get 'dominated' sometimes. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I like being dominated...hehehe. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you were the dominating one in both relationships? - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Most of the time. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was just wondering.~ - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh, I don't mind letting you take control~ if you think you can handle me. - Tue Nov 10 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a little.* - Tue Nov 10 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Plus.... - Tue Nov 10 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sort of silly for me to try and control you with how much stronger you are. - Tue Nov 10 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed a bit louder and reached out to poke her on the forehead.

"Its not always to do with strength silly. You just have to be confident~ And I'm 'confident' that you could do anything if you put your mind to it."* - Tue Nov 10 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have plenty confidence in bed but you are clearly meant to be in charge. - Tue Nov 10 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, we'll see we'll see. - Tue Nov 10 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We have a loooot of years ahead of us. No need to rush. - Tue Nov 10 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Planning ahead are we?~ - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maaaybe. - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Tell me. - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What do you see, love? - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her eyebrows and shifted back onto her back, staring up at the ceiling with a thoughtful expression. She reached up towards it, clasping her hand at some invisible scene.

"I see...I see us, old and happy. Grey from the years with our children and their children playing happily around us. And I see the end, together in our final moments surrounded by all the people we love. I see two souls, forever entwined together."* - Tue Nov 10 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) Lera raised her eyebrows and shifted back onto her back, staring up at the ceiling with a thoughtful expression. She reached up towards it, clasping her hand at some invisible scene.

"I see...I see us, old and happy. Grey from the years with our children and their children playing happily around us. And I see the end, together in our final moments surrounded by all the people we love. I see two souls, forever entwined together."* - Tue Nov 10 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned her head and grinned towards her.

"Not just yet, but in the future. Lots of children and I want to live to see our grandchildren and maybe even their children."* - Tue Nov 10 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh well then, LOTS. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehehe. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You sure know how to scare a girl. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We can take it in turns~ I'll have one first and then you have one~ - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or maybe at the same time... - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh dear. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I feel like you are fibbing. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I hope she is fibbing. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled again, feeling completely giddy with happiness; she was sort've joking but at the same time, she really wasn't.

"Maybe I am, maybe I'm not."* - Tue Nov 10 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, I suppose I will just have to see. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, lord knows we have enough time. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right, after all you still are a baby.~ - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes but theres on big factor. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm -your- baby. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) scrunched her nose up again and layed her head back into the pillows. She released a contented sigh and reached for Kiyoko's hand.

"This is...so perfect. I could lay here like this for days...maybe longer."* - Tue Nov 10 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised another eyebrow, slowly locking her fingers into Kiyoko's at the same time.

"Oh? I must just smell good~"* - Tue Nov 10 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised Kiyoko's hand to her mouth, holding it to her lips.

"Well, maybe you'll just have to stay here tonight...and tomorrow night too."* - Tue Nov 10 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Family isn't going to like that, getting away with one night was hard. - Tue Nov 10 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) heard the tone of her voice, could hear that she didn't really think that was possible.

"Your family?"* - Tue Nov 10 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *Sighs* Yes. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know they will be upset. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I -do- want to stay. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Perhaps you meeting them is a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sure they won't be able to refuse. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're family is a noble one right? - Tue Nov 10 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... all about the family name being clean and upheld. - Tue Nov 10 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm...this could be easy or hard. I'm not sure. - Tue Nov 10 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My family was a noble one as well. - Tue Nov 10 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know how they work...usually. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyone who shames them, they don't hide what happened they openly kick them out of the family. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well think of it like this - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My father is the kazekage and part of quite a noble family himself. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, they will... like that. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What an honor it would be...if a noble daughter were to marry into that family. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It will make it easier. - Tue Nov 10 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: They just aren't qu-- - Tue Nov 10 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Grin* See, The bigwigs are easy to manipulate if you know how. - Tue Nov 10 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm? Something wrong? - Tue Nov 10 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ............nope. - Tue Nov 10 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm? I don't believe you~ - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Come on, don't be stupid. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I caught her off guard again. this is fun. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: We were just talking about children, growing old together, of course marriage was on that list. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope, nothing...really. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyhow. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: They just aren't quite the same free spirited as your father is. - Tue Nov 10 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled her in close, letting herself be used as a pillow.

"Don't worry, we have plenty of time...and trust me, I don't think anyone is as spirited as he is."* - Tue Nov 10 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Something they will like about you also is that you are quite an accomplished shinobi, at least from what I know. - Tue Nov 10 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...all of my family members who are of age are shinobi. - Tue Nov 10 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. I can definitely progress further. - Tue Nov 10 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I intend to. - Tue Nov 10 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We will just see. - Tue Nov 10 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We can take it slowly. Introduce me to them, not as your lover but your friend. - Tue Nov 10 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Let them get used to me. - Tue Nov 10 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah. - Tue Nov 10 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Tell me something about yourself I wouldn't suspect. - Tue Nov 10 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hnnnn....hrm - Tue Nov 10 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Something you wouldn't expect... - Tue Nov 10 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not sure....Er....I did once survive on an island for a little over a month by myself. - Tue Nov 10 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your turn. - Tue Nov 10 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Jeez. - Tue Nov 10 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... - Tue Nov 10 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The first time I came and set on the bench with you, I said it was because you were talking to a sword. - Tue Nov 10 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But. - Tue Nov 10 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Really I came and set on the bench with you because you were brave enough to talk to a sword in public and not care what people thought. - Tue Nov 10 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? Interesting. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright...huhm.... - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...really like cats. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And you? - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I really like cats too, but dogs seem to like me a lot. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Ironic when I summon wolves huh. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Really, maybe I should introduce you to Jenna sometime. - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Jenna? - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My wolf~ - Tue Nov 10 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh I see. - Tue Nov 10 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well, I don't know how  wolf might act. Never met one. - Tue Nov 10 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: She's pretty exciteable actually. Still a pup heh. - Tue Nov 10 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Aw. - Tue Nov 10 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I can't wait to meet her then. - Tue Nov 10 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I can summon her now if you want. - Tue Nov 10 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If you'd like. - Tue Nov 10 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned and pulled a thumb to her mouth, making a tiny incision on it with her teeth. She rubbed the blood across her palm and then formed a few handseals. A puff of smoke receded outwards as she pressed her palm onto the bed, causing a small wolf to appear on the bed inbetween Lera and Kiyoko.

Jenna looked about the room quizzically for a few moments, confused as to why her master would summon her to a place like this. It glanced around for a few moments more before speaking in a distinctly feminite voice.

"Master? Why did you summon me here?"* - Tue Nov 10 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Jenna blinked a couple times at Kiyoko and looked towards Lera "Master? Who's this?"

Lera smiled warmly at the little wolf "She's someone very very special to me, her name is Kiyoko. She doesn't know much about summoned animals though. Almost all summoned animals can speak Kiyoko, they're not ordinary animals."

The wolf regarded Lera closely and then turned back to Kiyoko with a big wofly grin. She leaned in and gave Kiyoko a quick lick on the cheek "You made master happy again?"* - Tue Nov 10 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Jenna laid down between the pair, resting her head close to Kiyoko's chest.

"You can scratch my ears if you want."

Lera watched the exchange with a pleased smile, glad that Jenna seemed to Like Kiyoko "You better do it, she'll never leave you alone otherwise."* - Tue Nov 10 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Jenna's tail slowly rose into the air while her mouth hung open with tongue lolling out. The look in her half closed eyes was that of pure bliss, a few moments in a strange noise began to reverberate from her chest. Was the wolf purring? Yes....yes she was.* - Tue Nov 10 18:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned at Kiyoko, a hint of humor in her eyes.

"You must be a natural at this."

Jenna was slipping in to sheer wolfy happiness and had begun to drool on the sheets.* - Tue Nov 10 18:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at Kiyoko with a bemused expression for some time while she ranted on. After the rant was over, she burst out laughing and puled Kiyoko into a tight embrace.

"Oh man...oh man! I love you so much. Hahaha."* - Tue Nov 10 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, honestly you had my interest when I saw you for the first time. I most definitely would not have complained if you'd gone after me. - Tue Nov 10 18:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt a tingling travel up her spine, as her breath shuddered out. Just Kiyoko's touch was enough to make her feel excited, but right now she was content to cuddle.
