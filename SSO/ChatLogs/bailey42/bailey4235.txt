<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pressed her fingers against the wound, watching as Kiyoko's lifeblood seeped away into the sand and the spark in her eyes slowly slipped away to nothing. She shattered, persona breaking into tiny pieces impossible to find; she was broken, rent into pieces impossible to put back together. It was all her fault, ever single mistake played back; everything that had ever gone wrong and had yet to go wrong, taunting her with a nightmarish visage. It was all over.

She woke with a start, panting heavily with sweat soaking into the bed sheets. That was one hell of a nightmare and it scared her so much more than it should have done. Despite Kiyoko's insistance that her wounds were her own fault, Lera still blamed herself on a deep unconciouss level. Both Seisuke and Violet had died simply because she'd not been there to help them, she was determined not to make the same mistake with Kiyoko. No matter what, that nightmare must not become a reality.

Sighing away from the dark thoughts she twisted herself out of bed and trailed her way towards the shower, she made sure to pick up Samehada on her way; knowing how much that sword loved water. Before getting into the shower, she unwrapped samehada to reveal the true form hidden beneath them. Samehada was a frighteningly monstrous blade, with a mouth of sharp teeth and its impossibly hard and sharp scales; it was easy to see why the blade was dangerous.

In its normal form, Samehada was much the same size as he would be when wrapped; however, she knew he was capable of growing much larger and more frightening something she'd only seen a glimpse of so far. In the shower, she kept Samehada propped up against the wall; making sure he got a good soaking from the water. The blade seemed to wriggle and squeak happily as the water soaked into it, causing a smile to light up Lera's face. Though the blade was pretty scary, she knew that it was not evil; it was only as evil as the one who wielded and Lera was decidely not evil.

She stood under the shower for a while, closing her eyes and raising her face to the falling water; it was somewhat comforting, the silent tap of water on her face. She could only indulge for so long however, so after lathering her body and hair with soap and washing it off she reluctantly extracted herself from the warm water fall and dried herself off. Once dry, she carefully re-wrapped the now damp bandages around Samehada and place it on her back once more.

She hadn't quite decided what to do today, whether it was to go hunting or maybe sit in the academy and wait for business. Her newly created business hadn't really had much...'business' so far, but that didn't matter; it was the idea behind it that counted and it would surely begin to thrive eventually. She was thinking hard on it when an idea suddenly came to her, she felt it was too early to propose but surely a proper date with Kiyoko wouldn't go out of place right?

So she decided to set about making preparations for that before going off to do her daily training. First off, she would need a dress; something that would go well for a date, perhaps she would even wear make up. It didn't take long for her to find a dress, Lera had simple tastes and so her dress would be simple as well. With that bought, she traveled to one of the villages resteraunts, the best one she knew of, and booked a special room in the back of the resteraunt. After leaving specific instructions and putting down a considerable down-payment, she left the resteraunt on an excited high.

With almost all preparations made, she wandered off to the training grounds. As she wandered in, she found herself a little amused by the wary looks the shinobi and soldiers were giving her. It wasn't exactly unwarranted, considering the last time she'd come here she'd challenged every single one of the people present and had nearly won at that. It was only because of the jounin that had been present at the time that she'd lost. While she could happily take on a group of genin and maye Chuunin without issues, add three Jounin on top of that and she wouldn't last long.

She found herself approached by the same Jounin as before, this time he had a light smile on his face; though the look in his eye was clearly Quizzical "Lera! What a nice surprise, I didn't expect to see you here again after...last time. You look considerably happier though, thats good." she heard a few sniggers come from the nearby groups in training, she even heard one of the larger soldiers say "-nice- surprise...yeah right. My jaw's still saw from the little Bitch's punch"

The Jounin surprisingly rounded on the soldier with an angry glare, staring the man down...or up considering his overbearing size "Do not judge her actions before understanding them soldier, this girl has seen more hell than any of you ever will in your lives. Besides, you decided to confront a powerful shinobi alone, with nothing but your bare hands. You only have yourself to blame." after his little rant, the Jounin turned back to her with a sheepish grin "I...Did a little research after last time. I was curious. The names Aaron, pleasure to make your aquaintance."

Lera's surprise was obvious, she hadn't expected him to take any sort of interest in her; nor had she expected him to sincerely be that angry at someone for insulting her "Aaron...right, its nice to meet you and...thank you." she then turned to the soldier as well, holding out her hand to shake "I apologize for my actions before, It was foolish of me to act that way...although I was not in my right mind at the time, that is no excuse. Will you accept my apology?"

The soldier stared at her hand with a blank expression, though his eyebrows were raised; he had not expected her to be quite so sincere. As a upstanding member of Sunagakures army, he was not used to informality and Lera did technically outrank him so he took a soldiers approach. He took her hand, watching it dissapear into his meaty digits and shook his head in wonder. Shinobi scared him something, that such a tiny girl could exhibit monstrous strength was just unnatural "Thank you Ma'am. I accept your apology and give you my own, my words were out of line, will you accept mine?"

Lera nodded and smiled, shaking his big meaty hand with a gusto. It was scary to think that such a big man would be so weak to her standard. For an ordinary man, he was strong yes; but for a shinobi he rested neatly on the level of a genin. Lera knew she could pick him up and snap him like a twig if she really wanted to, it was a scary thought "I accept. Thank you." as she let go of his hand, he stepped back and saluted her "Thank you Ma'am" before returning to his training.

When she turned back to Aaron, she noted that he was smiling at her. She watched his smile and tilted her head to the side "What?" he just shook his head and gestured to the people around, none of them were sniggering anymore; in fact they seemed perfectly comfortable with her presence "You just changed everyone opinion of you with a few simple words, you'd make a good leader I think" Lera made a 'pfft' sound and shook her head "No, no I wouldn't. I'm not leadership material. Besides, I like having the freedom."

Aaron shrugged his shoulders and adressed her in a light tone "So! Anyway. What did you come here for today?" Lera nodded her head and took Samehada from her back, swinging it down with a wolfish grin "Training" the look of plaing horror on Aaron's face was totally worth it, he looked ready to crap himself "Oh god...your not going to challenge everyone again are you? Some of the genin are still recovering from the last time. You're frighteningly strong you know."

Lera took stock of the look on his face and burst out laughing, it was worth scaring him for that "Hahaha, No no. I'm not going to do that again, sorry everyone by the way. If I hurt anyone, it wasn't really my intention. But no, I'm more out for a spar with a Jounin or two I think." she could almost taste the relief on Aaron's face and she could even hear laughter coming from a few of the groups around them; this time however, they were laughing with her not at her. Aaron nodded, beggining to walk towards one of the sparring rings "That I can do. I think I can give you a good run for your money. Besides, I've been itching to fight you at your best."

She followed him to the ring and took her side, noting that there was already quite a crowd forming around them; nobody wanted to miss a fight like this. However, it also meant that Lera could not use any big techniques; for fear of hitting any of audience. Her attention snapped back to Aaron when he started speaking again, taking in his words with a nod "So, I'm a generalist shinobi; I tend to use a bit of anything and everything. Don't think you can get me so easily"

Lera's smile was innocently sweet, taking stock of his words. A generalist shinobi would be difficult to beat, especially a good one. Technically, someone who'd 'mastered' being a generalist would technically be invulnerable; having some sort of technique or fighting style to counter anything thrown at them. This was going to be a good fight after all "Thats good. As you know, I'm a ninjutsu and elemental specialist; though I'm getting pretty good with my buddy here." she glanced at Samehada lovingly as she said those last words.

Aaron thought she was a little crazy talking about her sword, or club, like that. The crazy ones often proved to be the stronger ones though, so he looked forward to this. He had a feeling that if she went all out with her Ninjutsu, she would thoroughly thrash him; he'd heard vague rumors about her new 'business' and that she offered to teach the jutsu she was selling. If that was the case, she would have to know a huge amount of Ninjutsu; a scary thought that was.

Without further ado, he charged forwards showing off a great deal of speed; much faster than she was capable of moving. Moments before he reached her to make the first attack, she spat out a tiny stream of mud at his feet. The sudden change in surface made him slip, but He'd seen her use this technique and thus dodged the subsequent swing from Samehada. He used his gained momentum to spin his entire body and drop into a low kick. Lera's mind was not paticularly strategic, but she was highly intelligent and she put that to use here.

She went through a number of scenarios in what felt like a split second. She could jump and let herself fly, but that would make a good surprise attack later; she could increase the weight of her leg so that the strike would not unbalance her, but that would cause her considerable damage. She could also use the Domu technique to reduce the damage to herself, but that wouldn't make good practice; she needed to stop relying on that technique so much. There was another strategy, but it was risky and unlikely to succeed; she did it anyway though, for the sake of practice.

As his kick rocketed towards her leg, she lifted her foot upwards and brought it down on his; intending to stop the kick from ever reaching her. If not for the fact that he was holding back some of his speed and strength for fear of hurting her, she would not have succeeded. As her foot slammed into his, she channeled her Doton chakra and intended to soften the earth under his foot. Aaron watched in surprise as his foot sank into the sandy earth; he could shift it out easily, but it slowed him down enough to allow Lera an attack.

Seeing as Lera was not trying to cause any serious damage, she swung Samehada towards his head; knowing that he could duck and dodge it even with his foot trapped. After dodging, he shifted his body and leaned backwards; bracing his hands on the ground and tearing his foot out of the sand in an upwards kick. She saw it coming from his body movements, the sand slowing him down enough to give her an easy counter. She raised her leg once again and caught his shin on the sole of her foot, the strength of his leg kept pushing her upwards; she used the momentum to jump high into the air, backflip once and land gracefully on her feet.

Their watching audience let out a collective breath, it had been a short exchange barely lasting more than a few seconds; but it was intense even for the ones who didn't really understand what had happened. Even the shinobi who did understood that this was some high level fighting. Aaron looked on at Lera, his heart beating fast and a wide grin etched into his face. He knew she was good, but not -that- good; this was going to be one of the best spars he'd had in his life most likely.

Lera was similarly excited, this was turning out to be more fun than expected; she saw now that she'd been far too ambitious to think she could take on multiple Jounin, just this guy alone was an even match. He was much better than her in Close combat, without her Ninjutsu for back up this would have been no contest. He soon showed how much of a generalist he was by forming several handseals she knew well, she knew from the handseals that he was about to use the technique ragin waves; a big wave of water capable of enveloping a number of enemies.

He was obviously confident that she would stop it, for a technique like that would hit the crowds. In retaliation, she formed one handseal and spat out enough mud to form a clone. The clone immediately began forming more handseals, moulding chakra at a faster rate than Aaron due to specialising in this. Soon the wave of water was spat outwards and began traveling towards Lera and her clone. However, it was met by a large wall of constructed mud. The mud wall easily stopped his wave, absorbing some of it but leaving the majority to crash back to the ground.

Lera didn't stop there however. She charged a large amount of chakra to her palm and thrust it forwards, essentially throwing a ball of conentrated Lightning. The Ball made contact with her wall and shattered it, but that was not her full intention. With how well water conducted Lightning, she saw the remnants of her technique conduct through the water and race across the ground towards Aaron. However, he saw this as well and jumped high into the sky; intending the dodge the Raiton completely.

Whilst in the air, he formed a few more handseals; spitting out a concentrated bullet of water straight towards Lera. This would be a good time to surprise him she figured, so she shot towards the bullet and took flight. It seemed like she might just collide with the bullet and be knocked from the air, however; at the last moment she swung Samehada at it, slicing it in half and removing the chakra. This left her a clear path to Aaron who was now falling towards the ground, who looked on in surprise as Lera flew at him and swung Samehada down from above.

Aaron raised his arms to catch the blade, blocking the worst of the blow on his forearms. It helped that her swing was much weaker due to her lightened body, but that didn't stop it from stinging like a bitch. The blow knocked him off balance and straight towards the ground, he took a moment to right himself before landing on his feet with a thud. He shook off the pain in his arms and looked upwards in amazement, there was not a single person in the audience that didn't have their jaws hanging open "You can fly??? The hell?"

Lera looked down on him, winking slightly before she increased her weight and began to fall. Mid-fall, she raised Samehada above her head and started to bring it down; as if she were tying to smash it ontop of him with unstoppable force. Seconds before she touched the ground, she increased her weight; just enough to add an extra oomph to her strike. It was more of a scare tactic as she knew he would dodge and he did, with a jump to the side. Her strike continued on, slamming samehada into the ground with enough force to create a small crater; such was her current strength.

Aaron knew not to let-up on the attack, lest he gave her another chance to attack. So he immediately launched into another one, swinging his foot towards the back of her head. Lera took this chance to test out something she'd been teasing around for a while, she took a hand from Samehada's hilt and raised it as if to catch his kick. As soon as his leg came into contact with her palm, Aaron assumed he had won; ordinarily it would be impossible to block a kick with one had. Lera however, had different ideas.

She let her hand bend back from the force of his kick, intending to push his kick upwards using the art of mis-direction. That alone was not enough however, at the same moment she was systematically lowering the weight of his leg; lightening the kick significantly enough to make re-directing it easily. Aaron watched in shock as his kick sailed easily over her head, missing her by several inches; he couldn't understand how his leg had suddenly felt so much lighter, Lera was obviously more diverse than he'd realised.

With a successful dodge of his kick, she lashed out with her own leg; intending to knock his awkward one legged balance away. Her foot connected with his leg successfully and she was greeted by him fall sideways towards the ground. Tasting victory, she raised Samehada and swung it down; slamming it into the ground just a few centimetres above his head. She smiled down at him trying to surpress her laughter, she had not expected it to turn out like this; it would show her not to be so confident in victory "A draw then?"

Aaron mirrored her grin and shifted his foot from her hip, a knife had shot out of the toe of his boot and he'd raised it to hover just milimetres from her kidneys just as she'd been swinging Samehada. She couldn't claim victory, an attack like that probably would have done her in. He laughed out loud and took Lera's hand helping him up "A draw, well; in the spirit of a spar yes. In an actual fight though, your strike would have killed me instantly; where-as mine would have just injured you. I would say this is your victory. I have much work to do it seems."

She shook her head and then started in surprise as their little audience had started to clap and shout out words like "That was awesome!", "Come fight again!" she looked around the crowds in bewilderment before Aaron clapped and called out the group "Alright alright, back to work guys. You should all be training" one by one the crowds filed off and went back to their respective groups to carry on training. Lera just looked around wide eyed and then back to Aaron "well that was certainly....something..."

Aaron laughed and held out his hand for her to shake "We'll have to do this again, that was a good fight; best fight i've had in years" Lera took hold of his hand, having a sudden idea as they came into contact "Yep, same for me. And by the way. I win~" as she spoke the words, his gravity was exponentially increased; causing him to crash to his knees with a body that could no longer support his own weight "Woah woah, the hell? I can't move. What did you do to me?"

Lera grinned down at him and released her hold, letting him get back up again at a normal weight "I use the Doton element to manipulate gravity. Thats how I'm able to fly. I recently learned how to make it go in the opposite direction, make people so heavy that they can't even move." Aaron stared at her as if she were talking in a different language, his eyes bugging out at the 'gravity' part "Gravity??? Jesus christ, you're really something. I've never heard of anyone who could manipulate gravity...thats insane."

She smiled sweetly and began backing away; ready to head back for some rest "Well, Anyone with the Doton element could do it to be honest. I was just the first person to figure it out. Anyway though, I have to go; things to do and all that." he shook his head with an exasperated sigh, there were some things that one just could not be modest about "Right right, I'll see you around then huh." Lera nodded at him and began walking out of the training grounds, waving back over her shoulder.* - Fri Nov 13 13:31:56 2015
