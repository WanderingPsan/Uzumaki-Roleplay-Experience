<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And you would litterally destroy -anyone- who would try to harm them. - Sat Nov 14 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah... - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: He's gonna make me fucking cry. - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) thought about Kiyoko's wounds.* - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's how I always felt about her always. - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Then let it out. - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her hand again, squeezing her fingers gently.* - Sat Nov 14 13:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: For what? - Sat Nov 14 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ge asked if theres anything else we want today. - Sat Nov 14 13:05:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 13:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Stop by again, I need to get a nap in. - Sat Nov 14 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood up next to her, never letting go of that hand in the process.

"Mhm, Thanks for the time pops."* - Sat Nov 14 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) glanced briefly at the tattoo, seeing the few letters that were there. She had a pretty good inkling it probably say 'RIN'.* - Sat Nov 14 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's had a long life. - Sat Nov 14 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) she said this while wrapping an arm around her and gently stroking her hair.* - Sat Nov 14 13:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My...no..our father is one of the kindest and strongest people I know. - Sat Nov 14 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He tends to have that effect if you get him to open up. - Sat Nov 14 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To tell you his story...he must really like you. - Sat Nov 14 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It was so sad...and wonderful....and perfect...but chaotic... - Sat Nov 14 13:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But those who do are stronger for it. - Sat Nov 14 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ngnng... - Sat Nov 14 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) repeatedly kissed the top of her head whilst rocking her back and forth, much like Kiyoko had done for her not so long ago.* - Sat Nov 14 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So...gonna guess that you like him huh? - Sat Nov 14 13:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh...his sincerity...its hard to not like him huh - Sat Nov 14 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. You'll see a lot more of him. - Sat Nov 14 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph. - Sat Nov 14 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm glad...it went well. - Sat Nov 14 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out a little moan the moment she saw her face, for some bizarre reason it was difficult to contain herself; the sooner Kiyoko got better the better it would be for the both of them.* - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just...ugh...trying very hard not to jump on you right now. - Sat Nov 14 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't break my concentration... - Sat Nov 14 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But look at me? I'm a mess. - Sat Nov 14 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For some reason...thats just turning me on...jeez. - Sat Nov 14 13:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And...all my stitches? - Sat Nov 14 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know that doesn't bother me. But I'm gonna hold back till you've healed. - Sat Nov 14 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But when that happens... - Sat Nov 14 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was asking if you liked them too but I suppose that was a no. - Sat Nov 14 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ohhh I thought you meant whether the scars would bother me. - Sat Nov 14 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well.. also I would like to know if you are going to like the scars. - Sat Nov 14 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your body is beautiful no matter whats added to it, so I think I will yes. - Sat Nov 14 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay, I feel sort of strange...going from having no scars to....this. - Sat Nov 14 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) kissed the top her her head again.

"Don't be, you'll always be beautiful. Even when your eighty and all wrinkled up."* - Sat Nov 14 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ewy. - Sat Nov 14 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Sat Nov 14 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph. - Sat Nov 14 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at her for a few seconds, before speaking abruptly.

"I love you.."* - Sat Nov 14 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed tried to bite the tip of her nose.

"I don't believe you!"* - Sat Nov 14 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) immediately regretted her actions as Kiyoko's little gesture broke her tightly held control. She let out a little gasp and pressed her lips against Kiyoko's, working her tongue in there as well.* - Sat Nov 14 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) eventually pulled away from the kiss, raising her face to the ceiling to take in a deep calming breath "Okay...okay...calm...I'm back in control."* - Sat Nov 14 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) groaned again and shook her head, trying to shake the rosy red hue that seemed to have settled over her vision.

"Just...a little."* - Sat Nov 14 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you going to be alright? - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Or am I going to find myself restitching myself later? - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can hold on...don't you worry. - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The longer I wait...the sweeter the fruit will be. - Sat Nov 14 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You didn't seem to be holding on a moment ago. - Sat Nov 14 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I didn't go any further did I...? - Sat Nov 14 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Not yet. - Sat Nov 14 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Psshh...'yet' doubting my willpower are we? - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I wouldn't mind her fucking me but it sounds like she doesn't think she can be careful. - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yes but I distinctly remember we no longer have a shower door. - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uh...needed more room...yes thats it.. - Sat Nov 14 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Riiiiight. - Sat Nov 14 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not my fault. - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know you can have me. - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're just so...tempting. - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are just worried you won't be gentle. - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A little... - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I never told you that you couldn't have me. - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I want you to be fully healed first... - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes yes I know. - Sat Nov 14 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmnhmmm... - Sat Nov 14 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you're done then? I guess we can just go to bed then. - Sat Nov 14 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....... - Sat Nov 14 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulped loudly and found her eyes roving up and down Kiyoko's body, the plain 'want' on her face was easy to see and her tightly gripped fists were trembling.

"K-Kiyoko..."* - Sat Nov 14 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This....is...not fair.. - Sat Nov 14 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think it's very fair. - Sat Nov 14 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Everyone has to go to sleep sometime. - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Even you, superwoman. - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood up and tore her clothes away, she wasn't gentle about it; the floor ended up in a litter of ragged pieces of cloth. Samehada was left against the cabinet and she followed Kiyoko in quick time.* - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh my, L-lera! What's come over you?!~ - Sat Nov 14 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't play innocent now... - Sat Nov 14 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What are you going to do to little o' me? - Sat Nov 14 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) -gently- picked the woman up and took her to the bed, intending to lay her down and then straddle her stomach. She was so so careful to avoid any stitching, she hoped she succeeded.* - Sat Nov 14 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was breathing in ragged gasps hands palms down on the bed, either side of Kiyoko's head. With a painful slowness, she leaned down and planted a short kiss on Kiyoko's mouth; moaning again as she moved the kiss to the side of her neck. At the same time she reached for Kiyoko's hand and gently moved it so her fingers were positioned directly underneath Lera's crotch.* - Sat Nov 14 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She wants me to please her? - Sat Nov 14 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moaned into Kiyoko's neck, pressing her heading against the pillows; leave it to another woman to know exactly what to touch. She was having mixed thoughts at the moment, part of her knew that they shouldn't be doing this yet. The rest of her however...just wanted it really really bad.

Ever so slowly, she sat herself up; forcing herself to keep those hips still, no matter how much she wanted to grind she had to be careful of Kiyoko. Reaching backwards, she lowered her own finger to Kiyoko's crotch; resting it against her clitoris before slowly trailing downwards and then back up.* - Sat Nov 14 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) reached down for her pants and casually tore them off, tossing them aside nonchalantly. With easy access, Kiyoko was able to do anything she wanted; she would feel the warm sticky wetness coating her finger allowing them to slide in with ease. As soon as they were inside, Lera gritted her teeth for a moment before opening her mouth in a huge gasp of air. Nothing could be more perfect than right now and as she slid her fingers inside Kiyoko's own tight little hole...she proved herself wrong again.* - Sat Nov 14 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sank her fingers deeper and deeper, hooking them upwards and into her G-spot. While she worked on stimulating there, she mashed her ball of her palm into Kiyoko's Clitoris; giving her as much pleasure as possible. It was all she could do not to start being more agressive; because at that point, Kiyoko started mmoving her fingers in ways Lera had never even experienced.

Her gasps quickly turned into groans, as a sweet viscous liquid began dripping onto Kiyoko's stomach. It was a wonder how Kiyoko could do so well despite having never done this before; but Lera was not one to complain.* - Sat Nov 14 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had a sudden thought and in her lust driven haze she went through with it. She took hold of Kiyoko's hand and pulled it away...but only for a moment. She re-positioned her body so that her legs were on either side of Kiyoko's head and she was turned around with her own face hovering inches above the womans crotch. She figured Kiyoko would know what to do here as she lowered her lips to the womans Clitoris and began to delicately suckle on it. Meanwhile, the fingers of one hand would slowly find themselves slipping back inside Kiyoko; while the others slowly started to tease her asshole.* - Sat Nov 14 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) drank it all in, enjoying the sweet tangy taste that was unique to Kiyoko alone. At the same time, she would feel Kiyoko's soft liftle tongue grazing across her lips; her entire body shuddering just from the touch. Then as Kiyoko reached her climax, Lera moved her crotch just a little lower inviting Kiyoko to taste the inside too...* - Sat Nov 14 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gushed out right into Kiyoko's mouth and possibly all over her face as well, her body entire body shook from the orgasm; having to dig her fingers deep into the beds matress just to keep herself still. Even as she slumped to the side and struggled to right herself so she was face to face with Kiyoko, she was still trembling from the climax.* - Sat Nov 14 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) maneuvered her body so she could wrap her arms around Kiyoko and lay peacefully while the pair recovered.* - Sat Nov 14 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are you...okay..? - Sat Nov 14 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Perfect. - Sat Nov 14 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) inched a little closer so their bodies were pressed up against one another.* - Sat Nov 14 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: My sentaments exactly... - Sat Nov 14 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) silently stroked her face, seeing the exhaustion plain on her face.

"Sleep love..."* - Sat Nov 14 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... - Sat Nov 14 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sang softly under her breath while Kiyoko drifted off.* - Sat Nov 14 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gently laid a kiss on the sleep girls forehead and trailed out of the room.* - Sat Nov 14 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Yawn* - Sat Nov 14 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A bit of training is in order I think....Anyone fancy a spar? - Sat Nov 14 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmm... I could spar I guess. - Sat Nov 14 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: c-can i w-watch? - Sat Nov 14 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Mhmhm.....was hoping for a challenge... - Sat Nov 14 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Sat Nov 14 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I don't mind. - Sat Nov 14 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Bitch, I'm sorry my chars didn't get to live as long as yours -omit- - Sat Nov 14 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took hold of samehada's hilt, swining it down and pointing the oversized blade at Chikyu.

"You start."* - Sat Nov 14 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) cracked her neck from side to side and let Samehada fall into the sand; she expected there would be no need to use it here. Instead she began a slow walk towards Chikyu whilst channeling Doton chakra throughout her skin. It made her movements slower than her usual state, but it left more than enough speed to fight Chikyu.

As Chikyu's blade made its powerful decent towards her head, she stepped to the side and put her full body into a punch directly at the blade in Chikyu's hand. It was possible the blade would have been knocked out of her hands, but the intention was to just knock it sideways.* - Sat Nov 14 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) knew for a fact that she was not so great with bog-standard Taijutsu, but on account of Chikyu being a large sword wielder; she probably sucked just as a bad. What she didn't like however was Chikyu using exactly the same move she just been about to use herself; it was sort of ironic really. Rather than make any attempt to dodge, she just harderned her defense on her right side and essentially 'tanked' the kicks.

Her foot however was successfuly hooked at the end of the barrage; pulling it upwards. Instead of letting herself fall though, she used the remainder of her balance to slam a fist right into Chikyu's breast plate. If successful, she hopefully be thrown back a few feet with a nasty dent in the metal.* - Sat Nov 14 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had her arm pushed away before it could hit Chikyu, a little smile lit up Lera's face as she saw Chikyu's improvement; the girl had definitely gotten better. The foot that had been hooked out slammed back onto the ground, giving Chikyu a moment to counter while Lera regained her balance.* - Sat Nov 14 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) clicked her fingers off to one side, Samehada who had been laying in the sand barely a foot away literally leaped upwards and into her waiting hand. She didn't have much time to react, so she slammed Samehada point downwards just as Chikyu's blade was coming up from below. She intended to arrest Chikyu's blow before it could flip her up and essentially halt her in her step.

"You've gotten better.."* - Sat Nov 14 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: hmm... - Sat Nov 14 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lifted Samehada ever so slightly to allow Chikyu to pull her blade out. When she reversed the strike and sent it towards her side, Lera would switch Samehada to a single hand before attempting to catch the blade on her hardened wrist. At the same time, she would systematically pull samehada back with her other arm and jab it towards the girls chest. Should the blade make contact, she would find a good portion of her chakra (10% of your current) leeched away.* - Sat Nov 14 18:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised Samehada to catch the kick on the weapon, giving it another quick shot of Chikyu's chakra. With the attack blocked, she pulled the blade to the side and lashed out to grab Chikyu's leg. If successful, she'd use her Domu Enhanced strength to throw the girl a few feet away.* - Sat Nov 14 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You should be feeling the drain right about now... - Sat Nov 14 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rested the blade on her shoulder, unwilling to go into the finer details of how Samehada worked.

"Something like that."* - Sat Nov 14 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Good fight, you've gotten much better. Work on getting through my skin and you might just get there. - Sat Nov 14 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its...hhuuu... pretty...tough. - Sat Nov 14 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *nod* - Sat Nov 14 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It does the job. - Sat Nov 14 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Huh...We got quite the audience. - Sat Nov 14 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) bowed to the watching audience and started to walk towards the wall, once she got closer she started floating up and over it.* - Sat Nov 14 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Guess it wasn't much of a show. - Sat Nov 14 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: ^ - Sat Nov 14 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Eighth member has arrived people. We can begin the Orgy. - Sat Nov 14 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Uh, what? - Sat Nov 14 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: -omit x2- - Sat Nov 14 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned her gaze to Akira, wrinkling her nose a bit at the smell of ciggarettes.

"Uh huh."* - Sat Nov 14 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Doton huh...Hrmmm...Well I guess? - Sat Nov 14 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: With the condition that you don't smoke while I'm teaching you. - Sat Nov 14 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: First Marrisa makes me quit drinking... - Sat Nov 14 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right right... - Sat Nov 14 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) reached out to take the ciggaretter from him, if allowed she'd abruptly incinerate it between her fingers and then gesture for him to follow her.* - Sat Nov 14 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) clapped her hands together with a few handseals and gestured to a small spot on the ground. A Flat rock would jut upwards, a simple variation of her Mud wall technique.

"Take a seat."

While he sat down she would cross her legs and begin floating in mid-air, a small cup of tea materialising in her hands. Lera Guru mode activated.* - Sat Nov 14 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because its horrible for your health and will cut your life short. - Sat Nov 14 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right...Marrisa said the same thing about drinking... - Sat Nov 14 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And she was right. - Sat Nov 14 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. What do you know of Doton so far? - Sat Nov 14 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If anything. - Sat Nov 14 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm pretty adept in it. - Sat Nov 14 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Show me. - Sat Nov 14 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's the only element I can use so I focus a lot on it. - Sat Nov 14 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh well...I only know one jutsu. - Sat Nov 14 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sat Nov 14 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And it's a little hard to use with sand. - Sat Nov 14 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its name? - Sat Nov 14 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mud silhouette. - Sat Nov 14 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sat Nov 14 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You don't have the ability to create it from nothing yet? - Sat Nov 14 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, Probably. - Sat Nov 14 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned her head to the side and spat out a minute amount of mud, letting it settle in a puddle on the floor.

"If you think about it. Wind creates something from nothing, as does lightning, fire and even Water. Earth is no different."* - Sat Nov 14 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right...well I've never had a teacher for any of this so. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats a little hard to understand at times. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In your own words, tell me what Earth is. At its essence. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well, it can be a few things from the mud to the rock to the sand. - Sat Nov 14 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A generic interpretation and correct yes. - Sat Nov 14 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But what is it to you. What do you feel when you use Earth? - Sat Nov 14 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Slow, Rigid...compact. - Sat Nov 14 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Angry...upset...scared... - Sat Nov 14 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...but it can also be free - Sat Nov 14 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Doton is Solidarity, but it is also flowing. - Sat Nov 14 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess, I've only really used mud silhouette in a few combat situations though. - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I guess I haven't really grasped that yet. - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When it comes right down to it. Doton is the ability to manipulate entities tied to the earth. If you take it as an abstract, then you can even manipulate gravity. - Sat Nov 14 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That manipulation works both ways... - Sat Nov 14 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her hand to the village wall and pressed her fingers against it. A few second later, the wall began to shake and a few seconds after that it began to tremor with a great rumbling noise. She removed her finger soon after, before any of it collapsed on its own weight.* - Sat Nov 14 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So as you see. Doton is one of the freeist elements. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Above it has diversity and...in my opinion, can do much more than any other element. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, I like it more than the others. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think it's more diverse. - Sat Nov 14 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. We'll start with a common technique. Common but useful. - Sat Nov 14 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) set her tea on the ground and landed lightly on her feet. A few moments later she started to sink and was hidden nicely underground. Another few moments after, she popped up next to Akira and spoke again.

"Hiding like a mole. It gives you the ability to soften the ground beneath your feet...allowing you to sink and essentially swim underground. As a nice little side effect, you'll also gain the ability to feel magnetic pulses and will thus know everything thats happening above you."* - Sat Nov 14 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm, Alright. - Sat Nov 14 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Sat Nov 14 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So thats a defensive jutsu and you already know a support jutsu. - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: An offensive jutsu then. - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed her few handseals, making sure Akira could see each one in turn. When done, she slammed them on the ground and formed four spears of earth underground. These spears would shoot up at an invsible target a short distance away.

"A useful jutsu, difficult to dodge and powerful enough to do some damage. The key is to be able to manipulate your chakra through the earth and get the aiming right. In this sort of enviroment, you have to crush the existing sand together in order to form the spears."* - Sat Nov 14 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: p -fun-  - Sat Nov 14 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 14 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I like that technique, seems quite versatile for combat. - Sat Nov 14 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sat Nov 14 20:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And then come back to me - Sat Nov 14 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll teach you something with a bit more...oomph - Sat Nov 14 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thank you Lera. - Sat Nov 14 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're te - Sat Nov 14 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're the first one to teach me anything practical in a long while. - Sat Nov 14 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thanks. - Sat Nov 14 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're welcome. - Sat Nov 14 20:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ALright - Sat Nov 14 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stalks and watches.* - Sat Nov 14 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: ...I'm assuming Jiki is holding back..Badly.. - Sun Nov 15 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) darted her eyes around, watching the shuriken circle her waiting to strike. While she could deflect them easily with Samehada, she couldn't hit all of them while they were spread out so widely. So she quickly slapped her hands together in a single seal and directed the chakra at her feet. The Dome of earth would form around her body, it didn't give her much room to move with how small it was; but it hopefully protected her from the shuriken. She knew better than to think it would protect her for long though. Knowing that Hassan would probably come pounding it down any moment;  she began preparing her escape.* - Sun Nov 15 08:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt her dome crack and rupture from the pressure of Hassans wind, before it was blown away completely. Lera was pushed backwards quite a distance facing off against the wall of wind moving ever closer, it didn't help that her vision was obscured from all the sand. However, this would make an excellent test for Samehada. Rather than fleeing backwards like one might except, she stepped forewards towards the wall; pulling samehada out and raising it above her head.

She brought the blade down, striking against the wall and running the weapon through it like a hot knife through butter. As Samehada sucked up the chakra, she expected a nice gap would open; just long enough for her to jump through. She was aware there was still danger however, so she formed a quick handseal around Samehada's hilt and created four clones to stand and defend her.* - Sun Nov 15 09:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: If I can just get one hand on him... - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) and three of her clones quickly dropped into the ground, she didn't know what Hassan was thinking using such a large technique where so many people were around. Even after slipping underground, Lera had not escaped the jutsu completely; the slight redness to her skin and the singed hairs were a testament to that. Samehada wriggled with displeasure, it despised the flames.

Her fourth clone stayed behind to get roasted, but before it was destroyed it formed a number of handseals and directed its chakra towards its sternum. Using every ounce it had, the clone would spew out a huge wall of water; hoping to dampen if not put out Hassans flames entirely. It was destroyed moments after.* - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt him split off with clones of his own, she was no sensor; even if she could sense his chakra she wouldn't know which was which anyway. So her two clones each picked a target and she picked her own. It was three for three, so she was bound to get it right with one of them. It was likely she didn't do what Hassan expected however, she didn't care about dragging him underground.

Lera and her clones would each pop up behind their respective targets, aiming to place one little touch on the back of each Hassan. A light tap was all she needed. If successful, she would exponentially increase the weight of all three Hassan's hoping to stop all their movements and drive them to their knees.* - Sun Nov 15 09:25:20 2015
