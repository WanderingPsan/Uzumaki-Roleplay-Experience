<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm.... - Mon Oct 12 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Why not fire? - Mon Oct 12 13:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Mon Oct 12 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right...what jutsu do you already know? - Mon Oct 12 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Haha....None. - Mon Oct 12 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. Then we start with the most simple. - Mon Oct 12 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed her handseal and took in a deep breath, she exhaled through a funneled fist; igniting the breath as it left her fingers. Trailing from her mouth was a steady stream of fire, shooting straight for several metres before arcing into the water.

"The basic Katon technique, Flamethrower. You have to pass the chakra through your lungs, but be careful; ignite your breath too early and you'll choke yourself on flames. Imagine your breath catching fire as it leaves your fingers and the flames will do the rest."* - Mon Oct 12 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Not bad - Mon Oct 12 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Next. If you're still good to go. - Mon Oct 12 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I definately am! - Mon Oct 12 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned away from the water, not able to show this on water due to the jutsu's nature. She formed her handseals again and performed similar actions as she did with Flamethrower, only this time she breathed through a slight gap between her teeth and tongue. The flames that spewed out took on an almost liquid like consistency, dropping through the ground and racing across it to form a circle.

"Fire run, very good for closing someone in. Even better if you can use it with a Fuuton type jutsu. The way I imagine it is as a liquid flame, though you may work differently. Go ahead."* - Mon Oct 12 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright....and the next. - Mon Oct 12 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned back to the water again, the jutsu this time was bigger and more powerful than the previous two; dangerous if he couldn't control it. She took it one step at a time, forming all five handseals and bring both hands to her mouth. When she breathed out, a stream of fire came out which soon expanded massively into a huge ball of flame.

"Fireball jutsu, treat it like flamethrower but much bigger."* - Mon Oct 12 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats about right yes. - Mon Oct 12 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Seems he has a lot of chakra like I do. - Mon Oct 12 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm. - Mon Oct 12 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One more. - Mon Oct 12 13:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) suddenly pulled back her hands, bright red sparks flashing on her palms. She moved as if she were tossing objects and the sparks burst into orange balls of flame that flew off over the water. On impact with the water they seemed to explode, throwing the water upwards into the air.

"Exploding flame shot. Imagine the flames as bright red sparks on your hands and...throw."* - Mon Oct 12 13:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Has -so much-  - Mon Oct 12 14:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went to kiss her again, clinging to the one thing that made her feel alive again.* - Tue Oct 13 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped out of the house leaving June reading one of her many books, she'd decided to leave Jenna with her as well; more to keep her company then anything else, the little wolf had matured considerably in the time they'd been together. She'd seemed happy to stay with June and June hadn't been able to help herself with cuddling up to the wolf. She was still a child after all.

One her way out the house Lera found herself feeling...better, she was still broken inside; missing that all important part that made her feel happy. Yet with someone to look after, she felt needed again; someone depended on her and she wouldn't let them down. She'd found June to have a brilliant mind, such a little gem living in obscurity; made her wonder if there was anyone else like her, just waiting to be polished.

It was only now that the new idea really occured to her. She'd always found herself to enjoy teaching people, there was just something about passing on knowledge that felt good. So what if she made a career out of it? It was so simple really, now she intended to ask Kirie if she could be in charge of the academy when it finally re-opened. There was more than one way to help Kirigakure, teaching the next generation of Shinobi was one of those ways.

The village was still in ruins but she could see the signs of it being rebuilt, like always life picked itself up and carried on. In a few months, Life in Kirigakure would likely be back to normal. It would take time though, to build Kirigakures military strength back to what it used to be. Before that happened, Kirigakure had to be be built back up and trade had to be started once more. Financially, the village was going to be poor for sometime; Lera would let Kirie deal with those issues.

When she really thought about it, the job of being a kage was a lonely one. She hoped Kirie was getting out their and helping in the village personally, that would show that she was more then willing to get her hands dirty. In the end, kage or not; she was still a shinboi, with the duty to help her village in any way she could. With a slight yawn, she passed through the remainder of the village and found somewhere isolated enough for her to train in peace.

Most of her techniques were already quite powerful, when she mixed them with them together in combinations it only served to increase that power. In return, her defense suffered; while she did have techniques made for escaping and some for defense it wasn't enough for her. She'd recently learned the Mud wall technique, constructing large walls of mud was a good way of blocking any and all techniques that came towards her. Even better, it could be used without a source of earth.

However, she was a novice at best with the technique; her skill made it easy for it to be broken down. So thats what she intended to do today, practice the mud wall technique until her chakra ran dry. The technique was quite simple in itself, no more complicated than the Dragon bomb; if not less so. The name was literal, she would literally spit out a torrent of mud and construct a hardened wall of earth out of it. At the very least it would be extremely good in stopping Suiton techniques and possibly Katon as well.

She did just that, forming a couple of handseals and taking in a deep breath. She hated this next part, though the mud left no residue in her mouth the taste of dirt always persisted for a while. The mud came from her mouth in a stream, impacting the floor and building upwards almost immediately. It took a few moments but a wall was constructed in front of her, though too slow for it to be really useful in combat. Thats what she lacked the most, speed; by the time the wall was up she probably would get hit.

Thats what she needed to work on, so she deconstructed her wall and attempted the jutsu again. She found it quite useful how she could construct and destroy the wall at will, useful if the situation called for it. While she practiced, her mind as always slipped back to Seisuke; something she appreciated, she wanted to remember him forever. If she thought about it, then in reality she should've killed Susumu after he released her; his ability was dangerous and he willfully used it.

Nobody deserved to have happiness and love forced on them, she was just exceptionally glad that she hadn't done anything with him while she was under his 'spell'. If she had, then he would definitely be dead right now. It shocked Lera how casually she was able to think about killing someone, she'd seen so much death that it had almost become normality. She wanted to build a world where children her age didn't have to feel like this, nobody deserved to live like that.

At least, she had been able to get a warning off to Hassan; she'd promised not to reveal his secret, but nothing had been said about telling someone to be careful. By this point her Mud wall technique was already getting significantly better, as always she was a fast learner. After ther thirtieth time of performing the jutsu, even her chakra reserves were starting to get low; so she forced her tired body back home to June.* - Tue Oct 13 13:03:21 2015

In truth she felt guilty right now, she couldn't help but feel that she was doing the wrong thing with Violet. She still loved Seisuke and probably would until she died. So could she still love someone else at the same time?

It was a difficult position to be in, her feelings for Violet were confused; on the one hand, the girl was her best and closest friend and on the other she was quickly becoming far more. The hole where Seisuke was could never be filled, but she was quickly realising that there was far more room in her heart than she'd originally known. Violets place in that was growing by the day and whenever she saw the girl, she wanted nothing more than to hold her and never let go.

Then there was June, Lera had no idea what it was like to be a parent; but she figured that maybe this was it. She was finding herself to be extremely protective of the girl, just the thought of someone trying to hurt her made a predetermined rage bubble up from her abdomen. Looking down at the girl, she could see that she was getting much much better; her bones no longer stuck out against her skin so much and the colour had been returned to her cheeks. To see her healthy made Lera feel good about herself.

Eventually, June dragged her gaze from her book to stare up at Lera "What? I can feel you staring at me, whats up?" Lera shook her head and gave her a little squeeze at the shoulders "Nothing, I'm just glad to see you looking healthy again." June kept her gaye fixed on Lera for a long time, even if she was healthy in body her heart had yet to heal. That would take much longer it seemed "You seem different Lera, less...sad somehow. Who did you meet?"

Lera couldn't help but blink in surprise, the little girls powers of observations were greater than most adults "Nothing escapes you does it?" June continued staring at her, waiting for her to continue; she was obviously not going to be satisfied with that "Jeez, nosy one aren't you. I met with my oldest and first friend and I guess I'm starting to realise that my heart is bigger than I thought. I guess I didn't think I would be capable of loving anymore."

June watched her for a bit longer before nodding to herself "I know you lost someone really important, but I don't think they would want you to give up on loving someone right? And what do you mean by your heart is bigger than you thought, I don't get that part" Lera gave the girl a tentative smile and ruffled her hair up, she looked thoroughly unimpressed by the gesture "It means that I didn't know I could love more than one person.It means that I love you June"

June stared at her with widened eyes and an open mouth, before a little sob escaped her lips followed by tears. She practically sank into Lera then, burying her face against Lera's chest and continuing to cry like that. Lera was shocked, it was the first time June had showed any sign of being upset. It was the first time the girl had a shed tears in her presence. She didn't know what had caused it, so she just held her tightly; gently stroking her hair.

They stayed like that for a while before June finally started to speak again, but all she said was "Thank you...thank you" over and over again. The girl had seen far too much for her age, lost so many loved ones that the parts that made her feel happy and warm had simply broken. They weren't gone though, instead they were just waiting to be re-ignited by someone willing to show her some love. Lera thought she could learn a little something from this girl, maybe she really should pursue a relationship with Violet. Seisuke wouldn't want her to stay sad and broken all her life.

Finally feeling a little relieved from her pain, she settled back into the sofa and cuddled June; letting her take all the comfort she could "No June...thank you. I'm glad I found you. You may have just helped me move on a little bit" June had largely stopped crying now, besides the ocasional sniffle "I...I'm sorry...I just, You'll..never leave me right? I want you to be my mama forever." Lera nodded her head without thought, like father like daughter; lera found herself adopting a little one of her own "Forever, no escaping from me now!"

The little girl laughed with a few hiccuped sobs and made herself more comfortable against Lera, where she started to fall asleep "Thank you..." the little girl was soon out like a light and Lera wasn't too far behind. She was finding herself feeling happier than she'd felt for a while; she would never recover from Seisuke's death, nor would she forget him. But she would still move forwards.

A few hours later, Lera finally opened up her eyes; looking around the room through a blur. She hadn't meant to sleep really, but all the sudden realisations had made her feel so very tired. For the first time in a while, the sleep had actually left her feeling refreshed and she was ready to take the day head on. June was still happily snuggled in her arms, fast asleep and breathing lightly; even she was looking happier just in her sleep, Lera felt that if she managed to truly make that girl happy; then she would have done something worth while with her life.

Deciding that the girl might be hungry when she woke up, so she carefully removed herself from Junes grip and left her wrapped up in a warm blanket. She watched the girl fondly as she left for the resteraunt. The village was still in ruins but things were starting to get back to normal, businesses were starting to run again and people were going about their daily lives. Once she had enough food for a feast, she wandered back towards the house; having the bags full of food stay suspended and weightless around her. She realised something was wrong the moment she stepped through the door.

June was no longer on the sofa and Lera had barely been gone a few minutes. In place of June was a white piece of paper, pinned to the sofa by a knife. Lera let the food drop, rushing to the sofa with a feeling of panic setting in. That little girl had wormed her way into Lera's heart, she wasn't about to lose her now. She read through the note several times, disbelieving at first but that was quickly replaced by a black bottomless anger. It was from her mother, of all people. She and her 'husband' had sent more mercenaries, only they weren't targeting Lera; they'd been targeting June.

The note went on to explain that should Lera not return to her proper place at her 'fathers' side, then June would take her place instead. The black anger boiled away in her stomach, filling her with the desire to gut that useless bastard and throw his entrails to the wind. Never before had Lera felt so angry at anything, not only were they intruding on her life -again-. They were also threatening the new addition to her family and whether it was a mothers instinct to protect or her blind anger that drove her; that man and her mother would pay.

She scrunched the note up and threw it to the ground, rushing out of the house. It wouldn't take her long to get there, an hour at most; provided she could get over the ocean without incident. Normally, Lera would get herself a boat; but this time she was just going to run right across the water. Most people would not be able to do this, they'd be out of chakra by the end of it; but for Lera and her huge reserves of chakra, it was definitely possible.

The anger never abated while she ran, in fact it only seemed to grow until she was practically seeing red. She was vaguely aware of fire, bursting out of her skin at random intervals; her body was reacting to her anger, attempting to activate the Fire shroud and burn through everything in her path. She was almost tempted to let it out, let her fury show as she burst through those gates; let her 'father' know exactly what it was he fucked with.

Soon, she'd made it over the water and was running towards the estate owned by her 'father'; the guards, it seemed, had been expecting her. There were five guards in total, all brandishing standing before the door. The guards weren't like the last time, it was easy to tell these ones were trained and kept themselves fit; her father at least had learned from the last time. Once she'd taken a good look at the guards, she strolled forward as casual as can be and glared at each one of them in turn "Two choice, Tell me where she is now and run or you get the living shit beaten out of you when I force my way through. Choose, now."

The guards exchanged glances, but there was no indication of fear or hesitation. They looked perfectly confident, if a little perplexed as to why their contractor sent five of them for one girl. After a few moments one of the guards stepped forwards, obviously one of the less intelligent ones by the look of disdain in his eyes "Your father told us to warn you, surrender now and the girl won't be hurt." Lera's eyes grew cold and she clapped her hands together, breating in deep "Wrong answer" she released her breath in an explosive gust of wind, slamming all five guards against the door.

Before any of them could recover, she rushed forwards and systematically knocked each and every one of them out. It didn't matter if she was bad at Taijutsu, they were nothing compared to shinobi standards. When there was only one conciouss one left she kicked his weapon away and picked him up by the collar "I suggest you tell me where she is now, if so much as a hair on her head has been harmed...I'll burn down this house and throw you in the damn fire!" the last few words she practically spat at the trembling man, who'd now realised what her father had neglected to tell them. They hadn't know they'd be up against a highly trained shinobi.

When he spoke, it was in stutters and high pitched squeaks; he was truly terrified of her "D-Don't hurt me! please! he just hired us to get you, we don't know where she is! Really!" Lera usually prided herself on being able to tell when someone was lieing and this guy seemed pretty truthful. So she tossed him to one side and moved towards the barred door, it was obviously barred from the inside and there were likely guards waiting for her. She relished the chance to beat the living hell out of them "If I find out you're lying, I'll find you and even your mother won't be able to recognise you when I'm done.

Without any further waits, she slammed her fingers through the door; cutting through wood and steel like butter. With the bar severed, she was able to push the door open easily and just as she expected there was a hole platoon of guards waiting for her. There seemed to be twenty in all, so if she made five clones that would be four each. If the group of guards was scared of her, they made no show of it. She formed the one handseal needed for clone and created five of them, each one moving forwards with Doton slowly hardening their skin. By the end of this, she would probably be running dry on chakra; but to save June she didn't care.

The guards didn't prove to be so easy as she imagined, since they were well trained; they were able to attack with teamwokrk and solidarity, Lera figured she could probably kill them all with a single jutsu; she didn't really want to kill people who were hired by her father. By the end of it, all twenty of the guards lay in heaps; either groaning from broken bones or unconciouss. After this, Lera made her way up towards the house and to her mother and 'father' waiting within.

She wasn't bothered by any more guards, she'd most likely taken them all down at the gates. Though, it would be odd if there was no more opposition; specifically whoever had been able to take June without her noticing. She confirmed her theory the moment she stepped into the 'throne' room, as always she viewed her 'fathers' self importance with disgust. At the end of the room, her father was stood; June's shoulder firmly grasped under his hand. At his side stood her mother, who now looked at Lera with cold hatred; whatever had made the woman her mother, was long since gone.

Thats when she noticed the other presence in the room, a man stood closer to the center of the room and entirely clad in black. He held a grim and slightly amused smile on his face. The first one to speak was June, who shouted with a teary voice towards Lera "Mama! Its a trap! They want you!" she was quickly silence via a slap from her 'father'. This brought Lera's rage back to the forefront, her eyes grew ever colder and she started to walk towards her 'father'

Her fathers only reaction was to laugh at her and pull out a knife, holding it to Junes throat. Her mother still remained silent, staring at Lera with that same hatred. Lera stopped, glaring quietly at her father and completely ignoring the black clad man who was now stepping towards her "Lera lera....calm down and think carefully, you don't want the girl to be hurt do you? Come now, all your father wants is for you to marry me; not so bad is it? If I remember correctly, you are a genin right? I used to be a chuunin you know, that puts me higher up on the food chain no?"

Lera was barely registering the mans words, though when he mentioned marriage; she knew he had to die here as well. By now, he was stood barely a metre from her; looking at her with that cruel gleam in his eyes. He started as if to speak again, confident that whatever Lera had he could throw back ten fold...he was wrong. Lera simply said the words "Shut up" and swung her hand to the side, just grazing his throat with her finger tips. At first, she just stood motionless; staring at Lera wordlessly, so Lera walked right past him and carried on to her father. She didn't see the spray of blood suddenly erupting from the mans throat, but she heard him fall.

Her fathers face was both a mask of fury and fear, while her mother just looked downright scared; she knew the idea of 'family' wasn't going to save her this time. In response to Lera moving forwards, he pressed his knife deeper against Junes throat yelling towards Lera "Don't come any closer! I'll slit her throat! I'll do it!" he tried to sound confident, but she could hear the fear in his voice "You're not going to live this time, I'm going to rend you to pieces and if you draw that girls blood...I'll make your death slow and painful"

He saw the resolution in her eyes and subsequently shat himself, he'd never felt fear like this before; he knew now that he'd well and truly fucked with the wrong person. Her Mother was now rushing to escape, she took a side entrance out of the Buildind; Lera let her go, if only because of the feelings they used to share many many years ago. Her father was going to have no such luck, he still held June in a death grip; Lera was going to have to get her out without hurting her. Fortunately it was simple.

She formed a series of handseals, faster than her father could react; by the time he realised what was happening, it was far too late. Staring him into the eyes, it was easy to activate the jutsu. A tree sprung from the floor beneath him, enveloping his body and constricting his arms. June practically flew forwards out of his grasp rushing to get behind Lera. Lera knew she could kill him without pain, but she wanted him to suffer; to be punished for everything he'd done. It was easy, too easy to just toss a ball of flame at his feet and watch him burn.

However, she didn't want to subject June to any more of this; so she grabbed the girls hand and rushed out of the now burning building, finally ridding herself of her old life. June was mostly silent when Lera picked her up and walked away with her, the only time she showed any reaction was when she took off and started to fly over the ocean. Finally after a good ten minutes of flying, the girl spoke "I...knew you would come get me, thankyou...mama" that word tacked onto the end of the sentence sent waves of warmth throughout Lera's body. Above all, she was incredibly relieved to see June unhurt.

They arrived back home quite quickly, where Lera slumped onto the sofa. The food she'd bought was still here, albeit cold; so they both ate in companionable silence. Soon though, the exhaustion was getting the better of her; she'd used up so much of her chakra, it was a shock she could still stand. June noticed this, and forced her to lay down; she was flat out asleep just a few moments later.* - Tue Oct 13 13:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped forwards and formed her handseals (I dunno how many it is). When she slammed her palms to the ground, she forced her chakra through the earth and manipulated the rock to shoot upwards in four spears.

"This one is pretty good for offense, especially if your opponent doesn't know whats coming. Channel your chakra into the earth and manipulate it into the spears. Give it a go."* - Wed Oct 14 16:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a good distance away from Violet so it wouldn't get her and surged the chakra throughout her body. For a brief moment, Raiton ran off her body; shocking a small area directly around her.

"This ones good for a quick defense around yourself, it will generally momentarily paralyze opponents. All you have to do for this one is surge Raiton chakra out of your body."* - Wed Oct 14 16:32:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. We'll start with that then. - Wed Oct 14 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed one handseal and temporarily halted the flow of her own chakra, before suddenly flooding her system; the outward appearences changed little, but if she'd been in a genjutsu it would have likely been broken.

"Once you form the handseal, just stop you chakra flow and then suddenly flood you system. I'll put you in a genjutsu so you can test it."

She stared directly into Violets eyes, which wasn't all that hard really; it was actually quite pleasent. She formed a few more handseals and put Violet underneath the genjutsu. A multitude of clones would rise from the ground and just stand watching violet.

"Try to break the genjutsu."* - Wed Oct 14 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thankyou. - Wed Oct 14 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't say anything to that, her eyes said everything anyway. Violet was one of the only people who made her feel again and she knew Seisuke would understand. Gently as if she were caressing the most valuable treasure, she ran a hand down Violets face and then leaned in to kiss her.* - Wed Oct 14 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) kissed the girl deeply, pulling her close into a tight embrace. There was more to it than just a kiss, she put every single one of her needs into it; letting out a little moan while she was at it.* - Wed Oct 14 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) is fist banging violet.* - Wed Oct 14 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had to pull herself away from the kiss in the end, as soon as Violet started using her tongue she would've pushed her down to the ground and tore into her clothes. So she had to stop herself, if only to save themselves from doing anything in public.  Once she pulled away, she just resorted to holding onto the girl as tightly as she could; though her entire body was trembling.* - Wed Oct 14 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah....yeah I'm fine. Better than fine actually...just had to...stop myself. - Wed Oct 14 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Stop you- Oh... <blushes> I get it... - Wed Oct 14 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah.... - Wed Oct 14 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not something we should do in public right? - Wed Oct 14 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Thats true enough even though I wouldnt mind... then again as long as its alone time I dont really care where its done im a little frisky like that. - Wed Oct 14 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at Violet in surprise, she definitely hadn't expected that to come out her mouth.

"I'll keep that in mind."* - Wed Oct 14 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm definitely intrigued....Do you want to stay at my house tonight? - Wed Oct 14 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Sure I dont mind... Is it destoryed? - Wed Oct 14 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My house is on the very outskirts, it wasn't very damaged. - Wed Oct 14 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Ok, well just lead the way when your ready... I do get tired of sleeping durinf my work - Wed Oct 14 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Wed Oct 14 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) decided to pick the girl up, reducing both their weights until they were lighter even than a feather. She hoped Violet wasn't afraid of heights, because they soon took off into the sky. Flying towards her house.* - Wed Oct 14 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) soon landed by her house, the house was barely inside the village bounds; in one of the smaller estates full of the larger homes. There were some signs of damage and some hastily made repairs, but for the most part it was intact and very much liveable. The inside was full to the brim with books, scrolls and various other reading and writing implements. Lera had obviously spent a lot of time and care clearing the palce up as it was extremely neat and tidy on the inside.

"This is my house....what do you think?"* - Wed Oct 14 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked hard at Violet for a few moments, trying to take her in before she just went ahead and did whatever she felt like. It didn't take long for her to give in, she just dropped her clothes and started to walk towards Violet. Apart from the red tattoo's on her arms and back, there was also a black complicated seal on her hip.* - Wed Oct 14 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned into Vioilets body, gently nipping at her neck; she flinched a little when she pressed against the seal, but she didn't intend to hold any secrets from Violet.

"Its the only thing I have left of Seisuke. His weapon."* - Wed Oct 14 19:23:31 2015
