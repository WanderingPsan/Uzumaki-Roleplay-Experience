<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: Then we'd only be protecting the regular army whilst his regular army attacks ours. - Sat Sep 19 18:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: It'll be a stalemate. - Sat Sep 19 18:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Elemental clones are limited to the element they're made from, right? - Sun Sep 20 02:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: But.. I kinda need to learn some Fuuton-based jutsus... so I'll teach you the jutsu I have for you now.. then you teach me the Fuuton.. sound like fair game? - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, fair enough. - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Let's go to the waterfall, for this. - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright... - Sun Sep 20 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Have you heard of the Shadow Clone Jutsu? - Sun Sep 20 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't no. - Sun Sep 20 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright... - Sun Sep 20 03:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) examined the seal, memorising it and then copying it with her own hands.

"Okay."* - Sun Sep 20 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Basically it's an elemental shadow clone technique, minus the elemental limitation. - Sun Sep 20 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So with this clone-based technique you can use all four of your elements with the clones. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That would....be useful. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm..This changes a lot of things... - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hah...wouldn't Hassan be surprised... - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm sure it does.. but, form the handsign, and invest a fraction of your chakra into a clone. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like this. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: They fool sensors too, I believe. - Sun Sep 20 03:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) poked one of the clones, a little impressed with it and a smile on her face; this technique just got better and better.

"Interesting and extremely handy. This definitely changes my combat style completely"

With a little nod to herself, she took a few steps backwards and formed the same handseal as shown to her. She imagines, in her minds eye, a split from her chakra; forming it into a clone that would stand beside her. Unfortunately that wasn't to be the case, she was far too used to adding an element to clone for stability. It was difficult to imagine making a clone without that element to keep it from simply falling apart. Yet, she had seen it with her own eyes; so it was most definitely possible.

With another look around at Setsuna's clones, she took note of how real they looked; it wasn't like some chakra filled puppet, the genuinely looked like real copies of Setsuna. So she kept that little tidbit in mind when giving the jutsu another go. This time, when she formed the seal and split her chakra off. She imagined there being a hard shell of skin to contain the chakra, along with working organs and an intricate system within. She had always been a clever girl, so it wasn't too hard to think of things like this.

She was happy to see that a perfect copy of herself formed beside her, perfect down to the tiniest detail. She gave it a quick poke on the shoulder, just to make sure it was real; thankfully it seemed to be.

"Hows that?"* - Sun Sep 20 03:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Perfect. - Sun Sep 20 03:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: mhmmm...thank you, this is going to help me a lot. - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When do you want to learn these Fuuton jutsu? - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: When you aren't busy, I guess. - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll have to ask hassan if I can teach her one of the forbidden ones... - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 20 03:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How does the 'scouting' part work. These can travel far from us? Unlike the Elemental ones. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And how do you know what they've seen? - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Once they disperse you gain all the knowledge they obtained. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So it's handy for training, too. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, now I understand how you've been mastering your techniques so quickly. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like if you don't feel like training, you can make two of them and let them fight eachother for say... hand to hand experience. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Naaaah, I recently learned this, honestly. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Fair enough. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Still, this is just getting better and better. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its going to help a lot. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It doesn't do much for me, but it means I don't worry about needing a sparring partner often. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see, hopefully my chakra pools will help me there. - Sun Sep 20 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: They should. - Sun Sep 20 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Has Hassan taught you how to infuse weapons with Fuuton? - Sun Sep 20 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No he hasn't. - Sun Sep 20 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I should ask him... - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though, I can control shuriken with fuuton. - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah, you used that on me before. - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) tossed a few shurken upwards and then formed some handseals, her shuriken were surrounded by wind; causing them to spin and float around Lera.* - Sun Sep 20 03:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its useful, though I don't really use it much. - Sun Sep 20 03:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Why not? - Sun Sep 20 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Honestly...its because I know so many jutsu...its difficult to decide which is the best for a situation. - Sun Sep 20 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And shuriken are very easy to knockdown. - Sun Sep 20 03:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For example. - Sun Sep 20 03:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned sideways and swimg her fingers like a blade to a nearby rock. Her fingers sunk through the stone as if it were made from butter, causing a crack to resound throughout the area.

"lethal like that."* - Sun Sep 20 03:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I also learned to combine this with fire...the rock thats in pieces over there is the result of that. - Sun Sep 20 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But yeah, I need permission from Hassan to teach this one and one other. He actually ordered me not too. - Sun Sep 20 03:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You know the answer to that question. - Sun Sep 20 04:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Sorry Setsuna. - Sun Sep 20 04:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's fine. - Sun Sep 20 04:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Sorry to stack in the questions Hassan, but mind showing me that shuriken trick you have. You know the one where you make the other shuriken follow behind it? - Sun Sep 20 04:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uh... Hassan, are you holding any of those Fuuton lessons again, anytime soon? - Sun Sep 20 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you have time, I can teach you my other ones. The ones I'm able to teach. - Sun Sep 20 04:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets go then. - Sun Sep 20 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright.. just demonstrate them one by one. - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with the easiest and work our way up. - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed the one handseal needed for the Godly Wind technique, making sure Setuna could see. Then she pulled back her hand and thrust it forward, releasing a stream of wind that lasted for several seconds.

"This one is Godly wind from the mountains, a bit of a mouthful I know. You simply have to focus the Fuuton into your palm or throat and then release it, keep it focused in a stream. Otherwise it will spread out and be more or less useless."

Considering Setsuna had asked to see all three, she moved straight onto the next one; before the girl had even started the first. This time, she performed five handseals; once again focusing chakra into her palm and thrusting it forwards. This time, she released a concentrated blast of wind; slamming it into the water and throwing spray for quite the distance.

"and this one is Great Breakthrough. Its similar to Godly wind, however you have to release all the focused wind in one concentrated blast. You can use either your hand or your mouth, though you should practice with both just in case. And...finally"

This time she withdrew her shuriken and formed another few handseals, concentrating the wind around her shuriken and causing them to float.

"This one you know quite well. Its called Rotating shuriken. Imagine a path for the shuriken to follow and guide them along it. With mastery you'll be able to change their paths freely. Remember not to try and control the shuriken, but to guide them instead."* - Sun Sep 20 04:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Probably get my ass whooped, but I haven't fought in a while, and we're in the middle of war, so I need all the training I can get. - Sun Sep 20 09:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Would you like the first move? - Sun Sep 20 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Alright then, I guess. - Sun Sep 20 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked the boy over once or twice, there was something a little odd about his eyes but she paid little attention to it. What she paid more attention to was the hammer at his back, that betrayed him as a close combat fighter. If he was fast enough then it could prove to be her disadvantage, if he wasn't however; then he was in for a bad time.

As he got closer with that hammer of his, she would clap her hands together just once and thrust a palm towards him. Her intention was to blow a humungous gale right into his body; to knock him off his feet and send him flying several feet.* - Sun Sep 20 09:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started moving backwards, forming a single handseal. The seal she used was unique, not one of the usual twelve; meaning this jutsu was a special one.
Splitting off her chakra, she created three clones; wincing slightly at the drain from her chakra, it was fortunate she had a lot of it. The first of the three clones would move to stand in Ikarus's way, hoping to hold him back from the original the the other two clones.

The second of the three clones would split off, moving to flank him from the left; while the third would do the same but from the other side. Each would already be preparing to use their jutsu's.* - Sun Sep 20 10:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched as her first clone accomplished its job of simply drawing ikarus away from her; even better was it left her other two clones to attack freely. While Lera formed her handseals, the two clones would do the same; forming three handseals each and drawing in breaths. All at once, they released those breaths towards Ikarus; sending sharp splinters of wind directly for him. If they struck, he would feel little more than extreme stinging pain and would likely be left with a multitude of bruises as she toned the jutsu's down to cause less damage.

The original Lera would be finishing up her own handseals, attempting to catch Ikarus's eyes in order to bring her genjutsu into effect. If successful, many more clones would rise around him and begin attacking without pause. For every one he destroyed, two more would replace it.* - Sun Sep 20 10:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed another handseal, letting her clones vanish away. She then looked down to Ikarus and held up her hand.

"Thats enough, we need to keep enough chakra. Just incase we get attacked...wouldn't do to get attacked while we're exhausted."* - Sun Sep 20 10:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My name is Lera, by the way. - Sun Sep 20 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm still practicing with those Clones, using them takes more chakra than I'd like to admit. - Sun Sep 20 10:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: s - Sun Sep 20 10:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Understandable. That technique can take quite the drain. - Sun Sep 20 10:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway, nice to meet you Ikarus. - Sun Sep 20 10:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 20 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...So you use Suiton. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I'm going to wager a guess and say you use Raiton as well. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: ...Possibly. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Using water like that on my clones.. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Guess you'll just have to find out soon. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its a combination I would use as well. - Sun Sep 20 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Very effective. - Sun Sep 20 10:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep. - Sun Sep 20 10:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I'm not that good with either though. - Sun Sep 20 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, my Raiton isn't quite up to standards either. - Sun Sep 20 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I can't use Sution. - Sun Sep 20 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I assume Fuuton is your main, correct? - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Fuuton and Doton. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are the two I use most. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Ah, nice. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though I often combine Fuuton with katon. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Four elements? - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: How rare. - Sun Sep 20 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Good to know I'm not the only one. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sure I'm not the only one. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And...I prove myself right almost immediately. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Interesting. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Haha. Katon is the only one I can't use. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I mainly use Doton, and am still inexperienced with that. - Sun Sep 20 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, maybe we could share our knowledge some time. - Sun Sep 20 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: That would be perfect. - Sun Sep 20 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm always looking to increase my repetoire. - Sun Sep 20 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I've been mainly focusing on my taijutsu as of now though. - Sun Sep 20 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Though i'd be surprised if he has something I don't know... - Sun Sep 20 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Rather, my taijutsu in conjunction with Varys over here. -pats his hand on his hammer-- - Sun Sep 20 10:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 10:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Taijutsu is definitely not a strong point of mine. - Sun Sep 20 10:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I like being able to use long-range and close-range. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, was thinking of learning Taijutsu eventually. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: The two extremes are good. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But for now I want to master my elements. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Seeing as how they are counters for each other. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm learning Fuuton from hassan. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: What you can do is work on using your ninjutsu for close-ranged battles. - Sun Sep 20 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. I already have one for that. - Sun Sep 20 10:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Really? - Sun Sep 20 10:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to a nearby tree and swung her hand at it. Her fingers were straightened out into the shape of a blade, allowing them to cut through the tree with ease. With a crack and a slight creak, the tree tilted to the side and fell to the ground.* - Sun Sep 20 10:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It does the job, too dangerous to use if I'm not trying to kill though. - Sun Sep 20 11:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not something you can...hold back. - Sun Sep 20 11:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 11:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Another couple suggestions. - Sun Sep 20 11:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 20 11:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Wind and Doton work very well for close range encounters. - Sun Sep 20 11:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: So, a Doton technique where you can use it as armor would be perfect. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: And then something where you can use wind to augment attacks. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: These are all things I have been thinking of learning in the future. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Doton armour? - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Right. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't thought of that. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm. Perhaps i'll look into that. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Mhm. - Sun Sep 20 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As for using wind to augment attacks. - Sun Sep 20 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You mean chakra flow? - Sun Sep 20 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Something like that. - Sun Sep 20 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: That, or maybe melee weapons composed completely of wind. - Sun Sep 20 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Blades of wind huh. - Sun Sep 20 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You have some interesting ideas. Maybe I'll put these across to my sensei. - Sun Sep 20 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. - Sun Sep 20 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shall we head back to the mansion? - Sun Sep 20 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: s - Sun Sep 20 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Alright, sure. - Sun Sep 20 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whats going on...? - Sun Sep 20 11:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A fight between the two of them. - Sun Sep 20 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why? - Sun Sep 20 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...Don't know, Probably over Religion. - Sun Sep 20 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watches, shocked and repulsed by what Erebus had done. She didn't understand why noone had bothered to stop him, just let him go ahead and murder Jin. Her teeth gritted in anger, she formed a single handseal and created two clones to stand in front of her. These clones would begin moving towards Erebus.* - Sun Sep 20 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Oi enough. - Sun Sep 20 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Stand down Lera. - Sun Sep 20 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) could barely watch the sickening scene, partly because it was covered in fire but because it just seemed wrong. Her two clones came together, one stringing together a series of five handseals and the other simply clapping her hands together. As the first copied Himura's fireball, adding to the flames that already surrounded Erebus. The second would breathe out a great gust of air, strengthening the flames considerably.* - Sun Sep 20 12:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gritted her teeth as one of her two clones were dispersed into smoke. The second clone wanted nothing more than to run in and rip out the mans heart, but it knew that the flames would only destroy it. Instead, it formed another three handseals; breathing air into its lungs and exhaling violently. Spewing from its mouth would be a hail of splinters and bullets, intent on piercing the skin of Erebus. As they traveled through the flames, they would only combust; hopefully peppering Erebus with a multitude of sharp flaming bullets.* - Sun Sep 20 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) completely ignored Seisuke's words, or didn't hear them at all. As soon as Erebus emerged from the flames, her clone ran forward; dragging its fingers through the flames so the Fuuton chakra that gathered there would ignite. As soon as it reached Erebus, it would thrust straight for his chest with a flaming hell stab.* - Sun Sep 20 12:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: ..? - Sun Sep 20 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was slammed into by her own clone, bringing her to the ground before she even had a chance to react. For a few moments she struggled to get back to her feet, before she simply stayed on her knees; for all intents and purposes looking as if she'd realised just how weak and useless she really was.* - Sun Sep 20 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: My best technique... - Sun Sep 20 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'm sorry Jin.. - Sun Sep 20 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had no visible injuries, though she would be bruised later.* - Sun Sep 20 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why's this nigga standing on ashes? -omit- - Sun Sep 20 13:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: To put out these flames? - Sun Sep 20 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Naw they can handle it. - Sun Sep 20 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Seisuke. - Sun Sep 20 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Do not let him stay here. - Sun Sep 20 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And where exactly do you get off telling me what to do? - Sun Sep 20 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: When he murders a member of this village. - Sun Sep 20 13:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That's when. - Sun Sep 20 13:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Don't see how, That has anything to do with me. - Sun Sep 20 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You're a part of this village are you not? - Sun Sep 20 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Not to my knowledge. - Sun Sep 20 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Then why are you here? - Sun Sep 20 13:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stayed silent on her knees, completely oblivous to what was going on around her* - Sun Sep 20 13:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Are you ok? - Sun Sep 20 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't reply, simply sitting against the wall staring at the ground.* - Sun Sep 20 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) kept her gaze on the ground for a few moments before slowly dragging her attention up to look at Setsuna. Her eyes were empty.* - Sun Sep 20 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: We've lost Tethys, Jin and Niza still hasn't come back or bird messaged me... - Sun Sep 20 13:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: We're mostly surrounded...our only real exit is blocked by the forces of Zetsumo... - Sun Sep 20 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) remained impassive and devout of any reaction while setsuna hugged her. After failing so completely to save or even avenge her friend, she just broke. Slowly while she sat there, she would come to realise that her feelings were unecessary; they caused so much pain, it was better to just remove them entirely.* - Sun Sep 20 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) remained cold and dead in Setsuna's arms, while she killed off and locked away the last remnants of her emotions.* - Sun Sep 20 13:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) allowed herself to be guided to the bench, where she took a seat and stared quietly into space.* - Sun Sep 20 13:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 20 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Lera.. you're super strong... if you're concerned about your strength then.. there's no need. Don't give up.. not on your emotions.. - Sun Sep 20 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ever so slowly turned her head towards Setsuna, watching her quiet for a few more moments before her lips tilted upwards into a smile. There was absolutely nothing in the smile yet it wasn't forced somehow.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He could possibly be moving around, or tailing Ushinawa. - Sun Sep 20 15:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 20 15:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: We have a multitude of boats prepped for evacuation. - Sun Sep 20 15:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: How about this. - Sun Sep 20 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're thinking that we should flee in the end? - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: We take what forces we have go to SUna put an end to this edge guy  use it resources to by time and then  when the moment is right we but an end to this big bad zetusmo guy who ever he is. - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That sounds like a bad plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's a terrible plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'll explain why I believe the plan is bad. First off, we don't know of Edge's location, nor his forces strength or size.  Second, we are currently in war with Zetsumo's forces who is allied with Ame. They are positioned around the village, as far as I recall.  - Sun Sep 20 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, Edge is more powerful than you think, Flexus. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: As of right now, we need a secret place to go to. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Suna is not that place. Our presence and activity there will alert Zetsumo, plus I think the adjustment from a place like Kirigakure to Sunagakure is the worst, especially with resources being sapped constantly. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...Is this where I laugh? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The moment we send a large force out to locate and deal with Edge, they will spot and attack.  Then there's the problem of war fatalities. We are already pressed with our forces. We don't have enough strength to split between Zetsumo and Edge. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just know that in our curent situation, it's best to deal with what's before us first.  Also, what advantage would we gain from dealing with Edge? - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gain no advantage, Honestly, Edge is better left alone. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Edge only wished to Unite Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
