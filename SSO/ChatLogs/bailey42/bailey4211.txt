<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 27 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh, take this scroll first. Might as well add it to your pile. - Sun Sep 27 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right...I'll get started then. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hmmm.. - Sun Sep 27 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took out the scroll given to her by Seisuke, undoing the twine and letting it roll open on the floor. She had no idea what kind of jutsu to expect, though it was likely to be something quite powerful if Sesuke's previous gifts were anything to go by. It was a Doton jutsu once again, just as complicated as the previous jutsu if not more so. Whats more, it was yet another jutsu without the use of handseals; which just made it harder to learn, though faster to use in battle.

While she read the notes, her eyes would slowly be widening; as she realised exactly what it was this jutsu was supposed to do. Seisuke had clearly known what he was doing when he gave this scroll to her, he knew her weaknesses better than anyone. The technique was called Domu. It involved spreading Doton chakra across the surface of the skin in order to increase the skins hardness and provide a few other benefits.

This was exactly what she needed to learn, her biggest weakness was her low defense; coupled with her lack of speed, people faster than her often found it easy to subdue her in just a few hits. With this though, Lera would be able to take those hits and it wouldn't even cause her much damage. By now, an extremely wide grin had spread over her face; this jutsu would make her much much effective in battle.

Taking hold of the scroll, she rolled it back up and wound the twine around it; making sure it was safe inside her jacket. She had a thought of getting Seisuke to sell all these scrolls, he certainly had more connections than she did and it would get them more money. She had to blink at that thought, wondering when she'd started to refer to herself and Seisuke as a single entity; but that was a thought for later.

She took a seat on the ground and ran through the instructions in her head, she knew that she would need to spread the Doton chakra throughout her body; but it would surely not be that easy. There was also the worry that it would restrict her movements, with hardened skin it might well be difficult to move as she wanted. Though the scroll hadn't mentioned any such drawback, which meant it either simply didn't happen or you had to be careful of how hard you made your skin.

To start things off, she held out her hand palm upwards and stared at it intently. She figured it might be better to start with one body part at a time, moving it upwards till the Doton encompased her entire body. While she stared at her palm, she envisioned the flow of chakra there. Though it wasn't actually visible, she was able to get a good idea of how things looks by using her feel for it and her imagination.

First, she started to focus the chakra there; in one specific spot at the centre of her palm. It wasn't as difficult as it used to be, this being something she practiced in order to learn the hell stab technique. All her different training regimes seemed to help in her various jutsu, one way or another. This was just another step in gaining strength, it used to be that she wanted to protect her friends. Now though she wanted to have the strength to be able to stand by Seisuke's side as an equal.

With the chakra focused on her palm, she began adding the Doton transformation exactly as instructed in the scroll. At first, nothing seemed to be happening; though she could feel the chakra and see exactly how it was working in her minds eye. Her skin remained unchanged and just as soft and pink as ever. After a few moments though, a spot directly on the centre of her palm slowly darkened. Giving the skin a bronzed heavily tanned look.

She stared at it for a few moments before reaching to poke it experimentally. What should've been soft and pliable was hard and cold. It was still easy to feel that she was touching skin, but it had hardness closer to the consistency of rock. Happy that it was performing as it was meant to, she set to work on the next step in the jutsu. Now she had to spread the hardness to the rest of her body.

With the rock like consistency still settled on her palm, she closed her eyes and formed a clear image of her hand as well as the chakra that burned within it. Breathing in deeply, she started to push at the edges of that chakra spot; spreading the chocolatey brown hue'd chakra further across her hand. Though her chakra was not this colour, the deep brown was always how she'd envisioned her Doton chakra. Seperating them into colours simply made it easier to use them, since she had so many elements she needed it to be as easy as possible to access them.

Though she couldn't see the effect, the bronzed brown colour was beggining to spread across her palm and up to her fingers. Once her entire hand was covered, she started to spread it up her wrist. It still seemed much easier than she expected it to be, she expected the issue came in maintaining the jutsu rather than actually learning it; but that was an obstacle she could jump when she reached it.

Soon, the darkened skin had reached her shoulder; staring to spread at a much quicker rate. It almost looked as if she were tanning her body a piece at a time, oddly enough her face and head remained normal; she somehow instinctively saved that area for last despite it being the closer place to change. Within a few more minutes, her other arm had now changed colour and it was spreading across her lower.

By now, she noticed the change in feeling on those areas; they seemed stiffer somehow, proving her earlier fears that this could possibly inhibit her movements. She figured the right amount of chakra would make itself known with more practice; either way this jutsu would still be incredibly useful, life saving even. She experimentally wriggled her toes as the chakra fully spread across her lower body; leaving only her head to change.

It was here that things got more difficult, never before had she had any reason to flow chakra through her face and head; so it was foreign ground to her. It was definitely possible though. At an incredibly slow snails pace, she forced the chakra to spread across her face and neck. Changing even the colour of her eyelids; she considered that there was more possible uses to this jutsu. Seeing as it darkened her skin, if she wore black she might be able to blend in with the shadows.

Finally, she managed to have the chakra spread completely over her face; completing the technique entirely and leaving her to open her eyes. She looked down over her body, looking at the darkened skin with a smile. She actually liked the look, she thought the dark bronze skin suited her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) quickly bit the skin on her thumb and rubbed a line of blood across her palm. After the seals were formed, she slammed a palm on the ground and summoned a wolf. By wolf standards, it was barely still a child which showed as it bounded around the pair excitedly. Eventually it came to a stop next to Lera who bent down to scratch it behind the ears.

"Jenna, meet Seisuke. Seisuke, Jenna."

The wolf rested its bright eyes on Seisukes and yelped out in a distinctly feminime voice "Hi!~"* - Sun Sep 27 14:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched as the wolf suddenly dissapeared with a quick "I gotta go! bye!" she wasn't so good at it yet.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her place on the stool, swallowing quietly as she ran her fingers over the keys. It was a beautiful instrument, it would not have been cheap. She took in a nervous breath and slowly started to play, singing the song she'd written for Seisuke.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) followed along nicely.* - Sun Sep 27 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So...whats the mission? - Sun Sep 27 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ............................ - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For real? - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We're teaching a class? - Sun Sep 27 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeeppp. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..... - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...ninjutsu i guess. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Genjutsu as well. - Sun Sep 27 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulped and walked into the classroom, assuming Sanoke wouldn't be far behind. Teaching a class was far from what she expected, though teaching was always something for her to enjoy. The room was full of children, all between the ages of six and nine; a few just reacing their teens. She was overcome by the enormity of it all, it was all well and good teaching a few people ninjutsu here and there, but an entire class of children was a different thing entirely.

There was already a teacher present who smiled at the pair when the walked through the door, she quickly introduced the two.

"Class, this is Sanoke and Lera; they'll be taking over your class today. Be good for them okay?"

There was a chorus of yes's and yes ma'am's while the teacher turned to leave the room, wishing the pair of them good luck. With the teacher out the room, silence prevailed; causing Lera to gulp with nerves. They had to break the ice somehow and Lera only knew one way, she just hoped Jenna would forgive her for this. She bit into the skin of her thumb and wiped a line of blood on her palm; pressing it to the ground to summon a small wolf. She whispered into the wolfs ear "Please Jenna, just let them stroke you a bit. I'll get you something nice later kay?"

Jenna rolled her eyes and hissed "Fine" through her teeth, settling next to Lera in full view of the glass. Assuming Sanoke hadn't already started to speak, she would then raise her voice to the class.

"Hello everyone, I'm Lera, this is Sanoke and this is Jenna. Why don't you all come up one by one and say hello?~"* - Sun Sep 27 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched with raised eyebrows, briefly turning to Sanoke to reply "Its a recent thing actually." then he pulled out a giant turtle obviously in an attempts to outdo her. That fell short when the turtle refused to wake up.

The class were openly laughing now, having Lera sigh in relief; the ice was definitely broken. Once the class had all been up to pet the wofl or turtle, she clapped her hands together; taking the leader roll since Sanoke clearly didn't want to.

"Alright, everyone back to their se-" she was cut short by the sound of a scream and the crash of a window breaking. Soon after the teacher from before came rushing into the room, a look of sheer panic on her face.

"Their everywhere! What are we going to do??"

Lera's smile quickly vanished, something had obviously gone very very wrong. She was about to ask exactly what the teacher was talking about when a large heavyset man broke down the door and barreled into the room. He wielded what looked like a one handed axe, there even seemed to be fresh stains of blood on the blade. With a loud and threatening voice he bellowed out "NOBODY MOVE! Stay where you are and noone gets hurt!"

Lera however did not follow his commands. Regardless of what Sanoke was doing to react, Jenna would leap forwards gently locking her jaw around the teachers wrist and pulling her out of the way. Lera would be clapping her hands together and drawing in a deep breath, turning her attentions to the thug. All at once, she released the breath right into the mans chest; slamming him with a great gust of wind and throwing him through the wall beyond. The children, who seemed more excited than scared, let out appreciative wow's.* - Sun Sep 27 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) merely watched the man at work, though obviously couldn't leave it all to him. So instead, she formed a single handseal and created four clones; clones that were perfectly real. Holding their breath to avoid the smog, they ran into the thugs; each covering their skin with chakra to harden it and increase their strengths.

The clones were bad at taijutsu, for a shinobi; but by the standards of an ordinary thugs, she was faster and stronger than even the biggest man could hope to be. The clones were knocking men out with hardened fists left right and centre.* - Sun Sep 27 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) as actually stood right by Sanoke, her clones taking the brunt of everything; she never fought up front herself if she could help it, she knew her weaknesses. looking out at the scene though, it looked like it was just about done; her clones got some of the poison smog in their system and dispersed because of it, but that was fine.

"Eh. Maybe. I think we're more or less done here."* - Sun Sep 27 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: True? What about him? - Sun Sep 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That he killed a Kiri-nin. - Sun Sep 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He did yes - Sun Sep 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow. - Sun Sep 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: We just gonna let that slide? - Sun Sep 27 20:38:11 2015
