<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped away from the central coutyard of the village, away from the groups that had gathered there. Her Mind was plagued by many things, predominantly on the wherabouts of Seisuke. She hadn't heard from in over two weeks now, one more day and she would ask Hassan for permission to go look for him. Then there was the whole business with Violet as well, she wondered what Seisuke would think of that when she told him.

In truth, she hadn't meant to let Violet kiss her like that; but it had been such a shock that she'd not done anything to stop it. Either way, Violet was upset and likely depressed from the events in Kirigakure; Lera would do whatever she could to comfort her friend. Now that Koeki was dead and Kirigakure was seemingly destroyed; they had a problem on their hands. It seemed this 'Edge' person was hellbent on causing widespread destruction.

She had no illusions to their loss though, she would stand up and fight alongside everyone in Sunagakure and she had to believe they would win. For that to happen though, she had to get stronger; she needed enough power to be able to stand with the likes of Hassan and Fujitora and fight on equal terms. Her Katon training had only been the first step, she was looking to go bigger and better. Do something new, unique and possibly more powerful then any kind of Ninjutsu used before.

How she would go about that, she didn't know; there was no real way to know without experimenting. So far, her most powerful techniques came from combining her Ninjutsu to produce large and explosive effects. So this is what she would spend her time practicing, starting with her latest Katon technique. First though, she formed a single handseal and created a total of five clones; training always seemed to work just a little bit faster when she used multiple clones for it.

To start things off, Lera herself floated upwards so she could have an aerial view of her Jutsu's effects and so she could be safe from the resulting explosions. Then, each of her five clones formed a series of Handseals; all spitting out an opaque gas that covered the entire area. Luckily she'd gone to an extremely isolated area in the desert around the village to avoid drawing attention or breaking anything important.

Once the area was effectively covered in Gas, one of the clones simple held out its hand and generated a small spark on its palm. The resulting explosion was impressive to say the least, Lera herself was forced further skywards just to avoid being engulfed by the smoke. Her five clones were all erased as expected, the flames dispersing them the instant they were ingited. She had to admit, learning this paticular jutsu was a good choice; the different possibilities were already swirling around her mind. Including a trap for her enemies...

With a slight smile, she started to lower herself back towards the ground; noting with some satisfaction that she was getting much better and flying lately. If she hadn't noticed the seemingly camoflauged figure moving through the sands, she might have been ambushed. Immediately she started rising again, scouring the ground for any sign of the movement she just saw. It took a great deal of focus but she eventually managed to make out the shape of a man, swathed in typical sunagakure attire.

He was moving slowly towards the point of her explosion, apparently investigating the cause. He hadn't yet noticed the figure of a small girl flying above him just yet and as such, when he saw the remains of her explosion and the lack of any bodies or apparent cause; he raised his hand. Prompted by his signal, a multitude of figures began rising from the sand; moving towards the point of the explosion. Looking closely she could see the variety of weapons they carried. Varying from simple clubs, swords, spears and even pitchforks.

The only guess she could wager as to who these people were, was that they were the remnants of bandits that had been expelled from the village. Obviously they'd heard of Edge and his plans and were waiting for Sunagakure to be overun so they could take it back. In truth, Lera felt a little sympathy for these people; they had no homes to go to and none of the comforts a home could provide, so she decided to leave them be. It turned out, her softness was just another big mistake.

She floated away from the bandits, gradually lowering herself to the ground so she could walk. Despite her growing skill, she wasn't yet good enough to be flying long distances. It was due to her lack of caution that she was ambushed completely unprepared. She didn't see the pair coming up at her until it was too late, she twisted to fight back and managed to land a punch on someones face with a satisfying crunch. Soon after, the world went black as she felt a strike to the back of her head.

She spent the next hour or so drifting in and out of concioussness, aware that she was being carried away with ties around her wrists and a bag over her head. She wasn't sure exactly how long they'd been moving, her concept of time more or less broken by the disorientation she was feeling. She only knew her wherabouts when the feeling on her skin went through a distinctive change. The air was growing noticeably colder and the scent of earth was permeating through the bag on her head. The only conclusion she could draw was that they were travelling underground.

Her suspicions were confirmed when she was dumped on cold hard ground and chained to a wall. The bag was subsequently ripped from her head and she found herself staring at her captors, there were five men or so; no-where near the amount she'd seen gathering around. On closer inspection she could just barely see a group of people stood outside the door and peering inside. No matter where she looked, it was only cold hard faces; with the exception of one. She peered into that face for a few moments, noting that was a little warmth and even guilt in his eyes.

It turned out, that man was the first one to speak "She's just a child...she barely looks to be in her teens. Are we really going to keep her tied up like this?" despite her situation, she immediately liked the man. His voice held hints of warmth and kindness not present in most people these days. The man standing directly in front of her turned his angry gaze to the kind man, practically spitting out his words "Don't be decieved by its appearence, this thing is a monster! Nothing more nothing less!"

At that, Lera raised an eyebrow; taking a closer look at the mans attire. Perhaps they weren't bandits after all, looking closely she could see the various religous paraphernalia dotted about the room and attached to peoples clothing. So she wasn't dealing with just generic bandits here, but a group of religous nuts. In some ways, that was probably more dangerous. While the man ranted about monsters and demons, she began looking around the room; looking for a way to escape. Like this she couldn't perform handseals, if she could just find a way out of these chains.

Looking at the wall behind her, she noticed that it wasn't made of Rock; instead it was made of dirt. Hardened and compacted dirt. That was the first mistake her captors made, assuming antyhing attached to an earthen wall could hold her. It would be easy to channel chakra up the chain and soften the earth that held it, but for now she would wait. These idiots would have to leave her alone eventually and it was then that she'd make her escape.

She was interrupted from her thoughts of escape when the 'priests' rant took on a more sinister approach "We lack the women to build our community higher. So from tonight onwards, a member of our church will be joining her here for the night. This will continue until she is with child. Don't worry girl, you'll be birthing many of our members over the next few years." Lera just stared at him in horror unable to believe the sort of thing this sick and twisted man was coming up with.

To make matters worse, he turned back to the only one who showed kindness; the same look of horror she showed was mirrored in his eyes. The 'Priest' picked up on that placing a vice like grip on his shoulder and practically spitting in his face "And you shall have the first honors! Tonight you will venture into this room and use it until your body is no longer able to produce its seed!" at this point Lera was gritting her teeth in anger, barely able to stop herself from removing these chains and cutting off the bastards head; but she couldn't do it now, she had to wait. Even she would struggle with this many at once.

To her annoyance and anger, she would have to wait until after they all left; leaving risk that she may end up being raped, a prospect she wasn't so keen on. As the people filed out of the room, she was readying her chakra for an escape and thats exactly what she would've done if the 'Priest' hadn't turned back to smash her in the head with his club. She was unconciouss almost immediately, barely registering a fuzziness of her vision and a wet sticky feeling dripping down her face before she passed out.

When she finally woke up; she found, thankfully, that she was still fully clothed and noone seemed to be preparing to do anything to her. The guards were no-where to be seen, though her door was ever so slightly ajar; revealing the shadow of a figure waiting outside. She only noticed kind man when he brought a spoon with an unidentified white mush close to her mouth. At first, she reacted with shock and flinched back into the wall; but the mans wary smile and warm eyes soon convinced her to eat.

The mush was some kind of porridge, sweetened with honey; probably to keep her strength up in the coming nights. After she'd eaten he leaned in close to whisper in her ears "I'm sorry...but I have to...you know.." when he leaned back, he appeared to be reaching for the buckle on his trousers; though the look on his face said he hated every moment of it. She watched him for a few moments more before gesturing for him to lean in closer, so she could whisper back "No you don't, I can escape this easily. You just have to stand back and watch."

He looked surprised for a few moments before whispering back "Please, don't try anything stupid. They'll just kill you..." Lera had to supress the urge to giggle; her small stature and young age, as always, led to her being underestimated. Instead she just shook her head and concentrated on the earth where her chains were attached. With a slight clink, her chains fell away from the wall; allowing Lera to rub her numbed arms "Chains like this can't hold me and I can leave without anyone even noticing...but, now I'm going to have to kill that...whatever he is."

In reply, he just stared at her chains; before rushing to the door and slamming it shut, twisting a key in the lock. Immediately the sounds of thumps could be heard from the door, but they soon gave up; just assuming the man wanted privacy with her, there was no escape from the room after all "When they said you were flying, I didn't want to believe it. Obviously you are a shinobi, looks really can be decieving..." Lera nodded once in afirmation and promptly cut the chains with her Hell stab technique, freeing up her wrists completely.

"You have two choices, I can either knock you out and say I overwhelmed you. Or you can come with me to Sunagakure, its bound to be better than living in this dump" he seemed to think about that for a moment, before nodding and handing her the key to the door "You're right, but do you really have to kill the priest? Can't we just leave?" she shook her head, a grim look coming over he face "No, if I don't take care of him here he'll just do this again and next time whoever it is might not be able to escape."

Without waiting for his reply, she walked up to the wall and casually walked through it. The entire cave seemed to be made of compacted earth, making it easy for her to make her way through. The guard on the other side looked at her with wide unblinking eyes, until she smashed a fist into his face and knocked him out. She then proceeded to unlock the door and let out her new friend. He looked down at the unconciouss guard and the blood dripping from his now broken nose "I guess you really are strong. Its a little hard to get used to."

Lera replied with "I know" Before walking confidently down the corridor, her friend tailing close behind. In the brief moment she'd been in the wall, she'd managed to get a good layout of the cave and all its rooms. This place had been here long before these people occupied it, it was quite extensive with various rooms big and small. Most areas seemed unnocupied and for the most part she ignored the ones that were occupied. There was a single person in one of the rooms, she assumed was a bedroom; it was the largest of the occupied rooms, likely inhabited by whoever led this place.

She made her way towards that, ocasionally coming across one of the caves occupants; those she simply knocked out before they had a chance to breathe a word of warning. The man was impressed by the lack of hesitation in this little girls attacks, despite her meager years she was obviously a seasoned fighter and had seen more than most people twice her age. He just couldn't imagine the life of a shinobi, to produce children like this; what does a child have to go through to end up like that? Soon enough they came across the largest bedroom, a locked iron door blocking their way.

The kind man was surprised by how easily she'd found it, though only chose to comment when she asked if it was the right room "Yes, this is the one. How did you know?" Lera didn't bother to give an answer, instead she casually shoved her fingers into the lock; tearing through the mechanisms as if they were nothing more than paper. She then kicked the door open and formed a few handseals, breathing out her invisible gas into the room. She just managed to catch the priests shocked look until she threw in a spark and stepped away from the room.

Flames leapt through the doorway, creeping up the earth around the door before rescinding after finding no viable fuel source. She heard the screams from the room, turning from shocked pain to a gurgled howl. She listened until they were gone and she was sure he was now dead. She thought it would feel worse taking a life, but instead she felt nothing. She wasn't sure whether to feel upset of glad by this fact. Either she was mentally broken after everything she'd seen, or the lack of feeling meant she wouldn't have to feel guilty.

The kind man watched everything happen with sadness in his eyes, the girl was young enough to be his daughter; yet she was able to take a life with such ease and without hesitation. He was sad because he knew the kind of life she would have lived to end up like this must have been horrible. Instead of offering words of comfort or wisdom, he just led her through the caverns towards the entrance. She remained quiet throughout the entire walk, more so because he was silent as well. When they finally reached the entrance, she took him by the arm and floated up into the sky.

He let out an exclamation of surprise, even after hearing she could fly he was not so sure whether to believe it. Yet here she was, flying and bringing him with her. Once they'd reached a good height, she looked around for the village. It turned out, they hadn't gone far at all. Her hit to the head at the start seemed to have stretched time for her, the village was barely a five minute fly away. 

Getting over the walls was easy, they got into the village without so much as a glance from the guards. As soon as they landed, she let him go and promptly fell face first into the sand. All the hits to the head and her overextended use of flight had all gotten to her. She fell unconciouss, exhausted with one hell of a headache. The kind man wasted no time in picking her up and taking her to the hospital.

When she awoke again, she found her new friend sat by her bed and her head wounds healed and wrapped. It went without saying that she felt significantly better. Once he noticed her open eyes, the man opened his mouth to speak "Welcome back. You were asleep for quite a while. Seems the nurses knew you, you're the daughter of the Kazekage or something like that. Explains why you're so strong." She watched him for a few moments, his smile was warm and completely genuine. He wasn't scared after seeing her works "Thanks...you brought me here then? I guess I owe you."

He shook his head and rested back in his seat "You saved me back there, I'd say we're even. Thanks for getting me out of that place, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. They gave me a job here in the hospital too, I know some first aid; said they needed all the help they could get." Lera smiled in return, glad that her effort wasn't going to waste "Good, I'm happy you're doing okay. Uh...do you mind if I rest more? I still feel a little tired." he shrugged and gave her forehead a pat "Rest all you want, I think you deserve it." With that, she closed her eyes; falling asleep within moments.* - Thu Oct  8 11:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yes. But it's better to watch it visually in action.  - Thu Oct  8 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) shrugged and concentrated her chakra again, drawing earth and moisture from the ground to create mud. It was difficult to create a lot due to the naturally dry atmosphere. Once the mud had settled, she drew back her head and spat out a similar stream; creating much more mud than before.

"As you can see, you can use the earth already present or just spit it out like that. The latter takes much more skill though."* - Thu Oct  8 12:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aaand he's gone. - Thu Oct  8 12:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...like this., - Thu Oct  8 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) created a clone of herself, which subesequently started spitting out a large amount of mud onto the ground. Once there was enough, the original began forming handseals directing her chakra towards the newly created mud. Rising from it was the head of a large dragon, maw open with a bright light shining from within. The clone then formed its own handseal, taking in a deep breath and coating its lungs with chakra.

The combination happened all at once. The Clone breathed out a steady stream of highly condensed flame and the dragons head fired off a torrent of hardened mud bullets. As they traveled through the flames, each one caught fire increasing their power considerably. Each bullet impacted the wall, leaving noticeable holes and minature craters.* - Thu Oct  8 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm. Yeah, we'll have to try later. - Thu Oct  8 13:23:24 2015

"I doubt either of us have a jutsu that can accomplish that, but If we can find a way to force them above ground...I can spread fire over them."* - Thu Oct  8 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) positioned each of her clones on either side of her, all five readying various handseals and clapping their hands together to perform a variety of jutsu. The original Lera went first, forming her handseals and breathing out a cloud of flamable gas; letting the force from Koji's technique spread it all over the scorpions.

Then, three of her clones would suddenly breathe out two large fireballs and a heavily condenses stream of flame respectively. To add even more to that, her final two clones clapped their hands together and adding two powerful Fuuton Gales to the mix. The Flames expanded rapidly into a humongous fireball, coming into contact with the flamable gas. As soon as it did, the group was greeted by a humungous explosions; only serving to spread the flames further and roast each scorpion alive in their shells.* - Thu Oct  8 18:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat on the sand with three scrolls unfurled infront of her, the scrolls she'd recieved from Kilm in a small trade. Two B rank jutsu and a single C rank. All in all, it had been a good trade; albeit she'd given up one of her personal techniques to get these. The Doton technique she recieved was the 'cream of the crop' so to speak. The other two were genjutsu simply to increase her overall knowledge.

She decided to start with the easiest of the three to learn, specifically the C rank genjutsu. On closer inspection of the jutsu's description, she wasn't entirely sure how it could ever be useful in a fight. According to the scroll, the jutsu was made to bring on the illusion of a giant flaming meteor falling towards your opponent. In Lera's opinion, there simply wasn't an ordinary jutsu that could accomplish this feat. It would be too obvious of an illusion.

However, someone had seen fit to create the technique and Lera wasn't one to pass up a chance to learn something new. So she picked up the other two scrolls and spent the next half hour simply reading and then re-reading the C rank scroll. Practicing a genjutsu was always quite a difficult thin to do. Without someone to test the jutsu on, it was quite hard to know if it was working at all. Fortunately for Lera, she had a way of navigating past that issue.

Forming a quick handseal, she summoned a single clone to stand a certain distance away from her. The clone was capable of percieving genjutsu and subsequently finding themselves trapped within one, it would be a good way of testing to see if her jutsu was working. Once the clone nodded its readyness, Lera tucked the scroll away and started forming handseals. The trigger for the jutsu was made via direct eye contact, which she subsequently established with the clone.

She waited for a few moments, watching for a change in the clones demeanour or just some acknowledgement that the jutsu was working. Instead, the clone just shook its head and gave a short sharp shrug. With a sigh, Lera released the jutsu and pulled the scroll back out; looking for any sort of reason why she failed. Unlike Elemental ninjutsu, Genjutsu didn't come quite as easily to her; not that she couldn't do it, it simply didn't fall within her natural talents.

Not one to give up on anything, she refreshed her knowledge on the jutsu's description and went for another go. After forming the handseals, she made eye contact with the clone who proceeded to look up into the sky. For a while it didn't note any changes, before it eventually squinted upwards at some invisible object Lera couldn't see. Upon closer inspection, Lera noted a tiny meteor; probably no bigger than a small rock, falling towards her clone.

The meteor was obviously falling, but never seemed to be getting any closer; betraying it for the Illusion it was. With a hefty sigh, she released the genjutsu and let the tiny meteor vanish. At least, she thought, something had happened this time. It usually only took her a couple of attempts to get a jutsu right, hopefully this genjutsu would follow that same pattern. One more go, she wagered. One more and hopefully it would work.

Taking in a deep breath, she stared the clone dead in the eye and started forming handseals once more. This time she poured significantly more chakra into the jutsu, simply assuming she had not used enough in the failed attempts. With a grim smile, she activated the jutsu and was greeted by no changes...at least for a few seconds. After the jutsu really took effect, the entire area began to darken and take on a reddish hue.

Both her and the clone looked up simultaneously, staring at the humungous flaming meteor that seemed to be falling towards them. It was so realistic that it was almost believable to look at. On closer inspection she could see that, although it looked to be getting bigger, it was not coming any closer to the ground. Perhaps that was something she could fix with some practice. Either way, it seemed as if she had the jutsu down; so she released it and her clone, before going back to another jutsu.

With a sigh, she pulled out the second scroll; looking at the title and rank of said jutsu. This, like the one before it, was a genjutsu; albeit far more useful and significantly harder to use. Once again, it could be said to be obvious that it was a genjutsu. Yet, reading deeper into it; the jutsu bound and restricted the victims movements and arms, thus stopping them from using Kai. She had to smile as she thought of the possible uses for this technique, if only she was a little better at Genjutsu.

The name of the jutsu was Slyvan Fetters, or Tree binding death. The first name didn't really give a good description to the jutsu, the second name however described it perfectly. If she was reading it right, then the jutsu would allow her to bind opponents inside a tree and then emerge from the trunk itself in order to attack. The way it made it sound, bordered less on illusion and more on effecting reality itself.

A jutsu that effected reality was likely impossible though, though it seemed like it did; this jutsu was simply an extremely elaborate illusion. That being said, it was not in any way going to be an easy thing to learn. Like before, she would be using her clone as a guinea pig; it would be easy to tell if the jutsu was a success thig time, it was often an entire tree spontaneously grew around a person.

The jutsu took five handseals and quite a large amount of chakra to complete, she would not make the same mistake as before; namely not using enough chakra and failing the technique entirely. After making eye contact with the clone, she formed her handseals and attempted to activate the jutsu. Imagination often played a key part in the use of genjutsu, without the imagination to visualise the necessary effects; the jutsus would often just fail.

In this case, she imagined a tiny sapling sprouting underneath the clones feet; before spontaneously growing into a large tree and wrapping its branches around the clones midrift and arms. It went without saying that this didn't happen at all, in fact nothing happened. She poured her chakra into the jutsu and the clone just stood there completely obvlious to her attempts. Eventually, she gave up the attempt and simply dropped the jutsu.

She checked her chakra reserves after that, Genjutsu was notorious for using large amounts of chakra; she remember when she learned her first two genjutsu and the severe drain using them caused her. At least now she had a significantly larger pool, when she thought about it she really had come such a long way in the past few years. Going from a shy and little girl, to a powerful Elementalist and ninjutsu specialist. The thought of her progress brought a little smile to her face, but it just wasn't enough...not yet.

Taking in another deep breath, she settled her thoughts and returned to the task at hand. For a genjutsu such as this, it was likely going to take at least a few more attempts before she got the general gist of it. The clone stared at her with a look of plain boredom on its face, it had always fascinated her how the clones shared her same thoughts and feelings yet had them seperately from her. She wondered if it was possible for a clone to make a descision that went against her.

Either way, it was something she could deal with if it ever happened; as unlikely as that was. Slowly, she began gathering her chakra; here eyes resting determined on the clones. Once she'd gathered a suitable amount, she formed the five needed handseals and directed her chakra towards the clone. Like before, she focused clearly on the image of a sapling, growing underneath the clones feet in order to bind it in branches.

As usual, nothing happened for a few moments; before Lera noticed the tinest hint of green shooting from the ground. It grew upwards exceptionally slowly, before stopping and wilting away to dust. In just a few moments her failed illusion was over entirely and the clone was left standing free. Clearly this was another failure, but this time the jutsu had at least had some sort of an effect. There was still a ways to go before it was complete, but she was getting closer.

Clearly, it wasn't so much about the amount of chakra but the image she had when enacting the jutsu; imagination really was key in this case. It was overly more complex of an illusion when compared to a giant flaming meteor after all. She figured just one more go might do it, she almost had it now; the needed image was clear in her head she just needed to be able to sustain it. 

With her eyes set and determined, she formed her handseals one last time and directed her jutsu towards the Clone. Things were most definitely different this time, the green sprout appeared almost immediately; growing at a slower rater than it was probably supposed to. Overall, it took several seconds to fully form into a tree, branches winding their way around the clone. The next part was the harder part.

Though she was supposed to dissapear entirely from the view of her clone, she could still be seen; albeit in an unfocused and blurred way. She tried to emerge from the tree trunk and enact her attack on the clone, but it proved much harder than expected. All in all, she could say that she simply couldn't yet do it. However, the elementary part of the technique appeared to have been successful, speed and power would probably come with practice.

With that done, she released the genjutsu and dispersed the clone; pulling out her final scroll in the process. The Genjutsu had taken a significant amount of chakra from her, not so much that she couldn't continue; but enough to warrant a short rest. So she took a seet on the grass and proceeded to read the scroll, pulling out a small bar of chocolate in the process to give herself a little sugar boost.

The jutsu looked like it were a relatively simple one, albeit a few months ago it would've been incredibly difficult for her to learn. It just went to show how far she'd come with her Elemental skill. The scroll seemed to outline the basic technique for Mud Silhouette, albeit with a few fundamental differences. Instead of just leaving the Mud to be used in other jutsu, it was concentrated in front of the user and formed into a large earthen wall.

She'd noticed recently that, although she had plenty of jutsu to help her avoid and dodge, she didn't have many that served purely to block them. This one would prove exceptionally useful in that case, especially for blocking Sution and katon based techniques; two elements that she had the most trouble dealing with. There was also another big difference between this jutsu and Mud silhouette; unlike the latter, it required handseals to perform.

Taking this to mind, she stepped forwards to the nearby wall; deciding to use that as a template in order to help her form the wall at first. She formed the handseals and gathered chakra into her sternum. Spitting out the mud itself was incredibly easy, it was already something she'd practice again and again. As soon as the mud splashed against the ground and wall, she tried to direct it into rising and hardening.

It was actually harder than it seemed, but not so much that she simply couldn't do it. Already, on her first attempt; the mud had begun to rise and harden. However it didn't get much further than knee height before stopping and forcing her to drop the attempt. She surveyed the results and could at least say that she'd definitely made a wall, not that it mattered that it barely reached further than the height of her knees.

Either way, the technique was certainly a failure; unless she decided to fight gnomes all of a sudden. Not one to give up however, she re-formed the handseals and began to spit the stream of mud once more. The mud splashed against the wall she'd made earlier, immediately rising higher and higher; growing harder by the moment. This time, it seemed she was successful in performing the technique and only on her second attempt too. It just went to show how much she needed to work on Genjutsu, compared to her Ninjuts she simply wasn't good with it at all.* - Fri Oct  9 12:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath, surveying her surroundings. It was pretty empty and closed in; perfect for her style. However, she knew Sanoke was extremely fast; far faster than she was able to react. She would have to do this carefully.

Forming a series of handseals, she directed chakra towards the ground; Manipulating the earth to form a Dome. Ordinarily, this would be formed around Sanoke; but Lera put a little twist on it. She formed the dome around herself, completely closing herself in while she could come up with a plan to get Sanoke.* - Fri Oct  9 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hadn't expected him to be able to break the dome in one go, so she never got the chance to enact her simple plan. Instead, the moment she heard and felt the domes imminent destruction; she would channel her chakra and just sink into the ground. With any luck, Sanoke would be confused and unable to discern where she'd vanished to. Once underground, she began moving away; attempting to gain a little more distance.* - Fri Oct  9 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) popped back up above ground once she'd gotten a nice distance away. She immediately formed a single handseal, creating a total of eight clones and showing off her bountiful pools of chakra. She expected Sanoke would have been preparing some sort of defensive measure for her re-appearence, so the clones would attempt to block whatever countermeasure that was.* - Fri Oct  9 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) set her clones into action the moment Sanoke started his method of attack. The four of her clones infront clapped their hands together and took in deep breaths. Once ready, they exhaled in a violent gust; sending a gigantic combined blast of Fuuton towards Sanoke and his clones. The intent was to knock the weapons back and quite possible blow Sanoke's little group on their asses.

To add insult to injury another two of her clones ran through three handseals each and repeated similar actions to the first four. Only, when they exhaled; they released sharp shards of fuuton that would hopefully tear Sanoke's clones apart and maybe even hurt the real Sanoke himself.

Finally, her last two clones took in deep breaths and spat out torrents of mud to cover the entire area in preperation for other attacks. Lera herself watched the onslaught for a few moments before forming her own handseals and breathing out an invisible gaseous substance to spread around the area.* - Fri Oct  9 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: chew on that... - Fri Oct  9 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jumped the moment she saw the turtle, she'd seen that turtle before; not in action sure, but she wasn't about to mess with it. When she jumped, she immediately began to fly hoping to get up to the top of the cliff. It was lucky her skill with the Misty Flames technique wasn't paticularly good, otherwise Sanoke's premature detonation may well have been big enough to catch her. As it was, she ended up with singed feet and a burnt scarf; which was a shame, she liked this scarf.

If she was able to reach to top of the cliff, she'd sit on the side looking down at him; an expression of distate on her face.
