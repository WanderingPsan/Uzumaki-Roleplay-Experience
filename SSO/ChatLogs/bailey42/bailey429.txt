<br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He already fought me once - Wed Sep 23 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep breath, looking sideways at Seisuke as he finished learning his jutsu. She was slightly impressed with that jutsu, it looked like it could be quite useful; but she pushed that thought to the side and focused on the jutsu at hand. She was extremely close and she knew it, she almost wanted to use her clones again but knew that another session with them would just mean passing out.

So for now, she practiced by herself. She could already produce a spark now and although she didn't realise it, she'd also gained the experience from the two clones earlier. When she opened up her palm to practice, she was surprised to see that she was able to summon a spark without much difficulty. With a little smile playing over her lips, she drew back her hand and went as if to throw something.

The spark appeared once more, igniting a ball of flame in her palm. As soon as she hit the peak of her throw, the flames flew outwards and landed on the floor. The explosion was less explosive than she expected, but then the jutsu was far from mastered. Instead of exploding, the flames spread outwards on contact; setting the damn grass a light.* - Wed Sep 23 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned into him, letting her head rest against his chest.

"I think all of it is useful"* - Wed Sep 23 12:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm always ready if its with you~ - Wed Sep 23 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let herself be swept up, putting her arms around his neck. She liked him taking the initiative like this.* - Wed Sep 23 12:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at the scenery with a raised eyebrow, a smile slowly playing across her lips.

"Oh my~ You've outdone yourself."* - Wed Sep 23 12:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) scooted herself closer to Seisuke, squishing her head against his chest.

"Well well, pretty AND isolated. Its almost like you had ulterior motives for bringing me here~"* - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed a little into his chest, only pressing herself closer to enjoy the warmth.

"My my, first the gifts, then this and now the compliments~"* - Wed Sep 23 13:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started to hum under her breath and then turned to singing, she hadn't sung since she'd watched Jin die; so it was nice to let her hobby out once more.* - Wed Sep 23 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leane upwards so she could kiss him, before settling back against his chest.

"Thank you" she spoke with absolute sincerity, feeling better than she had since failing so miserably to stop Erebus.* - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When...when Jin was killed and I couldn't do anything about it. - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I gave up on caring - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You...make me care. - Wed Sep 23 13:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We're kinda silly aren't we. - Wed Sep 23 13:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don't know, if we're silly. - Wed Sep 23 13:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But...I feel as if, as long as I'm with you..I won't regret anything we decide together. - Wed Sep 23 13:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Together till the end? - Wed Sep 23 13:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: No...Not until the end, This is something that'll last forever. - Wed Sep 23 13:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can live with that. - Wed Sep 23 13:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So can I.~ - Wed Sep 23 13:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I love.....y-you Lera. - Wed Sep 23 13:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) flinched as he spoke the words, the last person who'd said that was her mother and many many years ago. She didn't know how to answer him in words, so she merely answered with her actions; letting them speak for her. She took a tight grip on his shirt and kissed him hard, not noticing their new audience.* - Wed Sep 23 13:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) eventually pulled back and settled back into Seisuke's chest, she was still completely unaware of Hassan or his little friend.

"I...didn't know what to say."* - Wed Sep 23 13:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm glad you understood. - Wed Sep 23 13:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm happy, I'm able to spend moments like this with you. - Wed Sep 23 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So am I. - Wed Sep 23 13:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I was thinking....Tomorrow...Maybe I could teach you how to swim...? - Wed Sep 23 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How to...okay, I could learn. - Wed Sep 23 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: D-Did you not want to? - Wed Sep 23 13:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My house is plenty big enough for two. - Wed Sep 23 14:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) returned the kiss with a smile, she was looking forward to not being alone in that big house anymore.

"No...thank you"* - Wed Sep 23 14:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whats the difference? - Wed Sep 23 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The Knowledge focuses on Knowledge of the Gezo Empire, whereas, the Physical could be a number of...Dangerous tasks. Battle Royales...Tournaments. - Wed Sep 23 14:18:14 2015

"You're new, hello there."* - Wed Sep 23 23:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held out a hand.

"Lera, pleasure to meet you"* - Wed Sep 23 23:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Taijutsu huh. Complete opposite of me. - Wed Sep 23 23:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Abraxas Kurina(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Sep 23 23:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh yeah, don't worry. - Wed Sep 23 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I prefer to teach face to face. - Wed Sep 23 23:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh...If you want? - Wed Sep 23 23:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I should go train... - Thu Sep 24 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: What are you going to train? - Thu Sep 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Elements. - Thu Sep 24 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Elements... eh... what kind? - Thu Sep 24 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...haven't quite decided...I'm putting Raiton on hold...My Wind has gone quite far... - Thu Sep 24 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Probably Katon or Doton. - Thu Sep 24 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Wait... you have doton? - Thu Sep 24 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Thu Sep 24 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Some Doton jutsu? - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want the scrolls? - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I can take those. - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can teach you directly as well. - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not really bothered. - Thu Sep 24 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well, which ever best for you. Teaching directly is quicker, and honestly... I'm sick of writting and reading scrolls. - Thu Sep 24 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh sure why not. - Thu Sep 24 17:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm... - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which to teach first... - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Start with the easiest I guess. - Thu Sep 24 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) concentrated on her chakra just a little, show no visible signs of having to use a handseal. Soon, mud was rising around her feet and forming a small river which flowed towards the nearbly wall.

"Mud silhouette....requires no handseals. Focus your chakra on the ground and pull the mud from it to form a river like I just did. You can create bigger ones than this with practice. Also, you can generate mud from your mouth; its quicker but a lot harder. Give it a go."* - Thu Sep 24 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Thu Sep 24 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Straight onto the next. - Thu Sep 24 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) abrupty sank right before Jirun's eyes, rising from the earth right behind him.

"This one a little more difficult. You have to soften the earth into fine sand and allow yourself to sink into it. Once underground you can move around freely and sense, via magnetic force, everything that happens above ground and below it. Try not to get stuck under there eh?"* - Thu Sep 24 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess I'll do some training while I wait... - Thu Sep 24 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or...not. - Thu Sep 24 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad again. - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Looking a little tired. Still good to go? - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I think... uh..uh I could handle one more. - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm...Which one though - Thu Sep 24 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Clones or headhunting... - Thu Sep 24 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Guess clones is the more useful one. - Thu Sep 24 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a single handseal, the tiger seal, and created three perfect replicas of herself from the mud around her feet.

"This one is pretty useful. Not only do the clones constantly self repair, as long as you provide chakra, they can also turn back into mud and bind your opponents. Think of it like an ordinary bunshin, but add your elemental chakra to it and use the mud as a catalyst."* - Thu Sep 24 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Now i'll train. - Thu Sep 24 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pointed herself to the wall and spent a few moments deciding which jutsu she wanted to practice. Though the Doton jutsu was infinitely useful, it took a lot of chakra to perform and would take longer to master. It seemed to be a better idea to practice the Katon jutsu first. For a few moments more, she would open and close her hands; bright red sparks flashing there every time she opened them. The sparks were key for the jutsu to work at all.

Suddenly, she would draw back her arms and thrust them forwards in a throwing motion. With each 'throw' she would let loose a bright ball of flame, shooting them straight for the wall. On impact the balls would explode weakly, spreading flames across the grass and up the wall. The jutsu was a good one, though it could easily be more powerful; she just had to figure out the combo possibilites for it.

Figuring she might as well test that now, she formed one unique and special handseal, summoning a clone from thin air. Unlike usual clones, this one was real living copy of herself. Soon, the clone was pulling back its arms to throw more of the same fireballs; impacting with the walls in their minature explosions. As soon as they hit, the original clapped her hands together and let out a gust of wind from her throat.

The wind slammed into the flames, igniting instantly and turning the small outburst of fire into a wall of red that rose almost halfway up the village walls. Soon she cut off the wind and surveyed the damage with a smile, some lucky someone was going to have to scrub off all that burnt black soot. It wasn't going to be her.* - Thu Sep 24 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm - Thu Sep 24 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tired? - Thu Sep 24 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Uh, Betz - Thu Sep 24 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: heh. Fair enough. - Thu Sep 24 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can make it back? - Thu Sep 24 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or do you need a hand. - Thu Sep 24 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *sigh* - Thu Sep 24 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) summoned two more clones and had them move to grab Jirun by the arms, essentially carrying him back to the mansion.* - Thu Sep 24 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Thank you again. - Thu Sep 24 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) left him by the pillar as he requested and despawned her clones, taking her own seat by the other pillar.

"You're welcome."* - Thu Sep 24 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Ah don't you have more training you would want to do. - Thu Sep 24 18:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My exceptionally large house. - Thu Sep 24 19:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was enjoying this and ironically wasn't totally lieing either, though she didn't have that many carrots.* - Thu Sep 24 19:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) made an obvious show of looking him up and down.

"And I still like what I see~"* - Fri Sep 25 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took his hand carefully, looking down at the water with a little trepidation.

"I've never even tried doing this before..."* - Fri Sep 25 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and made to step forwards into the water. If they both ended up in the water, she'd start clinging onto Seisuke for dear life.* - Fri Sep 25 13:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. Ever so slowly she'd let go of him and take his hands instead. Her legs began to kick as instructed, though she kicked wildly and with no coordination.* - Fri Sep 25 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and started to kick slower with a little more control. It all seemed to be going well until Seisuke started to pull her out further. The moment he did, she lurched forward and grabbed onto him again.* - Fri Sep 25 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gritted her teeth hard, she'd never liked big open bodies of water like this but didn't expect herself to get this terrified. For a moment she relaxes her grip, only to grab his hands even harder. For a while, she forced herself to kick in slow coordinated movements.* - Fri Sep 25 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly build her confidence up, soon loosening her death grip to his hands. She was still scared and it showed, but she was at least getting used to it. Though still oddly silent.* - Fri Sep 25 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a breath through her teeth, she was forcing herself to stay quiet so she didn't burst into tears. Didn't want him to see that. She did however manage to force out a few words.

"A little...c-cold."* - Fri Sep 25 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't let him put her down, instead clinging onto him like a small child.* - Fri Sep 25 14:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) suddenly burst into tearts.

"I was scared!"* - Fri Sep 25 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) just sort've held onto to him until her sobbing calmed down a bit and she could speak normally.

"Its okay....I should've told you I was scared of swimming..."* - Fri Sep 25 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and pulled her clothes back on, instantly starting to feel better.

"I thought I could do it...I didn't want you to see that.."* - Fri Sep 25 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hugged him back tightly, she didn't totally agree with him but it was nice to be cared for like this either way. Eventually she would pull back and give him a kiss.* - Fri Sep 25 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just stick with me~ - Fri Sep 25 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll definately will.~ - Fri Sep 25 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don' - Fri Sep 25 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on the ground and unfurled the scroll, another gift from Seisuke. It was almost like he was trying to groom her for something, not that she minded learning new more powerful jutsu. After a quick skim through the scroll, she could immediately see it was another complicated one; no way she could've learned this without her knowledge of Doton jutsu. She took her time reading commiting everything to memory as best she could.

Soon, she had a good idea of what the jutsu was supposed to do. A powerful Doton jutsu, made to summon a dragon of earth and fire several bullets composed of mud. She also took note of the jutsu's footnote, that it could be combined with a katon jutsu to fire heated rocks instead. A jutsu like this would probably take a lot of her chakra, she would have to make an effort to increase her pools at this rate; something she'd never considered necessary until now. It just went to show how much she was improving.

Finally feeling that she'd read enough, she picked the scroll back up and folded it up neatly; tucking it away inside a hidden pocket. Most of her jutsu scrolls were stored safely in her home, with just a few lining the hidden pockets of her jacket. She wondered if she might be able to make a living off creating scrolls and then selling them to the highest bidder. She'd never wanted for money before, but the money could go towards buying even better scrolls.

With everything ready, she decided to first create a large puddle of mud around her; expelling it in large quantities from her mouth. It probably wouldn't be necessary unless not in the presence of earth, but for now it would be easier to use pre-existing mud; rather than generate it using a jutsu she had never tried before.

Taking a deep breath, she ran her hands through the handseals and focused her attentions on the mud in front of her. This jutsu required some form of shape manipulation, something she'd managed in small feats but never using Doton before. Thankfully, she had a good image of a dragons head due to Seisuke's summons; which was at least something. So using that as a catalyst, she channeled her chakra towards the mud and tried to force it to take that shape.

The mud seemed to quiver and rise, slowly forming a mishapen head of some sorts. The features became sharper for just a moment before the entire thing simply collapsed. It was surprsing though, she hadn't expected to accomplish that on the first try. If she could shape the dragons head, then she would work on the next step of actually having it fire bullets.* - Fri Sep 25 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was shocked to feel how little her attempt had drained her, she had expected to use significantly more damage. However, now that she had attempted the jutsu once; she realised that it would be impossible to use without first creating the required mud for it. It matter little to her however, knowing that she could simply have a clone create all the mud she required first.

Forming her handseals again, she directed her chakra to the mud once more; surprised at how easy it seemed to be forming the dragons head. This time, she formed it and it retained its shape perfectly for as long as she held it with chakra. It either meant she was getting much better at using her jutsu or the jutsu was much easier than she originally assumed.

Now she focused on having it fire bullets as the jutsu was intended for. Directing her attentions to the innards of the head, she had it form the bullets and open its mouth; using the chakra contained within it to expel those bullets at high speeds. It was nothing like what the jutsu could be if she spent time mastering it, but she was impressed with herself to have learned it so quickly and with so much chakra left over. She could now focus her attentions of practicing other jutsu.* - Fri Sep 25 18:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a special handseal, unique and not one of the usual twelve; she made sure he could see it before she initialised the jutsu. Soon there were two real copies of herself, perfect down to the smallest features.

"Its sort of like a bunshin, but instead of just making a fake shell of chakra to fool people. This one is a real, breathing physical representation of you. It bleeds, feels and can even relay information back to you when its destroyed. Though...be careful, you also get whatever exhaustion the clone had when you disperse it. Anyway....I can't really explain how its done, but the handseal has a a lot to do with it I think. Just give it a go."* - Fri Sep 25 19:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Fri Sep 25 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to the wall, having her two clones turn with her. She intended to practice several jutsu at once, with the intention of testing her combo techniques. She started off with her latest aquisition, intent on combining it with Exploding flame shot and a wind jutsu for good measure. The original would stand back, creating a river of mud for her use first; it was a shame that Earth Dragon Bullet required her to use Mud Silhouette first, though with her clones it didn't matter so much.

Once the mud was prepared, she formed the three necessary handseals; focusing her attentions on the mud infront of her. While she did that, her first clone would be preparing to use Exploding flame shot; bright red spark forming on the center of its palms. The second was gathering chakra in order to use great breakthrough, if this combination worked as she intended it; the effect would hopefully be quite devastating.

As soon as she was ready, she initiated the jutsu; having a large dragon head rise from the mud and subsequently open its mouth. Her first clone suddenly plunged its hands into the back on the dragons head; adding the exploding flame shot to the deadly mix inside of the dragon. Soon after, the head fired its load off towards the wall. She was happy to see the slightly flaming, extremely heated rock; rocket off at high speeds.

The rocks struck the wall, leaving large cracks and spreading fire. As soon as this happened, the second clone would clap its hands together and thrust them outwards; expelling an extremely large gust of wind towards the bullets just as they impacted. The wind chakra smashed into the wall; catching the flames as they spread and causing an exponential ignition.

Flames spread across the wall in all directions, coating the area in a bright orange hue. She seemed happy to note that this technique might have even been enough to damage someone like Erebus. It was a powerful combination, though it needed time and a lot of chakra to initiate; even now she could feel the drain on her chakra, though it wasn't enough to cause exhaustion.

There was still one more combination to test and would probably be the easiest for her to emply, albeit it would take significantly more chakra to initiate. Her two clones stood by ready to use their jutsu at a moments notice. For this one to really be effective, she needed to be quick and efficient in its use; the faster it happened the more likely it would work well in a battle.

Taking in a deep breath, she sent her clones running fowards; picking a spot where a large rock was sat. She used this rock as her target for the upcoming jutsu. As quickly as possible, she formed a single handseal and directed her chakra towards the ground beneath the rock. Soon, a dome sprang from the earth and formed over the rock; a slight opening sat on the top for her to attack through.

At this point, her clones were already relatively close to the dome and had jumped to land on top of it. The first formed a string of five handseals and began blowing a steady stream of fire into the dome. The second clapped its hands together and also began blowing into the dome; only with wind instead of fire. The moment it did, the flames leapt up; filling the dome and sending a column of fire upwards and out of the opening.

The clones were not fast enough to react to this, destroying themselves in the process using the combination. The flames continued for a moment, with lera sure that any human caught in something like this would be consumed relatively quickly. As soon as the flames died down, she let the dome crumble away and took a look at her targets Condition.

The rock was glowing a cherry red, though that soon died down; revealing multiple cracks and damage caused by extreme levels of heat. She let a little smile play over her lips before having to sit down, the amount of chakra used for all this was no joke; proving she needed to somehow increase her pools, but that could wait for later. For now, she enjoyed herself watching Seisuke train.* - Fri Sep 25 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood still for a few moments, forming her hands into a single handseal. As she concentrated, mud sprang up from the ground at her feet and formed circles around her; before flowing off towards the nearby wall.

"Mud silhouette is good for destabilizing your enemy. You have to draw the mud from the ground and set it off towards your opponnent. You can also expel the mud from your mouth, but its much harder; albeit faster. Also, a handseal isn't really necessary, but it helps."* - Sat Sep 26 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed just one handseal, directing her chakra towards the mud they'd both already created. Soon a perfectly formed copy of herself rose from the mud, taking a stand next to her.

"Treat it like the basic Bunshin, but add elemental chakra to it as well. The mud clone can regenerate if damaged, as long as you supply chakra. It can also bind opponents in mud from its own body."* - Sat Sep 26 06:29:32 2015
