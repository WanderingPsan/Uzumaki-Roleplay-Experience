<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned and stepped into the girl, resting both arms voer her shoulders.

"And what did you think?~"* - Wed Oct 21 13:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her eyebrows, but returned the kiss; it was pretty clear what Violet wanted and Lera was more than happy to give it. When she leaned back to bite her lip, she just couldn't hold back anymore.

"Oh man...when you look like that..."

She lunged forwards, grabbing the girl around the waist and running off with her; at this rate, they would end up in a bush if she didn't get home soon.* - Wed Oct 21 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) practically tore the clothes off her body the moment she ran through the door, they weren't going to make it to the bed; it was simply too far away. It went without saying that she wasn't exactly gentle, but she wasn't so rough in a way that would hurt Violet. As soon as her clothes were off, she was kissing Violet passionately, little low moans escaping through her mouth.

It wasn't just the need, it was the anticipation; when she finally pulled away, she sat on the sofa leaving herself open to Violets every whim.* - Wed Oct 21 13:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll They must have spent hours together like this, going far longer than any man would. By the end of it, Lera lay panting next to violet; arms wrapped lazily around the woman, the only thing on her face was sheer bliss. 

"I'm so glad I have you Violet...I love you."* - Wed Oct 21 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was tired as well, but she was more than content to lay stroking Violets hair; she felt right for the first time in months.* - Wed Oct 21 13:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Thats true enough, as long as we both aknowledge it - Wed Oct 21 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm! - Wed Oct 21 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: I need to retire...Bah, what am I saying.... - Wed Oct 21 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat sipping her tea, several hundred metres above the village. She casually floated in the sky, 'sitting' on thin air as if it were the most natural thing to be doing right now. She liked getting an arial view of the village, it gave her an appreciation for just how small things really were. The village rebuild process was coming along nicely, things were still a mess but it was slowly getting better. Their even seemed to be more shinobi around the village, which was a bonus.

She did have another reason for being up here, though she could fly; she could not fly and fight at the same time. She was up here to rectify that. Right now, she was still not able to split her concentration and perform ninjutsu while she was flying; but she could make up for that with her weapon. Going for the hilt, she lifted the weapon from her back; appraising all the various bits of damage to it. She couldn't see this thing lasting for more than a few weeks at the rate she was going.

Various nicks and chips extended up the edge of the blade, she could even see signs of superficial cracks running into the metal. The sheer amount of swings she'd made against the trees had left the weapon in quite the sorry state. She would have to see about getting a proper blade to practice and fight with. She knew the Samehada to have a fickle personality, even with her monumental pools of chakra; it would take time to win it over. She couldn't just run into battle with it straight off the bat.

Still in the air, she started to perform basic excercises; trying several different stances with the weapon and varying her 'attacks'. She quickly noted the several advantages and disadvantages of attacking in flight. For one, she had greater speed whilst flying and much greater maneuvaribility. It was much easier to twist her body and attack in a way that just wasn't possible on the ground. However, due to her lighter body and the fact that she couldn't use the ground to stabilize. The strength of her attacks were reduced considerably.

Even with the disadvantage of having much less strength, she felt as if it didn't really make that huge of a difference. If she was using a blade like Samehada, it didn't really matter if her attacks held strength or not. A direct hit would mean the absorption of the victims chakra, chakra that would be passed onto her. Theoretically, as long as her stamina lasted; she could fight with an infinite amount of chakra. She already had pools on a level that could possibly be far above everyone elses, with samehada those pools could be never ending.

She had to put a stop to that line of thought though, she couldn't afford to get complacent in her training now; there was still a very long way to go and her future goals were quickly multiplying. She was aware now that Kirie wanted to lead the Seven swordsmen of the mist, Lera didn't have any intentions to let that happen however. She had nothing against Kirie, but It was Lera's ambition to lead the new generation of swordsmen for Kirigakure and she trusted noone else to do it. After she'd mastered Samehada, she intended to retrieve the remaining blades from Fujitora and find suitable candidates for their use.

Her eventual goal still lay in taking the title of Mizukage, but she had no intentions to ursurp that position from Kirie; plus she didn't feel ready to commit herself into protecting an entire village. As leader of the seven swordsmen, she would have far more freedom to travel and to perform tasks as she saw fit; she would not be bound to the position of kage, not yet at least. In reality, it was probably a little farfetched for a genin to be thinking of such things. Yet, she didn't paticularly feel like a genin anymore; in fact, she considered herself to be closer to a Jounin rather than genin.

Lera wouldn't have passed up a promotion if it came her way, but as a genin she was quite often underestimated by those who didn't know her and that suited her just fine. Most people looked at a genin and saw them as weak, but Lera knew better. Lera knew that the rank meant very little when it came to battle, in reality; kirie was not much stronger than Lera, if not on the same level. The only reason Kirie had won in their previous spar, was because the woman had chosen specifically to fight on water; essentially locking away Lera's greatest form of defense.

However, even with that; Lera could have easily flown to greater heights and then simply combusted. Kirie's hair would have burned and then she would have fallen to her death, not that Lera had any intention of doing such a thing. With a sigh, she slowly began floating herself back down to ground level; until she landed just on the outskirts. The few villagers that saw her didn't even bat an eye had her strange arrival, they were used to this little genin flying around the village; very little surprised them anymore.

While she made her way towards her usual training ground, she thought of the various way she could choose to train. After seeing Baen's odd little ability, she more or less guessed that he would specialise in close combat, most like taijutsu or kenjutsu. That would make him an excellent sparring partner for her current line of training, though she worried that he was the type to take things too far; her certainly seemed that way. Truthfully, she saw him as a problem; someone who could threaten a life just because he didn't get his way.

Even with this though, she knew that the village needed everyone they could get; with things going the way they were, even the village idiot was a necessary addition. She soon reached her training area, greeted by several fallen trees and a few more that looked as if they were about to join them. This was the reason her blade was in such bad shape. The weapon she used had only been made for practice, it was blunt and basically impossible to cut with; but it was also heavy, causing quite a bit of damage with every strike.

The trees were a testament to that fact and also a testemant to just how much she'd been practicing. It took a lot of hits to bring a tree down with this thing, yet she'd practiced to the point where the trees shattered and fell. This training could only go on for so much longer, the blade having only been made for basic practice; repeated strikes with it were taking their toll. She turned to the tree she'd recently been practicing on and drew her blade into an immediate swing. She was greeted by yet another chip of metal flying off the weapon as it slammed into bark.

She lacked the care for whether the weapon was broken or not, once it had served its purpose then it would be useless; she silently hoped it would at least last until her training was complete though. Perhaps once she was done, she could take it to a blacksmith to have it repaired or maybe even turned into a proper blade. Perhaps then, when she found a suitable successor to her as the wielder of Samehada; she could pass this blade onto them and they onto whoever they chose to train. It was a nice thought, if she could create a lasting tradition...

Either way, that was many years into the future and thruthfully she quite liked the idea of passing her legacy onto Nina. Though Nina was old enough to start creating her own legacy, rather than taking on Lera's. Soon, she fell into her usual rythm; pull back, swing, pull back, swing. She alternated from either side of the tree, her muscles straining from the effort of swinging the blade constantly. However, the strain was no-where near as bad as it was; she felt herself improving with every day that passed, perhaps she would even master the samehada within a month or two.

It was starting to feel like a competition, Kirie had stated she would master her blade in three months; Lera felt the need to beat her to it, to master hers within two. It was impossible to know how far Kirie had gone with her training so far, she could be close to mastering her blade; but then Lera knew her blade to be just as large as the Samehada, if not more so. Which meant Kirie would have to master the use of large weapons first and Lera had seen no evidence of her even attempting to do so.

After swing number one thousand, the various blisters and cracks on her hands split open again; coating the hilt in sticky blood. She knew she was pushing it to far, going to the point where the skin on her palms cracked and split open. She couldn't afford to sit around though, there were shinobi around getting stronger all the time and she would not be left behind. She did stop however, just to create a clone and have it wrap her palms in protective bandages. Afterwards, she flexed her fingers; finding that she still moved and functioned as normal.

As long as her hands still worked it didn't matter, as long as she could still form handseals; she would never be defenseless. Even then, she had several techniques that simply did not need handseals; a few of which were quite potent. No, she had come a very long way from the shy little girl she'd been all those years ago. It was difficult to imagine how she'd been so shy and innocent of the world, it was sad though; how children had to grow so much harder and faster in this world. She'd seen the way some of the surviving children looked in the village, some had lost their entire families. She wanted to create a village where no child would have that look ever again.

To reach that goal, she need to keep training; keep training until her hands were broken, keep training until she could barely even stand. Violet would tell her off, she was sure; but there was no stopping, no room to rest. In the end, she would never be able to protect the things she loved if she didn't force herself to surpass the limits. When she reached her goal, al the pain and suffering will have been worth it. Her training came to a sudden halt when she heard the snaps of twigs behind her, the sounds of someone...lots of someones moving through the forest around her.

With a little sigh, she lowered her weapon and turned her gaze around the area. She wasn't surprised to see shadowy figures, crudely attempting to quietly surround her. She supposed this is what happened when she trained a lone in the forest, their were bound to be bandits around to take advantage of Kirigakures current plight. However, she found herself pleasently surprised when one of the figures stepped out of the woods and into the light. They'd seen that she'd already noticed them and had stepped out to confront her.

She squinted at him for a few moments, her eyes roving over his face and body; taking in the black smock and the white strip underneath his collar. She'd seen the guy before for definite, but where? Then it hit her like a lightning bolt. Several months ago, while she'd still been in Kirigakure; a group of religious fantatics had blindsided her and taken her to their 'cave'. She had of course escaped easily, making sure to kill their leader on the way out; she figured by killing the figure head behind them they'd give up and disperse. Apparently not.

Back then, she'd been much softer; sparing the members of the group during her escape.This time, unless they were here peacefully, they wouldn't be spared. Judging by the cruel glint in this 'priests' eye, there was no intention for peace here. He looked her body up and down, dragging his dry tongue over his lips; she could almost see the anticipation on his face. They weren't here to kill her, oh no...he had a -very- different sort of idea on his mind. After he'd gotten a good look at her body, he finally opened his mouth to talk.

"We finally found the heathen brothers! Let us do unto her as she did unto our father! She will bare the children of our tribe just as our great father proclaimed!" a series of cheers went up around her, giving her a better idea of just how many people she dealt with. By her estimate, there were about ten of then, probably all untrained civilians; no threat to her as long as she was careful. Still, she had to at least give them a chance to leave; though the leader had no chances "I'm giving you all a choice, run the fuck away or die just like...this.."

As she finished her sentence, she lunged forwards; jabbing her great sword forward and right into the 'priests' neck. There was a sickening snap as the priests neck broke and he vomited forth a fountain of blood. Thankfully, he didn't die instantly; she wanted the bastard to suffer as much as possible, to pay for his disgusting thoughts. While the priest lay twitching on the floor, she raised her voice to the surrounding idiots "Run now or suffer the same fate, I promise...it will hurt."

A series of mutters rose up from the men around her, before they seemed to make their decisions; stepping towards her with cruel smirks, they obviously thought ten against one was good odds. They were wrong. With a sigh, she lunged into action; her entire body bursting in flame along with her weapon. She slammed it point first into the chest of the nearest man, she felt his ribs give way underneath jab; he might have survived the strike as well if not for the flames suddenly spreading over his body. She made sure to keep up to her promise, every one that died would die slowly and painfully.

The moment the first man went down, she was already swinging her weapon into the second one. It slammed into the side of his chest, caving it in on the side; luckily for him, his lung collapsed before he burned to death. By this point, her assailants had finally realised just how screwed they were. Two of them were down before they even had a chance to react and they couldn't even touch her without catching fire; just like last time, they underestimated her. This time, they would pay for that with their lives.

A few of the less intelligent ones began to run, the one who didn't realised that they would never be able to escape and instead attacked with whatever they had to hand. First she dealt with the runners, instead choosing to block and dodge to pointless attacks. One even tried to punch her, but was rewarded by setting his own fist on first; the last she was of him was a burning figure desperately trying to put the flames out. With eyes dead set on the runners, she quickly threw three balls of fire; watching as each ball slammed into the backs of the would be escapees.

She didn't allow the balls to explode, that would kill them to fast; instead she had the flames ignite all over their bodies, leaving them to a slow and painful death by fire. Truthfully, Lera did not enjoy killing; nor did she enjoy inflicting pain, what she'd said to the monk had been completely true. However, people like this deserved everything that came to them; she didn't fight for revenge, she fought for all the innocents who'd suffered under people like this. With six now dead or dieing, that only left four more to deal with; four who were quickly realising that they had no way of getting out of this.

Two of them attacked her, swinging wildly with knives in a brazen attempte to inflict some damage. They were foolish to even try, her oversized sword was made for fights like this. She simply made for a wide swing, slamming it into the side of one and then carrying the swing on so it struck the second person to. The first man choked on his own blood, due to internal damage. The second however was no writhing in pain, flames coating his body. This only left the final two men, both of which had given up and fallen to their knees before her.

One of them looked resigned, the other was openly crying and begging with her to spare his life. She stared at the pair for a long time, before putting out her flames and speaking in a stern voice "You two are to report to Kirigakure, you are to help the builders and villagers in any way possible. You will earn your forgiveness with sweat. However...I'm watching you both. If I hear or see anything that you're not supposed to do, you're dead. Got that?" she'd never seen two people move so quickly, they hastily nodded their agreement and ran off towards the village. It left her at least a little relieved, she'd not had to kill them all after all.* - Wed Oct 21 16:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Rather than my elements. - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Yes. But incase you don't feel comfortable. - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: We can use Bokken's. - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I highly doubt there are Bokkens this size - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Yeah.. - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: They aren't... - Wed Oct 21 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, lets do it. In any case, i'd like to test something. - Wed Oct 21 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: I suppose we will use the real deal? -Sure. - Wed Oct 21 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Do not hold back. - Wed Oct 21 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hefted the weapon in one hand, lifting it with an ease that completely went against her small body. She was much stronger than she looked.

"Do you want to start then?"* - Wed Oct 21 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I wonder how well this will work... - Wed Oct 21 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had more than enough time to crack her neck from side to sides, he was much slower than anticipated; she'd actually imagined at least a decent amount of speed, he must have been really fresh out of the academy. As he was nearing, she took a casual step forwards before crouching down and then jumping. She flew over the man, almost floated actually, spinning in mid air to slam the flat of her blade against his back. Due to the technique she was using and the fact that she did hold back, the attack would likely just push him forwards.

She gave more than ample time to recover from her blow, while she floated a few inches off the floor apparently 'standing' on mid-air.* - Wed Oct 21 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled sweetly at him, the first reaction to her ability to fly was always the most fun.

"Yep, this is what I wanted to test, to see if I could fight and fly at the same time...now, defend yourself!"

With a slight motion from her foot, she lunged forward; blade extended outwards with one hand. The intend was to slam the blunt point into his chest, something she expected he would be more than capable of defending against. Her weapon was by no means sharp however, nor was it durable. Already it was covered in dents and chips from her excessive training.* - Wed Oct 21 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't defend her blade and fly at the same time, so she touched back to the ground and began flowing chakra through the weapon. It quickly hardened, preventing his attack from damaging it so much. She couldn't afford to have her blade damaged just yet, especially when she was getting used to using it as a shield.

Either way, the blade was disbalanced; pushing it to the side ever so slightly, however she used that momentum to spin her entire body and aim her foot towards his chest. She liked his combat style, but couldn't help but think just how much more impressive it would be if he wielded a weapon like hers. If her attack was successful, she'd wait to recieve more attacks; with the intent to test yet another technique of hers.* - Wed Oct 21 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (Well, I'm training for Samehada. But shhhhh. Thats a big secret) - Wed Oct 21 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: NICEE!) - Wed Oct 21 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: and you can do it cause your chakra Gene) - Wed Oct 21 17:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (yuppers, I will actually have Bijuu level chakra eventually. Serene state practically doubles chakra. Funnily enough, the most you'd normaly get to is about 9k. Chakra gene is so OP) - Wed Oct 21 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: It is I wish I had it) - Wed Oct 21 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) whispers: Even though I dont use nin) - Wed Oct 21 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (yeah, the genes can really make a big difference. - Wed Oct 21 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt a little bad, she'd never once in her entire life been faster than someone; even her daughter was faster than her, it was a nice feeling to have the upper hand for once. Despite feeling bad, she wanted to test her close combat techniques in ever aspect; thought the Fire shroud she would leave out for now.

The darkened colour of her blade waned off, instead somehow spreading to her hand and then through her entire body. Eventually her skin had taken on a darker colour, while she waited for Daisuke to recover.* - Wed Oct 21 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath, batting the sheath he'd thrown to the side. The real test came when she decided to take his attack, she didn't block it with her sword or attempt to dodge it. Instead, she attempted to catch it on her wrist. She was very much hoping to not lose an arm here and thankfully her hopes came through. His sword slammed into her arm, sounding akin to steel striking against condensed stone. She remained completely undamaged however.

She hadn't really intended to show off in this fight, but now she wanted to show Daisuke how far he had to go. Unlike Kirie, she wasn't soft with the people she helped train; she fully believed that overpowering someone completely only served to help them grow.

With a swipe of her arm, she attempted to push his blade away; scraping it against her steel hard skin without so much as a scratch. In such close quarters, her large weapon was mostly useless. So instead, she lifted it so the blade was between them and then pushed hard against the flat side of her blade. The intent was to slam steel into his body and throw him away once more.* - Wed Oct 21 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded as if she was affirming something she already knew, he was determined and that was enough for her. She slid the blade back onto her back and deactivated her armour, taking a few steps forward towards him.

"Not bad. You're determined, thats good."* - Wed Oct 21 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Keep practicing and ask Violet for training, she's the best swordsman in this village. - Wed Oct 21 17:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You think I got this far by training alone? - Wed Oct 21 17:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Daisuke(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But I am not like the others, I don't want others techniques, or their legacy. If I am to obtain perfection... - Wed Oct 21 17:53:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: No, I want you... - Thu Oct 22 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was exceedingly turned on by this, it was beginning to get to a point where she wouldn't care if they did it right here; right in front of the mansion. Her hands snaked down, gripping tightly on Violets ass.

"That makes two of us then...I'm already all yours..." they probably just weren't going to make it somewhere private this time, so she gave into her need and firmly planted lips against Violets.* - Thu Oct 22 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't waste any time, the moment Violet spoke the word; she grabbed her around the waste and jumped. The pair sailed over the mansion, landing lightly just in front of the water fall. With a mischevious grin, she let violet stand on her own and walked through to the other side of the water fall. As soon as she was on the other side, she stripped off and waited expectently for violet.* - Thu Oct 22 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had her hands everywhere, the adrenaline running on overdrive. Absolutely anyone could just walk it at any second and she found that...exciting. She showed just how excited she was when they really got going, it had to be said; Lera wasn't very good at holding herself back.* - Thu Oct 22 13:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had tried something new with this one, it wasn't just herself laying with Violet; there were approximately five of her all laying near violet in some way. Clones were definitely useful in more ways than one...

"That was...I don't have words..."* - Thu Oct 22 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a bit and then clicked her fingers, all of her clones promptly vanished and she pulled on top of of her, so the girls head rested on her breast.* - Thu Oct 22 14:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe...how long did we go this time? It all sort've blurs...by. - Thu Oct 22 14:19:44 2015
