<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats okay, its just means that I can teach you quite a few jutsu. - Sat Sep 19 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with the easiest. - Sat Sep 19 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood at the edge of the water and formed just one handseal, whilst gathering the chakra on her palm. With the chakra gathered she thrust it forward and released a torrent of wind. The stream was steady and lasted for several seconds before cutting off.

"This technique is called Godly wind from the Mountains....a mouthful I know. You can release it from either your mouth or your hands, whichever is easiest for you. Just remember to keep the wind in a tight focus, don't let it spread orthewise its more or less useless."* - Sat Sep 19 02:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll pracitce while you learn. - Sat Sep 19 02:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a few steps away from the girl, figuring it would be a good time to practice her own jutsu. With a deep sigh, she held the fingers of her hand straight; forming them into a sort of blade. Wind chakra was quickly concentrated at the tips of her fingers, sharpening them to the highest degree. Though the wind was barely visible to the naked eye, simple survival instinct told everyone who happened to look, not to get close those fingers.

For the sake of practice, she wandered up to a nearby stone; drawing her hand so she could jab it forward. Her jabs weren't paticularly fast, nor was her Taijutsu skill very good; if anything it looked like she were a child holding the sharpest blade. With every jab her fingers pierced the stone, leave deep finger shaped holes behind. She still wasn't quite good enough so that her fingers pierced perfectly every time and soon enough her fingers were starting to hurt. She took that as an indication to stop and it looked like Alice had finished anyway.* - Sat Sep 19 02:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Sat Sep 19 02:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not a problem with me - Sat Sep 19 02:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded and turned back towards the water, this time forming several more handseals; five in total. She made sure that Alice could see each and every one. The wind gathered in her palm exactly as before, in fact it looked like a carbon copy of Godly wind at this rate. However, when she thrust her palm forwards and released the wind; a huge gale blasted out. Smashing into the water and sending it flying everywhere.

"This is very similar to godly wind, however instead of releasing the wind as a slow stream. You let it all out in one single blast. Its a powerful jutsu and with enough mastery you can forgo the handseals entirely and perform it with just a clap."* - Sat Sep 19 02:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out a kunai from her holster and held it out so Himura could see, with a little bit of focus on the blade it would abruptly burst into flames.

"It looks simple but its not quite that easy. Treat the object in question as an extension of your arm and include it in your flow of chakra. It works differently for everyone, but thats how I do it."* - Sat Sep 19 02:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a couple of shuriken from her pocket, as well as forming the needed handseals (I can't remember how many). Fuuton chakra gathered around the shuriken, causing them to float upwards and hover around Lera whilst spinning. Then she made some motions with her hands, causing the shuriken to shoot off in curves and zigzags before coming back to land at her feet.

"This is a useful one, You won't be able to do this straight away so for now; just imagine the path you want the shuriken to take. Guide it rather than control it."* - Sat Sep 19 02:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started to walk towards the water fall and jump off onto the water below.* - Sat Sep 19 03:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. I'll practice alone then. - Sat Sep 19 06:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat herself down against the wall and straightened the fingers of her right hand. She would have to spend her time practicing her jutsu, in this case she simply focused Fuuton chakra to the tips of her four fingers and then let it go; repeating the process over and over.* - Sat Sep 19 06:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Right. . . - Sat Sep 19 06:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) could feel herself getting close to a point where she could consider her hellstab technique mastered, now when she pierced rocks with the technique there was no pain in her fingers. The rocks that dotted the area around her were each full of holes and gashes; as if someone had repeatedly struck them with an immensely sharp weapon. Now that she seemed to be getting better with the technique, she wanted to see if she could demolish one of the rocks.

It took much less concentration to turn the technique on, she merely needed to focus for a few moments and her fingers would become a blade of immense power. With her skill getting better, the blade on her fingers was becoming more visible. If one stared at it for long enough, the shimmer of Fuuton surrounding her fingers could be seen. Ending it sharp nano-points at the tips of each finger.

She was happy with her progress, but with her new found drive to gain strength; it wasn't enough and she knew it. Until she was capable of killing someone like Zetsumo, there was to be no rest for her. Moving forwards, she came closer to one of the rocks; the larger of the ones scattered about. This one had yet to recieve her attacks, but that was going to change now.

Pulling back her arm, she would suddenly jab it forwards; sinking her fingers into the hard rock as if it were nothing more than butter. Her Taijutsu technique may not have been good, but her weapon more than made up for that. With just a single graze against her enemies skin and they would find themselves ripped open.

Lately, she realised, she was beginning to ignore the advice given to Jin so long ago. She had told him not to harden his emotions, someone who couldn't see the fear in battle and death would become no better than Zetsumo himself. Yet now she found herself wanting nothing more then to forget those emotions that hurt to much to think about. Instead, she would give her all into protecting the village, protecting the people who lived in it. If she died doing so, then so be it.

Whilst lost in her thought, she had been jabbing away at the rock; slowly breaking the thing apart piece by piece. She didn't yet have the same power with her techniques as Hassan did, but not for lack of trying. With a single swing of her fingers, she would shear off a large chunk; causing stone to cascade onto the ground with a crunch.

With a little smile, she surveyed the damage done. The rock had definitely seen better days, it was no dotted with hole; chunks had been sliced from it and it was slowly being reduced to rubble. While she looked, she'd deactivate the jutsu and take a short rest; even with her large chakra pools, she still got tired.* - Sat Sep 19 07:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sat Sep 19 07:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right.. - Sat Sep 19 07:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished up her rest turning back towards the rock. While she'd been resting an idea had come to her, it could either go badly for her or give her a new weapon to use in battle. First, she formed a few handseals and spewed out some fire onto the ground; the flames stayed there, burning with the apparent need for no fuel. Then, she leaned down to the water and dipped her fingers into it; making sure they were completely soaked through.

Then came the more dangerous part. Her fingers were quickly formed into a blade, the Fuuton chakra settling on her fingertips with a wicked gleam. Her idea was a simple one, she knew that Fuuton chakra was generaly very flamable; if she dipped her fuuton coated fingers in flame, then that would give her an incredibly sharp flaming blade. That was the plan anyway, she'd soaked her fingers in water before; purely because it would stop her from getting burned, at least for a few moments.

Taking in a deep breath, she swung her fingers to the side; trying not to wince as they entered the hot flames. Though she couldn't help but smile when she seemed to slice through the flames themselves, it showed she was making very good progress. Soon however, her fingers were ignited; the Fuuton chakra quickly going up. She wasted no time in pulling her fingers out and slamming them into the rock.

As her jab flew, it would be leaving behind a short trail of flames; with the fuuton chakra now alight, the 'blade' was clearly visible. Her fingers ending in impossibley sharp bright points. Moments after, her fingers slammed into the rock; sinking down right up to her wrist. She kept a straight face as cracks spread from the point she'd struck, flames traveling along them and all around the rock. On the inside however, she was cheering; even if she tried to act down and serious now, she couldn't keep the excitable bubbly part of her down completely.

As she pulled her hand away, she noted that the flames had been extinguished along with the Fuuton jutsu. Her hand itself only looked a little reddened, without a single burn in sight. The rock was significantly worse off, it quickly crumbled away; the damage to great for it to hold together anymore. It was good to know that she had a new weapon to use, though she could only use it if it was sure to hit. It would definitely burn her otherwise. Nodding to herself, she took a seat on the ground and had another break. The training was going well.* - Sat Sep 19 07:36:19 2015

"From today we're no longer together. I was stupid to think this was possible. We live in different worlds Seisuke, what you said before opened my eyes. Good bye."

With that, she turned to jump from the cliff and land on the water below; slowly walking away.* - Sat Sep 19 07:53:23 2015
