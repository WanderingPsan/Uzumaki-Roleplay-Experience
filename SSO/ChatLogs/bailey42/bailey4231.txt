<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As for the other, I was thinking Koji...and none at all. - Sun Nov  8 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know what he's like. - Sun Nov  8 10:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I did. - Sun Nov  8 10:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . . That is a good pick. Trying to think of who else would be better. - Sun Nov  8 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I did consider Mirai, but she doesn't want to. - Sun Nov  8 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That isn't her thing. I can talk to her about -- But Koji is more powerful anyway. - Sun Nov  8 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. I figured. - Sun Nov  8 10:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mashai(Novaraven747) thinks: How childish.. - Sun Nov  8 10:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Eh....like I said, this shinobi stuff isn't for me but it's necessary for me to help people. - Sun Nov  8 10:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Heh, thank you. - Sun Nov  8 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mashai(Novaraven747) thinks: That reminds me.. I'll need to fit Takuro out with an outer shell that looks like me at somepoint..  - Sun Nov  8 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You remind me a lot of how I used to be. - Sun Nov  8 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ahh...those were the good days. - Sun Nov  8 10:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Thank you, Lera. - Sun Nov  8 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But why, though? - Sun Nov  8 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You're very welcome. - Sun Nov  8 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Is um... Sanoke always such an ..... ass? - Sun Nov  8 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Bah, whatever. I'm going to assume that it's just some secret battle style. - Sun Nov  8 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well...I wouldn't call him an ass...he's quite the joker though. I wouldn't take him seriously. - Sun Nov  8 10:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Can't keep you serious anymore can I now? - Sun Nov  8 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Oh dear, You got me again?? Damn... - Sun Nov  8 10:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Jeez. I'll just have to try my hardest to stay serious... - Sun Nov  8 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put on a comical frown, pouting her lips while she stared at Kiyoko.* - Sun Nov  8 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hows this? - Sun Nov  8 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) settled back into another rare smile, thought she couldn't help but giggle a bit when she was poked in the side.* - Sun Nov  8 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: looks like I made you laugh this time! - Sun Nov  8 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Looks like you are ticklish. - Sun Nov  8 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Uh....no i'm not! - Sun Nov  8 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think you are fibbing.~ - Sun Nov  8 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nu uh.... - Sun Nov  8 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out another laugh and scrambled backwards, the obvious signs of being extremely ticklish.* - Sun Nov  8 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nooooo - Sun Nov  8 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh I gotchu. - Sun Nov  8 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked from side to side, trying to protect her sides from any follow up pokes.

"Uh...no reason! no reason at all"* - Sun Nov  8 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Heh, would you like me to stop Lera-chan? - Sun Nov  8 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Uh....why would I tell you to stop if it has not effect!! - Sun Nov  8 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mashai(Novaraven747) says: Mashai. - Sun Nov  8 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) expression was something along the lines of 'Oh god why', as Kiyoko pounced on her and began a tickle assault. The laughter was imminent, reverberating around the square.

"N-noo...st-stop...oh god!"* - Sun Nov  8 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Soooooooo you do want me to stop?~ - Sun Nov  8 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. Mashai, my name is Sanoke. You've gotten my interest. - Sun Nov  8 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Someday you and I should spar? - Sun Nov  8 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was definitely fighting a losing battle, she was bright red in the face and struggling to breathe around the laughter.

"P-please...stop..y-you win!"* - Sun Nov  8 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) found herself flat out on the ground before being helped up by Kiyoko.

"Bleh...i can't help it if i'm ticklish jeez.."* - Sun Nov  8 11:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat down on the bench with a harrumph, but she invited Kiyoko to sit on her knee. Jiki would probably find all this rather awkward, but she didn't care so much.

"Well, its not fair if I'm the only one who gets to sit..."* - Sun Nov  8 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave a little nod, balancing herself on the bench so Kiyoko could be as comfortable as possible.

"There, comfy?"* - Sun Nov  8 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Very. - Sun Nov  8 11:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not at all. - Sun Nov  8 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Well that's good... that would be wildly inappropriate with our fellow shinobi sitting beside us. - Sun Nov  8 11:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh? - Sun Nov  8 11:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And what were those? - Sun Nov  8 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I vaguely remember saying I had two people I cared for in this village. I'll have to make that three I think. - Sun Nov  8 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I... don't think that's what I asked... b-but that's nice. - Sun Nov  8 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Who would this third person be? - Sun Nov  8 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I think you already know who it is. - Sun Nov  8 11:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: So I do make you nervous... - Sun Nov  8 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...perhaps. - Sun Nov  8 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) shifted her weight slightly so she could put an arm around Kiyoko's waist.* - Sun Nov  8 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I said before right? You don't need to be nervous with me. - Sun Nov  8 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: D-did you? - Sun Nov  8 11:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I feel like I'm going to pass out...shit. - Sun Nov  8 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: To see me? Whatever do you mean? We're just two close friends sharing an intimate moment no? But...if it bothers you, we can go talk in more...privacy. - Sun Nov  8 11:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I found that more often than not, you should just do whatever you want to do. - Sun Nov  8 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It seems you just want to know what I would decide. - Sun Nov  8 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not at all~ - Sun Nov  8 11:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nope. - Sun Nov  8 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I... suppose...if you ...in the off chance wanted to keep...holding me this way... I am not all that public of a person.... - Sun Nov  8 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: The most I would show in public normally would be a handshake...or maybe a hug... - Sun Nov  8 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I see, so you want to go into private. Well alright then, just sit tight and we'll go somewhere quieter. - Sun Nov  8 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lifted off the bench and kept rising, flying off towards her own private home.* - Sun Nov  8 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) landed lightly infront of her house and wandered inside, still carrying Kiyoko if she allowed it.

"Nope, I wasn't."* - Sun Nov  8 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why is she still carrying m--not that I'm complaining... - Sun Nov  8 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I bought this a while ago. - Sun Nov  8 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I have a house here and in Kirigakure. - Sun Nov  8 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) , whilst still carrying Kiyoko, propped Samehada against the wall and took a seat on the sofa. She resumed the same position they'd had while sitting on the outside bench.* - Sun Nov  8 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well its quite alright. - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No need to whisper now hm? - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, no I suppose not. - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course... what was the need for 'two close friends sharing an inimate moment' to whisper? - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Very true. - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...it strikes me...that I don't really know a whole lot about you. - Sun Nov  8 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I suppose you don't... how dangerous of you to invite me into your home.~ - Sun Nov  8 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I'm sure I can handle myself...heh. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What if ...hm... I could have been an assassin or something, yeah? - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Entirely possible. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I don't think so. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That happens... *wrinkles nose* I think. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh...only once so far. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To me at least. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Shit. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? No need to apologise, I made it out okay. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right...  - Sun Nov  8 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So...Kiyoko, What sort've things do you like to do? - Sun Nov  8 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What do you want to know about me the--heh... uhm... I... honestly am a workaholic. I am practically living in the hospital most of the time... but uh, I guess I like stuff like... Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I like the market place... during the busiest time of the day. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It feels alive at that time. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched her face very closely while she spoke, a faint smile on her face.* - Sun Nov  8 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ooh, and lemon poppy seed muffins. The homemade kind. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was wrong...you're not cute. You're beautiful. - Sun Nov  8 12:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah...apologies, I'm getting ahead of myself. - Sun Nov  8 12:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I said i wouldn't ever...feel...well I said love but still. - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I guess I was wrong again. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I said that the first time as well...guess I really can't help myself.. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If... I'm pushing too much, I can... back off... I know you have had reasons not to persue... erg... we had that conversation... and that didn't stop me. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No no. I want you to be as forward as you want... - Sun Nov  8 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...I'm not so sure about that. - Sun Nov  8 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't lie to myself all the time. - Sun Nov  8 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I generally tell myself that I can't love anyone again, to save myself from the pain you see? - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But, someone told me once that the pain is worth is. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And they're right. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have to agree with them. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course... - Sun Nov  8 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm fairly motivated...hah. - Sun Nov  8 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are you now... - Sun Nov  8 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) reached a hand up to brush a strand of hair from Kiyoko's face.* - Sun Nov  8 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You sure know how to make a girl... feel tormented. - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess I really am a fool huh. - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tormented...? - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  8 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then... - Sun Nov  8 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned forward slowly, giving Kiyoko plenty of time to pull away if she didn't want to. Her intent was plant a kiss on her lips.* - Sun Nov  8 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out a small moan through her clenched lips, pushing it further to deepen the kiss as far as it would go. She was happy with how quickly Kiyoko seemed to want this, it meant she wasn't the only moronic one here. Unable to stop herself anymore, she squeezed her arms around Kiyoko's waist; pulling the two closer together. The kiss she did not break off, she only served to deepen it with a desperate passion that spoke volumes of her 'need'.* - Sun Nov  8 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt little shivers run up and down her body at Kiyoko's touch, it was difficult to believe that Kiyoko was inexperienced in this; she certainly knew her way around Lera. As tongues were pressed together, she knew she would have to stop this for now; otherwise her instincts would kick in and then there would be no stopping. So as gently as possible, she pulled her mouth from Kiyoko's but stayed close with forehead resting against forehead.

"Am I still...tormenting you...?"* - Sun Nov  8 12:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled and gave a little breathless laugh, she was content to mearly stare into Kiyoko's eyes though; feeling herself getting lost in there.

"Well...it wasn't easy.."* - Sun Nov  8 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) settled back into the cushions, pulling Kiyoko with her in a sort of cuddle.

"I'm not complaining."* - Sun Nov  8 12:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey...I tried... - Sun Nov  8 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: you're too hard to resist... - Sun Nov  8 12:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good~ - Sun Nov  8 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We could... try and get to know one another... questions back and forth? ...other types of games...granted... we probably will just end up where we just were with those games. - Sun Nov  8 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure, do you want to start? - Sun Nov  8 12:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you -really- believe yourself when you told me you weren't going to pursue anyone else... that first conversation? - Sun Nov  8 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes I did. - Sun Nov  8 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...my turn. Why do you enjoy being a nurse? - Sun Nov  8 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I really want to help people... help them in ways no one else can. Not just medically either for their bodies, but mentally too... and to make sure that whatever they have gone through to lead them to the hospital... they will leave feeling no burden....to body or mind. - Sun Nov  8 12:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well you're already down on the mental side, you've helped me. - Sun Nov  8 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your turn. - Sun Nov  8 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why did you become a shinobi? - Sun Nov  8 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I....hm. At first it was because I...had nothing else to do, my family had left me in Kirigakure and..I was alone. Well, I suppose I just didn't want to be alone anymore. - Sun Nov  8 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you were lying to yourself more than you knew. - Sun Nov  8 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose I was. - Sun Nov  8 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think i would have made you laugh back then. I was so shy I could hardly mutter a word to anyone. - Sun Nov  8 12:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sounds adorable. - Sun Nov  8 12:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. Do you enjoy music? - Sun Nov  8 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weeeeeeeell, yeah... but I usually try and only listen to music at parties or when I'm alone. I'm not very confident in my choices being 'cool'. - Sun Nov  8 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you know how to dance? - Sun Nov  8 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...can't say I've tried. - Sun Nov  8 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't be that hard can it? - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Whaaaa? - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Never had a reason I suppose. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I prefer to play the music people dance to. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And here I thought you would be the only one to have things to show me. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well now. Thats something to look forward to. - Sun Nov  8 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I have to admit I'm looking forward to all of it.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave her nose a little poke "So am I~"* - Sun Nov  8 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a bit while she pulled her finger back, not that she would've minded a little nibble like that.

"My turn right? Hmmm. What kind of food do you like?"* - Sun Nov  8 13:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: My favorite is sushi...but it's so hard to get good sushi in Suna.  - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, when things calm down I'll have to take you to Kirigakure. I know an excellent Sushi bar there... - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Besides that, I pretty much will eat anythin--th-that sounds really nice. - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anything huh....hehe, I doubt you would eat my cooking. - Sun Nov  8 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I would certainly try it at least once.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: When you get the chance to indulge... what do you enjoy? - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you survived the experience... - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And uh...hmm. I don't paticularly have a favourite. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: My stomach is iron resistant! - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...love food. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One of my many vices I suppose. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And well, we'll have to see about that won't we. My cooking is beyond terrible. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Really? Guess I'll be cooking for you then instead..hm? - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'd like that~ - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Getting ahead of myself. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Christ...you wouldn't believe how bad it was surviving in the wild on my own cooking. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...hehe. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That...sucked. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep... - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I bet it's great protien. - Sun Nov  8 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. It kept me going for a few days at least. - Sun Nov  8 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways....my turn again... - Sun Nov  8 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm curious, the makeup around your eyes? don't get me wrong, its rather beautiful but...what does it symbolise? - Sun Nov  8 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see, You don't like it? - Sun Nov  8 13:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's not that I don't like it... I love the culture... I...don't like my family. - Sun Nov  8 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mentioned it before. - Sun Nov  8 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 13:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: S-shit I forgot what I was going to ask. - Sun Nov  8 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hehehe, i'll give you a moment to remember. - Sun Nov  8 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This is more of... just wanting something confirmed, but is what we are doing right now the most relaxation you ever get? Your indulgence was food. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well....I do have another little...hobby I guess. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't done it in a while though. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anything I can get my hands on...so far; piano, harp, guitar, flute...and I sing. - Sun Nov  8 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm, that is quite impressive.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It makes up for my lack of cooking skills for sure. - Sun Nov  8 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. My turn I think? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Have you ever...been in a relationship before? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.... a serious one? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well any really. - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've gone on dates, but nothing more serious than a few weeks. I guess...that's a bad omen huh? - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, not at all. - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It just meant the right person hadn't come along yet. - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Surprised? - Sun Nov  8 13:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You're younger than me. - Sun Nov  8 13:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Interesting. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wow. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That was unexpected. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Really? - Sun Nov  8 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wow, I must act really mature huh. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe because you've been through so much? And yes... you are very mature...not to mention, powerful. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah, I wouldn't call myself powerful. I still have a very long way to go. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you kidding? - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am nothing to you. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You are a nurse though. A healer. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah but how long do you think it will last as a shinobi that they will allow me to be 'just a healer' - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. I'm not sure. As far as I know, Zenaki is a healer as well; not suited to combtat. - Sun Nov  8 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't worry. I'll do my best to protect you. Being my fathers daughter does have some benefits. - Sun Nov  8 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...heh...that's so generous of you. - Sun Nov  8 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright.. Well. Its my turn I believe. - Sun Nov  8 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why don't you just leave your family? if you hate them so much. - Sun Nov  8 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled, more like grinned actualy; there was a warm feeling centering in her chest from Kiyoko's words.

"So you listened to me...heh...thank you."* - Sun Nov  8 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, yes I did. - Sun Nov  8 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is your best childhood memory? - Sun Nov  8 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My best childhood memory...? Oh man.. - Sun Nov  8 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) seemed to retreat in on herself for a few moments, thinking carefully and quietly for a while. Truth be told, her childhood wasn't one of the best; but there was almost always at least one experience or one memory that made everything seem worth it.

"It was...a warm day, spring had just come and you could smell the blossoms from the garden. I was with...my mother, she was singing to me; a soft lullaby. I remember feeling so...happy, so content. As if all thing were right in the world...its about the only time I remember my mother being....my mother."* - Sun Nov  8 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared off towards the wall, as if she were seeing something entirely different to Kiyoko "It was...."

With a deep breath, she broke off from her trance and looked back into Kiyoko's eyes.

"So? What about you? Your best childhood memory?"* - Sun Nov  8 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And there you are~ You followed your dream right? - Sun Nov  8 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... cheesy huh? - Sun Nov  8 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not at all, I quite like it. - Sun Nov  8 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your turn. - Sun Nov  8 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph. - Sun Nov  8 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Dirty cheat. - Sun Nov  8 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. - Sun Nov  8 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not sure if I should ask this. - Sun Nov  8 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ask whatever you want. - Sun Nov  8 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If... you have done this before, what does it feel like when you take a life? - Sun Nov  8 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Its...well. - Sun Nov  8 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its difficult to explain. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its like....you take away a little piece of yourself. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The first time I had to...you know...well I threw up. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's...common though right? - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'd...be surprised... - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: There are some seriously sick people out there. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay for normal people like you. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Does it get easier? - Sun Nov  8 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: yes...yes it does. I wish it didn't but it does. - Sun Nov  8 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn.. - Sun Nov  8 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I hope you never have to do it. - Sun Nov  8 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...me...too... - Sun Nov  8 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave her a light kiss on the forehead.

"I'm hoping to have peace before you ever have to."* - Sun Nov  8 14:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Those eyes are perfect for recon. - Sun Nov  8 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've also suggest Koji as a member - Sun Nov  8 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So you're using people with eyes like ours? It's not a bad choice. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Who is it that you're looking for, and why? - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, not exactly. Truthfully I wanted someone who could travel underground. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah, I have no clue. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like I said, he didn't give me details. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's a bit difficult. - Sun Nov  8 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your name was suggested. - Sun Nov  8 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They just didn't think you'd be back so soon - Sun Nov  8 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Muhammed, Hassan. - Sun Nov  8 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think you probably know him. - Sun Nov  8 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Somewhat.  - Sun Nov  8 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I thought that was common knowledge...guess not. - Sun Nov  8 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well, the choice is yours. - Sun Nov  8 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, it's a fairly difficult choice. There's not enough information on the task, and I'm a monk.  Stealth is not my strong suit. Also, I'm considered a visitor to this village.  There's a lot of people who think I'm a shinobi due to the fact that I've been staying here for a while. - Sun Nov  8 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. Well, if you wish to talk directly to Hassan. You're welcome too. - Sun Nov  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To have me assist may also clash against your beliefs. I don't condone violence, or even taking another person's life. Should a situation where the others feel as though they need to take the life of a target, I would most likely interfere. There's been clashes frequently in this regard between me and some of your villagers. - Sun Nov  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah. well. Thats fair enough, i'm not one to counter anothers beliefs. - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, I almost forgot. - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Have you heard from Koji or Fujitora about what they found from the Necromancer?  - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Necromancer? I had no idea there even was a Necromancer. - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who was it? - Sun Nov  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He was a man who infiltrated the village a few days ago. I tried to have him live a new life, but Fujitora decided to kill him instead. He believes he's from the Gezo and are out to destroy this village, when it's not the Gezo who were pulling the strings. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I took a sword of his as a momento for his life, but I was bullied into handing it over. - Sun Nov  8 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. I can ask my brother. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I don't know how much he will tell me. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hopefully I can get it back. - Sun Nov  8 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: We must always remember the departed, even if those around us view them as evil. - Sun Nov  8 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know what you mean. - Sun Nov  8 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Believe it or not, I've etched the names of all those who've died around me into my soul.  It's sad, but it's all that I can do for now.   - Sun Nov  8 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Back home, there was a memorial I built. Here, it seems as though once a person has departed they are forever forgotten. - Sun Nov  8 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No...I still remember everyone ive killed and everyone who has died close to me. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you ever meditate on it? - Sun Nov  8 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I try not to think about it. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The first time I took a life, I was bedridden for a week. - Sun Nov  8 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This may seem difficult to you, but should conflict arise, try to resolve it peacefully. Even if it turns to violence, try your best not to take their life. We must fight fire with water. - Sun Nov  8 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha...i really wish things were that simple. - Sun Nov  8 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's much simplier than you think. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: There are some people who can't be silenced peacefully.. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Edge...Ortho...so on. - Sun Nov  8 19:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ortho is someone you can reason with.  - Sun Nov  8 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've only ever seen him. - Sun Nov  8 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Ortho took the life of someone very dear to me. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nearly took my life. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sorry to hear that. - Sun Nov  8 19:22:14 2015
