<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: We can train speed together, make a obsticle course - Sat Sep 26 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Depends on what type of training.. - Sat Sep 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* I'm not bothered, I can't use the jutsu i need to practice in a spar though; they're too dangerous. - Sat Sep 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Maybe I can dodge them. - Sat Sep 26 07:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: How about hand to hand combat? - Sat Sep 26 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...not very good at that. - Sat Sep 26 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: You can always get better.. - Sat Sep 26 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We could just have an ordinary spar? - Sat Sep 26 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I will, just not yet. - Sat Sep 26 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ordinary spar it is. I'll try using hand to hand combat, though. - Sat Sep 26 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: There's something I want to try out. - Sat Sep 26 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh. Okay. - Sat Sep 26 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: You can go ahead and go first. I'll try countering whatever you throw at me. - Sat Sep 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right... - Sat Sep 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started by drawing her hands, conjuring red sparks therein. Though she didn't specifically aim for Setsuna, she would toss several balls of flame. Each one would impact near Setsuna, leaving small explosions of flame and making it difficult for Setsuna to move around easily. Truthfully, she wanted to test out her new combo's on a live target; though feared she might end up killing someone by accident.* - Sat Sep 26 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jumped back in surprise, Setsuna's speed was beyond anything she expected from her. Perhaps this would be more difficult after all. To help slow her down, if even for only a moment; she summoned mud from the ground beneath her. She spread the mud outwards, coating the area in the thick slime for quite some distance. She expected it wouldn't stop Setsuna, but perhaps it would slow her down at least a little bit.* - Sat Sep 26 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) caught Setsuna's movements as she jumped into the air; watching her form her handseals. She hadn't seen that combination before and didn't intend to stick around and find out what it was. So she decided to use one of her newer jutsu in order to hide herself. Bringing her hands to form a handseal, she formed a dome of earth around herself. It was large enough to hold a few people, if Setsuna decided to come in. While she was in there, she was preparing her counter attacks.* - Sat Sep 26 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed her own handseal, creating three clones inside her dome; then she continued to watch and wait, just in case Setsuna intended to sneak her way in after all. The worst part was that she had no idea what was going on outside of her dome.* - Sat Sep 26 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had all of her attentions focused on the only way Setsuna could invade her dome at the tome, namely the ground. She was also aware of the headhunter jutsu, though she didn't know if Setsuna had learned it. As soon as the hand came from the ground; she assumed the girl had. Her reactions weren't paticularly fast, but Lera and her three clones immediately applied chakra to the earth and sank. Intending to join Setsuna underneath. If this was successful, one of the clones would stay behind to block Setsuna's path while lera and the other two moved away from the dome.* - Sat Sep 26 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt Setsuna rise above ground again, immediately knowing her next course of action. She could feel the girls clones up there as well, but she would ignore them for now; they were harmless for the most part. She would take a few moments to get into position, herself and the three clones essentially surrounding the one who'd risen from the ground. She couldn't tell the difference between the clones and Setsuna, so she simply went for the one who'd tried to grab her ankle.

A few moments later, her clones and herself rose from the ground. Herself and two of the clones immediately formed three handseal. The final clone formed five; its hands beginning to spark. She intended to leave no escape for Setsuna. She would either attack her or one of the clones and be struck by a multitude of wind bullets. Or she could try and escape under ground and be shocked by her final clones earth flash. The wind bullets in question were weakened enough to not kill, but they would sting like a bitch.* - Sat Sep 26 08:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jumpep away with just two of her clones, the third consumed by ensuing flames. She was more or less finished with the spar, but she now at least wanted to destroy the clones; they would make a good test for her latest combo. As quickly as possible, she ran through three handseals; focusing on the mud she'd created earlier as a catalyst. Rising from the mud was the head of a dragon with glowing yellow eyes and a dark open maw.

Before the dragon fired its load, her first clone would plunged its hands into the back of the head; sending several shots of flame inside. The dragon then fired off several red hot rocks at high speeds, straight towards her clones. Just before they would reach, the third clone clapped its hands and let of a humungous gust of wind. As soon as it came into contact with rock, the wind ignited; spreading a wide arc of flames.* - Sat Sep 26 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) holds up her hand, assuming Setsuna could feel the action rather than see it.

"Okay, thats enough."* - Sat Sep 26 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lolonehots her.* - Sat Sep 26 09:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I need one of you two to tell me if the speed I can move at is fast enough. - Sat Sep 26 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: One hundred ninety four miles seems slow to me. - Sat Sep 26 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: ..... - Sat Sep 26 09:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hassan-sensei. We haven't trained in a while. Can we do some training later? - Sat Sep 26 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Yusei, has the best physical prowess of the three...Iza and Yuudai are much alike. - Sat Sep 26 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 26 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So... I'm wondering. Is that fast? - Sat Sep 26 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Takes up a massive amonth of chakra...So I can only use it at so much power. - Sat Sep 26 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: The damage from that punch could've been better. If I get stronger physically, maybe near Koeki's level of physical power, this'll be very effective... - Sat Sep 26 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Fujitora? - Sat Sep 26 09:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Standard Size is fifteen meters...Any more than 40 and it'll make me fall to the ground at the level of sperfection. - Sat Sep 26 09:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: OH! - Sat Sep 26 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Ca you spar Lera for me> - Sat Sep 26 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes that was fast, and sure. - Sat Sep 26 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Doesn't seem fast. It didn't make anyone's jaw drop. - Sat Sep 26 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: How strong is she exactly?...I plan to test this jutsu..Maybe the one she mentioned earlier can be used against it. - Sat Sep 26 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, you are very fast actually..How you think its slow, i have no clue. - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: She's my student. - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: She's been my student for longer than I can count. - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Says enough then. - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So don't hold back. - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I wasn't moving at my full speed... I forgot to inhale through my nose and exhale through my mouth... - Sat Sep 26 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: How fast can you move at max? - Sat Sep 26 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: One hundred ninety four miles. - Sat Sep 26 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: It's not good that I can't see my own movement. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Quite certain that by the end of the month, you'll possibly reach two hundred miles.. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Moving fast won't get you anywhere. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Spar him? I heard he's strong, that means I don't need to hold back right? - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You need raw power. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And no, don't hold back at all. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: If I stack raw power with raw speed, how good would that be? - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Come with me then. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You'd be half as strong as Kenshin. - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Basically, what if I combined Koeki's tactics with Kenshin's? - Sat Sep 26 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shall I go first then? - Sat Sep 26 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or do you want first strike. - Sat Sep 26 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'll go ahead. - Sat Sep 26 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: This thing takes preporation. - Sat Sep 26 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll start it off with my strongest combo... - Sat Sep 26 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a single hand seal, spawning five clones to use in her combinations. The first two, would start running towards Fujitora; though they were not paticularly fast. The other three would stand in front of Lera, acting as an effective meat shield while Lera perpared her combination.* - Sat Sep 26 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Hassan should be able to get out of the way right? Right... - Sat Sep 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ......... - Sat Sep 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: The heck is that. Can I even destroy that with my combo?? - Sat Sep 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Time to try.... - Sat Sep 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Doesn't look very durable. - Sat Sep 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) instructed her first two clones running at Fujitora, to clasp their hands in the shapes of blades and jump at the golem; with the intent of jabbing into it using hell stab. She didn't intend for this to be a success, though it would be nice if it was.

Back with the original, another clone was spewing a stready stream of mud onto the ground; coating it in the thick substance for use in her Doton jutsu. As soon as there was enough, Lera formed three handseals in quick succession and had a large dragon head rise from the mud. She wasn't finished there however. The fourth of her five clones would subsenquently plunge its hands into the back of the dragons head, igniting its insides with flames; while Lera finally allowed it to shoot its load.

Flying from the dragons mouth was several small extremely heated rocks, aimed for the golem and Fujitora behind it. She figured the golem would likely absorb most of the damage, so her final clone added something a little extra. Simply clapping its hands together, it would breath out a huge gust of wind; igniting as soon as they came into contact with the flaming rocks; and sending a wall of fire directly towards the golem and Fujitora.* - Sat Sep 26 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Not bad, i'm moderately whelmed. - Sat Sep 26 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) immediately fell backwards, looking as if she'd been knocked over by some force; she could see that her attack had been effective somewhat, but as soon as his many clones spawned she realised that retreat was the best option. As soon as her back hit the ground, she dissapeared underneath it. Her first two clones had already been destroyed by her own jutsu, but the last three decided to throw one last thing at the golem before they were also destroyed.

They figured that if the clone was made out of stone as it appeared to be, then it would be weak to a Raiton based attack. All three clones ran through the same five handseals, slamming their hands down on the ground and sending waves of arcing electricity towards the golem. Whether it worked or not, they ignored their own defense completely and were subsequently destroyed.

Now underground, Lera could sense immediately that the clones Fujitora had created were not there at all. Indicating it as a genjutsu she knew quite well. It also revealed another thing, the real clone that he had sent underground to reach her. It might have traveled the path of her other clones Raiton jutsu, if not she would begin moving backwards away from it; albeit at a slightly slower pace.* - Sat Sep 26 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in her chances, wondering what the best course of action would be in this case. She had to cause as much damage to fujitora without killing him as she was possibly able to do, but now that her clones were gone it would take time to prepare anything large. She considered encasing him in a dome, but with his use of Doton jutsu she knew that was pointless.

Instead she did the only thing she could think of to do in this situation; though it could well end in her loss anyway. She got as close as she dared; knowing that his underground clone would be on her if she wasn't careful. As soon as she was certain she could have a clear shot on Fujitora; she would jump above ground and form three handseals, drawing in a big breath.

As soon as she exhaled, she released several dozenf wind shards; sending them flying towards Fujitora, intent on ripping into his skin but nothing more damaging. She didn't want to kill the guy.* - Sat Sep 26 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: She uses Fire and Earth..Then Wind..Much like myself..Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started moving backwards at a fast rate; trying to avoid getting crushed underneath a massive fist. Once she came to rest, she formed a single handseal and had the Earth rise up and over her; forming a hardened dome of rock with no visible openings. She knew that he could break through it or go underneath it with relative ease, she merely intended to give herself breathing room in order to prepare for another attack.* - Sat Sep 26 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gritted her teeth, knowing that what she intended to do was going to hurt. Forming the one handseal for her clone jutsu, she summoned a total of twelve clones; the most she was capable of creating at once. Three of the clones move to block the attacks of Fujitora's clones; they were not good in close combat but she hoped they would at least subdue a single clone. Another five of her clones moved to form a meat shield against the Katon flames.

Herself and the rest of the clones moved to get as far from the flames as possible; though some likely managed to get past her meat shield ,leaving her with burns similar to Fujitora's.* - Sat Sep 26 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) decided to go for one last attack. Everything she had in one go, she was not able to follow Fujitora's shunshin and although she could probably escape the golem with hiding like a mole, it was pointless since she would have to face it eventually.

The five clones she had kept with her surrounded her, 3 of them forming handseals and the other two clapping. One of the clones she had sent towards Fujitora's clone had been destroyed; a distraction while the other two had finished it off. So with only two of them remaining they attempted to inhibit the Golem as much as they possibly could. To do this, they charged forwards; aiming to jab their hands into the legs of the golem repeatedly. They both focused on a single leg, attempting to sever it completely.

Meanwhile, The real Lera would also clap her hands together; aiming her attentions to the point where Fujitora should be coming, directly ahead. The clones around her would subsequently spew five balls of fire and two great gusts of wind. Since they could not see where he would appear; they spread the flames all over the area directly infront of her. Lera would simply add her own gust of wind to this, furthering the spread of flame. Once it was over, she would drop to a knee; all of her clones dispersing.

Never before had she tried to use so much chakra in a single battle, or even so many clones at once; though she had enough to keep going, she was definitely exhausted.* - Sat Sep 26 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) answered his question by passing out. She'd used far more chakra than intended.* - Sat Sep 26 11:35:53 2015

"This...this is incredible. I guess this is how a prince dines huh?~"* - Sat Sep 26 19:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sipped her wine slowly, both savouring it and knowing that she would get very drunk very quickly; it being her first time drinking. The moment she looked at the menu, her eyes would widen and she had to force herself not to drool. The resteraunt she'd taken Seisuke before was nothing compared to this.

"Theres...so much."* - Sat Sep 26 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep~ - Sat Sep 26 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jolted in surprise, turning to the pianist who was playing.

"Oh...I love this song..." it even distracted her from her food...for about half a second.* - Sat Sep 26 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) paused her eating to press her glass against his.

"To us. Forever"* - Sat Sep 26 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) got through her food relatively quickly, though she showed her absolute skill in eating cleanly and with an exceptional amount of grace. Something she had been taught from an early age.* - Sat Sep 26 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finally had the last bite of her torte, settling back into the chair with a slight groan.

"That was...amazing."* - Sat Sep 26 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took his hand, glancing furtively at the piano before letting him lead her away.* - Sat Sep 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? Mhm...maybe. I've always wanted a piano - Sat Sep 26 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...really like music. - Sat Sep 26 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Really? - Sat Sep 26 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah... - Sat Sep 26 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Why not give it a go then~? - Sat Sep 26 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...I've never played a piano before though. - Sat Sep 26 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: This is as good as any to try~. - Sat Sep 26 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Okay. - Sat Sep 26 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on the piano's stool. Experimentally pressing a few keys, she loved the sound they made. To her, music was a form of art and could take shape in any form. She took several minutes, pressing keys to get a feel for the sounds they made. Then she simply improvised, playing a short and simple lullaby. While she played, her smile just got wider and wider.* - Sat Sep 26 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) continued to play, the piece ascending and growing more complex as she gained confidence. She'd failed to tell Seisuke how she often was able to pick up most instruments and play them, mostly out of embarrassment.* - Sat Sep 26 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) eventually ended her improv, pulling her hands away from the keys and taking in a deep breath.

"I...forgot what it was like to play an instrument."* - Sat Sep 26 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you. - Sat Sep 26 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll be sure to get you a piano~, Maybe you can play for me some other time? - Sat Sep 26 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll...write you a song shall I/ - Sat Sep 26 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Mm, I'd love that~. - Sat Sep 26 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have one more thing I'd like to do for you, If you'd allow me~? - Sat Sep 26 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 26 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Shall we head home~? - Sat Sep 26 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: I can only imagine...How good she'll be if she practices. - Sat Sep 26 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 26 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) accepted his hand and allowed herself to be pulled along.* - Sat Sep 26 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked a couple of times as she sat on the bed, surprised by his offer.

"I would love it if you gave me one~"

Carefully, she stripped off her clothes and laid front first on the bed.* - Sat Sep 26 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) relaxed into the pillows, closing her eyes with a happy smile.

"Go ahead"* - Sat Sep 26 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out a sigh of pure bliss, he was definitely good at what he did; he had obviously practice hard at this.

"mhmmm...you're good at this."* - Sat Sep 26 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't help but let out a little moan, she hadn't felt this relaxed in years; it was like he was working away years of pent up tention.

"Ahhhhh....you should do this more often..."* - Sat Sep 26 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was having trouble focusing, even if Seisuke wasn't. She tried to stay relaxed but with Seisuke's hands running all over her like that it was incredibly difficult.* - Sat Sep 26 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) suddenly turned her body and grabbed him, pulling him onto her with as much force as she could muster.

"I can't hold back anymore!"* - Sat Sep 26 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wrapped her arms around him and started to tug at this clothing, attempting to undo the various buttons/clasps in order to pull it off him. She returned his kiss with just as much passion, she wanted nothing else but him right now.* - Sat Sep 26 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't spend any time waiting, immediately exploring every part of his body with her mouth, tongue and teeth; she wanted to know every inch of him.* - Sat Sep 26 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finally gripped him hard, intending to carry out the act they both wanted to happen; but the lord of all screens erected a mighty blackness around the scene.* - Sat Sep 26 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) merely laid in his arms once the deed was done. Holding him lightly and resting a head on his his chest. She was both satisfied and fufilled, finally feeling as if she had her place in the world.

"Seisuke?"* - Sat Sep 26 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I love you. - Sat Sep 26 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. - Sat Sep 26 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing can break us apart. - Sat Sep 26 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-Yeah.. - Sat Sep 26 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave the little girl a pat on the head.

"Hello kiddo. Training huh."* - Sun Sep 27 06:15:28 2015

"Hello Sanoke, I haven't spoken to you in....oh wow nearly a year now?"* - Sun Sep 27 06:18:52 2015
