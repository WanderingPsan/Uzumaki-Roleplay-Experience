<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a few handseals and drew in her breath, gathering Katon natured chakra into her sternum. When she exhaled, she released a steady stream of fire while turning herself in a circle. The flames clung to the floor, putting her inside a circle of steady burning flames. It was in this circle that she took a seat, crossing over her legs and holding both hands in her lap.

Fujitora's instructions had seemed simple, yet she knew they would be far from it. He'd seemed worried that she would burn herself by accident, considering his much greater skill over the katon element than hers; she was expecting to do exactly that. She wasn't worried about burning herself to death, not at all; she knew Kilm was well versed in Suiton technique and could put her out in the event of an accident. She wasn't worried about the pain either; in fact, at this point, she welcomed it.

With the flames surrounding her entirely, she could feel the constant heat on her body; that coupled with the natural heat of Sunagakure, made for a very uncomfortable position. Soon, sweat was beginning to drip from her body and the heat was near unbearable. She once again ignored her discomfort however, no pain could amount to what she was feeling in her chest. Losing Seisuke had well and truly shattered her soul.

Soon, sweat was beginning to drip from her body and the heat was near unbearable. She once again ignored her discomfort however, no pain could amount to what she was feeling in her chest. Losing Seisuke had well and truly shattered her soul.

Drawing in a deep breath of hot air, she began trying to control the flames around her; to safely feel the warmth and hold them close without burning herself. At first, the fire didn't even respond: but soon, her little circle started to draw itself in closer. Tongues of flame licked up and down her arm, she felt the pain and accepted it. Knew that the skin of her arms was starting to redden from close proximity to fire but she just kept going.

It almost looked as if she were really trying to burn herself alive, the flames were so close that they were almost doing just that. She knew the technique wasn't just about protecting yourself from the flames, it was about accepting them; making them a simple extension of the body. In truth, she already treated a great deal of jutsu as extensions of the body but they were nothing like this.

After a few moments of the flames itching to sink into her skin, they won out and Lera's concentration ebbed. She didn't go up entirely in flames, at least having enough sense of self preservation to weaken the flames before even starting the jutsu. However, it truly looked for a moment as if she were shrouded in the flames; with her the minimal clothes she was wearing starting to burn away to nothing.* - Sat Oct 10 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) flinched when the water hit her, contrasting the severe hit with cold. She honestly hadn't even noticed the fact that she'd essentially been burning, perhaps that was part of the technique. It looked her there were minor burns covering her arms and her clothes and chest bandages were in tatters. Her appearence had suddenly taken a not so modest turn.

"...Thanks."* - Sat Oct 10 16:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later. - Sat Oct 10 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) relit her circle of flames and took her seat in the middle once more; she noted a significant change from the last time. She could feel the heat of the flames yes and it had almost the same effect as before. However there was now a subtle difference. She couldn't only feel the heat, but she felt the flames themselves. Felt each individual tongue against her skin like an old friend.

It was so close, she knew that this is exactly what Fujitora was hitting at; she had to embrace the flames without a shred of fear and hesitation. She had to accept the flames for what they were and treat them as a companion. As soon as this realisation occured, something clicked; like a switch had been flipped. She'd had the switch the entire time, she just had to have to courage to find it and flip it.

The flames drew towards her, gathering about her body and staying mere inches away from her skin. The heat was still there, but it was no longer as uncomfortable. Now it was like welcoming an old friend she'd never known she'd had. Without so much as her willing, tears began to spill from her eyes; quickly boiling and turning to steam from the heat. The emotions of her loss had been there the entire time, she'd just surpressed them because she couldn't deal with it.

These flames though, they helped her let them out; helped her handle them without breaking down and crying. Finally, she crossed that final threshhold and drew the flames to cover her. If she'd even hesitated or held a shred of fear, then she would've burned herself alive. Yet, even with flames covering her entire body; she remained untouched. 

Standing up, she ran her hands through the flames that covered her; her pain and sorrow momentarily replaced by a overwhleming joy. Fire was such a happy and joyous element, it could cause so much pain and destruction but it was bursting with energy and it was infectious. Without really even meaning to, she laughed out loudly; forgetting all her worries for the world. She felt free.

However, freedom could only last for so long. Soon, the flames began to die; their dance ending with her supply of chakra. Lera's pain returned to her, the hole in her heart throbbing as hard as ever. Though, she felt refreshed at the same time; today she'd learned something new. Not only fire, but all the elements; they encompassed the cardinal points of life, love and joy. She was proud to be a part of that. Sure that she'd accomplished what was asked of her, she pulled her clothes back on and went back to the square.* - Sat Oct 10 16:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stumbled backwards at his strike, feeling a sudden wave of heat throughout her entire body.  Her vision grew a little fuzzy and sweat started to coat her forehead, it was almost like being under a severe fever. It took all her concentration not to just burst into flames right there and reduce herself to nothing but ash. For a moment she almost did just that, just give in and let it take her.

She pushed that thought away with all the force she could muster, locking it away in the deepest cages of her mind. There would be a time for her to join Seisuke, but it wasn't now. With her face red and flustered from the sheer physical effort, she focused on the feeling of heat. Pushing it towards a single point directly in the center of her chest. This was nothing like the meditation she'd done before, that was playing with an ember by comparison to this. She understood now, the meaning behind it.

It was gradual and took several minutes, but the heat eventually focused to a single point; centering on her chest. She saw it in her mind, a single point of bright red heat; just waiting to be unleashed. So thats exactly what she did. Flames were never made to be contained, they were made to be free; to dance and consume.

It erupted from her chest, a clear orange flame that spread over her entire body; enveloping her, but not harming her. She could feel the joy in it, the freedom and it even managed to bring a tiny smile to her face; if only for a moment. It didn't last long, in her tiny moment of freedom; the flames died down and vanished all together. Leaving her colder, yet somehow feeling a little better than before.
