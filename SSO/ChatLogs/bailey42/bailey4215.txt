<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to a nearby boulder, one almost three times her size. She placed her hands on the rock and channeled her chakra through it; as she poured her chakra through it, she could feel it getting lighter and lighter. Once it was light enough, she put her arms around it and lifted it up and over her head. Apparently with very little effort at all.

Once it was in place, she began pushing it up and down; almost as if she were training her strength. In reality, she wanted to test the limits of her technique; just how much weight could she take of an object. A boulder like this wasn't so difficult, but what about a building? Or something even bigger. It was difficult to find objects big enough to test this on, so she would have to stick with this for now.* - Sun Oct  4 17:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lay back into the sands, the heat blaring down on her skin; the extreme difference in weather here was going to take a lot of getting used to. It was so different compared to the cold mists of Kirigakure; but this was where she belonged now. She expected that she would return to Kirigakure one day, but if Muhammed and Seisuke were here then this is where she would be too. Hopefully, Koeki would understand.

With a little groan, she slowly forced herself to sit up and eventually stand; in truth she hadn't just come here for her father and Seisuke, but because she felt that she could no longer gain strength in Kirigakure. There were already many ways here for her to gain more strength, a pool of knowledge and jutsu she could draw from as well as a whole bunch of elementalists who she could learn from. This place was perfect for her right now, especially now that Muhammed had accepted her as one of his shinobi.

She'd settled herself in an isolated area of the village, away from the bustle of the town. She found it a little disconcerting that the village seemed to be full of bandits and vagabonds; but besides a few a odd and ocasionally hungry looks, they left her alone. She no longer wore her Kirigakure headband, but she guessed Muhammed must have put word out about her somehow. It was doubtful any of these bandits could pose a threat to her, but she could only imagine Muhammeds wrath if they tried.

Now she was finally stood up and in position, she faced the wall nearest to her and formed a hand seal. The entire purpose of her coming her today was to practice her Katon techniques and perhaps increase her skill with the element all together. She still had a ways to go, but was getting much better with it. Pressing a single hand to her mouth, she exhaled through it; igniting her breath as it passed through her fingers.

A large condensed stream of flames blasted out, staying steady in a straight line rather than expanding outwards as a ball of flame. The flames crashed into the wall and blackened it, leaving cracks and small chunks of rock to fall from it to the ground. She was mostly happy with the power behind her techniques, but the possible strength she could get behind a technique when combined with Fuuton was incredible. Just a little more and maybe even Muhammed would be impressed.

With a sigh, she sat back on a rock; just basking in the god forsaken sun and unaware that she was being watched. Her watched eventually made himself known, stepping away from the shadows and stepping into the light. Her eyes immediately fell on the man, her facing lighting up when she recognised him. Cain himself was smiling, the only thought going through his head was how badly he'd wanted to see this dangerous little girl.

Lera jumped off her rock and straight at Cain, slamming into him with what amounted to a tackle hug; despite what he felt for her, Lera's feelings were purely platonic and he knew it. Despite that, he couldn't help but come to find the girl; he'd heard about Muhammeds move to Sunagkure and assumed she'd follow, he was worried for her safety more than anything "Cain! What're you doing here?" As soon as he heard her voice, he felt a little tingle run up his spine; though he repressed it immediately, he was not in a position to claim this girl.

"I came here to check on you, I just had to make sure you were safe. It was damn hard getting in the village though." and it had been hard, he'd had to climb over the walls and sneak past the guards; not an easy feat. Lera just shook her head, an exasperated look coming over her face "ReallY?? That was dangerous and unneccessary, I'm perfectly fine and you know I can look after myself." Cain did indeed know she could, he'd seen her in action first hand and even had an inkling she'd held back.

"I know I know, but I couldn't help myself. I'm hired for life to look after you after all. Anyway, I'm here now so might as well stick around for a bit. You were training right, mind if I watch?" in truth, Cain didn't care so much about the training; he just wanted to watch her, it was the closest he was likely ever going to get. With a roll of her eyes, Lera stepped away from him "Sure, I don't see why you can't. Uh...stand back though, it might get a little hot."

Now fully turned away from him, Cain took a seat on the rock she'd just vacated and began watching her practice. He didn't so much look at her jutsu, more that he looked at her body. She was bigger than he remembered, she'd gone through some sort of growth spurt; looking more and more like a woman with each day. Lera could practically feel his eyes while she practiced, it made her a little paranoid; though she trusted him not to try anything, he knew full well how dedicated to Seisuke she was.

She tried to blot him out of her mind, just pretend he wasn't there. The way he felt blazed through so strongly even Lera had noticed it, but it didn't matter; her heart and soul belonged with Seisuke, no matter what happened. Eventually, with a few deep breaths she managed to push it out of her mind and focus on the task at hand. Slowly her hands formed the single tiger seal once more, fingers funneling around her mouth and acting as the barrel for her flamethrower.

Unlike the Flamethrower technique however, this jutsu was far more powerful and could actually cause some real damage if it struck someone. Lera however, never intended to use it as a direct weapon against someone.  To her, it was simply a tool for gaining more strenth and a jutsu she could combine with others to produce far more power. She almost felt like giving a little demonstration to Cain, to see how he reacted; he'd never seen what she could really do.

After leaving yet more scorch marks and damages to the wall, damage she could fill in with mud later on, she formed another handseal and created three clones. The clones stood around her for a few moments before suddenly springing into action. In truth she'd never tried this Combination just yet, she'd used it with exploding flames yes; but Dragon fire Bullet was made for this combination. Her first clone breathed in a spat out copious amounts of mud, coating the ground in the thick substance.

Her second clone formed the handseal for Fire Dragon Bullet and waited to fire it, her third clone clapped its hands together and breathed in ready to fire off a blast of wind. Finally, Lera herself formed three handseals and formed the large head of a dragon from the mud itself. The head openend its mouth and a bright light suffused from within. A moment later, it shot a hail of hardened mud bullets from its mouth. It didn't end there however, as soon as these bullets left its mouth; the second clone breath out its stream of fire, igniting the bullets with flames.

Finally, her third clone let out an explosive blast of wind; not only igniting everything in a gargantuan fireball, but speeding up the flaming red bullets in the same process. The result was a huge wall of flames that spread rapidly across the wall, followed by bullets that slammed into it and left minature craters in the hard rock. The flames soon went out completely, finding no fuel to burn in this dry sandy area. The wall however was left looking a little worse for wear, though that was relatively easy to fix.

Cain's reaction was somewhat expected, he dived backwards off the rock and took shelter behind it; despite knowing that hiding behind it from something like this was useless. Though of course, Lera had made sure he would be completely out of range and safe. While the flames died out Lera giggled approaching Cain, who stood up looking a little pale and embarrassed "Lera, That was insane. How the hell are you able to do something like that."

Lera just shrugged and took a seat on the rock, surveying the damage "I just practiced a lot, I used to barely be able to produce a little gust from my hand...but now, well you can see the sort of thing I can do. To be honest, Anyone can do it with a little effort; I was just lucky to be born with all of these elements and a much larger chakra pool than average." Cain shook his head while she explained, he wasn't sure if anyone really could do that; she didn't even seem tired, he was certain that most shinobi would Sacrifice more than half their chakra to perform a feat like that.

"Its still extremely impressive, I'm sure most of your peers would give anything to have what you have" and he was sure he was right, he'd heard her say Muhammed had called her a prodigy and he was beginning to think the man was right. Lera just shook her head and gave him a sly smile "I'm extremely good at Ninjutsu, but you wanna know my weakness? Physically I'm extremely weak, at least by the standards of a shinobi. Give me one good hit and I'll go down, that and I'm really rather slow. I have to complement my phsical skills with Ninjutsu, otherwise someone with a good bit of speed takes me down easily"

Cain had already had his assumptions about her weakness, everyone had weaknesses and considering how she seemed to prefer a longer ranged battle, this seemed to be hers "I expected as much, but you more than make up for it with your ability to produce such...frightening levels of power in just a few seconds." Lera had to laugh at that, Cain really how no idea of the sort of people who inhabited the Shinobi world "And if I told you there are people who can cross huge distances in mere seconds? Heck, theres a man who can run between villages in barely a few minutes."

He stared at her open mouthed, how could anyone be that fast; even more so, how could anyone run that fast and not kill themselves from exhaustion. There was still too little he knew about the shinobi world, it was to much of a dangerous place for an ordinary man like himself. With how focused he was on the conversation, he simply didn't notice when she began floating a few inches of the rock. Lera found it quite amusing however, so she continuously lowered her weight and rose just a few milimetres at a time. It would be funny to see his reaction when he noticed.

It took him a while to notice, he was so focused on his thoughts that he only realised when Lera was a full head higher than he was. He looked her up and down, seeing the growing gap between herself and the rock she'd been sitting on "What the...How...?" Lera let of a loud girly giggle and slowly settled back to the ground "I can fly, something I learned to do recently. Though I'm still practicing, I can't get far off the ground just yet."

Cain was finding himself more and more perturbed by the shinobi world, they continuously did things that both amazed and confused him; a lot this seemed completely impossible. Yet here she was, levitating off the ground like it was the most natural thing in the world. He would just have to accept it for what it was and move on, there was no point trying to understand it "That...is pretty cool I have to admit. Anyway, are you gonna practice some more? Or will you let me treat you to dinner."

He was a little worried about the smile on her face when he said the words 'dinner' and 'treat' in the same sentance, he had a feeling his wallet was going to be a whole lot lighter after this "Weeeeeelll, if you're sure your wallet can handle my appetite; then i'd love to~" and it looked like he was right.* - Mon Oct  5 12:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's begin then. - Mon Oct  5 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) half floated, half walked to the resteraunt with Cain. He watched with growing concern as she seemed to rise and fall every few seconds. For Lera it was just an easy way to practice her jutsu, for Cain it was disconcerting and it made him feel a little uncomfortable. The looks the pair recieved from the various thugs and vagabonds were now downright hostile. They didn't know Cain and they were understandably wary of strangers.

Cain seemed to spend every moment with his eyes darting around, looking for potential attackers. The village was full of criminals and she was walking through it without a care in the world. In a hushed whisper he said "Lera...are you sure its safe for you here? There are criminals everywhere.." Lera was a little happy that he cared so much for her safety, even if his worries were completely unfounded "My father already warned them off me, they all work here now."

This didn't placate him at all, he trusted Lera and knew that she could probably handle these bandits if they got bored one day; but he still worried "If you say so.." with a little node, she replied "I do say so. Most of them are just hungry refugees, they've all had a difficult life most of them just need a little help." To prove her point, she made her way over to a refugee child and knelt down in front of him. Pulling a wrapped rice ball from her holster and passing it over.

The look of pure joy on the childs face was enough to make Cain's day, he could see the hardness in the way Lera moved and spoke. The cold and bitter way she seemed to view the world now. Yet he could also see the bright and warm kindness that she kept hidden deep within, that same kindness that seemed to escape every now and then. Yes, there was certainly a lot more to this girl than she made out to be.

While the refugee child happily munched on his food, Lera wandered back to Cain and dragged him off to the resteraunt; determined to get her meal for the day, especially if it was free. They entered the resteraunt and took a seat at the table. It was staffed mostly by refugees, with former criminals for waiters. This fact didn't bother Lera at all, she often found that someone who'd struggled to survive often produced better food anyway. Unliked most chefs, the ones who had to work hard to eat appreciated the finer foods more.

Cain watched the staff warily while Lera ordered her food, despite everything he just couldn't trust the people here. He half expected to tuck into a meal and find it poisoned. For himself he only ordered a soup, then he watched open mouthed as Lera seemed to order almost the entire menu "S-surely...you can't eat all that." her answering smile was full of all the sweet innocence she didn't have "Oh? I warned you it wouldn't be easy on your wallet~"

He watched with exasperation, barely touching his food while she practically devoured hers in minutes. Most people would probably look upon the scene with disdain, but he had to admit he was impressed. She ate extremely quickly, yet there was so much grace and ettiquette; it was more like he was watching a noble woman eat, but sped up. She kept to her promise, eating everything she'd ordered and patting her stomach with a satisfied smile afterwards. While he lightened his wallet, she chatted with one of the waiter like old friends. He had to admit, he was jealous of the way she seemed to make friends with anyone.

Once they were out of the store, Lera stretched herself out while Cain checked his time piece. He didn't have much time left, he had a job to get to "I would love to spend the rest of the day with you Lera...but I must go. Would you mind if I came to visit more?" she nodded her agreement to him, before turning to look him in the face "I don't mind at all, just...you know..this. I Can't.." he held up his finger to silence her, he knew what she wanted to say and as much as he didn't want to hear those words, he knew they were true "Its fine, I'm happy enough with simply being your guardian....I must go, I'll be back Lera"

He didn't give her a chance to reply, instead sprinting off towards the wall; probably to climb back out. Lera was left feeling oddly heavy, she felt bad for rejecting him like this; but her heart belonged with someone else. She did love Cain, but more in the way a sister would love her brother. It would never be more than that and it was better he know it rather than live with the hope he might get more. Feeling heavy hearted, she wandered back to a isolated place for more training.* - Mon Oct  5 15:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved up to a rock, one several times her size. She circled around it a few times before nodding in satisfaction, it was big enough to get her point across to Muhammed. She began channelling her chakra into the rock, decreasing its weight exponentialy before it was light enough to lift. Wrapping her arms around, she lifted it up and over her head; holding it aloft on a single palm as if it weighed no more than a feather.

She assumed Hassan would realise it was some sort of jutsu, he was too old and experienced to be fooled by her little parlour trick like everyone else was "So? What do you think pops?"* - Mon Oct  5 15:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Suicide? - Mon Oct  5 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) concentrated a little further on the jutsu, extending the chakra to encompass her body as well. Though it took some effort and concentration, her body itself started to rise off the ground until she floated higher and higher. Once high enough, she dropped the rock; its instantly regained its usual weight and fell with a great crash to the ground. Lera floated down after it, though stumbled a little on her landing.
