<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sighed to herself while she viewed the sands of Sunagakure. She'd now come full circle, back to where it all started; everything had seemed to fall out of her control since then, but not anymore. Hopefully the few shinobi she could save would be safe here in Sunagakure; away from Ortho and his relentless attacks. As per usual, the attacks had happened while she wasn't there; people were dieing because she could not protect them and it hurt her more than she let on.

Thing were bad, there was no sugarcoating it anymore; she'd all but given up on Kirigakure now but she couldn't leave the people to die. She truly hoped that at least some of them would come to Sunagakure, at least then she would have saved a few people. With a little release of breath, she got back to her feet; brushing off the sand on her clothing. The only thing she could do now was help her father with any sort of work he wanted done; that at least would keep her mind off things.

To take her mind off things, at least for now, she decided that training was probably the best option. She still had yet to master Samehada, but with everything that was going on she hadn't even thought about training for quite a while. With a crack of her neck, she wandered off to the training grounds where there were likely a number of soldiers and shinobi training. She first had to beat every single one of them, then she could move onto something a bit more intensive.

With a confident swagger, she strolled into the training grounds; moving towards the center whilst ignoring the stares. What appeared to be a Jounin trailed towards her, stopping infront of her with a frown on his face. He took in her Kirigakure headband and the fact that she was armed to the teeth, immediately assuming her to be a threat of some kind "Who are you? And why are you here?" she regarded him with an observing eye, taking in his jounin suit and the caution on his face. THere were surprisingly few people who recognised her it seems.

"I'm Lera and I'm here to train, thats what this place is for no?" the Jounin visibly relaxed after hearing her name, even if he hadn't seen her before he knew the Kazekages daughter by name at least "Ahhh, Kazekage-sama's daughter. Well, you are welcome to train here of course; i'm sure your father would happily allow it. What exactly are you wanting to train today?" Lera smiled a little, she was sure the jounin might take offense at her next words...but she didn't really care.

"A spar, all of you against me." the jounin looked at her for a few moments, shocked and a little taken aback "All of us? Thats not paticularly safe, if you want a spar I would be happy to-" Lera held up her hand to cut the man off, sweeping her gaze at the groups of soldiers and shinobi who'd been training now watching her "I don't need safe, I need training and just fighting one of you is not enough. Are you going to fight me? Or are you all cowards." she obviously didn't mean her words, but from the angry mutterings coming from the crowd; her ploy was clearly working.

The Jounin stared at her in exasperation, he had not expected the Kazekages daughter to be this difficult "Now we can't j-" his words were cut off once again as a soldier on the sidelines yelled towards them "I ain't no cowards, kazekages daughter or not. Ain't noone who called me a cowards and got away with it." Lera turned her gaze to the soldier, a heavy set man who looked like her barely had a brain cell in that thick skull. He walked towards her with a menacing smile, apparently ready to clock her with a big one. It didn't go so well for him however.

With ease that betrayed her experience, she stepped to the side and pushed his punch away with two fingers from her left hand. She still wasn't too skilled with Taijutsu, but her skill and variety of techniques had improved dramatically. With his punch re-directed, the man was momentarily off balance. The onlookers could only watch as she swept his feet away and left him fall side ways. Before he had a chance to hit the ground, she spun her body and slammed the back of her fist into the side of his head; knocking him out instantly and slamming him to the ground.

The jounin watched this with a raised eyebrow, he had to admire the fluid grace to her techniques; she used the minimal amount of strength necessary to take out an opponent much bigger than herself. There was more to this little girl than met the eye. With a shout, several more soldiers ran at her swinging their meat fists at her. She wasn't interested in fighting soldiers, they weren't half as good as fighting even your bog standard genin. At least these ones were well trained, it was just a shame that they thought muscles could win them this fight.

Sighing under her breath, she stepped towards the group of charging men. As soon as she was close enough, she ducked under a punch and grabbed the first one by the wrist. He was of course pretty heavy, but Lera was used to lifting much heavier objects than this. His arm made a sickening cracking sound as she twisted it away; dragging his body with it. Thankfully, she hadn't actually broken it; but he was definitely going to be sore for quite a while. Using the man as a shield she put him between her and another soldier; pushing him away so his back slammed against the second potential attacker.

Then, she twisted her body again and straight up kicked the man in the stomach. The strength behind the kick was enough to throw him and the man behind him to the ground. The first was out cold, the one underneath merely struggled for a few moments before pushing him off and getting up. He soon fell again, an unexpected strike just clipping the bottom of his jaw. The punch didn't seem like much, but she had done it to specifically shake up his brain. It worked and he soon dropped to ground.

There were still soldiers aiming to attack her, but they now kept their distance; circling her and waiting for the shinobi to join in. They realised now that this girl was probably a Jounin of some sort, perhaps stronger than that; they were of course wrong, but Leras eternal genin status wasn't widely known. Finally, the shinobi did join the battle; a number of genin, chuunin and even a few Jounin thrown into the mix. Lera knew she realistically didn't stand a chance of victory against these odds, but it would not be a challenge if she she won easily.

The jounin who originally spoke to her took control of the group, knowing that this could quickly get out of hand if they were left to their own devices. He moved away from her and raised his voice against the shouts "All of you form up. Ninjutsu specialists, surround her and use Ninjutsu; think small, I want no casualties here!" the group followed his orders to the letter, surrounding her in a circle and running through various different handseals. With a grin, she formed her own handseals; summoning a dome around herself for protection.

What she didn't see was the ninjutsu that got fired after. The majority of them were weak, suiton and Katon techniques rebounded from her earthen dome with ease. While A few Doton and Fuuton techniques left cracks and chips. It was the Raiton techniques that did the damage however, they ripped through earth with ease; crumbling her dome in a matter of moments. By that point however, she was already gone; underground and safe from the variety of jutsu that had threatened to pummle her.

She could almost feel the confusion, how could someone dissapear like that? The Doton users among them however, were quickly starting to put two and two together. Hiding like a mole was quite a common technique after all. She acted fast, moving behind the nearest opponent and popping up behind him. If she was clever about this, she could stop jutsu from being fired at her; the opponents would want to avoid friendly fire, or at least she hoped so. The one she appeared behind was just a genin, the girl didn't notice Leras presence until an elbow had been slammed into the back of her head. By then, it was too late and she fell to thr ground out cold.

She heard the Jounin raise his voice once more, pointing out lera's new positions "Taijutsu specialists, attack in pairs! bring her down!" now Lera was no Taijutsu specialist, even she would fall against multiple fighters if they had the chance; so she would not give them that chance. Gripping the hilt of Samehada, she pulled it from her back and swung it towards two of the shinobi already running for her. The flat edge of the blade slammed hard into the first shinobi, before pushing him to the side and directly into the second one. They were both throwing to ground, knocking heads and falling unconciouss.

This left...a lot of opponents, she could hardly count them for their sheer numbers. The soldiers outnumbered the shinobi at least three to one, but even with that Lera would soon run out of stamina and fall; it didn't matter though, she intended to push herself to the limits. Another pair of shinobi came running for her, this time on either side; they were obviously attempting to flank her. She'd also noticed so far, that only the genin had been attacking her; the chuunin and Jounin hung back in the sidelines, waiting for the right time to attack. She noted as well that there were not that many of them.

The two genin ran right for her, launching a series of telegraphic punches on either side of her. Lera didn't feel like taking it easy any more, so she channeled chakra through her skin and hardened it several times over; until it was as if her skin were made out of diamond hard steel. She ignored the first genins attacks completely, allowing fists to slam harmlessly against her hardened skin. The second one however she aimed a to the centre of his forehead. It was like she'd just whacked him in the head with a rock.

He fell back uselessly to the ground, landing in a heap. She was refraining from causing any real injuries, so the genin would wake up later with a simple headache. The first genin stepped back, nursing his sore hands and turning to run; she could've sworn she heard the words "Screw that, I ain't fucking with that monster" as he left. It wasn't the first time she'd been likened to a monster, but she disgreed with his statement...she wasn't a monster, not yet anyway.

She could see now that a good majority of the genin were starting to back away, most were either realising that their ninjutsu was useless in a large battle such as this, or they were simply losing confidence. This meant however that the higher ranks were starting to move; though there were much fewer of them, she knew that quality beat quantity any day. This is where things were going to start getting difficult. The first of her opponents ran for her, slipping a katana from its sheath and they did.

The katana was swung and Lera brought Samehada up to meet it; the chuunin was using the blunt side of the blade, sticking to sparring etiquette it seemed. This one, a chuunin by the looks of things was far more skilled than the genin; they were able to meet her strikes and attack back with great accuracy. In a straight up close combat battle, she might have lost. However, this was not one on one. Another chuunin came up behind her, launching a kick directly at her back; lera was not fast enough to react and still fight the katana wielding chuunin as well.

Instead, she let the kick land against her back and use the momentum of that strike to slam her body against the first chuunin. The chuunin dropped to the ground, allowing Lera to slam her stony palm against her forehead and knock her out. The other chuunin let out a curse under his breath and went to bring his heel down ontop of her. Lera spun back to her knees and raised her arms, catching the kick on her wrists. Even through her Domu technique she felt the jolt, this was the difference between a chuunin specialst and a genin one it seemed.

She did not intend to be beaten so easily however and quickly pulled an arm away to swing samehada at the mans single leg. She used the flat edge again to avoid damaging him but it had the intended affect. The chuunin found his balance gone and was quickly falling to the floor. Before he could regain that balance, Lera was on her feet and slamming Samehada's hilt into his kidney. He coughed up some bile before falling unconciouss at her feet. They would not be giving her time to rest however, soon another three of the chuunin were rushing at her; the first two throwing a multitude of training shuriken and the third preparing what she knew to be Gale palm.

If they were starting to combine attacks then it just meant that they finally were starting to recognise her for what she was. In order to stop the shuriken from hitting her, she would have to meet Gale palm with an even greater blast of wind. Clapping her hands together, she drew in a breath and exhaled violently towards the trio. Her breath was released in an almighty gale, slamming the oncoming shuriken to the ground and tearing their Gale palm to shreds. They found themselves stumbling a little due to her Great Breakthrough technique, but soon continued running at her. All three, it seemed, were generalists.

She would have to deal with at least two of them immediately, before they could reach her. So she formed three handseals and spat out a little bit of mud at the feet of the one closest to her. He jumped above the mud, not realising that it was rapidly construction a minature wall. His feet clipped the 'wall' and he lost his balance, beginning to fall slowly to the ground. Lera made her move then, position herself between the falling chuunin and the other two. She reached out to grasp his collar, going with a similar strategy she'd used in the beginning.

The chuunin was quickly thrown at the other two, one made the correct choice of jumping away; the other however made the mistake of catching him. With the disbalanced chuunin in her arms, the second was unable to defend herself when Lera leapt forwards with a Dynamic Entry. Slamming the full force of her weight and strength behind a single flying kick. It planted firmly in the first chuunins stomach, sending them both flying backwards to the ground. Before the woman could get up, Lera rushed over and planted her fist against her temple; flooring her as well.

The third chuunin was not sitting back and doing nothing however, she felt his kick to her hip first; followed by the punch to her back. She rolled away from him and to her knees, staring at her assailant. She was bound to get hurt eventually in a fight like this and she just did. A side effect to using Domu meant that she was incapable of using any other jutsu at the same time; she'd had to deactivate it earlier. She ignored the pain spreading in her side and back and got back to her feet, facing off against the third chuunin.

He rushed towards her, throwing a number of shuriken as he did; with a simple swing of Samehada she knocked the shuriken down and met his charge. He was severly outmatched however, with the range and sheer size of Samehada; he could do nothing to stop her swing cracking against his side and dropping him to the ground. The difference was simple, while she had the strength to bring them down in singular hits; they could not do the same to her, that was why she was winning.

However, with the sheer number she'd been defending herself against; Lera was beginning to get tired and it was showing on her face. Finally, though there were still plenty of Genin and chuunin left to fight, the Jounin took steps towards her. Including the first she'd spoken to, there were only three of them; at this point however she would struggle to beat just one of them, nevermind three at once. She wasn't going to be seen as a quitter though, so she gathered her energy and ran to meet them.

The first pulled a blade of similar size to Samehada, meeting her charge head on and matching her strength perfectly. While Lera was not physically the strongest shinobi, she was confident of her strength; it was definitely not something to laugh at. Yet, this jounin had just matched it with perfect ease. They exchanged several strikes, Lera could see he was about as skilled with the blade as she were with Samehada; but he had greater experience and greater reserves of stamina, a fact that was quickly showing.

While she exchanged strikes the other two Jounin leapt into action, sending a multitude of strikes towards her. She had no hope at all of dodging or blocking them all, she was well and truly outmatched and there was not much she could do about it. She channeled chakra through her body, hardening it once more. Their strikes landed exactly as intended, strikes she could still feel even through the hardened stone like skin. These jounin were certainly not push-overs. The first Jounin took his chance to strike, slamming the flat edge of his blade into her side just as she had done to others.

She was sent sprawling to thr ground; coughing and choking as the strike took effect. The jounins stood together, watching her rise; though it was obviously she struggled. The first jounin who had spoken before thought she was rather reckless, but admired her determination to continue despite her exhaustion and the injuries she'd sustained so far. Once she was on her feet, he approached and spoke to her once more "I think thats enough, you're very skilled but even you can't beat three Jounin. I suppose you must have been a Jounin of Kirigakure as well."

Now back on her feet, Lera started to laugh; though her breath was ladened with exhaustion she spoke anyway "Haha, you guys are great. I didn't mean what I said before, I just wanted you to fight. I'm not finished yet though, come at me until I can't get up. This...genin is ready for you." She could've sworn that his mouth hung wide enough to fit a boulder, such was his shock "A genin??? The hell, why are you still a genin; you're easily at the level of a Jounin" Lera merely shrugged, and held her blade out ready to fight once again.

This time, the genins, chuunin and even the soldiers joined back in on the fight; swarming over her with attack after attack. The Jounins stood to the side, watching in disbelief as the already exhausted Lera took attack after attack on her Domu armour, knocking people out left right and centre. She could only continue for so long however and after almost a full minute of straight fighting she dropped to the ground. She lay on her back with Samehada still firmly gripped in her hand; surrounded by conciouss and unconciouss opponents. She'd put up quite the fight but her stamina had its limits.

The Jounin came and picked her up, shaking his head with a wry grin on his face "I can't help but like your tenacity, I'll take you somewhere to rest good job Lera." he trailed off with her in his arms and placed her in one of the inns beds, paying for her stay there. He only watched her sleep for a few minutes, making sure she was okay before leaving her behind. He wondered why she was still a genin, she was more than good enough to take out most Jounin level shinobi; the title genin did not suit her at all.* - Thu Nov  5 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) 
Lera settled into an exhausted sleep, plagued by her usual nightmares; every single time failing to save those who she cared for. First there was Jin, for whome she could do nothing while Erebus murdered him and then there were Seisuke and Violet. Both she had given her heart to, only to have them wrenched away without even being there to protect them. Never again would she love someone like she had loved them; even thoughts of Nina were fading away. She assumed Nina had run after Ortho, she had picked her side and it was not with her.

At some point during her sleep, she became aware of a presence in the room; breaking her from her nightmares to look up at the perpertrator. Imagine her surprise when she saw Cain smiling down at her with a sad look in his eyes, she had thought he was dead. With a look of shock, she managed to whisper out his name; not able to hide the surprise in her tone "Cain...?" the man nodded while he looked down at her, she could see he knew everything already; it was probably quite difficult to hide the destruction of a village.

"Hello Lera...I...know what happened." Lera's gaze dropped its surprise and she turned her head to the ceiling, resuming her empty dead eyed look "What are you doing here Cain?" he sighed quietly, hearing the lack of empathy in her voice and the stone dead look in her eyes "I was worried. I hear about...Kirigakure and I had to know...had to make sure you were alright." Lera kept her stony gaze for a few moments more before releasing a sigh "Yeah I'm alive, as per usual I was not there when I was needed the most. As per usual...I survived because I'm useless."

Cain chose not to reply to that statement, sensing that Lera's demeanour was probably quite fragile at the moment "I saw you on the training field, you're as impressive as ever...maybe even more so than before. You've gotten stronger." Lera regarded him for a few moments with one opened eye, before scrunching it shut and resting back against a pillow "Not strong enough...I won't rest until I become a monster. How did you get in the village anyway, we're supposed to be on high alert." Cain almost laughed, but held himself back; he thought she was already something a monster, how she thought she needed more power he'd never know.

"I have my ways, I can be sneaky when I want to. But well...there is another reason I came here. I was hired to clear out a bandit camp a little ways into the desert, seems they've been attacking trade routes. Want to join me? I figure you could do with a trip outside." she opened her eyes again and sat up with a groan, she still ached from her fight; but she wasn't going to pass up a chance for more practice "Sure. No need to sneak out though, I can come and go as I please." Cain just shook his head, he'd forgotten that she was the kazekages daughter.

"Alright, get ready and we'll leave." with a shrug, she pulled off her covers and leapt out of the bed, her clothes were in quite a state from her last fight so she casually pulled them off and went for another pair. She was curious to see Cains reaction and was not dissapointed, he span around to face away his cheeks taking on a reddish tint. Lera was likely to miss Violet and Seisuke for her entire life, but still...her body had needs and she would probably give into those needs every now and then...just not right now.

Once she was dressed, she carefully strapped Samehada onto her back and strode towards the door "Come on then, lets go." Cain surpressed a relieved sigh and filed out of the room, leaving Lera to follow. They soon reached the village gate, the guards quickly blocking Cains paths; they had not seen him enter, so how had he got in? They moved out of the way as Lera confidently moved forward though, bowing with their apologies "Apologies Madam Lera, we didn't realise he was with you. You have permission to pass."

They were soon well on their way, leaving the village behind and taking a slow job towards an oasis. There were just a few oasis' dotted around the desert, a safe haven for those who decided to make their homes in these unforgivable wastes. With the constant heat, Lera soon found herself sweating; coating her clothes and her forehead with the sticky substance. While they jogged, she tugged at her jacket pulling it off and tieing it around her waist. This left her wearing only some tight bandages to cover her chest, a fact that did not escape Cain. She was happy to see that he was suffering from the heat just as much as she was however and he soon decided to go shirtless.

They made good time, reaching the distant oasis within an hour; they stopped there to take their fills of water and for a short rest. With a splash of fresh water on her face, Lera felt much better already. Cain however could not keep his eyes off her, she was aware of her effect on him he was sure; but she either didn't care or chose not to pursue it. He knew she was not a cruel person, so it was likely the latter; she'd been hurt so many times by the deaths of loved ones, he expected she didn't want to go through that for a third time.

Lera was indeed aware of her effect on Cain, she kept a subtle eye on him; feeling a little bad as his stares almost verged on desperation. She was no longer interested in a relationship like that, not anymore; maybe if he would have been happy with a friends with benefits sort of deal, but she knew that would not satisfy him. With a silent sigh, she gestured to Cain and set off back into the desert; the sooner she got this done the better. As night fell they decided to stop at the next oasis, which wasn't so far away from their destination. They arrived in quick time and constructed a single tent and while Cain settled inside, Lera went to bathe in the waters.

Cain emerged from the tent, looking around for Lera. He could see her outline in the waters so he took a seat with his back against a rock, despite his feelings he preserved her dignity and his. He was no pervert. After a while he became acutely aware of her settling on the other side of the rock. They sat in silence for a while before he decided to speak "Lera...You know right? You know how I feel about you...how I can't get you out of my mind. I love you Lera, won't you be with me?"

She let out a sigh, tilting her head up to the stars "I...can't Cain, I'm sorry. But I will never love again, never. I've seen too much death...lost too much. I just can't go through that again." he had expected the answer, but that didn't make it hurt any less; he had hoped...that just maybe she would change her mind "Its...okay, I understand. Friends though?" with a little relieved smile, she got up and walked around to the other side of the rock; forgetting that she had not put her clothes back on yet "Yes, friends. Always"

For a moment Cain didn't even notice her clothes...or lack thereof, he was just happy that he could still be with her; not in the way he really wanted but still. Then his eyes drifted down and went wide, his face slowly turned a healthy shade of crimson "U-uh...Lera...clothes." she followed his gaze to her unclothed body and simply said "Whoopsie, my bad. Sorry." While she trailled off around the rock to dress herself, Cain took each of his arms on a death grip; holding himself back from doing something he would eternally regret.

When she returned clothed, he released the grip on his arms and brought himself back under control; Lera took notice of it however, she could see how much he wanted her and apreciated his understanding so she threw him a bone "Things change Cain, nothing ever stays the same. A few years down the line...well who knows what will happen, just...don't wait for me. I could die any time...maybe even tomorrow, you never know." He looked up at her, understanding what she was doing and it just made him love her even more "Thank you...I think I will wait. I don't think anyone will ever kill you."

She nodded with a smile and returned to the tent, summoning a wolf to keep guard before she pulled Cain into the tent with her. She may not have wanted his love right then, but she certainly enjoyed a long cuddle. For Cain the night passed in a happy blur, Just a chance to hold Lera like this was a dream come true; even if it was just as friends, he was content with her company. They awoke in the early hours of the morning, Lera stepped out of the tent; giving her sleepy wolf a pat on the head before sending it back.

They packed up the tent in companionable silence and headed out once more. The camp wasn't so far away from here and they soon arrived. By the looks of things it was just a collection of tents with a small campfire in the middle of it all. She could see the piles of goods however and the cages...cages of what looked like women and children. It was horrible conditions to be kept in, with the glaring sun and the dry sand those in the cages wouldlast a few days at best, even with a steady supply of water.

"I...really hate bandits, they have hostages?" Cain stared grimly at the scene before him and nodded his head "So it seems...I wasn't informed of this. The ones who hired me said they will be here to collect their goods within two hours...I can only assume that means the hostages as well" Lera nodded solemly pointing a finger at the leftmost gathering of tents "Right. Maybe they didn't know about the hostages either...it makes sense. Why would a suppy train carry women and children, they're from something else. Either way, we have to finish this fast; take care of the left side, i'll take the right."

Cain nodded again and set off towards his intended targets, stealthily making his way through the sands. Lera did the same, moving towards the other side of the tents. There were guards dotted around, which made sense; not even bandits were stupid enough to leave their camp unguarded. She dispatched the first one easily, gripping him by the mouth and then shoving her fingers through the back of his neck. She was careful not to get any blood on her clothes and any on her hand was evaported by the concentrated chakra from her Hellstab. Either way, the guard died silently and quickly; alerting noone to her presence.

She quickly broke into the nearest tent, running a sharp kunai down the fabric and opening up a hole. Before that though, she made sure to make an eyehole and peek inside; it was still early hours of the morning, most of them were asleep and the inside of the tent stunk of sake. They wouldn't be waking up any time soon...indeed, they wouldn't be waking up at all. Once inside the tent, she quickly dispatched each one with a swipe to the throat. The old Lera probably would have spared them, but this new Lera was ruthless; she had to be in this broken world.

She poked her head outside the tent, gratified to see another guard moving to walk past. She pulled Samehada from her back and reached out to grab him by the collar. She made sure to get a good look at him before he hit the ground and had the point of Samehada slammed into his throat. As well as his windpipe getting crushed his neck was quickly broken, he died instantly. With his features preserved in memory, she performed a quick henge technique; transforming both her appearence and Samehada's to match the guards.

This allowed her to wander freely, it made the job almost to easy to be honest. She wandered into every tent on the right side killing all the inhabitents one by one, the few guards that were dotted around were generally pulled into a dark corner for a quick snap of the neck or a slicing of the thoat. All in all, it was a massacre. It took her no more than ten minutes to clear away the entire right side, leaving her to gaze on at the left side and wait for Cain to emerge. It didn't take him long to come out, rubbing wet sticky blood of his hands with a piece of cloth.

All in all it was a quick and clean job, they didn't even need to clean up; the desert animals would do that for them. With the bandits cleared away, they freed the hostages and Lera opened up a large hole in the sand; filling it with as much water as she could create. She'd never seen so many people so happy to see a bit of water. Then it was just a matter of settling down to wait for Cain's client to arrive. It didn't take long, it was a cheery man with a shiny bald head and one hell of a moustache. Cain shook his hand and accepted the money, before letting the man take the goods and the hostages to safety.

All that was left was the long trip home, a trip in which they still stayed almost completely silent; Lera always like to keep quiet after a job like that, she still didn't enjoy killing even if she knew it was necessary. By nightfall, they arrived back at Sunagakure and Cain was treated to a tight hug from Lera "Thanks for letting me come with you, I needed to get out and do something." Cain laughed a little and pat her back "I'll think of you if I get another job then shall I?" Lera smile up at him and stepped away "Right, you know where to find me" with a little nod, he turned away to leave waving over his shoulder while Lera headed back into Sunagakure for a long shower and well earned rest.* - Thu Nov  5 15:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) widened her eyes as the giant snake appeared, clearly the rumors were not true and this was just Ortho in disguise. As soon as the snake appeared, she channeled chakra to the ground and dissapeared underneath; hopefully avoiding the subsequent gust of wind. From there, she 'swam' a short distance away and began planning her next move.* - Fri Nov  6 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) (*Ketsu brings his right hand to his mouth, clamping down on his thumb and subtly allowing a trickle of blood to expel from the wound. He quietly smears the blood in his opposing, forming a quick succession of handseals afterwards. No words were said, no sudden movements were made. He acts completely casual as he crouched down and placed the smeared palm on to the grassy ground. Just as he did so, the immediate area is engulfed in a shroud of white smoke.
 
Out from behind the smoke came a massive purple snake, charging toward Lera's general area. Of course, since Manda, the name of the snake, knew of the current plan, he'd purposely avoid the Mizukage. Ketsu, who was placed on top of Manda's head would string together another series of handseals, allowing his chakra to knead within his stomach. Afterwards, when the handseals were complete, he'd inhale one powerful time. His lips pucker and his chest deflate, unleashing a powerful gust of wind toward Lera.*)

Once she was out, she didn't stop; she kept going upwards flying away. Assuming the snake didn't stop her somehow, she would continue rising into the sky with one eye kept on what she now knew to be Ortho. Reaching behind her back, she would also grip Samehada's hilt; ready to use it to counter Ninjutsu if need be.* - Fri Nov  6 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was unfortunately swallowed her, she cursed as the mouth closed around her; but there was no way in hell she would make it easy for the beast. If anything, Ortho had likely just spelled the beasts doom by having it swallow her. As she'd already been reaching for Samehada, she did the most logicial thing with it and attempted to turn it sideways in order to lodge it and herself within the snakes throat. Then, just to make matters worse for it; she channeled Fuuton chakra to her spare hand and began jabbing at the soft skin around her.* - Fri Nov  6 20:03:12 2015
