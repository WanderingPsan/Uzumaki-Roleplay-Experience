<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) fell into step behind a group of genin, heading into the training fields. Lera hardly ever went into the fields, usually because she prefered to train alone but today she felt like training with a group. It was more out of curiosity, she'd only really seen a select few in action; so it would be good to gauge how strong the others were. The field mostly consisted with groups of genin training with friends. Though there were a few chuunin and even the odd Jounin here and there.

After viewing her surroundings, Lera took up a position by one of the training logs. There were genin on either side of her, either practicing with shuriken or striking logs directly with their fists. Lera however had a jutsu to learn, the log would make the perfect target for it. Slipping a hand into her jacket, she took out a scroll and unfurled it; beginning the slow process of reading through it bit by bit. Given to her by Fujitora, she'd more or less guessed that it would be a Katon type jutsu, but not one like this.

She ignored the odd looks other genin were giving her, un-aware that most genin would not usually know much more than a handfull of D-rank jutsu. Most just ignored her assuming she was just some overly ambitious genin, a few of the chuunin and a Jounin however, looked on in interest; curious to see what this little genin could do. Lera continued to look down at the scroll, oblivious to the people watching her. The jutsu she needed to learn appeared to be a difficult one, however it was no more difficult than the other Katon jutsus she'd already learned.

After a few minutes, she had a good idea of what the jutsu was meant to do; a powerful katon jutsu, one she could use in conjunction with Earth Dragon Bullet. Just recently it had been getting to a point that she knew so many jutsu, that it was difficult to decide what was the best jutsu to use in a battle as many of her jutsu could make a difference. Then there was her latest jutsu, the Domu technique; which actually gave her a chance in close quarters. All she needed now was to improve her speed against the faster types and she would be unstoppable.

The training for that however, could come much later; right now she would focus on learning the Katon technique. The technique in question was called Fire Dragon Bullet, it was similar to the flamethrower technique in the way it worked albeit, more powerful and much more concentrated. Unlike the Fireball jutsu which spread the flames over a larger area, this one concentrated them into a straight and steady stream. Now that she had a good idea of what the Jutsu was supposed to do, she wrapped the scroll back up and tucked it into one of her hidden pockets. She could give this to Seisuke for his collection later.

With only one handseal required for the jutsu, performing it actually seemed like it would be rather simple; though from experience, Lera knew it wouldn't be. First, she gathered the chakra into her stomach and called it upwards to her throat. She treated the jutsu the same way she did with Fireball and Flamethrower, holding both hands to her mouth and exhaling through them; igniting her breath with flames on its way out. She tried concentrating the flames into a straight line; but it was much harder than it seemed. Instead of accomplishing what she needed, she ended up spitting out a weak stream that fell barely a metre in front of her.

She didn't see the smirks from the nearby genin, who assumed she was pushing higher than her station. Nor did she see the looks of surprise from the chuunin and Jounin, who realised that most would not accomplish so much on their first attempt. In what was only mild interest before, the higher ranked audience now viewd her with avid curiosity; surprised that they hadn't heard of such a skilled genin before. Lera, as per usual was still completely oblivious to all the attention she was recieving; this sort of training was simply normal for her.

Unperturbed by her failure, she began gathering her chakra for a second attempt; already in her mind running through what might have gone wrong. Some might have called Lera a genius, Hassan often referred to her a prodigy; Lera however put it down to hard work and effort. No matter how much talent someone had, it was useless if you didn't work for it. With chakra in her throat and the correct seal performed, she blew out the air through her fingers once again. This time, the flames reached the training log; but proved too difficult to keep concentrated and they dispersed after a few moment; leaving the log blackened and scorched.

All eyes were on her now, even the other genin were beginning to realise that she was learning this jutsu far quicker than normal. The Jounin who'd been watching her from the start had now come to stand close behind her, causing Lera to finally notice him there. Now that she'd noticed the Jounin, she noticed all the other watching her too. Her cheeks reddened a little and she tried to blot them all out, she could almost feel their eyes on her. After a few deep breaths, she managed to push all that away and focus on the task at hand; getting ready to try the jutsu for what she hoped was the last time.

After a few moments, chakra was gathered in her throat and she was ready to go; by now she was an old-hand at this, though she could never get used to the taste of flames they somehow tasted metalic. With her hands funneled against her mouth, she blew; letting her chakra infused breath ignite on its way out. After it was all over, she was standing before half of a smoking training log; the top half having been burned entirely from existence. What had come from her mouth was an intensely concentrated line of fire, all the strength of a Fireball condensed into a thin stream.

Soon, she was aware of a clapping sound coming from behind her; so she turned to see the Jounin clapping slowly with a bemused look on his face. He was wearing the typical Jounin attire and he looked to be in his early twenties, Lera could immediately see that he was nothing compared to Hassan, or even Fujitora. He may well be weaker than she was. Once again, Lera was un-aware that not all the higher ranks were so strong; it was simply that the people she knew were stronger than average.

Still clapping the jounin opened his mouth to speak "Very impressive for a genin, You're an elementalist specialising in Katon then?" from that, Lera began to realise that she and her friends probably were much greater than the average. So to answer his question, she merely shook his head and said "No, I'm atually better at Fuuton and Doton; Though katon is better than my Raiton and I do use a little genjutsu to compliment. Oh and my summoning jutsu too."

While she listed all this off, the Jounins eyes would widen his mouth falling open in disbelief. That only confirmed her suspisions, while Lera was used to seeing people with this sort of skill; clearly it was not the norm. After a few moments, the man seemed to recover; shaking his head slowly and looking at Lera with a new found respect "If thats true, then I'm extremely surprised. Having just two elements is quite a feat, but four? And to have a summoning too. Are you some kind of prodigy?"

Lera had to roll her eyes at that, why everyone always equated being strong to being a prodigy she would never know "No, I Just work hard and I have a good master. Though Hassan-sensei can be a little lazy sometimes, he taught me well." the Jounin took in a sharp intake of breath, before letting out an apreciative whistle "Now that explains a lot, taught by Hassan eh? No wonder you're so skilled. That guy's a monster. Say, want to have a little spar with me? It'd be good to see how good you really are."

With a shrug and a nod, Lera stepped forward into the more open area; mainly used for spars if the damage to the ground was anything to go by. The Jounin took up a position across from her gesturing for her to go first, his face held a look of absolute confidence; he was sure he could win. Lera felt like educating him, though she knew it was possible to kill him if she wasn't careful enough. So first she formed a single handseal and summoned three clones to stand with her. The jounin raised an eyebrow at that, assuming the clones were fake illusions; little did he know, they were very very real.

Bringing his hand together in a clap, the Jounin took a deep breath and exhaled violently towards Lera; she knew full well the jutsu he was using as she used it quite often herself. Her and all three of the clones responded in kind; all clapping their hands together and repeating the same actions as him. The ensuing gale had their audience holding on tightly to the nearest stable object. Ultimately, her jutsu won out; blowing the gale towards the Jounin and throwing him off his feet. She was surprised though, it was difficult to tell which would have won without the clones; he was better with Fuuton than expected.

While the jouning slowly got this his feet, one of her clones would prepare a large puddle of mud to which Lera directed her chakra and formed a large Dragon head. The second clone prepared to fire another jutsu, while the third held what looked like balls of flame in its hands. When the Jounin got up and saw all this, he held his hand up in surrender and shook his head "You're a monster, theres no way I can beat that. How are in the world are you still a genin?? You're far stronger than most chuunin, perhaps as strong as the average Jounin."

After hearing this, Lera would drop her hands and let her various jutsu disperse along with the clones. It was true, she didn't know why she'd never been promoted. Tethys had promoted a lot of other people, Jin had even become the chuunin commander. All but Himura had died, she was sure she could have beaten all of them if it came to a battle; but still, she'd been left at a genin. It didn't bother her so much, but it was still a sore spot "I don't know, Tethys never deemed it fit to promote me. I'm sure he had his reasons though."

She didn't bother to wait for his reply, there was no reason to stay here and no real reason to come back. It seemed she wouldn't be getting much out of practicing with the people here, it made sense now why most everyone she knew trained alone or with others like her. The average fodder, simply wasn't good enough.* - Thu Oct  1 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a long walk through the village, bored and indifferent of her surroundings. Lately everything had been far too quiet, with the distinct feeling that something was looming on the horizon. Not just that, but everyone Lera knew seemed to be dieing. First Jin and now Setsuna too, Lera found herself distinctly unbothered by all this; which could be worrying in itself, but she'd seen to much to care anymore. She thought back to what she'd said to Seisuke 'you make me care again' and it was true, when she was with Seisuke; everything just felt...right.

That was why, when he wasn't around, she got so bored; she could only train so much a day, then she was left to her own devices. She considered going home to play on the piano, or on her newly aquired harp; it was good to get back into music like this, another benefit Seisuke had brought into her life. She could see clearly her years ahead with him, first marriage, then children and then a long happy life until they grew old and died together. It was a nice dream to have, even if she knew it was far-fetched an unlikely. The life of a shinobi was a perilous one, either of them could die at any time.

When she thought about losing Seisuke like that, little shudders of horror ran down her spine. If he died, then so would she; in spirit if not in body. She would hunt down whoever caused it and destroy them, or die in the attempt. She was more aware as of late that Seisuke may actually be stronger than she was, true she was more skilled in Ninjutsu than he was but whatever she threw at him; he could probably throw back in kind. With his larger pools of chakra, in a fight he would certainly last longer. That being said, she could never lay a hand on him; just the thought of hurting him sent a wave of repulsion through her.

Instead, they'd taken to helping each other with their techniques and learning whatever the other knew. She had to aknowledge that they made an excellent team, perfectly in sync with each other and both strong enough to level a group of enemies. She thought back to what that Fodder Jounin had called her, a 'monster' he had said. She liked the sound of it, if the two of them trained together and got strong enough...she could imagine the names. The 'monster couple', she kind've liked the sound of it; it sent littler shivers of delight down her spine. She was fed up of living in fear of enemies. One day, it would be their turn to fear her.

After a while, she noticed how far she'd come. She'd come out of civilization and was stood now by the ocean, facing out to see. She recalled then how much of a fool she'd made of herself, when Seisuke had tried to teach her how to swim. She had thought she could do it, but the fear was so overpowering that she simply siezed up and fell apart. He had been so nice back then, so understanding of her pain; had even blamed himself for putting her through it. She couldn't imagine him being cruel to others, though she knew he did have that in his nature. Not that she cared, for him she would travel any path; even a path of darkness.

A slight crunch behind her alerted her to a presence, someone had been following her. She cursed herself for her stupidity, Seisuke had even said that Kirigakure was not quite as safe as it could be and now she was going to pay the price of not paying attention. She whirled around to face whoever was following her and stepped back in surprise. It was a big man, heavily muscled and wearing a tight black suit suited for battle and travel. He wasn't wearing any insignia's but that didn't mean anything. What surprised her was his attire, if he'd wanted to go covert he'd have worn something less obvious.

For a while they exchanged looks, until the man finally opened his mouth to speak "Are you Lera?". She cursed herself again for coming out here alone, but forced herself to remain passive. If he knew her name then that meant he was here looking for her, why anyone would be looking for her was a mystery however. Maybe it had something to do with Seisuke, a genin dating a Gezo prince was sure to raise a few eyebrows. However, the more she looked at the situation; the more it seemed like he wasn't here to fight. If he had wanted to kill her, he would not have stopped to talk.

Taking a few deep breaths, Lera decided to get as much information from him as possible. Though she didn't bother to answer his first question, they both knew he'd already found what he was looking for "Why are you looking for me?" the man nodded his head, as if affirming what he already knew "I've been hired by your mother to come get you out of Kirigakure, she no longer feels that its safe for you here."

For a while, Lera simply stared at him; processing that information. Her mother wanted her back? That was rich, considering they hadn't spoken in nearly four years now. Why would the woman want her back now? "You realise that I have not spoken to my mother in years right? That woman is no longer family to me. Besides, I'm a shinobi I'm fully aware of the danger in this job and can take care of myself." the man simply shook his head and held out his hand "Its not my job to question it miss, whether she's your mother or not I've been hired to come get you. She gave me permission to use force if necessary."

Lera took another moment to have a proper look at him, if he'd been hired then he was a mercenary. It was unlikely that he had any sort of shinobi training, though it was still possible he did "You understand that I could probably kill you without really trying no?" he set his mouth in a grim line, crossing setting his stance in an attempt to assert at least a little authority "I'm aware that is a possibility miss, but I'm simply doing my job" Lera smirked in amusement, the man had some balls he had to give him that.

After a few moments of tense silences she stepped forward in the most non-threatening way possible and nodded her head "Alright, I'll go with you if only to tell my mother when she can shove her 'safety'. However, I would like to hire you afterwards to escort me back. Deal?" the Man's body sagged with visible relief, and he nodded his agreement "Thank you miss, I can agree to those terms. If you would like to follow me." He stepped away and turned heading for where the bridge used to be, she could vaguely see a waiting ferry settled in the water. Of course it had to be a boat, with a resigned sigh; she set off after him, already thinking through all the the ways she could tell her mother to fuck off.

As soon as they reached the water, she noted the distinct lack of a paddleboat; judging by the mans confused expression, there was supposed to be one waiting to take them to the ferry. Her suspicions were soon confirmed when he spoke "There should be a boat here....theres something wrong. We may have to swim it." Lera practically growled her disagreement with that, there was no way she'd even attempt swimming that "Oh hell no, I'm not swimming to that boat, no way. I'm going to walk instead and if you don't want to get wet, I suggest you get on my back." The man simply stared at her, looking confused and a little amused "No offense miss, but I doubt you can carry me."

Instead of replying, Lera flowed Doton chakra across her skin; feeling the increase in her physical strength from the jutsu "Are you going to sit and stare all day, or are you going to get on my back. Unless you actually wanted to get wet." he kept silent for a few moments before tentatively stepping forwards and trying to saddle himself on her back. It was difficult for him to do, considering his size compared to hers. However, he was lifted easily thanks to Lera's increased strength though his long legs dangling at her side was almost comical "You...are rather strong for your size miss."

She didn't bother telling him how she did it, instead she took a step onto the water and began walking over it as if it were as solid as any floor. This left the man staring down at her feet with bugged out eyes and an expression of disbelief, he had to remind himself never to take a job involving shinobi; they were just not normal. Despite everything, Lera was enjoying herself. She sometimes forgot what it was like for people who weren't shinobi, to see one in action was often surprising and a little scary. It was nice to show off to someone who had obviously had very little experience in dealing with shinobi.

Soon enough they reached the ferry, it was immediately clear that something was wrong. It was far too quiet for one, they'd been expecting the hustle and bustle of a ferry preparing to depart. Instead they were met with absolute silence. Still holding the man on her back, they took a circle around the ferry and found something disurbing. Tied to the far side of the ferry was a much small boat, hidden from the eyes of anyone who bothered to look from the village. It was a small boat, built for speed and big enough to hold ten to fifteen people. Whoever had been on it was now on the ferry and Lera had a feeling it wasn't for a good reason.

They viewed the boat for another few minutes before a cough alerted them to the presence of someone still on it. If there had been more than one, it would probably not be so quiet; so it seemed likely they only had a single person to deal with. Her mercenary friend seemed to want to get on the boat, but instead Lera held up a hand and then reached into her holster. She pulled out a single shuriken and held it ready to be thrown. She aimed for the other side of the boat, having the shuriken land in the water with a loud splash. While the two of them duck behind the hull, a man came rushing out of the boats cabin looking over the water where the splash had originated from.

With his back to the pair, they could take a proper look at him. He was wearing your typical seafarers clothes, a bandanna tied around the top of his head an a cutlass at his waist. He was clearly some form of pirate and Lera would wager that the rest of his crewmates were on the ferry, looting whatever valuables they could take. The mercenary gestured for her to lift him over the boats edge, to which she complied. He landed quietly on the boat, his soft padded shoes taking all sound from his footsteps. The pirate hadn't even known what had hit him, one moment he was stood looking for potential invaders. The next, large hands had him round the mouth and neck; twisting visciously with a great crack.

Lera winced at the sound of his neck breaking, it wasn't a pleasent sound by all means and it actually left her feeling a little bit sick. She hadn't intended to kill him, though she saw that it was necessary. She listened to the splash of the pirates body hitting the water and jumped up onto the boat, giving the mercenary a grim nod. He looked as if he were going to steal the boat and sail them to safety, but Lera had other ideas "No, we're going on that ferry and dealing with these pirates. Don't try to argue with me." he stared at her for a while, a single raised eyebrow. He seemed to be re-evaluating what he'd though of her "If you say so miss, I'll follow your lead and my name is Cain."

She nodded, feeling a little guilty about not asking for his name sooner; but there were more important things at hand. She looked up at the ferry, noting the grappling hooks attached to the boats edge and the ropes trailing down int the water. Obviously thats how the pirates had gotten on board and thats how they would get on board too. She gestured for him to grab a rope and star climbing while she hoppe back onto the water. Before she climbed herself, she had to sink the boat. She formed her hand into a blade and channeled fuuton chakra into it, slicing it through the hull like a hot knife through butter. The boat immediately began taking on water and would soon sink if left un-attended.

Cain watched from halfway up the ferry's side, the girl was surprising him more and more every second they spent together. He was growing more aware by the minute that the shinobi world was too big for him, this girl was a genin and if a genin was this strong what could a chuunin or Jounin do. For now, he simply vowed to never take a Shinobi based job again; the weakest shinobi could probably put him down in a moment. It was a little scary, yet also enlightening. He waited for Lera to climb the boat, trying not to be surprised when she just walked up the side as if it were the most natural thing to do. She'd been able to walk on water, so of course this much was possible.

The two quietly slipped over the ferry edge, looking around the deserted deck. Lera, formed a handseal and created five clones; she was surprised with herself, she'd already used quite a large amount of chakra but to still have so much left was impressive. She used the clones to scour the boat, covering it in a much faster time than if Cain and Lera had searched alone. The clones endeavoured to stay hidden and out of the way, so as not to be heard or spotted. If the pirates had hostages, it would be bad if they were noticed. It didn't take long for the pirates to be found, there was a group of four in the dining area; surrounding a huddle of civilians and several crew members. As soon as the clone spotted them, it dispersed itself and sent that knowledge to Lera.

Soon after that, the clones found the rest; all searching one by one through rooms and storage, looting whatever they could get their hands on. There was about eight in total, making the total number of pirate twelve. Thirteen if the first they'd killed was counted. She relayed this information back to Cain, who shook his head. With a frown Lera said "Is there something wrong?" Cain just let out a strained laugh and replied with "No miss, I'm just shocked. I had no idea just how powerful a shinobi was, I fear I would not stand a chance If I were forced to battle one. If you're just a genin, then I'm terrified of what a chuunin could do" 

Sudden understanding flooded Lera, of course he wouldn't really know much of how a shinobi was "Ah, don't worry too much. Yes I'm a genin, but i'm closer to the level of a Jounin. I simply have yet to be promoted, remember that rank doesn't mean anything. Though there are plenty of shinobi more powerful than I am, just hope you don't meet them." Cain listened to this with more than a little relief, it was good to hear that Lera was actually much stronger than her rank suggested it gave him a little more confidence in himself "I'm glad to hear that Miss, now do you have a plan? I assume you wish to free the hostages before taking on the remaining pirates"

Lera nodded and formed another handseal to create a clone before she relayed her plan. It was a simple on really, she would literally swagger into the dining area and put the pirates off guard before wiping them out. It would be quite easy really, as long as they didn't do anything stupid. Cain seemed a little hesitant with the plan, it would be putting his charge in the direct line of danger which did not sit right with him at all. Even if she could beat him with an arm tied behind her back, he didn't know that she was actually phyically weak and had to use jutsu to supplement herself; but what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him "Are you sure about this miss? It seems a little reckless." Lera just smiled and nodded her head "Trust me, A little bit of confidence gets them of their guard. They won't even realise until its too late.

With Cain pacified, she led him to the dining hall and left him hiding in the shadows. She kept two of her clones towards the back in case more of the pirates returned, but for now she would enact the plan. As casual as could be, she wandered into the hallway; with a clone striding right next to her. The clone appeared by all rights, to look like an exact copy of Violet thanks to the Henge technique. Behind its back, it held both palms open; with them crackling from an electrical current. Lera opened her mouth, trying to make herself look as queasy as possibly "H-hello boys...I think I'm gonna hurl, could someone get me a barf bag??" the pirates exchanged surprised and confused looks, none acting towards the hostages. Just how Lera wanted it.

Then with as much authenticism as she could muster, she lurched her head forwards and made a barfing sound at the same time gathering her chakra for a jutsu. It was lucky this jutsu required no handseals, it was perfect for something like this. Expelling from her mouth was a thick, dark brown mud. It actually did look as if she were just puking, but by the time the pirates had noticed that she was 'puking' far too much. It was already too late. The mud swirled around the hostage, spreading across the feet of all the pirates but leaving each and every hostage clean. Once every pirate was covered, she jumped back leaving the pirates just enough time to shout "What the hell??!" before her clone/violet jumped forwards and slammed her hands onto the mud.

The mud acted as a conductor, spreading arcs of lightning along it and anyone unfortunate enough to be stuck in it. This mean that all four pirates were suddenly overcome with powerful electric shocks. The charge lasted for a few moments, when it stopped; the pirates all dropped to the ground, twitching and groaning in the mud. A moment later, Cain came rushing in; surveying the scene and then looking to Lera "The rest of them heard that, they're on their way" Lera perked her ears and noticed the shouts resounding through the boat, they would be here in a minute tops. Her clones would hold them, probably even knock a few down; but two against eight were not good odds. She ushered Cain into the room and had her clone resume its original appearence.

First off, she looked towards the hostages; noticing that the sounds of fighting were now coming from the hallway, her clones were holding their own it seemed "Is anyone injured at all?" this was followed by a chorus of no's and thankyou's, many of them were standing now and working the creaks out of their joints. One of the crew members stepped forward and saluted to her, a sign she realised that she liked "Captain Saffron Ma'am, You're a shinobi from the village yes? Its good to have you here." Lera gave him a smile and a nod, waving her hand at him "Yes, I'm from the village but they didn't send me. It was just luck that we intended to take this ferry across the ocean. Oh and there's no need to salute, i'm just a genin. Though don't worry, the Pirates will be dealt with very soon."

The Captain nodded and went back towards the hostage, leaving Lera to her job. She gave a sudden jolt when she was overcome with a rush of knowledge. Her clones had fallen and their knowledge was now hers "My clones are down, they took three of the pirates with them before running out of chakra. Theres five on their way now." she didn't bother to wait for a reply from Cain, she knew he would stand and fight off the pirates with her. Even if she didn't need the help, it was better to have someone to protect the hostages. Before the pirates came down the hallway, she spat out more mud; coating the hallway with it. She didn't intend to use the same method as before, instead she would use this as a chance for some training.

Soon, the pirates were visible; running towards them with cutlasses outstretched ready to strike. The hallway was only big enough for two to run side by side, which made it easier to bring them down. The one at the back followed his fellow pirates at a slower pace, he was obviously the captain; sporting a large claymore and an air of authority around him. She thought to leave Cain to deal with him, it would be good to see how he fought. Using the mud she'd created moments before, she formed her hand seals and had a large draconic head rise from the mud. A bright light appeared in the dragons maw, before it fired off several balls of hardened mud at high speeds. The two Pirates in the front could do nothing as they were peppered by these bullets.

She watched as the two pirates fell, groaning and with several broken bones; but alive. The other two pirates almost turned and ran, but their fear of their leader was obviously greater than their fear of Lera and thuy they continued charging. Lera covered her skin in Doton chakra, darkening and hardening it till it had the consistency of stone. A shinobi would still be able to harm her, but a few pirates would stand no chance at all. She pointed Cain in the direction of the leader, giving him the go ahead to take him down. Lera on the other hand took the other two. She was comparitively bad at Taijutsu compared to most, but the pirates simply couldn't hurt her. They swung their cutlas' at her, but she would simply catch the blades on her arms.

She let this go on for a while, the blades completely incapable of even scratching her stone skin; but even she grew bored of playing with them. As they swung their Cutlas' she simply caught them on the palms of her hands and squeezed. They snapped like twig, the metal bending to her will with ease. The pirates themselves couldn't believe what was happening, they simple stared down at their broken weapons with sheer disbelief. Until the little girl infront of them plunged her fists into their stomachs, forcing them to double over in pain. Then it all went black, hardned elbows slamming into the back of their heads; knocking them out entirely.

Now done with the pirates, Lera turned to see how Cain was doing and she had to say she was impressed. He fought with perfect fluidity and deadly grace, every blow he struck was precise and mean to cause severe injury. She watched while he slowly took the leader apart, piece by agonising piece. Eventually, he was left stood over a broken man; with bones jutting out all over the place and injuries that would take months to heal "That...was pretty impressive Cain, if you can fight like that I don't know what you're worried about." Cain replied with a simple smirk, if Lera was impressed with his fighting skills then maybe he really did have nothing to worry about.

The two turned to the group hostages who'd been watching the entire scene with shocked gasps and eyes full of awe. There weren't many people who'd seen a shinobi fight up close and lived, for them; this was something to idolize. The Captain rushed up to the pair and saluted again "Excellent work! We'll take it from here, you two go up and have a rest; we'll head for the other side in a few. Don't worry about the fare, you've more than payed it already." Lera gave the man a tentative smile, gave the group a wave who cheered in response. Assumign Cain would follow her, she wandered off and found somewhere quiet to sit down and rest.

Cain followed the powerful little girl in silence, she had to be barely a teenager and yet she could fight the way she did. It sickened him to think of what a person had to go through to gain that level of skill, he was both impressed and a little sad. Children had no place fighting in battles like this. So he did something he was never supposed to do, he actually cared for her well-being "Miss? Are you feeling okay? This must be a lot for one so young to take in?" Lera looked back at the big man, surprised he actually cared enough to ask "I'm just a little tired, don't worry. I've seen and been through far worse than this."

He lowered his head a little, avoiding gzing directly into those eyes. They were eyes a child should never have, the eyes of a person who'd seen too much. Above all, her eyes were old; betraying more experience in life than most grown men. He had to wonder if all shinobi were like this, the children especially; there was no innocence in her anymore, whatever she'd seen and done had wiped that away "Excuse me if I'm intruding miss, but are you sure? You must barely be a teenager, noone your age should have to do what you do." Cain was surprising her more and more, at first he'd seemed completely without emotion; he would have made a great shinobi is what she though, but now...she thought he cared to much for that job.

"Honestly? No I'm not fine, I'm fifteen years old and i've seen more friends die than men twice my age, but i stopped caring a while ago. Now the only person who can make me care is the man I love. Is that strange to hear from a fifteen year old? It shouldn't be, because there are shinobi younger and stronger than me who've been through worse." Cain stared at her open mouthed, reforming his opinion of her. She'd seen more than any one person should ever see and she had not broken. Sure, she was synical and perhaps even a little bitter; but even she had someone she loved. Normally, he'd have scoffed at a girl her age talking of love; but even if she was fifteen in body, her mind was far older. She knew what she wanted, he was starting think he'd rather prefer if she wasn't taken. Though he immediately shook such thoughts from his mind, he was nearly ten years her senior.

After that outburst, they remained in silence; Lera sat with her back against a wall and her eyes closed, recuperating what chakra she'd lost. Cain sat in silence watching her, he found himself looking at her more often than he should; she was attractive he supposed, beautiful even. If she had been older he might have even considered her, but the way it stood; it was impossible, he was her guardian and she his charge. Nothing more and nothing less. After a few minutes she cracked open her eye and stared at him, she had been able to feel his gaze the entire time "What? Why're you staring at me?" Cain quickly scrambled to find an excuse and came out with "You said you had a man you love. Who? You don't have to tell me, I'm just curious"

For a moment she smiled with such genuined warmth, Cain was shocked into silence. Beautiful...yes she was definitely beautiful; he could only imagine what sort've woman she would grow into. Her reply is what broke him from those thoughts "His name is Seisuke. He was the first man who really seemed to care for me...when I'm with him, everything just seems...perfect." Cain wasn't surprised, he'd heard that name and for good reason. Who hadn't heard the name of the Gezo prince. He'd heard rumors of his cruelty though rumors were never entirely accurate. It made sense though, if this girl was going to attract anyone; it made sense that she would attract a prince.

With that, they stayed quiet for the rest of the trip; Coming to rest in a small port not far from her mothers estate. So with a heavy heart, Cain took the girls hand and walked her there; he had a bad feeling, a feeling that she might harm or even kill her family. If that was the case, he would have to fight her and he wasn't sure if he could. Though she acted hard and cold as she had every right to be, he'd seen the kind heart hidden underneath; he found that he actually liked her quite a lot, unlike her shrill and annoying mother. It took an hour for the two to reach the estate, they walked at a relatively slow pace; with Lera growing more and more tense as they got closer. In truth, she was scared; scared that she might not be able to resist her mothers orders. She remembered the better days when her mother had been kinder and warmer, could she really push those aside?

Finally, they walked through the estates gates; moving confidently past servants who whispered amongst themselves "Is that her? Gods, she's beautiful!" They kept with their walking until they came to a large room, a man with hard lined face sat behind a desk at the end of it. She recognised the man immediatel, it was her stepfather; the reason her mother changed so much. Without even a word, the man gestured to the side a row of bodyguards sliding from a door followed closely by her mother. A bag of money was thrown towards Cain and a shooing motion was made in his direction. Despite herself, Lera didn't want him to leave; she need someone with her now more than ever. So she pulled out another bag of money and handed it to him "I'm hiring you and you're first order is to stay with me."

Cain didn't even bother taking the money "No can do Miss, I only take payments after the service has been done. Just tell me what you want done and I'll do it" Lera let out a little laugh, ignoring the look of astonishment on her mothers face "Well, okay; but for my second order. Call me Lera please, none of that 'Miss'" Cain's answering smile was a toothy grin, he was definitely enjoying himself. Anything to stick it to that vile woman "Sure thing Lera. Anything else?" Lera just shook her head and took a step forward "Just stay with me for now."

Her mother couldn't hold herself back any longer, she stepped forwards with a furious look etched into her makeup plastered face "How dare you! I hired you, not her! Now leave! Before I have the guards drag you out." Cain simply stared into the womans face with a look of Nonchalance "No can do ma'am, you paid me to bring her here and so I did. Whatever happens after that is not my problem. And I dont't think it should be me you're worried about, but her" her mother looked at her then, properly for the first time in years. She saw what she was dealing with, she saw the isignia of a kirigakure shinobi and she saw the hardened look in her eyes and she was scared. At that moment her step father stood up, having been watching the scene with a cold calculation "Enough, guards take her and throw that man out. She must be ready for the wedding as soon as possible."* - Thu Oct  1 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) could hardly believe what she was hearing, she'd heard of marriages between noble families before; but they were seriously trying to marry her off? She looked towards Cain briefly, seeing that he was staring at her; just one simple wink from him was enough, she knew that these people held no power over her. She looked to her mother, seeing her for what she was; a broken and tired old woman, used to getting whatever she wanted. Then she looked at her step father, a man who held the appearence of someone much harder than he really was. On the underneath, she saw him for the pig he really was "I'm afraid thats not going to happen. You see, you either let me leave here and never bother me again. Or I burn this entire place down. Make your pick."

Her step father seemed to smile, though there was no warmth or emotion in it; only anticipation of what he could do to this beautiful little girl later and it made her sick. He nodded his head to the guards who all began moving forwards; she immediately saw how pathetic they were, weaker than the pirates and used to a cushy life. In answer to the signs of agression, Lera swung her fingers at a nearby pillar; slicing through it with a single swipe. This was merely a show of strength, as moments after she created two balls of flame in her palms and stared directly at her step father. This little show had already stopped the guards, who had only now realised that they were dealing with a shinobi "Oh no way, nobody said she'd be a shinobi. I ain't messing with that man"

Her step father had widened eyes, surprised by the show and unaware that this was completely nothing compared to what she could really do "Now, are you going to let me go? Just so you know, this is quite literally nothing. I'm capable of wiping everything out in this room with a single attack If I want. I would rather not kill you all though." the man watched her for a few moments, trying to decide if she was being serious. He saw the coldness in her eyes and the power there too, she could do it and she would do it. So he made a calculated decision "Fine, guards stand down. You may go. But don't think we'll continue paying for your life"

Lera merely laughed and started to walk away "I make more money daily as a shinobi than you've sent me in a life time. Now, I never want to hear from any of you again. As far as I'm concerned, my only family is an old man by the name of Hassan." throughout the entire thing, her mother had been completely silent; merely watching her daughter with widened eyes, all she could remember was a shy helpless little girl. Now she was looking at a woman...a powerful woman and it made her jealous. She didn't even say a word as her child walked out of the building and away from the estate.

Back outside again, Lera walked with a new skip in her step; she felt as if she'd been freed of an immense burden. Her thoughts were interrupted by Cain "Are you okay Lera? You seem...happier" Lera replied with a great big grin, a genuine one "Yep, I've never been better" Cain had a thought then, looking at her and understanding where her strength might come from "When you said Hassan...you meant THE Hassan. Muhammed, Hassan. Right?" Lera gave off a little giggle, a bit surprised that Hassan was so well known "Yep, he's my sensei and i kinda see him as a dad." Cain shook his head, shocked into silence once again; it seemed Lera knew all of the big figures.

The trip back was uneventful, no pirate attacks or any such thing. They spent most of it in companionable silence, Lera wondering if Seisuke had missed her and Cain wondering what his feelings for Lera were about. Eventuall, they got off the ferry and stood on the shore around Kirigakure. Lera went to give Cain his payment, but he just shook his head "No, your company was more than enough payment. I won't keep you from Seisuke for too long, but remember....if ever things don't work out with him. Come and find me." Lera didn't have a chance to reply as he sprinted off, leaving her with a shocked look on her face. She had noticed that he was getting closer during the trip..but not that close. With a confused sigh, she set off back for the village. Intent on heading home for a long and well deserved rest.* - Thu Oct  1 13:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lay her back against a tree, a small candle held tightly in her fingers. She was practicing her control over Katon, which right now wasn't so great. It was easily one of her most powerful offenses, so she needed to amp it up a bit. She'd already experienced first hand the sort of power a wind technique combine with a Fire technique could produce. If she were to improve the power behind her Katon now as well, she could only imagine the sort of devestation that would be possible.

The wick of her candle remained clear of flames, until she concentrated a little bit of chakra to the tip and watched it ignite. This training was honestly a little too easy for her, she had already learned and mastered the katon flow technique. Causing a candle to light was painfully simple by comparison. With a sigh, she concentrated on the candle as a whole and watched as the wax melted onto her palms. She realised that it should've been burning her, but she felt nothing besides a slight tingle.

She quickly wiped the melted wax from her hand and pulled herself to her feet. If she was going to get better at controlling her katon, then the training would have to be a little more intense. She took her time, making her way towards the waters edge where she could safely fire off her techniques without causing damage to the surroundings. She longed for the day where her Katon became powerful enough to evaporate any form of water it touched, but for now; the water made a good training tool.

Now facing the water, she put her hands together in the tiger seal and took in a deep breath. With both hands brought to her mouth, she breathed out; releasing a stream of solid flame that punched into the water. She did notice a rise of steam before the water was promtly put out, which just went to show how this was easily her most powerful Katon technique. It was certainly one she needed to practice, once mastered it would be especially useful to combine with the Doton dragon bullet.

It wasn't quite enough for her to be satisfied yet, so she summoned four of her clones and had them stand at the waters edge. Each preparing handseals while one merely pulled its arms back with sparks forming it its palms. Then in quick succession, all fired off multiple Katon techniques. One releasing a flamethrower over the water, another spreading flames across the waters surface which quickly went out. Another threw balls of fire that exploded on contact with the water and the last one Fired a great ball of fire.

Lera herself performed a similar feat as before, firing a steady and condensed stream of flame directly at the waters surface. She did note that her fireball seemed to still hold more power, but that wasn't a problem; she just needed to master the fire dragon bullet and it would likely end up being more powerful than the fireball.* - Fri Oct  2 11:27:21 2015

She was looking forward to Jirun and his rabbits reaction to a wolf appearing at her feet. The wolf looked up at Lera for a few minutes, tongue lolling out in a big wolfy grin.

"Master?? Hi master!" the wolf was clearly female and very much still an excitable cub. It suddenly sniffed the air, whirling its gaze onto the great fluffball of a rabbit "Rabbit! Jenna's favourite! Master, you got this for me??"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ran her fingers over the boulder, feeling her chakra running through it. Her latest jutsu was a useful one, she'd been thinking about something like this for a long time and now had finally accomplished it. With her technique at work on the boulder, she wrapped her arms around it and lifted it off the ground. She made it look easy, lighter than a feather while she held it aloft above her head. Yet the trick was a very simple one.

Using the nature of Doton to her advantage, she'd simply lightened the rocks weight. Already she was starting to take advantage of the various applications for this jutsu. It even worked on organic objects, allowing her to lighten her body considerably. So far, she'd been able to levitate herself a few inches off the ground, but she though that with practice; she might be able to take it even further and take to the skies.

She made throwing the boulder look extremely easy, tossing the thing several metres ahead. As soon as it went out of her range, the boulders original weight returned and hit the ground with a crash and a thud. Something like this would be useful for more than just flight, it would be possible to lighten huge objects and simply drop them on her enemies. There would be no need to use so much chakra with combination jutsu.* - Sat Oct  3 07:36:32 2015
